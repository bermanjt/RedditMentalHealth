1,"She told me she had a piss fetish. I was grossed out but hid it, and I like her so I told her i'm fine with it. Especially since I have a fetish also, which I decided to tell her since it was way better than a piss fetish

I told her I had a foot fetish, then she asked ew how, feet are gross, that's disgusting etc. then she said she has to go after like 5 mins. She didn't reply to any of my texts for 2 days then finally replied ""i dont think it's going to work out"". I asked what happened and to just be honest and she said ""i can't be with a guy that likes feet"". We'd only been dating 3 months but still. Is a foot fetish really that bad?",10Jun2017,91

3,So I kinda got throw in to babysitting. I have wanted to babysit for a while but haven't gone through with any classes for health or anything like that.

4,"My daughter was 15, and befriended a 17 year old man. They started dating, they went out for 8 months, and my daughter said she wanted sex. He said he was not ready. She laughed at me. She stripped naked, and was begging sex from him. He said okay, and they had sex. She said, she wanted it, and enjoyed the experience. I told her, he broke the law, and I calling the police trying to press charges against him. The police and detectives were not interested, at first. I kept calling and calling, and screaming at them to bring charges against him. After 5 times, they finally arrested him. He should have said no, even through they dated for almost a year, and was nude begging for it. The judge gave him 10 years in a Wisconsin prison. He was paroled after serving 4 years, and 4 days after he was released, he raped me, telling me this is paypack for sending me to prison, after he raped me, he forced me into the shower to wash off the evidence.

5,"Context: A friend and I are about to have a big talk that will either fix things between us, or end our friendship/ contact with one another.

I have the majority of what I want to say down (I want to salvage it), but I would like help wording/ providing backup for these following points.

&amp;nbsp; 

- hiding the truth and then lying about it to cover it up is betrayal. (how is it bad? - to avoid inconvenience , little annoyances, commitment? - please add)

- withholding the truth is just as bad as lying. (why, how so? what does it do to trust?)

- little lies turn into greater lies, so trusting a person with ""big"" claims is difficult. (why lie in the first place?)

- actions speak louder than words (just like silence can be louder than words), so expecting one to trust someone's words is hard when their actions say different (anyone have anything to add?)

- it is better to tear down a friendship held together by lies and rebuild it a new (this is the center point for saving our friendship - it's all I got, and the belief I hold on to the tightest. (help me reinforce it with steal/diamonds/ the hardest best material possible.

&amp;nbsp; 

For those of you willing to help, this means a great deal to me. You're welcome to support those points, or attack them - I must be prepared to take it from both sides. You're also welcome to pose your own questions, but please put some effort to answer the points. It means a great deal to me. Please help. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

Basically the store I work in has a small payroll so employees often have to work shifts on their on.

He was about 40 and I am a young looking 27 year old. I felt uncomfortable when I saw them even before he grabbed my hand as they looked dodgy and also you cannot see past a big structure at the front of the store to the back where we where.

23,I'm usually a chaotic ball of energy and I have a solid amount of people I'd consider friends but today when I'm really low it seems like I'm mostly being ignored. My little sister had another round of chemo so I spent all day at the hospital and it crippled me as per usual to see her like that. After leaving her and my mom for the night I dug into my contacts looking to take my mind off it and text some of my friends. Admittedly I wasn't my usual self and the conversations drifted off relatively quickly leaving me to hit up a fwb just for the human interaction. As I'm waiting on her to show up I had this overwhelming sense of dread that makes me feel like nobody that I normally consider close to me actually is because they aren't here for me when I need them. Is this a rational thought or I'm just uncharacteristically fragile because of my emotional state? I don't know how to deal with this.,10Jun2017,14

About a week ago I went to meet with this person I had met online off of Craigslist to buy a dirt bike. We had been haggling over prices for some time. He wanted far more for it than I thought it was worth, but I eventually talked him down to what I thought was a reasonable price. I ended up meeting him at night and in a sketchy place (very dumb I know). I talked to him for a bit and once I had made it known that I had money, he pulled a gun on me and demanded my money. I'd never had a gun pointed at me before so I folded almost immediately. I have his phone number, which I can't post on here due to reddit rules. I haven't texted him since the occurrence, and went to police almost immediately, but they told me that it was mostly my fault ( I realize this and I'm tired of people telling me that) and that there wasn't much they could do.

I have all of these goals, but my brain can't focus on them because it want to focus on negatives.

I have been told (by my brother, he's an interesting guy) that this is something called loss aversion. We focus on negatives because in the old days, you'd die if you had a loss, but a win just meant you got to live another day. But I feel like I'd be happier if I focused on what I wanted to achieve, what I would be doing with my life if I could live any life, much more.

37,"During February, my dad, my girlfriend and I all moved down to Tampa and since I was underage then, my dad has full access to the money my mom left me and my bets are on he's been using a bit of it on cigs, alcohol, etc while he was unemployed after being fired, for the record, he was unemployed for a month and a half.

Her and I need to get back up to Maine, need my money and need to somehow bring my dogs with.

First off, I'm not sure if he'll be easily willing to give over my money since he's been relying on it for a bit, his excuse is that he's afraid I'll blow it all as he was blowing mine. I know the bank where it's stored, just not sure how to go about getting it back, it's a joint account with myself and him.

Second of all, my older dog was given to me by him and my second is mine and hers, all said by him yet he's made it clear, especially for the older one that ""I am his and he is mine."". I don't believe there is anything on paper saying that either are mine nor hers so I'm not sure what he will do discovering that I take them.

Third of all, we think we have a plan on how to get back up, we contact her friend that has a license and is well experienced in driving, I transfer money up to my girlfriend's mom (who absolutely hates him for the things he's done and said.) so she can order a rental for the friend to get down here and get us seeing as how his car is in the shop.

**TL;DR**, my dad has full access to all my inherited money, need to get it in my possession, get my dogs who he says are his, yet were given to myself and my girlfriend and we might be able to get back up by getting a rental for her friend to come get us.

39,"Hi. This is my first ever post ever on... anywhere on the internet, really. I was never one to participate on internet stuff, but I have always found reddit to have some interesting stuff, so hopefully you'll have some insight. Sorry about my writing, english is not my first language.

I am a 21 guy with very low self esteem. People generally seem to like me, though. All my life I have tried to be kind and help others, and I might even be copedendant, I'm not sure. I have this feeling that I MUST help people with problems, otherwise I am a selfish, evil person. That feeling has led to me making some pretty self-destructive things in my life, by putting other people's live's above my own. But it has also made it so people generally look up to me, which sometimes feels nice (when I am not feeling suffocated by trying to live up to the high expectations that I feel I gave everyone).

My specific problem today is that last year I met this 15 year old boy, with whom I talked only twice. He watched a presentation I did on college that got me some awards. He wants to follow the same career path that I am currently in, so that made him really look up to me, and he even told me I am a source of inspiration for him. 
Thing is, today I found out that he has depression. He has been seeing a therapist for 1.5 years apparently, but he is at such a low point that he has not gone to school for 3 months.

Because I know he has a problem I feel that I am morally obligated to do something about it. I only talked to him twice in my life, and I dont even like him. I think he's annoying and inconvenient and it really bothers me how he puts me in a pedestal (Sometimes I wonder if the reason why I find him so annoying is because I think he is a bit like me). Am I obligated to do something? Do I have to ""save"" him?

I just feel so tired, and angry and I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing. I mean, I just finished college, and I'm trying to start a company right now and trying to figure out my life and who I am. 

Is it selfish if I don't do anything about him? And what could I possibly do? I know that depression is a disease, not just a sad feeling, so what could I do to help him? I don't know, I'm not a psychologist. Is it just arrogant to assume that there is something I could do that would save him? 

Is it evil if I know that someone has a problem and I don't help them? I've met lots of weird, troubled, even mean people, and everytime I've tried my best to ""fix"" them, but now I'm just tired. But what kind of stupid excuse is that?
But what if this boy that looks up to me commits suicide because I didn't do anything? What if he grows up to be a sad, troubled man because I didn't talk to him enough? How do I live with that? And what do I do about the next person I meet that has issues? Should I just shrug like it's not my problem and just let them suffer alone? Isn't that wrong? Where are the lines that divide  ""being generally a good person that tries to help but knows his own limits"", ""being a codependent loser that feels obligated to help others at he cost of his own well being"" and ""selfish monster that ignores other people's suffering""? 

Basically, what I'm asking is: Am I a bad person?",10Jun2017,7
40,"I met my boyfriend online and since then I haven't talked to many guys online. But I ran into a guy on a poetry site I frequent that is a great writer and is hilarious. We'd been messaging back and forth every few hours all week. I'm reading his manuscript. He is just an awesome guy to talk to, great sense of humor. I kinda felt like he was maybe getting feelings for me though when he started complimenting my smile and that sort of thing. I hadn't mentioned my boyfriend yet cause nothing related to him had come up. We had just generally been talking about writing and life.

43,"I feel like I've failed kids in dangerous situations twice within the last week, so I really need help here. I work in a state campground. Situation 1 involved a child approaching me and telling me he was scared for the girl he saw at the site across from him. He proceeded to show me a video of what appeared to be a ~8 yr old girl drinking a beer while her mom took a picture. I had the kid show the video to the ranger on video, but it was almost shift change and he was busy, so he did nothing. The next ranger came in and I pleaded for help, but he didn't see the video and said it probably wasn't what it looked like. He said he didn't want to make anything worse by intervening, and also did nothing. I felt sick, because from what I saw in the video was incredibly disturbing.

Situation 2 involved a woman who came up to me sobbing, saying she heard the man at the site next to her screaming profanity at children and yelling about how badly he was going to beat them, followed by a young girl's screams. I had heard yelling from nearly a half mile away myself. The state police were called, and one of the girls told the police about being beaten. Her dad slapped her face hard enough to knock her out of the chair, but the dad said it was because she was misbehaving. The police decided to do nothing because supposedly he was ""parenting"" them and it was just discipline. The next morning one of my coworkers said she saw the girl with bruises on her face. He was drunk and yelling profanity at them by the next day, but was then just evicted from the campground. Again, nothing was done to help the girls.

I feel so guilty for not doing more to help these kids. But I don't know what to do. I don't know what I can do for them. If any survivors of abuse read this, what did you wish that bystanders told you? What do you wish they did for you? How can I help other children in the future?",10Jun2017,1

50,"I am 22 and female. This is my third summer working at a family owned architecture/construction firm. I have one more year of college. I attend University out of my home state, but have always chosen to come back home during the summers because my family would like to see me. I was able to secure a paid internship as an architectural intern 3 years ago, and have been returning back since. However, for my third summer I was not wanting to come back. I tried to get other internships, however was not successful. Either they couldn't find it in the budget (I live in a very small town) or our the closet city 1.5+ hr a way was unrealistic to drive to. So, I ended up coming back to my current internship. They would not give me a raise. I started the first week back in May, and the new hiring manager would not even sit down to talk to me about it, saying I would have to wait for the Vice-president to come back in 4 weeks. Now the Vice-president​ will be in the office on Monday. I'm not sure if I should still try to ask for a raise, but I think I should have gotten a raise after three years and have more responsibilities than a traditional intern would have. I effectively do the work many Architects would do, drafting construction drawings and having three weekly meetings with clients for multi-million dollar projects a week. Even though the construction and Architecture field isnt the best job market, it is ridiculous I am only paid $12 an hour. 

But my issues go beyond this. My company is very unique in that it is very religious. We have a 15 minute prayer and scripture reading at our all team meetings each week. Legally, they have to say this isn't mandatory. But it would be awkward if I was the only one not going out of a 30+ office. I have accepted this, but still cringe when we talk about how God leads our business. 

But what is unique to this summer is how I feel I am being treated by co-workers. I have been referred to now as the ""token girl"" of the Architecture team. My male co-workers are in their 40s and 50s. I was working on a drawing of a design which showed two women in a hotel room together and my boss said ""what are you showing, lesbians?"" My boss also uses unprofessional language around me which he didn't in past summers. All of my colleagues feel strongly about Trump. They have brought it up in conversations with me,  which I ignore. They do make other comments about me being a women, such as picking paint colors and being better for an interior design team (which we don't even have) so I think they think less of me, even though I go to one of the best schools for my major in the country. Which the end of the day- we live in America. They can think whatever they want- I just don't think it feels right in the workplace.

Which brings me to my question: should I tell the vice president (who is a female, but the wife of the owner) what has been going on? I know she will talk to me on Monday, and probably doesn't know I asked the hiring manager for a raise either. I still would like a raise but I don't want to phrase it all like I'm trying to use all the inappropriate comments as a way to get more money. Advice? ",10Jun2017,1

54,"I make videos as a third job (restaurant primary, photography secondary). I like it a lot. I have a degree in film production. I've done some music videos, generalized camerawork/production team type stuff, but the freelance work that pays is general video production work: You pre-produce, you shoot, you edit, you color, you deliver. This is usually for clients who can't pay a lot and when you look at it by the hour, it's usually a pretty bad deal for me. 

Here's what's happening right now:

In December, I moved home with my parents. When I got home, a friend of a friend told me her parents run a non-profit and they want to make a kickstarter sort of loosely related to it (the kickstarter is for the prize money for a contest the non-profit is holding to incentivize inventors to make something that will help them do what they do). I meet with them, they give me a PBS documentary on the subject and an information packet including everything they want mentioned in the script for the kickstarter video (this is the ONLY creative direction besides script edits I will get from the client for the remainder of this story). I get to work.

A couple weeks later, I have written and drafted a script that's been approved by the board of this non-profit, and I start meeting with the friend of a friend, who is supposed to narrate the video. We text a lot back and forth, postponing meetings and editing the script and postponing meetings, each of us being busy with jobs and me having a chronic medial condition. After a few weeks/months of postponing stuff (late April, early May), she drops out, and an outside consultant decides he should narrate/""act in"" the video. We set a date quickly and shoot for 3 hours one morning. Since then I've had the footage, slowly cutting together this guy's narration in that sort of jump-cutty YouTube star-style that's very popular now. I figure with some music and supplemental footage/graphics, as was originally planned, this project is in the bag.

A couple weeks ago, I sent the non-profit head dude (the friend of a friend's dad) an email explaining that, because I was working a lot at the time and had been experiencing complications from my chronic kidney stones, I might have some trouble finishing in a timely manner. He wrote me back saying essentially ""sure you can have a couple more weeks but until you emailed me this I was starting to wonder if you were the right guy for the job."" Fair point. They definitely didn't give me a lot of creative direction, but I should have done this sooner probably. 

**Here is the problem**: In order for this project to be finished it needs a lot of supplemental footage and graphics (the narrator at times read directly from the script, making footage of certain large segments of the video unusable). I have not been able to find any of this much-needed footage in a license-free way or in a way that wouldn't put the non-profit in the position of defending themselves for having used others' footage. As for the graphics, they said I have a budget (including my own pay) of very little and a graphic designer, even to create a few small 15-second graphics, would probably need a $150-200 minimum day-rate. Couple those things together with the fact that even the very best performance I could cut together of the narrator is shoddy at best, and I'm at a loss. I'm literally leaving town in 4 hours to shoot my next project, and I don't know what to do. I reached out to the friend of a friend, but she's busy with her jobs/businesses and can't speak with me until Monday. I don't want to fuck her over or the non-profit her parents run, but this project seems insurmountable. I've had to do this before only once, when I felt totally overwhelmed by the amount of editing that needed to be done on a project (editing is not my strongest suit), and I don't want to do it again, but I'm starting to get distressed that I'll burn a bridge or really put someone out or hurt their feelings by doing this. 

What advice can you give me? I'm leaning towards just taking the loss of favor/loss of face and trying to be better with my next projects. It just hurts that I've failed this badly. It's not the client's fault, but I really don't think it's my fault either. ",10Jun2017,7
55,"So me and these two girls have been friends for about 10 years. But I've recently realized through making other friends that they are very toxic. They are always negative, try to guilt trip me into doing things for them, and get a sense of power from constantly putting me down. Knowing them has taken a huge toll on my self esteem and happiness. I started dreading seeing them, and always felt unhappy after we hung out. Recently I've been trying to drift away, and they've been getting increasingly angry at my distancing. I want to cut them off, but it's been so long I feel trapped. I still care about them, it's been a decade of friendship, but I can't stand how unhappy they make me anymore. 
Also keeping in mind that we are part of a collective friend group, and even if I do cut them off I will still see them often at hangouts or at school. I don't want them to try to get the rest of the friends I truly care about to turn on me, and I also don't want to create tension in our group, but being friends with them has been really getting to me.

59,"I have a temporary contract teaching job in China. The university I work at provides me with housing at no cost. I've lived in this apartment since September and I'll be leaving for summer holiday in July, then returning again in late August.

When I moved in in September, the apartment had no windows open and the A/C unit was turned off. The apartment was super humid inside, like a sauna, and smelled of kind of like a river. The smell was especially apparent in the cabinets, which are made of some sort of wood material.

As I've lived here, I've noticed that my apartment is quite humid. I don't know why, because I'm in North Central China, which isn't very humid. Anyway, I'm guessing that the apartment isn't sealed well or something. I've seen mold on my cloth sun hat and on my cloth suitcases. I even saw some mold spots on a pair of jeans. It's possible that my jeans hadn't completely dried when I put them away, but Idk about my suitcases because they never got wet.

So...because I'll be moving out in less than a month and returning to this apartment in late August, I'd like to try my best to kill mold now and prevent it from coming back. My apartment doesn't smell strongly of mold like it did when I moved in (I keep the A/C unit on all the time), but I'm still worried that I'll return to a problem. Any tips?",10Jun2017,3

65,"I'm a 17 year old male and I'm struggling with my socialization skills.

Seeing people talk all around me, hold effortless conversations and perfectly flow from topic to topic without worry makes me question my own abilities. I wonder when things began to change, when I could no longer talk without worrying that I'll be awkward or fumble over my words.

I think part of my lack of conversational development stems from my childhood. As a kid, I grew up with two older sisters who were always off with their friends/boyfriend. Early on, I made a friend in my neighborhood but after he physically bullied me, I never hung out with him again. I believe this also is a stem for me never hanging out with friends outside of school. I never hung out with my friends until 6th grade for a birthday party. Even now, I don't go outside with friends. I have one amazing friend who's I talk to all the time and has changed my life for the better but she's the only person I'm actually close to. I had a friend group leading up to now but honestly, they're toxic and I feel like I'm often left out of what they do and talk about. I've distanced myself as far as possible from them and I've grown happier as a result. However, that leaves me with only my really close friend and a couple other friends I've made because of her. With her, I'm able to really open up and talk but outside of that, I feel like a part of me is missing, something that everyone else has.

I see all the connections, history, and relationships people have and quite frankly, I'm worried about myself. I lack the necessary abilities to connect with people quickly and easily. I think another part of it is I want to live out of everyone's way, to make things more convenient for them. That goes to the extreme end, going so far as to where I simply just don't bring up conversation even if I really, really do want to. However, even if I want to, nothing simply comes to mind.

I want to be able to have a small group of friends, no bullsh*t, no worry, nothing. I want to be able to text someone and ask to hang out and feel totally fine about that situation. I'm worried that I won't be able to connect with someone relationship-wise, be able to settle down, marry, and have kids unless my significant other is able to understand why I'm reserved and basically be the extrovert.

I don't think it's necessarily a confidence issue. It's more ""I lack the skills and the resources to build up those skills."" 

I've also thought about how sick I am of high school. I'm a good student, with about a B+ to A- average. But I've felt like I've needed a fresh start for a little while now but honestly I don't know if that's what I need. I don't know if I can get anywhere with a fresh start. What if I can't get to know... anybody? I'm just... worried. I plan on heading off to Seattle for college, my idea of a ""fresh start.""",10Jun2017,2

71,"I was at my local wawa with my girlfriend buying cigs real quick. It's about 8:30-9pm, 80 degrees or just under. It had just gotten dark outside. 

I get out of the car and start walking in. To my right I see a very tall person walking in. They were wearing a hat, sunglasses, and had a scarf hiding their face. They were wearing a large jacket and a lot of clothes; so much that I couldn't tell if they were a man or woman. 

This person walks in, goes straight to the soda machine, grabs two large cups and fills them with ice. Then they loop around the back of the store and skip the counter just in time for me to hold the door for them on their way out. 

They proceed to their car which is parked behind the building. This wawa is connected to other stores, so there are only dumpsters and back entrances behind the building. There aren't any parking spots behind the building, and plenty of free spots right in front of Thebes's entrance. His windows were all tinted, car was an older coupe.

Was this a robbery? I lost sight of the person as they looped around the back so I don't know if they stopped in one of isles. All I saw them walk out with was two large cups of ice. 

It's one of the stranger things I've seen in my life. I've asked quite a few people and no one really knows what to make of it.

81,"TLDR: Grandpa died, now gradma wants to kill herself, and she has no way to make her life meaningful (and she's also starting to hate my family).

My grandmother is now 80 years old and is still quite healthy.However she is illiterate and cannot drive a car, quite forgetful, and has a hard time speaking english as it is her second language. 

My grandfather was a very nice man who drove my grandmother everywhere, and did all the basic functions of living for her. She just cooked and cleaned for the household as she did not know how to do much else. 

Recently he had passed away leaving my grandmother all to herself. My family and I have tried to get her to move in with us or to move into a retirement home, but she refused to do both and threatens to disown us if we mention it. 

Her only 'friends' are foreigners who accept gifts from my grandmother and then leave, as if you spend too much time with her she begins to get angry at you.

She cannot work a job or volunteer, to acquire some sort of meaningful life, as she cannot speak english very well (you have to know her for a few months before you can understand what she is saying), she cannot read or write, cant drive, cant use computers or mobilephones, and often needs to go to the toilet every hour due to a bowl problem. 

Recently she has been telling me she wants to kill herself, and today she went back to the pokies machines (slot machines) to start gambling again - she had a huge gambling problems maybe 10 years ago.

I dont know what to do, or how to help her without giving up my job/personal life. And even when i do try to help her she tells me she doesnt like me, as any minor incident (or one she thinks happened) will get her angry at you.

We've discussed getting a personal nurse for her, but she doesnt like the idea, and it is quite out of our budget to be honest.

89,"Hello /r/Advice, I'm here because I honestly don't know what to do. My friend of four years (high school), let's call him Barry, has recently decided to cut ties with myself as well as my girlfriend, Sarah, and other friend, Diego. This is all due to his crazy girlfriend, Samantha, who doesn't approve of us. 

It all started about two years ago when I was a part of a larger group of friends that spent a lot of time together. Now, this was high school so we would eat lunch together and hang out after school all the time. However, a small portion of us (myself, Barry, Sarah, and Diego) decided that we wanted to try experimenting with alcohol and weed. Now, not everyone in the group enjoyed this or thought it was a good idea, so we thought ""hey, let's just do it ourselves."" This led to us hanging out alone more often than with the rest of the group, which we tacked up to personal differences and the natural process of friends growing apart.

Fast forward to this year, and Barry has started a relationship with Samantha, who I've never been personally fond of but hey, who am I to tell him who to date? 

A few weeks ago, we all graduated together, and all seemed to be well. Naturally, as all friends do, we four (besides Barry) had grown apart from the rest of the group, especially Samantha. They had been hanging out without us for a long time, and we had continued to do the same. 

One evening, my girlfriend's cousin (24) had a party and invited myself, Barry, and Diego because we all knew her relatively well. She, having been five years older than us, had no idea who the other kids that used to hang out with us were, and therefore didn't invite them. At this party, Barry told us that ""he was supposed to be in bed right now."" Apparently he had lied and told Samantha that he was sleeping, but didn't tell us before there were already pictures of the event all over social media. 

Over the next couple of days we tried making plans to go to an amusement park but he kept saying he was on ""probation."" We were confused and my girlfriend talked to him about it. Apparently, his girlfriend had put him on PROBATION from hanging out with us. This was because she and her friend felt excluded from us, because they weren't invited to my girlfriend's COUSIN'S party. She said that they had all been feeling it for a while because we had had exclusive ""parties"" (really just hanging out) without all of them. What we thought was just us growing apart they had decided was us being exclusionary and saw it as a personal attack. Naturally, we tried to talk to Barry and have an intervention.

However, tonight, he sent a text to our groupchat saying that he couldn't hang out with us because he wants tensions to die down. I just can't believe that one of my best friends could just drop everything for this girl that's so obviously manipulating him. They even agreed that they would break up at the end of the summer because of the difficulties of long distance relationships (different colleges), so I don't understand how he can drop us for two months of crazy girl. He won't listen to reason, and he stopped responding to our texts. Needless to say, the three of us are very sad about this situation and we just want to have our friend back before we have to go to college. I'm here because we have no idea what to do anymore, and if there's anybody out there who's been in a similar situation we could definitely use some advice. Thank you.",10Jun2017,1

I also asked her maybe what to do to get closer to her. So she told me to just introduce myself to her on Instagram direct message, which I did.

I'm just worried that if she responds and we communicate with each other I'll just mess up all my chances with her.

97,"Hello. I just turned 22, making 55k / year and finally getting my student loan debt down. Started scouting around for houses and what to expect a few months ago. Finally starting to look more seriously now that I have a down payment ready, and will probably be getting FHA pre-approved in the next couple of months.

Anyway. I'm so tired of living most of my existence in my bedroom at home, and I'm so ready to have a place of my own where I can branch out and just be myself more comfortably. Along with setting up my own office for work, being able to pursue my interests more freely, be in a real relationship, etc.

My mother raised me almost entirely alone. My father passed when I was very young and my mother has busted her ass for the past 10+ years working with elderly people and cleaning houses to pay the bills. Since I got a good job about 3 years ago I've done all I can, if not more, to help her out and pay her back. But now it's time for me to move on.

Every time I even bring up the notion of moving out she gets emotional and can't handle the conversation. I've mentioned it several times over the past few months and every time it's ""I can't do this right now"", or ""whatever, just do what you want"". She's even asked me repeatedly why on earth I would want to move out and be on my own, and tries to discourage me by almost vengefully asking me if I know what I'm getting into, if I'm aware of how much it costs to furnish a house and live on my own, etc. 

I'm fully prepared for those expenses and I'm aware of what I'm getting into. She can't seem to comprehend that I'm prepared, and that I'm an adult. I know she feels like she's losing me by my moving out, but I've done all I can to make it clear that just because I'm moving out, likely to another part of town not 20 minutes away, that I'll still very much be a part of her life. 

I've even tried to include her in the process. She loves decorating and interior design, and I've asked her so many times what she would recommend for so and so house that I'm looking at, if she'd like to help me pick out furniture and decor, etc. She'll get interested for a bit and then lock up again and push the conversation away. 

I've made it clear that this is happening with or without her. I would very much like her to be involved or at least informed as I go through the process, so that when it happens it isn't a total shock to her.

I can't think of what else to do to help her come to terms with this. Anyone have any advice that may be able to help me out? Anything at all is greatly appreciated!",10Jun2017,6
98,"Oh boy, I don't even know where to start. I'm a 19 year old male, currently a college student. In the past couple days, I've just felt lost, I feel empty and almost depressed but without suicidal tendencies and any sadness. I don't know how to explain this feeling. The reason for this spans from a multitude of sources. First, love. I've never been able to love, and I feel the cause for this is because my first true love chose a friend over me the same night that I asked her out. This. Was. Devastating. Second, friendship. I've never really had true friends. This may be related to how I act and think. I feel like I'm a robot. If I'm given a task, I'll do it and do it to the best of my ability, and I'll put all my energy into it. There is no half assing whenever I do anything, no matter how mundane (such as washing the dishes). Third, motivation. This has been something I've always struggled with. I am always lacking motivation. I'll do what I have to, nothing more, nothing less. I've noticed this the most by how I go to the gym. I will go super motivated for 2-3 days and then just stop abruptly for months. I'm a fit guy, but the reason that I've deducted for doing this is because I really do not care about my body image. Fourth, sexuality. This one goes hand in hand with love. I don't know what I like anymore. I feel like anyone can be beautiful. Not much else I can say here. Fifth, cancer. This one is HARD. My dad was just diagnosed with Stage D Prostate Cancer (PSA 22, Gleason 7). This one is extremely rough for me because I've already lost a cousin to cancer a few years back. I've been trying to keep my head up, and supporting my dad to the fullest by helping him with whatever I need and going to all of his appointments. I know this disease, in particular, is not necessarily deadly, but it still hurts to see someone I love with it. All in all, I feel like these are the 5 main things that are turning me into a black hole. I'm empty, I'm lost, I don't feel any emotion. Another issue I've been having lately is that I keep zoning out, thinking about nothing. This can be a real issue because I've noticed this while driving also, and I've ran red lights and stop signs due to this.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I need help, but I don't know who to ask, how to ask someone, and on and on. Thanks for reading this, and I hope things get better.

Feel free to ask me to elaborate on anything if you need me to, I tried to be prompt so I can get everything out. If anything does get too personal for me, I may PM you.

She found a cigarette lighter in the bathroom (neither one smokes and nobody else has been in their house). He also keeps scratching his face and arms. When he eats he is always dropping the food utensil because he shakes so bad. They haven't had sex in 4 months and he pretty much ignores her.

What should my friend do about her boyfriend?

105,"Yo r/Advice I've literally never thrown a party before and was wondering if renting one of those lookout towers (totally possible, I checked) would be a good idea? The tower is kind of small but there's also a campsite below where we could have like a fire and everything, and the view is amazing.

the contract states that no pets are allowed unless agreed with the landlord, we knew this coming into the flat but it's a great place at a good price and so we jumped at it.

this is something that certainly won't be an immediate thing - it may even be a year down the line - but i know that we both really want a pupper in the future. i just wondered if anybody had any experience/tips to 'sweeten' the request and hopefully make it possible !

This doesn't seem long but I knew after a week he was my soulmate. We started dating after a week and was engaged a few months later. When we get married soon we will have been together for a year and 4 months.

So my fiancé is super baby crazy! He loves kids, kids love him and he wants one so badly. I love kids also and am perfectly fine with having children. However, I am still in school and am one semester away from graduating. 

So, if I were to get pregnant now or soon I would still finish school but I couldn't really get my big person job because I'd be due soon. 

We are financially stable and sound and have all the means and support to have a baby no problem but I'm just a little scared/nervous/anxious about if the timing is right.

Any thoughts? ",10Jun2017,2
115,"Hi all, I was hoping to get some advice on how to resolve this situation... 

My sister is 22 and has been pursuing her undergraduate degree since she was 18 (currently in her Jr. year).  She lives at home and has never worked a day in her life besides occasional babysitting... no internships, no menial high school jobs, nothing.  She lives with my parents who enable this behavior and don't really push her to do much of anything, including getting a job.  To her credit, while in high school she was involved in multiple after-school activities, but since graduating she has basically been taking the minimum credits to stay in her program and then sitting on the couch and watching TV the rest of the time.  She doesn't have any disabilities besides the lack of drive to accomplish her goals and doesn't see the value in working because she has no financial pressure or drive to do so.  Despite explaining that developing a lot of the necessary ""soft skills"" starts with working low level jobs in retails/food&amp;bev/etc, she couldn't care less.  

My parents are on the older side and are not in the best of health, yet both work their tails off to support themselves and my sister.  For me, this only makes the situation more upsetting and the resentment for my sister is only compounded because of this.

After a couple years of trying to help resolve this to no avail, I've basically taken the stance of removing myself from the situation all together, as my words have fallen on deaf ears.  Have any of you been in a situation like this and how did you approach it?

Many Thanks.",10Jun2017,2

125,"Okay. So my entire life I've been super wanting to go to this giant state university, and I'm currently signed up for the fall semester (graduated from high school in the spring). However yesterday, my parents took me for a college tour of their alma mater, a small, private college the same distance from my hometown. It's important to note here that I'm going into Botany (I've been teaching myself for 3 years now) and am super into research (A big goal I have is to be able to start a project ASAP, I couldn't do the advanced experiments I wanted to in high school because we didn't have the equipment). Both cost about the same, and both have around the same amount of Botany courses.

Big school pros:
-All my friends are going there
-exciting, giant town
-Botany department-ish thingy with people with Botany degrees
-Large herbarium
-Large greenhouse complex
-Has reputation for Agriculture/Horticulture 
-WISE living community
-big library
-has my dream study abroad program

Big school cons:
-would have to struggle to get access to research stuff and professors
-would most likely do most work with a Grad student, not a professor, if they let me do research that early at all
-big class sizes
-a ton of required courses
-No one from the Botany department has ever answered my emails and I've never met any of them in person

Small school pros:
-Got to speak to the actual professor who actually teaches botany 
-They're doing a research study on a highly dangerous invasive weed in our state and it kinda sounded like the guy would be willing to let me on it after hearing about my research interests
-They have an awesome ""make it work"" policy when it comes to research and interests that passionate students have/getting access to equipment and stuff that students don't have access to there
-all buildings are air conditioned 
-they pair up roommates based on interests
-small class sizes
-awesome tutor program
-parents graduated from there
-everything is pretty easily accessible on campus
-heard that it's pretty quiet on the weekends (I'm an introvert)
-liberal arts school, so more well-rounded in all
-people that go there actually want to go and don't just want to get a degree
-study abroad program to the city where one of the few people in the world who studies the plant protein Im interested in lives/works, might be able to set something up

Small school cons:
-they have a greenhouse but it's small and only used for individual research projects
-no one I know is going there 
-no professors with a botany degree
-smaller library 
-less equipment 
-small town

I really don't know, but I have to choose fast; I'm kind of leaning towards the small school, but I'm not sure and don't want to opt out too fast. Thoughts and reflections?

128,"M: 34, F: 32 Been together over a year. 

My boyfriend has a platonic friend who's a girl. She kinda has her own bedroom in his house. As in she has a bed in there to crash at.

 I was talking to my boyfriend about if I were to move in, how I want to feel that although the house is his, it would be OUR home. And I asked about making one of the two bedrooms he never uses my own space. His friend has the better room because well it's better. He basically said I could have a room but not his friend's (who doesn't live there. And is a girl. I get it's platonic but still). Or if I did use that room to keep the giant bed in it for her. 

I've been pretty furious about this ever since. I feel like he cares more about his friend not being upset about losing her room than he cares about me. It's not even about the room for me. I feel he picked her over me and really makes me feel like his house would NOT be my house too if I moved in. And I'm getting kinda upset that I'm supposed to keep being okay with his friend having her own room in the house even after I'd move in.

131,"Okay so to give a little background information I am 16 and currently go to school I am planning to go to sixth form next year for 2 years until I'm 18 and can work go uni. My mum has mental health issues and because of this I moved to my dads house however then she quit her job and expected my dad to work and keep her at his house... which he did for a while but then some things happened and because she came aswell to his house ( keep in mind it's a studio flat ) the landlord kicked me and my mum out for causing trouble at the house. She hasn't had a job in about 2 years now. She lives off my child benefit and the money my dad gives her to pay for rent. However she is not going to work, she doesn't even want to go to work. Which puts me at a difficult situation as I want to go to school and not be homeless. Which I was for about a week when I got kicked out of the house. I told my mum countless times that she needs to find a job I even pointed her towards ppl I know who need workers she still refused and wants to carry on with her life sleeping. Im sort of afraid she will grow roots haha. So due to her mental health issues anything I say to her is pointless it just bounces off and she goes on shouting about random things. Like she often says that someoen steals things from her or that my dads sister or my cousins have cars because they stole her money... Ofcourse this is because they work and don't sleep all day haha.  Talking to her is useless no matter how many times i try ( this has been going on for 2 years) I have told social services taht im afraid i will become homeless soon ( it's inevitable as shes not working ) but they cannot help me unless they can come to my house and see the situation and talk to my mum. But ofcourse she will not let anyone in and also I live with ppl who told us if we want to stay here we cannot give anyone this address and we cannot bring any official people like social workers or etc. to this house ( for private reasons i dont want to mention ) So if I want to get put into care I need to let them into my house but ofcourse I can't so I'm in a cycle. Also she cannot go to work if she wanted to unless she lied abotu where she lived as there is n address. I told her lets move and go live somehwere where we have an actual address and the rent is more affordable but she doesn't understand what I'm saying. And she keeps on saying that it's my fault and that there is nothing look what you've done. I would leave school and just work. I want to start a business I already have something huge planned however I need to be 18 to have a credit card. I'm basically an adult even I go to work with my cousin and my dad ( construction ) to help out and pay for rent however ofcourse I should be studying for exams not making money right now. she doesn't even cook or clean which leaves me to do that. She is literally a potato . Any advice you have for me? What should I do?

132,"Hi, I'm not sure what sub I should be in so I went with this one. Feel free to redirect me!

Throwaway because my SO is aware of my regular username. Alright, my boyfriend and I have been living together for about 3 years, been together for 4. It was never a secret he struggles with depression even though he rarely actually talks about it, but then again he rarely talks about anything (I think I've gotten a feel for when to nag him to make him talk when he needs to and leaving it alone until he seeks me out).

Anyway, on to what prompted me to write this. He's visiting his mom right now, which he hates (she's a very difficult and abusive woman). Right before he left he told me not to get mad (I didn't) but he had read through my reddit posts and found something I had written about his mother, he appreciated it and I think he was touched.

He himself was always more of a lurker so I never had a reason to go through his posts, but since he brought it up and I'm bored here I decided to see if he had posted anything. That's where I found out he's been hanging around on several subreddits dedicated to the topic of suicide.

One comment stood out to me. He explained his depression, how he isn't feeling lonely but rather feeling stuck. He said he hasn't committed suicide, because he's afraid of hurting people, mostly me. He said I was caring, which is definately correct. He expressed that he feels suicide is the only way out, but he won't do it, 'not yet anyway'. (Reasons: not brave enough and afraid of hurting those who care about him, especially me..)

[I'm gonna go on a tiny rant here, feel free to disregard. So, fuck. I remember back in high school when some people thought the topic of suicide and love were romantic. There is NOTHING romantic about knowing somebody you love is in endless pain and knowing they're not ending that pain 'for you'. I'm not explaining that right, I don't want him to end his life to be done with it, but I don't want him to be in pain. I can't remember where I saw this comic online when I was like 14, about saving someone from suicide by living for the other person, but it's not romantic. That's not a love story, it's a tragic story and it's painful any way you cut it.]

So that comment is from about a year ago. Around that time, I knew he wasn't doing well. He didn't talk to me about it much, but I made him talk about it a couple of times then. Which he said he appreciated, and he's gone to therapy since then. He had already been to therapy before, had gotten the diagnosis for generalised anxiety disorder and after the sessions ended he wasn't feeling any better. So I helped him get back into therapy, not for a set amount of sessions this time, but actually 'permanently' for as long as he needs. He's still going, and he's asked me to come with him next time which I agreed to, of course.

The thing is though, I know he's in pain everyday regardless. I'm afraid you're going to tell me that he will have to do this himself but I still want to ask advice. From his comments I can tell it does help to feel cared for, and I care about him very much. So, what can I do to make it better, to make his life worth it?

Having typed this out it feels kinda silly to ask. I think I'm doing my part, having guided him asking for help and getting into therapy and stuff. I'm not very good at being somebody's rock but I'm willing to try anyway. If there's anything I'm just plain forgetting I should be doing, let me know. I'm worried that although he's managing alright at the moment, in the future he might slip and attempt suicide. I really want to make it better, any words of advice here?",10Jun2017,3

I'm not the biggest fan of man's best friend. I understand that other people like them and I'm okay in open spaces as long as I'm not jumped on or licked. I generally try to keep quiet about this as to not look like an asshole. I know a lot of people love dogs as a whole and often take it as a personal insult that I don't. 

I've had a few bad experiences with the animals that kind of lead to this. When I was a kid, a family friend that I had to visit often had a large, ill-trained dog that often jumped on me and knocked me over a few times, which I'm pretty sure is why I tend to be anxious around larger dogs, and once witnessed my father, a pretty strong man (and a dog lover!) be attacked by a dog who got in a few nasty bites. I'm also not a big fan of muddy paws or poop-covered fur being on me, but that pales in comparison to the other two experiences. 

Anyways, a lot of my friends are animal lovers. I usually just hold my tongue- why infringe on them being happy?- but it's become an issue lately because if I try to organize a trip or an event, it's ""can my dog come?"". I usually just explain that I'm not comfortable driving if animals are in the car so that I don't look like a monster... which leads to someone else driving. And now I need to either cancel the plans I was really excited about or deal with being stuck in the backseat with the dog for the duration of the drive, which makes me really uncomfortable. I also don't really know how to explain when I go to friends' houses that I'm not a huge fan of being jumped on/sat on/licked... when I've said it in the past I just get made fun of and not taken seriously. How do I deal with situations like these?

151,"I'm 18, I've just finished my first year at university. The uni is in a quiet location at a campus, meaning that the nightlife is pretty terrible. All of the many people I have met at the university are very strange, they either never come out of their rooms and socialise or are just strange in some way, it's quite hard to explain. Everyone is boring and unsociable but this may just be the people in my halls. For example they have called security on me just for chatting to a friend in the kitchen and they constantly complain in the flat group chat about literally one dish that I have left to clean at a later time which is not a big deal. 

I'm studying geography but I've come to realise that I probably don't want a career in geography plus everyone on my course is immature and I don't really like a lot of them. Also I picked the university since my two best friends went here and we all agree that everyone is unsociable. So I've picked the wrong university for starters and I don't want to start again at a different one. 

I have an opportunity to quit and begin my real life working for my fathers company where I could work myself up and make a lot of money possibly. Also I wished I did business instead of geography so this may be a good path for me.

156,"First off, both my friend and I are in Alberta, Canada and 19 years old, Male, university students. 

I came to visit my friend for the weekend, everything was normal and cool. But then he starts talking about starting this thing to make extra money on the side. Turns out he's got a shot as an insurance broker. I'm confused, but he's come up with way crazier random ideas so I humour him. Turns our through a guy at work he's lined this gig up, at this international firm called World Financial Group. I go okay cool, sounds legit, whatever. I start doing a little research as I've got a hunch, and it's right. Massive red flags, it's definitely a MLM/Pyramid Scheme kinda place. 

My friend is a really good guy, Smart too. He's going into his second year of Aerospace engineering. He's even got a few thousand saved away, which is pretty rare for a student. He's on a good path, even has great goals of running his own business (Nothing MLM/Insurance, he wants to start up something in the aerospace or automotive industry). 

I really dont want him getting involved in this obvious scam. I've done some research and the company basically keeps running by using and disposing ""new recruits"" like they all do. He doesn't deserve to get burned, but I don't think he sees it for what it is. He says there's about $400 in insurance broker course fees, to legally sell insurance. That sounds somewhat legit to me, I don't think they've hit him with the $100-$200 background check fee and ""forcing"" him to buy plans to keep the system churning, so there's a chance he sees what's going on, but I doubt it. He's only been to one meeting, so there's still hope.

I realize in a situation like this you can't just say, ""Dude, it's a fucking pyramid scheme you idiot,"" as that'll just alienate yourself from them and you can no longer do much to help. 

I need him to figure out for himself that it's a pyramid scheme. But these companies are specifically designed to not come across as such, and promise riches. What have you guys done that worked?

She said she also didn't trust herself not to cheat on me whenever she left for college. (I still have a year of high school left.) She said she wanted to continue being best friends since apparently I've made such a large impact on her life, and doesn't want to lose contact with me, and lo and behold she avoids me everywhere and has blocked me on 90% of things.

Now, we have all graduated college and have probably been out of college for about two years. One is continuing his education, working, and dating a few people, the other is working, looking to go back to school, and has a girlfriend, and I am currently/technically unemployed, looking to go back to school, and single.

I used to see them every day or once a week (at the very least and this was rarely) back in high school and college, but now, if I see them once a month...That's a lot, but it's more like I see them once every 3 or 4 months. When I call one, he doesn't pick up the phone, but he'll text me. We all still text each other, so more than best friends, its more like we've become text friends or online friends. They still insist we're best friends, but it doesn't feel real to me anymore. I don't feel we're as close as we used to be.

For example, last week, we made plans and an hour before we were supposed to meet, my one friend canceled and then my other friend dropped out. Even though, I had told them how much I miss them and how much I miss hanging out with them and this isn't the first time it has happened. I think 2 out of every 3 plans we make, get canceled.

So my question/what I want to know is, do you think this is people growing in different directions as they move into young adulthood? Or what? Even though we used to be close, is this just naturally growing apart?",10Jun2017,1
163,"To preface this, I understand that this may sound a bit silly. So I'm currently in college and on summer break. Outside of work, hanging out with my SO and videogames, I don't have much to do. I just got a new desk setup and finally have a whole lot of free space on there. Here's where it gets silly, though. I just want something physical to work on. Like maybe model building or something? I don't know. I'm open to any ideas at all. Ideally, not super duper expensive , but all suggestions are welcome.",10Jun2017,5
165,"I already missed the deadline for applying this year.


I was homeschooled and have never made it past a 6th grade math level or been to a public school.


I'm 25 so not as mentally sharp as a 20 year old so it's probably a bit late to be starting school cognitively speaking, I never had the fastest ability to learn to begin with. 


I did try to go to community college two years ago, I dropped out after 2 months due to failing the class. I was only trying to take a summer catch up class for math, needless to say it was a disaster. They wanted me to learn 3 new math concepts a week which was WAY too much. I feel like taking on more than 1 class at a time will be 10 times harder so I feel like and I'll have no chance of keeping up. I just don't learn that quickly and need things explained to me many many times before it starts to stick. I would spend 45 minutes on an equation and never be able to figure it out or understand it (it was high school level). 

I have a job that I currently really like but, it doesn't pay that well and involves scrubbing toilets when the need arises so a career change wouldn't be unwelcome.

166,"Hi! So, I have a child with spina bifida (the spine grows outside the body in utero) and she's turning 6 in August. She's incontinent as a result of the spina bifida and she went to headstart or ECE this past year. The school has been great with changing her diapers and things of that nature. She's getting almost too big for the biggest size diaper though and I work in a nursing home and have looked at the smallest adult diaper and they would be huge on her. Does anyone know where to look for larger diapers for children about 50lbs? I have done some checking but so far have found almost nothing.",10Jun2017,1

168,"(I literally just got a reddit so I could ask for advice, I’m sorry if it is all over the place, I had a hard time collecting my thoughts). 

Backstory: Okay so I’ve been dating my boyfriend “A” for three years and we both still live with our parents since we are in college. His sister “C” and her husband “R” have lived with my boyfriend’s parents the entire time we’ve been dating. Their story begins with C getting pregnant in her final year of college and dropping out (her and R had only been dating 6 months before she got pregnant). My boyfriend’s parents, whom knew nothing of R’s past, told them they should get married. Turns out, R was in a gang which led him to go to prison for 8 years because of armed robberies before he met C. Fast forward one year and R started having some kind of back issues which disabled his ability to work in his field of masonry (brick work). He was able to get disability checks which is good. After already struggling with finances they got pregnant again which ended up with them in my boyfriend’s parent’s house. Now they have three little ones, ages five, three, and eight months. 



*Here’s where shit goes down (aka where I come in and start observing all of this). 
-	All five of them live in one room. Before the youngest was born, they all slept in one bed. Now the oldest and the youngest sleep in their own separate beds. This room is an absolute pig sty. If you were to look in the room you wouldn’t be able to see a clear path to walk, mounds of just stuff covering all the walls, an usher poster on the window for the entire neighborhood to see, and dirty diapers everywhere. The entire room also reeks of feces. 

-	These kids will wear the same outfit for a week straight at least. I would say 40% of the time they aren’t even wearing clothes. Then 45% of the time they are wearing R’s or C’s shirts as an outfit. 

-	Did I mention that they have dog? This poor dog has started to urinate on their stuff because they refuse to let it out. It basically just sits in a cage all day with no one to love on it.

-	R gets hydrocodone prescribed for his back pain but he doesn’t take them himself. He gets the prescription only to sell them to his friends (his friends are all on disability checks because of their felonies). Then to ease his pain he will sit in his car all day, every day, and smoke marijuana. 

-	R has gotten C fired from her job before because he has repeatedly called her asking her to come home to watch the kids because his back hurts too much. Then he will end up going to his friend’s house for the rest of the day.

-	When C was pregnant the third time, I would watch her smoke marijuana every single day. She would come back into the house so high that she would pass out on the couch.

-	C skipped the last couple months of checkups during her third pregnancy. The last she heard from the doctor was that her baby would be born a 6-lb baby but it ended up being a 10+lb baby.

-	After C gets home from work, she and R will strap their kids into their car and just smoke for hours. The driver/passenger seat windows will be rolled down but the kids windows will be rolled up. They smoke while holding their 8 month old.

-	They don’t have any kind of a schedule for their kids. They keep their kids up to 11pm or later every night. They only go to bed earlier if C and R want to go to bed earlier. Its never earlier than 9pm. 

-	They let their kids (aged 5, 3, and 8 months) play mortal combat and other very gruesome video games. They also let them watch rated PG or R movies. The oldest will come up to me and tell me about the zombies or ghosts that were in the movie. 
o	The oldest once came up to me and told me that she had a “woman dream” so of course I asked her what it was. Turns out that it was about the characters from mortal combat smashing her head into a wall. 

-	They pirate movies all the time. The oldest tells me all the time about the movies they watch with their daddy. The movies they talk about are all still in theaters. I don’t know how they are able to do that but its just one more thing that adds to the list. 

-	They do not make proper meals for their kids. For example, I came into their house the other day only to have the middle child (3yo) come up to me and tell me that he had a pizza in his sandwich. It was literally a sandwich with bread, ham, and a mini babybel cheese tossed into it.

-	I have never heard R say anything positive come out of his mouth. He is always screaming at his kids to “shut up.” I have never seen him hug them or cuddle them. When he is in physical contact with them he is either watching shows on his phone, playing video games, or hitting (spanking) them. 

-Both C and R are always high. 

-There are dirty diapers everywhere.

-The first thing they bought when they got their disability check was a 60” TV. 

-	Every single time someone tells them they shouldn’t smoke in front of their kids, they become defense and threaten to move out. my boyfriend’s parents are afraid that if they move out then the kids will be in an even worse situation (my boyfriend’s parents live in an extremely nice neighborhood).

-	Their kids are always stuck inside the house unless my boyfriend and I decide to take them somewhere fun. 

-	Their kids are the absolute worst kids I have ever seen in my entire life. They are extremely loud (screaming constantly), very aggressive, and always a mess. 
o	I wouldn’t blame this on the kids though. It is through the parenting that they have received.

-	When C needed clean urine for an employment drug screening, she made her 5 year old pee in a cup. 

-	They don’t have any kind of child locks on anything. Their floors are an absolute mess and their feet are always black (I have to wear shoes whenever I am there). 


More details:
Her entire family has talked to her about all of this and she becomes super defensive and basically says that she as a parent can do what she wants with her kids. She comes up with the excuse that R can’t take any other medication because smoking marijuana is the only thing that works. They don’t have insurance which makes getting treatment very difficult. I haven’t said anything to her in fears that it will put a rut in the family relationships. My boyfriend’s family is very close and I think they are afraid that they will break up the family if they continue to talk about this matter. My boyfriend’s mom is mental health social worker and she still ignores what is going on. I am in nursing school and seeing this kind of stuff every single day just rubs me raw. I have looked after kids my entire life and I have never seen kids act this absurd. They have obviously been impacted by the parenting they have received. I think they’re afraid of saying anything because they don’t want to break up the family. I think they are also afraid that C and R will get angry and move out into an area which is really unsafe (we live in Kansas metro and they would move to Kansas City which is a bad area). I think they think that it is better for the kids to stay in that situation than to be in Kansas City. I desperately need help in figuring out what to do. I don’t want to ruin my boyfriend’s and my relationship but something needs to happen.",10Jun2017,5
169,"I work in the accounting dept of a corp.  I been with the company for more than 2 years, and I been there the longest within my team.  Generally I have no complaints, our accounting department is fairly small so we are almost like a family.  
Yesterday I received a written warning, mostly because  me taking my vacation was a problem.  I had requested my vacation and got the ok for it, and was told to let everyone else know and make sure the person who will take on my work is ok with it.  In which I sent a text to him letting him know I confirmed with the manager, and I just want to make sure he'll be ok too. To which he replied ok. Another accountant also wanted to take vacation around that time, but she didn't confirm her dates the time I requested my dates.  She confirmed hers and told me what days she'll be out.  I had let her and the manager know that my days were the only days I can take off due to school.  So now it became a problem because it was month end and 2 people weren't suppose to have overlapping days. But this became dawned on me after I took my vacation. Now she's saying I should've reconfirmed with her the dates because she wouldn't have allowed two people to be on vacation that time. 
Added to that the other accountant who was to take over my work supposedly said I didn't ask if he was ok with it.  If that's the case, then there's a big misinterpretation because I had asked in the text if he will ok with it, the manager was fine with it. But I didn't show the text at the time because I didn't want to use it against each other.  I really think this was just an issue because the amount of work the other accountant had to do once I left.  We always requested vacation dates verbally in the past, this time it seems by not having formal documentation it end up used against me probably to cover the managers a@@.    There were also some minor things that i didnt really think would be nessessary as a formal warning, like there was a double entry somewhere. Or some new task I was given should've been handled better.  Granted all this was happening while we have our busiest sales, and there was added work load due to expanding entities. No feedback was given during the process.  In most cases I stay late when I don't have school.   I think probably everyone was stressed by the expanding duties and my manager is desperately trying to pass them down.  My boss is usually fairly satisfied with me and praised my work in the past, so doesn't look like there's anything wrong with my core responsibilities. But doesn't look like it will die down either.  I am worried for the next busy season we have in fall when I'll have even more classes.  
I guess I should possibly look for a way out and get something more suited for cpa as I know there's probably no room for me to grow and stuff.  There is room for me to learn more stuff, and that is my goal.  I just hope I can achieve a desirable result without burning my self out too much.  I haven't sign the written letter yet, but I wonder if I should explain to hr more of my perspective since she was present.

Tl:dr; I got in trouble for taking my vacation because I didn't reconfirm it with the manager supposely. This was for month end so understandable would be challenging.  But I got the ok when I requested it, and I mentioned it was the only dates I can take due to school.  Another accountant had also wanted vacation around that time but didn't have set days.  But when she got her days, mines must have got forgotten or something.  Now it became my fault for not reconfirming ",10Jun2017,2

172,"Let me start with a bit of background information that may help. I am currently renting a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in Ontario. With my landlord's acknowledgement and agreement, I rent out the second bedroom to co-op students. I am the only person on the lease and fully responsible for paying rent in full to my landlord. The students pay me about a third of what I pay the landlord since I'm not trying to make money, I'm just trying subsidize my rent a bit while helping students with affordable rent. 


Now I have this roommate, let's call her Sarah. Sarah has been living with me since mid April, and for the most part is a great girl. This is her first time living outside of home. She's sweet and friendly. She does her dishes. But that's about the limit of cleaning she does. When she had agreed to rent I had made it clear that I like the house clean. Within her first week, I proposed a cleaning schedule that she agreed to.


Now while I have been diligently following the schedule, she hasn't done anything besides washing her dishes. Furthermore her room smells. And this isn't just a slightly musty smell, it smells like sweaty feet on a hot day combined with a sweaty buttcrack on a hot day. I think it's a combination of body odor, unwashed sheets and unwashed laundry (she has only done laundry once the entire time she's lived here). She also has the blinds down and windows closed so there's no sunlight or fresh air getting into her room. She has never vacuumed or cleaned her room (or the common areas for that matter). Usually I would let it go because I understand that cleanliness often is a personal opinion. However, her room is adjacent to the living room, and even sitting in the living room makes me gag. I don't invite friends over because of how bad it smells. I want to be sensitive about this, because I know that body odor is sometimes a medical problem. 


Now to try and at least get the house smelling fresh I decided to hire a cleaner twice a month to clean the entire house. I will be paying in full. So I sent her a message letting her know that the cleaner will be entering her room to clean next week. She responded back by saying I don't have permission to enter her room because she's not comfortable having a stranger clean her room. I offered that she could be there when the cleaner cleaned her room and I gently reminded her that I have an obligation to my landlord to keep the house well maintained. She responded back repeating that I do not have permission to enter her room. I want to respond that if that's the case, she's going to have to deep clean her room twice a week to my satisfaction.


I need advice with how to deal with this on two fronts. Is there anyway that she can legally forbid me from entering her room to get it cleaned even if I give her 48 hours notice. Not sure if the landlord tenant act comes into play here. Secondly, how do I tell her that her room reeks and that it is not okay.

I made the mistake of forgetting about it. It was left open therefore now there is quite a bit of water in it. Of course it smells terrible and I want to dispose of it... 

My mom told me to take it to the nearest storm drain which I was definitely hesitant of. So I googled it and it is apparently illegal to do that and even if it isn't I don't think my conscious would allow me to do that.

182,"So I'm posting on behalf of my parents since they don't reddit. And I'm posting on my girlfriend's account so my brother won't see. This involves me (23f) my brother J (15m) and my parents (late 40s) 

So my brother, turning 15 this week, literally NEVER gets off the phone with his little girlfriend. I'm talking never. He will talk on the phone with her the ENTIRE day. While sometimes they are just on the phone but doing something and not even talking. If he isn't on the phone with her he is either texting/chatting with her on skype, or he is playing video games on his computer. 

Before he met this girl, he would almost never get off the computer. It's like he just switches between obsessions. He also gets SUPER moody and fights wth everyone. On Mother's Day he locked himself in my parents bedroom to talk with her on the phone for over 8 hours. 

I feel like my parents have given up. They have raised me and my other brother and I feel like they just don't know what to do. For some reason they will not take away his phone or computer.. I should also mention that this girl's parents had forbid my brother from seeing their daughter due to the fact that they had sex once and the girl thought she was pregnant and the parents flipped out. 

I guess my question is, is there anything I can do as their 23 y/o daughter to wake them up and try to get them to be more serious in their parenting with my brother? They were much harder on my and my other brother. Also, my littlest brother has started doing even worse in school than he already was. He lies to my parents saying he's going to tutoring but it's obvious he's staying at school late to hang out with this girl. He has started neglecting his tasks at home even worse and spends the whole day in seclusion talking to this girl. He flips out on you and he is rather large, nearly 6' and over 200lb. He gets upset and slams doors, throws things. He was already moody like this before when we would try to get him to stop playing on his computer but it's gotten even worse. I have also noticed he has been crying more lately than before and he has confessed to me he had body issues. 

I just see my brother really suffering and I don't know what to do to help and what to do to get my parents to be a little more hard on him.

183,"Hi everyone, never posted here before, let me know if I'm in the wrong place or whatever. Anyway here goes (sorry in advance if this is a wall of text)

I've been living at home for several months now, after dropping out of university after 2 years due to a lot of mental problems as well as just feeling like I didn't want to carry on my course any more. I'm pretty much broke, except for a little under £600 (roughly $750) which I will hopefully soon get from an investment account my parents made when I was a child. I've been looking for jobs but with only half a degree, no experience, and my mental health issues making it difficult to even start searching, I haven't found anything in almost a year. I also have a small source of income from doing translations online, but that is unsteady at the best of times, and if my mental health is too bad I can't do it, plus the internet here is so terrible and it literally cuts off every time it rains, which happens a lot. All in all I'm lucky if I make £50 a month from that, and that goes pretty fast.

I hate living here as well. Not only are my family pretty horrible to live with (which ruins my mental health even more), but I feel really isolated from the rest of the world. I live in a tiny village in rural England with horrible internet, nothing to do nearby and only one bus to the nearest town, where I can't really afford to do anything anyway. All my friends (and my partner) are still at university at the other end of the country, with the exception of a couple who I never see anyway. I can't afford to take a train there anywhere near as often as I'd like, even with my friends helping me out.

I really need to get out of here soon, but I have no idea how. I really want to be able to live on my own and see my friends and just be free of my family and this shitty place, but I don't know how to get there. I'd also love the ability to travel, to see my friends or just visit places all over the country.

I have a couple of options, but none of them are great.
First, I could try and learn to drive, buy a shitty car with my £600, and just get out of here and live in the car indefinitely, /r/vandwellers style. I actually love this idea and I think I could make it work but the sticking point is the lessons, which would easily eat up all of my money, plus I might not pass, plus my dad is the only person who can help me practise and he's busy all the time and even when he's not he doesn't make it easy.
Second, I could go back to university. I can't change subjects without starting my whole course over again, so I'll just have to go back to my previous one (the one which I hated so much I dropped out), plus this will put me even further in debt to the student loans company.
Third, I could keep trying to get a job, but as I've already explained, that's going to take me ages and it could just never happen. If I could get one I could make the money to go for one of my other options, but I really don't want to have to wait that long because just living here for a couple more months is terrifying to me, even though I've already been here for about 6 months

Do any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or similar experiences that you can tell me about?
As you might be able to tell from the car-dwelling thing, no idea is too crazy. I just want to be happy, and I don't care how unorthodox or how much of a legal grey area (obviously I don't want to fuck anyone over, but it's not as if the police like drifters or whatever) my escape plan is.",10Jun2017,1

They always act like they can't believe I don't date more girls and sleep around, or that beautiful women should be flocking to me because I'm such a sexy beast or whatever.

I have a good personality and a lot going for me. But I'm terrible at meeting new people, I'm not attractive, and I'm not very smooth when it comes to flirting. I'm awkward as hell, and usually scare women off before I even get their number, or before we meet in person if we met online.

196,"Hello everyone,

I'm feeling a bit awkward about writing my story here, but as I'm feeling so incredibly sad and no one seems to be able to relate to what I've experienced, I hope one of you might be able to say something helpful about it.

In 2011, at age 36, I met an amazing English organic farmer, aged nearly 41. He was everything but a stereotypical farmer; he had studied, gone to boarding school, traveled to Africa and was extremely appreciated by everyone around him. It was love at first sight for me and the fact that he had never before been intimate with a woman, didn't bother me at all. I prepared myself for months of giggles and clumsiness, the only thing that mattered to me, was that I had finally found a ""home"" in someone's heart.

There were lots of lovely hugs during the day, as there were kisses and many sweet words from him about a shared future, marriage and children. I felt the most blessed girl in the world... finally, someone who is serious with me and treating me well!

The first time he ""went down on me"" though (something he initiated himself, as I had no desire to become his teacher and intended to leave things to time and curiosity), he run off to the bathroom to brush his teeth... something that left me feeling pretty bad about myself. I sat there waiting, on the edge of the bed, for quite a while, but when he came back, all that came out of me was ""are you alright?"". He said ""yes, was just feeling a bit thirsty all of a sudden"" (he didn't know I had heard him brush his teeth).

I decided to keep my feelings of insecurity to myself and to not make it into a problem, after all, we slept besides each other every night and sex wasn't everything (which I still believe to be true).

When, over the next 4 or 5 months, he actively avoided that part of my body, also with his hands (it was intercourse only), my feelings of insecurity started to grow. What was going on? I thought that perhaps sharing a bath together would help... all in vain. He had clearly developed a phobia for my private parts.

The result was that I became quite anxious and didn't feel my free and happy self anymore. Something that bothered me a lot, as I really wanted this relationship to work. I knew we had to talk about things, but how was I to start the conversation? And what was the point of having one? If he wasn't into me, he wasn't into me, right? I feared feeling even more bad about myself after opening the subject.

Still, one morning in the 5th month, I (gently but clumsily) tried to tell him that ""it was meant for two people"". Which were the wrong words, of course. He probably took them as a complain or a sign that he did something wrong, as his answer was legendary ""I don't think the cows of the bull have orgasms and I'm pretty sure my mother never had one either"". Which was the end of the conversation. I didn't know what to say anymore. But from that moment on, I found it hard to keep trusting he meant well with me. Which resulted in me taking a step back and becoming less talkative and crying over things that had not bothered me before. Which is where I went wrong... and which I regret a lot. Where I had helped him enthusiastically on the farm before, I now felt reluctant. Which wasn't helping us, of course. I should have properly communicated my hurt and feelings of insecurity, but as I'm quite an introvert and not a star in articulating feelings on the spot or standing up for myself... I let things simmer.

Nothing changed anyway. Occasionally, he gave it a try with his hands. But that never lasted longer than a few seconds, before he said ""sorry sweetie, I'm falling asleep"".

In month 9 I discovered I was pregnant, and then, under influence of pregnancy hormones, all my build-up hurt came out one night. During a hysteric and very tearful outburst (in which I first brought up lots of less relevant incidents of insecurity, like ""you didn't even look at the Christmas tree I put up for us!""), I asked him ""are you perhaps gay?"". Something I wasn't really worried about, but as I didn't feel brave enough to say ""are you perhaps disgusted of me?"", that was what came out. 

The result was that an hour or two later, he - for the first time - made an effort to pay some attention to me. Which felt like a pretty big thing after 9 months, but up until today, I don't feel particularly wanted, knowing that it took an ""are you perhaps gay?"".

There were many other awkward incidences besides the above, but the end of the story is that a few months after my miscarriage, we parted. He really needed someone on the farm and didn't feel I had the ""get up and go"" needed to learn the ropes and build myself a fulfilling life where he lived.

Within 2 weeks after my departure, he was out on the Internet looking for someone new again. Something that made me feel things hadn't meant anything to him. Feelings I expressed to him and to which he said ""I'd like to find someone physically stronger than you"".

I'm hoping to hear from someone who's been the first girlfriend of a 40+ year old virgin as well... as where he moved on with the speed of light (and is now engaged to a woman 23 years his junior!), I feel robbed from everything: my self-confidence mainly, of course, but also my faith in love, my hopes, a chance to motherhood... many things. 

I feel as if he gained a life at the expense of mine.

Next week, I will be moving across the country with my boyfriend of 3 years.  My mother is understandably having issues with this.  Today at lunch, she told me she thinks I am pushing back my future for a guy and ""I'm not as young as I think I am"".

Now the point of this post is not my mother or my boyfriend or even this move.  What she said to me about not being as young as I think I am really inflamed some fears I've been ignoring for awhile.  Basically, ever since I turned 24 years old I've been struggling with what I've been jokingly calling a ""quarter life crisis"".  I'm not sure if that's a normal thing for people or even real.  I'm struggling with the fact that I am almost 25 years old and I don't have a good job, that I can't do fun stuff I should be doing in my 20s and I'm terrified of wasting the rest of my youth.  I graduated last year from college and I got a job with great benefits but shitty pay.  I was making more at my part time job during school than I was at this job out of college.  I'm starting to deal with confidence issues and self loathing that I haven't felt since I was in high school.  Now I feel like these feelings are taking over my life and I don't have the time to waste on them like I did in the past.

I'm scared and I don't know what to do.  I don't want to become adventurous and struggle finding a job later in life but I also don't want to get comfortable now and then wait to have the fun I should be having now later. I guess I'm just terrified of growing old.

I don't know if I have even explained any of this correctly. I'm not even sure I this is where I should post this.  Does anyone have any advice for me to deal with all these fears?

A few days ago, Joe asked if we could meet in real life since he lives in the state next to mine. I felt shy and self conscious about it so I gently told him that I'd rather not yet. ""Maybe someday.""

After this, Joe started acting weird around me. He became passive-aggressive, and has barely talked to me.

216,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am 19, male and I live in Europe 

My channel blew up like four months ago (from like 5k to almost a million subscribers and I am sponsored by a big local brand). Almost everytime when I go out, there's someone who stops me to take a picture or they shout to me or some people even give me gifts. (All of them are aged 13-20). I don't really have a big problem with this.

The fact is that in reality I am an introvert. I am a very shy and calm guy and I like to just mind my business, walk down the street with my headphones on an just be there with my thoughts.

The bad part is that lately a lot of people try to be friends with me and they do it just because I am ''famous'' now and they want to benefit from it (I know this because before they didn't even say hello to me and now they act all nice and friendly). And the really bad part is that girls do it too. I atach really fast to someone because I didn't have many relationships. Girls that didn't even knew that I existed in highschool are approaching me now everyday.

My biggest concern is that everyone I will meet from now on (especially girls) will want to be friends or in a relation with me just because of who I am.

I just want a normal life. I want to be with only one girl, who likes me for who I really am, not for the ''fame and money'' I could offer her and I also would like some friends who I could go out and have a beer without them taking thousands of photos so people can see that they are with me.

I am thinking about closing my channel and ''disappear'' for a while, maybe change my look a bit (grow a beard, dye my hair) so that I can start again my social life without the paranoic thought that everyone wants to benefit of me.

As someone who is about to start college, I'm trying to fix my bad social skills. I suck at conversation and I always manage to make things awkward. Basically, when people talk to me, I try to listen to what they say, nod and say yeah, awkwardly, and maybe ask a few shitty questions. And rarely, if ever, do I contribute anything to the conversation.

Same thing when in social circles or groups. I just sit back and listen, not being able to contribute anything.

Honestly, what can I do to help me get over this? Is it because I'm not doing enough interesting things in my life or something? I hate just staying back and not being able to say anything, and I always sit there stuck, not knowing what to say or add to the conversation.

I've been throwing myself at social gatherings, and trying to engage myself with strangers (at parties, for example), but I always end up looking like an awkward, shy dude who is just lame. Especially because at max, I contribute like 1-2 sentences of my own, and most of the time contribute nothing.

Please help, any advice is appreciated. I honestly am trying to improve myself but have no idea how to do this. Even a small tip might help.

Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that I suck at telling stories. I always end up stumbling through them (on the rare occasions that I do share them) and they never turn out to be enjoyable to listen to. Most people just tune out like halfway through.

But if someone else says those same words I needed to hear from myself, or even if I just read them, then I will know exactly what to do and I will follow through it.

I'd like to know how to gain confidence in myself? How to respect myself enough, how to acknowledge myself with the same deal of attention I do with others? It affects my life negatively because the environment will shape me and how I perform.

If I run out of money, I know that my dad will give me some to help me out. He does not have a lot of money saved up and I don't know whether it will hold up for his old age. 
I am not lazy. I work very hard every day. Or, 6 out of 7 days a week from 8am until 1pm. Only I am working on getting a foothold as a photographer. I am good at it and I say so because I have got high praise from people very high up. However, I am not yet earning money from it, I am just builiding up my client base (haven't had a paid one yet, only portfolio work). The problem is not that I don't have ""talent"", only that it takes a while naturally. My work is good because I work when my brain works best (mornings) and study a lot. Because I work so hard on this, I tend to not care much about whether the little money I earn form my 10 hour/week side-job runs out. Although I have tried again and again to make myself care. In the end it's always my Dad who gives me money. Usually, I have the evenings/afternoons free. If I worked more side-jobs then I would have enough money and could develop my business on the side. But I won't have any life left and I feel my photography will decline. And I seem to be close to getting paid for it. Should I persevere, knowing that I will be earning money from it and can pay him back if I continue to focus on the photography? Or should I get more sidejobs and it will simply take longer?

So, ever since i was a kid i was one of those ""Locked in his room playing video games"" kind of person.

I was always socially awkward, i have enormous difficulty making small talk or establishing a conversation, and my fear of interaction has gotten to the point in which i can't even catch the bus because i have a panic attack from having to be close to people i dont know (yes, irrational and downright stupid, but true).
Sitting in front rows during lectures is unthinkable for me, i always sit at the farthest corner as hidden as possible and i avoid interaction as long as it isn't specifically necessary.
The small group of friends i had simply left me behind and any new people i try to strike a conversation with simply lose interest immediately and never talk to me again.

238,"My husband and I have been very close friends with another couple for almost 10 years. The husbands spend a lot of time together, enjoy many of the same activities. I have considered the wife to be my best friend for several years. We consider them family, spend holidays together, vacation together.  Our kids are close friends as well. 

A few days ago, the wife and I have coffee. I've known that they have been having some troubles in their marriage for the last year, but they have been together since they were teenagers and she's not happy. She's mentioned about a year ago that she wanted to leave her husband. I was shocked - she confirmed that she still loves her husband, but the spark has dimmed. 

I told her my honest opinion, a year ago, that you don't just throw a long term marriage away unless you are sure it's what you want, you've tried to fix it and that the grass isn't always greener. 

So last week, over coffee, she disclosed to me that she was once again thinking about leaving her husband, even tho she still loves him, she's not ""in love with him"". As we talked, she finally disclosed that a year ago, while on vacation in another country, she met and slept with a man about 10 years younger than she is. She has been texting and speaking by phone and skype with this guy regularly over the last year.  She went on vacation back to his country this winter and they saw each other again. This guy is hoping to immigrate to our country, and has plans to do so, and **married someone else living a few hours away from us two months ago**. After his wedding, my friend went back to his country and slept with him again. 

Now, she's planning on leaving her husband and maybe getting involved with this guy. 

Every fiber of my being is screaming that she is being used. I think this guy is a scam artist. I think he's desperate to immigrate and is going to use her for this. And even if he isn't, she's cheating on her husband and this guy is cheating on his wife. 

Wtf?!?  This is one of my closest friends and suddenly I feel like she isn't the person I thought she was. Over ten years of friendship is shaken to to core. 

Seriously- am I being a judgmental bitch here? Or is this just fucked right up?

Also - she tells me that her husband knows all about the other guy. I have no idea if that's true or not. I haven't mentioned the conversation or the other guy to my husband yet, because I'm concerned that he will say something to the husband and it will hurt him. I'm friends with him as well, and hate seeing him hurt. But do I keep my mouth shut and stay out of it all? ",10Jun2017,2

Lately, I have had no such luck. You could chalk it up to the fact that not everybody stays friends forever. Or perhaps it could be because people change. Never did I realize there was a third option, the idea that I don't deserve to have friends.

After talking about getting engaged with my then 6yr ex, she eventually left me right after I had graduated from college. After a year of self pity sex with girls I would normally never sleep with, I soon came to a realization that I no longer felt anything for these girls. This mindset would soon spread to my coworkers, my friends, and even my family...

I tried my best to work out all of my stress, whether it be more hours at the gym, or taking a 2nd job on the weekends. But recently, my best friend passed away as well. He was the best dog a guy could have and would always cheer me up when he knew I was sad.

I'm at an impasse where there seems to be no more hope of me to ever emotionally bond with anyone again, especially the longer I keep spiraling down this path.

242,"Hello viewers. I'd appreciate your help with this. My mom contently tells me about how messy my room and bathroom is. It's like she doesn't notice when the rooms are clean. I don't argue with her at all but I feel really disappointed in myself and pathetic because I let her down.

I've apologized to her and promised that I will keep them clean about three times now but she always gets me as soon as it gets dirty or I kept something out of place. Today she talked to me and I'm trying to make it the last time. I work full time and go to school so that's why I slack here and there. Although I'm not going to make that an excuse, sometimes I don't notice when I'm focused on working and studying. 

What ruins my spirit even more is how she says recently I've been doing a poor job with cleaning the bathroom. I guess because I rush with my limited time. Now I feel paranoid that I'm not performing well at home. I just feel like I failed her. I'm honestly going to try keeping my rooms clean from now on but will that be enough to make it up to her?",10Jun2017,1
244,"She's pregnant and has had three miscarriages in the past year. I've told her multiple times she needs to go to a doctor and be closely monitored through this pregnancy, but she keeps making excuses not to. I can't call CPS on an unborn child,  but if it were a born baby she wasn't taking to the doctor this would be medical neglect. ",10Jun2017,1
246,"I’m in college class rn and we are doing a group project.  I introduced myself to a person(let’s call them Becky)  in the beginning of the quarter, and was willing to work with them, however early in the class they said they no longer needed to work with me. k. but throughout the quarter they continue ask for me to send my code to them.  red flags that I ignore for some reason.

Back to present, was waiting to be randomly assigned to a group but someone asked me to be in their group.  Don’t know how to say no since I was just waiting for the end of class to be assigned. third person joins. I try to be proactive, create google drive, repository, provide digital copy of instructions. We are required to diagram all our variables and functions together to match everything up. 

Have a feeling Becky would need help, so I partially write Becky’s class since I am assigned to the parent class ;  I needed a child class to test my code anyway. Week long project, send over my finished classes within 42 hours of being assigned (tuesday). Offer help and support if group members need it. 

Classes on m/w, so on wednesday we check in, other partner is maybe 5 lines in their class. Other partner is fantastic, she figures out how to translate my parent class to her child class, however Becky is still confused about what we have been learning for 2 weeks, decides to not follow our diagram and begins handwriting a whole page of function ideas in the corner. I ask her what she is doing and she beams at me and says shes handwriting some functions we are missing. oh u. Tell her professor has repeated multiple times to just follow the instructions as written, and don’t need to include other functions. k. walk her through the functions we agreed upon in UML. don’t hear from her thursday. I message everyone that I updated my file and added comments and offer help again. friday. becky asks me where my main is.Classes dont have mains, and professor always provides us with the main, but ok- I tell her the professor has the main uploaded with the instructions. Other partner finishes her part, also found a git of the same project and links us. soft due date friday night.  becky inquires about adding excessive variables (that i agree we would need in a rl situation) , I ask her if she’s finished with just fulfilling the instructions, then we can move on to looking at her new variables. she’s still working on it. k. several minutes later she txts me and I find out she doesn’t know how to match a parameter to a variable name. Becky is somehow secretary to a com sci club… never knew I could feel genuinely concerned, frustrated, and baffled by one person. I have tried my best to communicate with her rationally, but we are almost 2 days past the due date and I provided her with a class to look at for help…Don’t know what to do if something like this happens in the future, or if this is just a unique experience. I could have avoided this whole situation if I just said no to being in their group I guess… Any advice? Feel free to tell me if I'm just overthinking this btw, I feel fucking stupid for dealing with this.",10Jun2017,1
247,I'm an introvert and shy. I don't do well in social events and end up being a wall flower. I like anime and video games. I work in a mostly women environment so finding a man is so rare. How do I find someone? I tried reddit and Tinder. I didn't like tinder because all the guys seemed so thirsty.,10Jun2017,1
248,"Thanks everyone for the support from the last post I made here, I've taken this to a therapist and talked it out.
So now that it's in the open I've got to the stage where the the just a matter of fixing the damage over time. 

The trauma being revealed has caused some issues especially with sleep. 
I can't just fall asleep anymore, I lie for hours waiting to eventually pass out from exhaustion, I've tried over he counter sleep meds, exercise before but nothing seems to work. 

Especially the sleeping meds I just sleep for longer rather than earlier. 

So do you guys have any advice about how I can break my insomnia?

249,"Hi reddit, so basically I've learned that my e-mail and the password were posted on some websites, since some websites allow you to search for the websites the e-mail is used on, some people used it to connect to my accounts.

I was at fault, I shouldn't have put the same password twice, I changed some of the most important passwords, but what do I do now ?",10Jun2017,2
250,"So, I'm not really a social person and it was super rare for this to happen but I managed to say something in school to a rather young girl (3 years younger than me) and I was bored at home so I eventually sent her a private message on facebook.. All good and we kept talking and I noticed that she liked me to the point she even got mad because I was compliment on how nice her friend was (she told me she got jealous and shit so that's where I figured it out)
So.. I made her talk and she eventually said what she felt for me and it's proven that she likes me but I chose not to date her. She did made me feel like I should treat this with time and give her an answer later.
She's a very sweet girl and all and I would date her but there are some stuff that limit me (i think)
- First things first, the age gap. I'm like 16 and she's 13 (pf) and in 2 years I'm leaving school and she's barely even finishing it.
I know that for people in their adult life feel like a 3 year gap is nothing but it feels really big for teenagers.. I really like her but I don't think I should date her. Thoughts?  And she says she's not hurt but she talks way less than she used to. Do not want that to happen as I have a good time with her.",10Jun2017,1
