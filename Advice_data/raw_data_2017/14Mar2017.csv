0,"I regularly watch gay porn. To my knowlegde those that i have watched the most clearly features adults. A few of them are my favourites. But after reading several articles about child pornography i became seriously worried about the legality of those sites that host them. According to two institutions that deal with illegal pornography ; claim that such illicit content can be regularly found on those  porn sites. That statement 
alone has left me totally paranoid.  Everytime i think the police  will come banging on my door at any moment and dragging me to prison. Even though i have never encounterd such illicit content in the years that i have watched adult porn. i am absolutely terrified at the thought that i might stumble upon  child pornography while visiting sites like pornhub, redtube or xhamster. i know that the likelihood of encountering such illicit content is very small.  But that doesn't take away my scares.  So, should i justt stop watching gay porn entirely   or am i  just overthinking things. ",14Mar2017,0
1,"I am from the UK and the person I had a LDR was from America but we ended up breaking off the relationship due to fuck ups by both of us. Because it was my first relationship I was pretty clueless and unsure if I actually wanted to be with her for the rest of my life.

I broke things off a bit into the relationship then I regretted my decision and asked if she would take me back. She still loved me but I made an ass of myself with breaking up trying to get back so she declined. We tried to go back to being friends because we were really close friends before we dated. But that didn't really work out very well and we fell out. She stopped speaking to me and thought I had send my friends to troll her (which I didn't)

When we did talk it was when she was anxious about something or tempted to go back to taking prescription pills or stealing (She did this a few years back but stopped) and I was the only person she would talk to about it. I tried to convince her to tell her family or go to a therapist but she refused.

I thought I was over all of this until she asked a friend of mine if I would speak to her and I guess she wanted closure. We apologised for everything we did to eachother and left it at that but she has started to come on the voice chat server I use to talk to a handful of my friends. She doesn't speak to me or my friends she speaks to other people I know of and now I can't stop thinking that maybe I should try getting back together with her.

But then theres the issue of if we are even compatible. When we were talking about our plans for the future we are complete opposites. I have no interest in travelling and am happy staying in the UK where as she wants to travel and work around the world. (So live in say Asia, europe or africa working for a few years then go home for a few years rinse repeat) And we have different interests. I am into films and video games  and while she does play the odd game of CSGO or League every now and then she never plays games.

And most of my friends don't really like her or aren't fond of her so theres that.

Part of me wants to ask her out again but then theres another part of me that thinks its a terrible idea and im just gonna break up with her after a while. I am completly stuck on what to do :(",14Mar2017,1
2,"I hit a deer with my last vehicle voiding it useless, and live in a rural area, making my own transportation absolutely essential. My credit is only 676, I make about.. 500 a month only (but can get about 2k in student refunds). I want to increase hours to make more cash but I have to share vehicles and that's impossible for me to do. I look at loans but I feel like I won't be able to get one at all, plus not a single part of me wants any brand new 20k+ vehicle, it's unnecessary for me. So, then you think ""buy used, craigslist..ect.."" Yeah, only have 1k saved up and buying a great gas mileage, not totally trashed and long lasting vehicle on CL for 1k either is delusional or a scam. And saving any more feels impossible because of regular living expenses taking up my small checks. I need advice on what to do please! 

TLDR;I need a car asap, I have no debts or loans (and want to keep it that way), I can make more but need a vehicle, only 1k in savings, and credit is ""fair"". only 21 y/o living @ home, part time worker, full-time student.",14Mar2017,1

9,"Hello everyone,

A little background: My dad has suffered from alcoholism and depression. He does not have any close friends. Our relatives are in another country. He is only 45 but refuses to try dating again and making new connections. I am all he has.

The issue is that I am a full time college student and want to work soon(he has flat out told me I cant move out and that he'll provide money for my necessities). I am not allowed to date or get a job. I know what everyone is thinking. I am an adult and can do as I please. This is where I feel conflicted. 

My dad has sacrificed many things for me growing up. He had hopes and dreams but had to take care of me by himself. We were always close and he is my best friend. He doesn't understand why I would want to move out when I have it ""easy"" with him. He thinks 20 is young and that I shouldn't leave him until I get married(Very ironic because I cant date right now).

Recently, he has become more clingy ever since I brought up getting a job. He asks to to watch movies everyday, out to dinner, go out to the mall etc. even though I'm extremely busy with studies. 

Has anyone experienced something similar to this? I feel so stuck and I dont know what to do. I just feel so bad, because he has no life outside of me.",14Mar2017,41
12,"Her name is Smokey and she's old and senile. We don't want her anymore for a number of reasons. When one of my roommates, M, moved in, his dad forced him to take Smokey with him because his dad refused to house her anymore (bad sign).

The worst of our problems with her is that she rarely, if not never, shits in the box, she shits *next to* the box. And to make this problem even worse, her bowels are some kind of fucked-up, so half the time that she shits next to the box, it's diarrhea.

We don't know if it's Smokey, or Archer, or both, but someone keeps pissing on M's bed. Also, to help keep Smokey from shitting on the kitchen floor near the cat box in there, M has taken it upon himself to put a cat box in his closet, which is by itself a crappy thing to have to do. And get this: when smokey shits near the box in M's closet, she tries to cover it up with litter from the box, making an even bigger mess.

She doesn't get along well with our other cat, Archer. Archer's young and just wants to play with her, but she's an old fart that just cat-slaps and hisses at him. Also, she's one of those skiddish cats that lives in perpetual fear of everything that moves and makes noise. This makes it even more difficult to love her and also explains why she just doesn't seem happy; I've never seen her asleep.

So it's obvious why we don't want her: she's not an enjoyable cat to have in the house and just causes more needless stress for us. But we can't just give her to a shelter because it's very likely that no one else would want her either. She'd probably just waste away in there and get euthanized once she's too old. I'd rather us not get her euthanized ourselves, that would make us feel awful even if it's morally permissible.",14Mar2017,1
13,"So I slug to work everyday (ad hoc informal carpooling) and this one time on the way home I got into a car and had the greatest conversation with an incredible girl. She's maybe a year older than I am (22) and we are both new into the work force (same field). As we get to my car (she's dropping me off), we were talking about happy hours and web development. Like an idiot, I thought ""Hey let this be one of those times you just have a great time with a great person and don't ask her name or number"", so I decided not to do either and walked over to my car.

Fast forward 2 weeks and part of me is regretting not asking her for her number. I see her in the lanes once in awhile but I don't want to be weird and just walk over to her car (if there are others in-front of hers). Advice on what I should do here, and how to find a way to talk to her even if I'm not aligned to get into her car? I'm sure she remembers me, but I'm not trying to be weird here, especially if she doesn't remember me (loll).

15,"So. My drug dealer is also good friends with my friend group, though I don't know them that well. Living with them is another friend with a baby girl that's a few months old. They all live in this disgusting house, with multiple dogs in cages barking 24/7, it smells horrible. There's dog shit pressed into the floor, the carpet is all torn up, and the mother has been known to use hard drugs (I don't think she's stopped). There's doors missing, paint peeling, trash all over the floor, bongs just left out. The baby always breathes in smoke because people are doing drugs with her in the room (though her room with the crib is the cleanest in the house). Her parents are good people, and they obviously love her, so I don't know what I should do. I would be shunned if anyone ever found out I called CPS, because they are good people. What's worse, me being the reason this baby girl was taken away from her loving parents, or sitting by and not doing anything, letting her grow up in unsanitary conditions?

This has a very very very low probability of happening, but I am kind of scared that my SO (my first and only so far) won't break up. That being said, I never want to break up and I want the relationship to go super well. I'm making a lot of contradictions right now, aren't I?

Okay, what makes me scared is that I'm afraid that if I don't have a bad relationship experience, I'm going to wonder if there is more out there, if that makes sense. I'm not hoping for any bad relationships or anything like that, but I'm scared that only having one good relationship will strain it, because I'm inexperienced with bad ones and start to doubt everything.

35,"I was homeschooled since third grade, and it was a terrible experience. While I retained some friends I'd made in school, contact with the outside world ended after my family moved shortly before middle school. After that, my parents kept me from doing very many things outside of the house, and I only made one actual friend (who wasn't even a close one). Partly due to difficulty focusing, and partly to force my parents to put me in school, I didn't actually do a lot of the work.

With the poor high school transcript I had, I ended up getting an associate's degree at a community college. I finally transferred into a better school, majoring in ""Editing, Writing, and Media"". I chose it because it didn't require the math credits that I was missing, and it gave me a chance to get away from home. Now that I'm about to graduate, I feel unsatisfied. The major is utterly useless and I don't think that I ever actually learned anything of any value. I don't know if I really want an editing career. And I want to complete the math credits I never got for that sense of validation, if for no other reason. 

I also want a longer college experience. I had almost no life while I was homeschooled. I never became involved in my community college. And I've only been at this school for two years. Right now is the first time in my life that I've ever actually had friends, and I want it to last longer. But it hasn't been everything that it should have been, because I still struggle with my social skills, and want more time to develop them before I try to start a career.

I'm about ready to quit my first job after college and move onto my second, but I've hit a problem: I don't know how to quit.

As a result, I haven't quit anything since I was nine, even when I probably should've.

I know I'm not great in those subjects but I still feel responsible for failing out. I've held German at a B- or B range for most of the year and biologys been at C- t C+. This was good enough as it's not completely raping my GPA however it's holding me back in all my other classes I've had straight A's and A+ this has kept my gpa around a 3.3ish range. This would be fairly fine except that I've been sick recently and missed a whole weeks worth of school. This dropped my bio grade down to an E German is at a D- and all my other classes are still at the A to A- range so nothing to worry about there. except for the fact we got 2 weeks till the term is over. I've decided to ring up my cousin because she's going into world language as her major and she's down the whole German program at the school as far as it goes. She agreed to help me set up a little study/homework group for the German classes and that she'd help us all learn.

Dated this guy last year. No sex but came close. I freaked on him .On the 3rd date, I told him I was getting attached and he said he feels the same. I told him I didn't like it because I missed him, I didn't know what I wanted, but I wanted a bf. He then postponed our date  2 days to hang with his friend and I flipped out and told him I couldn't trust him and needed to block him. We argued long time about ending it and he says ""so you're gonna throw this away?"" ""You want me to cancel with my friend and sister?""

I apologized the next day for my behavior and he moved our date back one day. 

The fifth time I saw him I pressured him  to be my bf before we even knew each other cuz I wanted to lock him down... he essentially said he was only wanting to see me, but not for bf/gf yet...I said I need bye then. 


I apologized again, but said let's both keep our options open. He said ""so I'm an option?"" I told him I'm not seeing anyone else and he said well neither am I and i don't want others

Six date I broke it off to his face. He got really pissed. I said ""sorry it's just hard . Give me a hug goodbye?""

He did but he got really mad and texted me when I left saying that that he wasn't going to just go into a rship and he thinks I'm playing games and he's losing feelings 

I begged him for forgiveness. He said he'd think on it, but I couldn't wait so I just said forget it. Let's move on. 

The next day I called him and he seemed friendly but distant. He said he'd see me again just not now 

5 days past without him contacting he used to text me all the time first. Daily. 

So I flipped out and says he's great but I have to block him for good 


I came back months later and we talked and I blew up His phone and pressured him to be my bf again(he agreed jokingly) I said ""nvm when you become bf sex stops, so let's break up"" 


He finally got fed up with me and rejected me saying 
He says I'm hot and cold and too much and he'd love to sleep with me too but ""baggage"" he said more blowing up phone and getting attached 

My question is, could my behavior from before be what he means by hot and cold?

Broke up with guy several times 
Acted a little unstable 
Says I'm hot and cold

52,"So my boyfriend [23 M] rents a 1 bedroom apartment and subleases the living room to his coworker [28 M] who he considers an acquaintance. A little background on the lease is that it is in my name and my boyfriends name, although I don't live there anymore. We had previously agreed that my lease term would be temporary until I moved in with my current roommate. We planned on transferring my name to whoever would replace me, but we weren't able to do so since my bf's new roommate doesnt have strong enough credit and we couldn't find anyone else. Anyway, lets call the roommate Adam.

The issue with Adam is that among small things such as bad hygiene/cleaning habits, and frequently paying bills late, he has a habit of drinking our alcohol without our permission. He moved in two months ago and the problems began his first week there when he brought a girl over. My boyfriend and I were drinking from a new bottle of rum and Adam asks if he can make himself a drink. We said that was fine and a few minutes later he asked if he could make a drink for his girl too. He made each of them generous serving sizes, about 3-4 shots in each drink. This was annoying but we went on with the night, all playing board games together and we noticed them go to the kitchen separately with their empty glasses and coming back with refills. The bottle was nearly empty at this point and my boyfriend and I were pretty annoyed. We decided to wait till the morning to confront him about it after his girl left. Come morning, we discover that our nice $60 handle of grey goose is half empty when we had only made two martinis from it for ourselves on nye. My boyfriend went off on Adam telling him to never touch our stuff without permission again (including our nice sets of glassware), asking him how he has the audacity to help himself to someone else's expensive booze without permission. Adam is super apologetic, saying that he's sure they didn't have that much of the rum and that his girl had ""maybe a shot"" of the grey goose. My bf tells him it was practically full and adam tries to argue that he looked at it earlier in the week and it was about how full it is now. It was annoying in itself that he was checking out our bottles from the freezer in the first place. In the end, he never accepted responsibility for the missing booze but nonetheless bought us a new (small) bottle of grey goose as an apology.

Fast forward to last weekend, its my bf's birthday and we're having a quiet night in with some homemade dinner and a bottle of wine I bought for him. We drink a glass each and I take our empty glasses to the kitchen and leave the rest of the bottle in the cabinet. My boyfriend goes back out there 10 minutes later and notices Adam sipping on a glass of red wine at his desk. I go to the kitchen to check our bottle and sure enough its lighter than it was when I put it away. I'm fuming at this guys nerve to help himself to wine I purchased for my boyfriend and I for his birthday and shamelessly drinking it from my nice glass. I debate confronting him and decide to wait till the morning to make sure it couldn't have been from another bottle of his. He left this morning and I checked the recycle bin, all of the kitchen areas, and even around his desk and can confirm it was for sure my wine.

I know its just alcohol, but its the principle of him stealing from us that makes me feel so disrespected. The part that gets me is that this guy is 28 years old, can hardly support himself, doesn't have the credit to sign a lease, and has no shame stealing booze from a couple 5 years younger who manage to support themselves. And not only that, but the fact that we've confronted him about it before and he continues to steal from us and use our nice glasses despite us asking him not to.

I realize that it seems like a no brainer to kick him out which is what we are working toward. But in the meantime, we are dealing with it until we can find someone who has good credit, but is also trustworthy to replace him. I'd like to hear other people's take on this and any possible solutions to dealing with him. I still plan to confront him next time I see him. And for now I think we will have to start keeping our booze and glassware in the bedroom closet.",14Mar2017,1
53,"Hello Reddit, made this account just to post this. I'm 20F at my third year in college and want to get my visa this year as it seems more plausible to get it now than doing it in my last year at uni. I'm a bit uneasy as the travel situation in the US has gotten worse now that Trump is in power. What makes it worse is that my record is tainted: my mother was engaged to an American man and he wanted her close to him so they decided the best option was to live in the US until they got married. Well, before they got married we got busted with leaving there on a travel visa which obviously is illegal. I was 7. That man is no longer in our lives (thank god! If you're reading this Nick.... fuck you, I hope you rot in hell for hitting my mother all those years) For obvious reasons they didn't get married so that went down the drain. 

My mother payed the fines and we got the opportunity to apply again, we tried two times. Both times we were denied. Now that I'm a legal adult here in Mexico I'm applying alone or I'll wait until my 21 birthday which is this year.  I have a car in my name, credit record, made a considerable investment at a bank, have money to spend and really freaking pale with light brown hair but I'm an only child with a single mother with a very Mexican sounding last name. 

The other option is that my boyfriend (4yrs) and I are thinking of getting married after we finish college and save money for the big wedding HE wants. Maybe in four years or so. Should I wait for that? Or what should I do? ",14Mar2017,1
55,"Here's the story: I had a best friend about 3 months ago. He and I went to a really excellent rap concert (Atmosphere, if you really care). One of the opening acts was another rapper (Again, if you really care, it was Brother Ali) who my friend is a massive fan of.

Fast forward to now, Brother Ali is playing again, and I've already purchased tickets for me and a different friend. HOWEVER, this is where I require assistance: my best friend seems to have stopped all communication with me. I'm not exactly sure why, there was no fall out, or fight or anything, he's just fallen off the Earth. Mutual friends informed me that he is very busy with school, and I can respect that. What I'd like to know is if it would be appropriate to purchase him a ticket and send it to him via mail (with a letter saying something like ""Hey, I miss you, come and join us at this bomb-ass concert!"") 

School will be finished by the time the concert rolls around, so, provided that he is actually busy with school, he should be free by then. My question is: Would buying a ticket to this concert for him be a good way to break the ice, or would I be wasting my money? Anyone who has experience with this kind of thing; your advice is much appreciated!",14Mar2017,1
56,I left my $30 school parking pass in my car when I sold it to someone and now they won't take the time out of their day to give it back. She's bailed on me 5 times now and won't answer my messages. She also ignored my call. She does not go to my school/has no use for this parking pass and simply doesn't want to give me the time to come pick it up or even drop it off somewhere for me to pick it up. I know $30 doesn't seem like a lot of money but I'd have to park $2 a day/3 days a week for the rest of the semester if I don't get it. How do i get it back?,14Mar2017,1
57,"Im a female, and this happened when i was around 11-12 (Im 17 now).. I recently remembered this AND IT BOTHERED ME SO MUCHHH.. So i learned about the wonders of masturbation when i was 10 (i know, i know.. thats too young) and i got addicted ever since.. I was young so i was EXTREMELY stupid.. Stupid me decided to do it in our couch which was facing my two sisters rooms.. They didnt really caught me.. i ""think"".. i THINK.. Cuz u know.. i close my eyes sometimes and such.. 

Anyways, when i was around 11-12.. It was about lunchtime when i decided to do it.. 
Stupid young me decided the best place to not get caught was.. Not the bathroom, not the bedroom.. But the fking storage room.. So i went in and opened this huge cabinet and hid behind it's door..
I sat down, removed my bottoms and started rubbing it.. 

When i was about to orgasm ( i think )  I heard my sister calling me.. I was about to be done so i ignored her and just continued.. When i was done, i wore my pants and stood up.. I then saw that the door.. was slightly open..
Now i was EXTREMELY nervous.. But I wasn't sure if I didn't close it completely in the first place so I WAS NEVER SURE IF SHE DID SAW ME OR WHAT.. I remember going downstairs after and saw her washing the dishes.. I asked her something and i guess she answered normally.. BUT STILL! Im not sure ;--;
One time, I actually caught her doing it too, but i just pretended i didn't  saw anything and forgot about it the next day..

Now the thing that even increased my speculation was that.. I remember one day..
While eating breakfast with my mom, She was scolding me for staying up too late.. She then asked 
""What are you doing at night huh?"" I quickly dodged that question by saying something like I was drawing or playing computer games or whatever.. This made me thought that my sister told my Mom WHAT SHE SAW.. WHICH IS BOTHERING ME SO MUCH..

THIS IS BOTHERING ME SO MUCH BECAUSE IM NOT SURE IF THEY DID CAUGHT ME OR NOT

58,"Hey folks

I am a 33 year old consultant, living on the other side of the planet from where I was born, and I face a moral? dilemma:

2 years ago I quit my consultant career to focus on personal projects. I was making a living with casual jobs. Best decision ever.

I had a great life, lots of free time while living on the beach. Despite that I decided to move away again, to a cheaper country where I can buy property and settle. 

I took up the next good paying job I could find. A horrible job:

Service Operator for an online casino. My job is pretty much talking gamblers into gambling more. In online chats. During night-shifts!

I thought I will power through a couple of months until I have saved up enough to leave. 

I am now 2 months in and everyone likes me there. The job is easy, my colleagues are young and friendly. I hate it nonetheless because it is very draining to work at nights and the job is just so immoral and wrong. 

Also, my health suffers. I went from sixpack to looking like shit since I started. The night-shifts fuck up my appetite, I can´t sleep properly and training is also hardly possible. I am always tired. 

So, the thing is, I have invested into a risky asset about a year ago and all out of a sudden have enough money to move now rather than wait longer doing this shit job. 
My flight tickets are booked already, I am out of here in 3 weeks and will just leave everything behind, except for a suitcase. 

My plan re the job was to give them the required 2 weeks notice and then leave. 

But yeah, no, that is not going to happen. I am not wasting my last weeks in this country.

So I thought I will just give them 1 week, which is the week I am currently in. I am already halfway through and haven´t told them yet. 

I just could not, some colleagues know already but I have not made it official yet. I haven´t told HR yet because I first wanted to clarify a missing payment from my first week. 

I was calling in sick during training for a day. Today they told me that I won´t get paid for that day because I hadn´t called them but rather just sent an email, which is against the rules. 

It made me furious! Trying some fucking loophole to trick me out of my money. Btw, I ended the training best of class. 

I have to admit however, that I was already sick in the second week of working on the floor. For 2 days, I provided a certificate. 

Now, because I hate this job and have better things to do and really feel sorry for the scammed people and players and despise their business, I DECIDED THAT I WANT TO CALL IN SICK AGAIN!! for my last 2 days. 

Then I would send them an email telling them that I wont come in anymore. 

How horrible is that? Right now I am lying on bed, I had a couple of hours sleep after my last shift. I feel like shit and just don´t want to go there anymore. 

And I think why the hell should I not just call in sick again and get paid too. 

There is not much volume of world atm, so my colleagues won´t suffer. I am an idiot and told 1 or 2 already. Stupid I know. 

But what does it matter? I will be gone soon. I might run into one of them where I live but that is not my issue. 

I just can´t bring up the courage to call and say I am sick again. I feel so stupid, everyone would know I am lying. But they could not prove it. 

HEEEELP and thanks for reading this mildly interesting story

Your advice is much appreciated.

59,"Hi,
So I made some bad decisions that I didn't really see as bad at the time but I certainly see as bad now and I have violated my schools conduct. Since I don't know what will come from it I can't offer details other than it is likely I will be suspended for a year. 

I am already being represented by a lawyer, which will cost around five thousand dollars I do not have. Luckily my family loves me and will cover it, but I will have to pay them back with time. I also had a very rough semester in the fall due to a spell of depression that I had never encountered before but I am now in a much better place between therapy and medication. So I am thankful for that and I am doing my best to stay positive about this situation. My biggest fear is telling my parents about my suspension as all they know is that I did something bad, have a lawyer and law wise everything will work out in the long run.

I am here asking for advice on how to tell my parents I am being suspended. I am beyond scared to have this conversation with them because I know they will be disappointed in me. Which they should be; I'm disappointed in myself too. I have definitely learned my lesson the hard way. I wish it could have been different but alas this is the situation I am in and I'm taking full responsibility for it. 

I have thought about plans of what I can do while I am suspended. But I do not want to take the year off. I am thinking about enrolling at another state college for the year I cannot attend me college. I want to take online classes there but still live at my normal school. My reasoning behind this is that my friends at home flat out suck. They are not good people and I don't want to be surrounded by them. I would like to cut them out of my life because I feel like they are bad people and bring me down. At my college I have my girlfriend of two years who fully supports me and wants me to succeed as well as one other really good friend who is also in the mess I am in as we got in trouble together. But we have both learned our lessons and want to make the most of life and continue on to get our degrees and enter the world as great people and succeed. 

I want my parents to be okay with this plan, but I am not sure how to present it to them so they are on board. A side note is that my dad pays for my college, so ultimately it will be his decision what I do. But I think that taking 9 credits or so online while working would be a good medium where my graduation is not completely derailed and I can also get a job for 20-25 hours a week and work towards paying him back for the costs I'm incurring. Any advice would be very welcomed and I don't want this suspension to ruin the rest of my college career as I want to succeed; more now than ever because this situation has really put my head on straight, which I don't think it was before. I'm 20 and a sophomore. 

Thank You.",14Mar2017,1

Theyre amazing people, and genuine to the core...i just dont know if they are doin this because they know we cant afford it right now... or if theyre ok with parting with so much money.

I dont necessarily feel belittled by their actions. But as the guy in the relationship, you always want to be the bread winner and right now I'm not, and they know that.

61,"A bit of backstory of my problem. It's a long read so im sorry.


So a long time ago back in August I developed feelings for this girl I met through some friends (let's call her Anna) but ultimately gave up because she had a boyfriend at the time
A bit later Annas roommate told me she wasn't going to make it to our hangout because she was sad for some reason
I message her out of curiosity and pity to see what's up and Anna just vents to me that her roommate isn't paying rent, her boyfriend is being a manipulative fuck and school isn't going well. So I listen to her and we talk for a while and everything is going well.

We start to get closer and start to learn about eachother a lot more and me being oblivious, she started to get feelings for me as well. So late night at 2am she messages me saying her and her boyfriend had a fight and they are now broken up (we will call him Chad). Chad was a cunt. He is your stereotypical emo boy who works at Spencer's and spends no time with Anna when they were together but gets pissy if other people do. Chad kept her up because he was crying about the whole breakup. They were living together at this point.

After that her life went to total hell. He was starting fights and constantly trying to get in her pants and back together with her. But she wasn't having any of it, she always pushed him away and left the house whenever she could to get away. 

Fast forward a month later 
Me and her are really close, so me and my stoner friend walk to her work as she is finishing her final shift before she quit. She gave me her car keys and me and my buddy went to her car. She locked up the place and proceeded to drive me and my buddy home. She dropped him off first and drove halfway across the city to drop me off at my place. 
We stop in a parking lot and she thanks me for coming and seeing her and so we hugged and that's when we first kissed.

Flash forward a bit later 
She's still living with her ex because she had nowhere to go. Chad is still being a cunt. Then she had gotten a new roommate. I asked her out a month later and she ofc said yes and it was a very happy moment but I feared it was too early but didn't care because she was someone I deeply cared for. Chad started the occasional fight and he brought strange girls home but forbade her from having any guy friends stay the night. 

My first introduction to chad was when I was totally drunk. I didn't care much about him. but when he walked in my buzz disappeared and it was like the morning after, it was just a giant headache. He stared at me a ton and gave me dirty looks but I didn't really care and kept drinking with her and her roommate. Me, Anna and her roommate went to the roommates bedroom to get away from chad but he followed us anyways not knowing that we didn't want him there so he left 20 minutes later and stayed out for the night.

A bit later in the month I get a text from Anna
(Chad doesn't know we are together) and tells Anna that I am not allowed over anymore because he fears that I will kick the shit out of Anna and take Chad's stuff. (Which is weird because I am in police studies in college) but I didn't care but I worried for Anna in that environment so I talked to one of my profs and he told me that Anna needed to go. 

I convinced Anna to talk to her mom and she agreed to let Anna move in with her. Anna usually house Sat for her mom and so she would have he house to herself and so I spend the night there and lost my virginity to her there as well. So at this point the honeymoon phase has ended and it went downhill.

Anna told chad that we went on a date and chad got extremely jealous. He then sent me a paragraph about how to take care of her and such. Long story short I told him that I don't need his opinion and on exchange for being let back into the apartment I wouldn't make any moves on Anna. Which I didn't really care. I was happy just being with her and making sure that she was safe and such.

 Fast forward to literally a day before she moved out. We both thought chad was at work so we could have some time alone so we could pack and do whatever but that was not the case. I kissed her in the apartment hallway and chad seen it. He then proceeded to tell me to leave. Me knowing the law fought back saying that Anna was on the lease too so she has a say in who stays. He stomped away and got really pissy, so I left for class and I was going to be back later until I got a text saying that the packing was finished so I was good with that. I didn't have to see chad at all.

Later that night chad came home from work completely hammered and was looking for me in the house because he wanted to kick my ass. I laughed at his attempt and went to sleep but during my sleep he kept telling at her to stay but she wouldn't have it. She fought back for once and he left crying once more.

I called a U-Haul and got her shit together and we brought it over. She was really thankful and gave me so much appreciation. Chad was in the apartment sulking in the corner. During this time because he couldn't do anything. 

For the next week it was good. No chad means that everything can start to get better?

As Donald Trump would say.

Wrong

She was still in contact with chad. Because apparently chad owed Anna money for some bills. Knowing what the best options would be I told her to cut her losses and block him immediately. But she didn't listen and still waited. So it was a constant thing that he would message her asking for her back and she still thought that she would get money. It was a sad cycle that I just accepted for now. 

It was December at this point and shit seemed strange. I was stressed due to school assignments and all I looked forward to was seeing Anna at around Christmas after my exams. Though when I talked about presents and such she didn't really like me spending money on her. So I told her that she could draw me something. She didn't like that at all and started to go silent. 

For the week we barely talked.

I told her that I couldn't handle not talking to you and she just sat there and starting ghosting me. Seeing my messages and not caring. Anna has been known to do this and so my friend said to just leave her alone and she will start to talk to you again. 

I am riddled with insecurities but the one thing that stuck out the most was the whole not talking part.  I felt like shit constantly and I couldn't relax at all during the week. I then started to message anna out of desperation saying that I can't not message you. She was one of my only supports at the time so it was crucial that I atleast talked to her for an hour before my shittiest went away. But I kept getting ignored. 

I didn't see her for Christmas. 
On December 27th she broke up with me.

Saying that we needed time away from eachother and we needed time to relax. 

I was a mess.

Flash forward to the beginning of January.

It was rough, I just lost my job and I was just miserable all of the time.

I get a message from Anna's old roommate. We start talking and seeing how we both are. She was working at the movie theater near her apartment and she told me that Anna was seeing chad again. 

Without any thought I was livid. 
I am an easy going person but this is the maddest I have been in 6 years. 

I messaged Anna about it being like

You are really seeing chad again? 
After everything​ I did for you?

I just blew up.

To many emotions to count. 

She blocked me soon after.

I felt happy that I didn't want to get her back for being this petty.

A couple hours later I get a call from the old roommate. She is completely drunk and told me that she was jealous of mine and Anna's relationship and was trying to ruin us for a long time.

Out of sheer rage I blocked her and tried to text Anna saying that it was all a mistake and that her old roommate gave me misinformation. 

But it was too late.

The final thing I said to her was 

I'll fix this I swear it. 

Fast forward to now.

I have a new job and I'm in Counseling.
I'm a wreck 
I still miss her and any attempt to message her ends up with me not sending any message

I need help on either do I try to communicate with Anna again or do I just move on.

 If I do try to communicate how should I get in doing that.

If not how do I finally get over this chick.",14Mar2017,1

64,"I met my boyfriend online, reddit actually. And I really do love him. However, hes from Australia and I'm from America. I have never traveled much, however I now find myself living in Aus with him for the last 9 months. Hes immature, and has ADD so its difficult for me at times to be with him, but we have been together for almost 3 years now and i cant imagine a life without him. The main strain is his family. My family is very close and tell each other everything and everyone is so easy to talk to. Whereas his family is very moody and its like walking on eggshells around all of them. The point of that comparison is that I am very family driven.  


I don't know if i should stay or not. I'm on a visitors-type visa that only good for a year (so a few more months.) and the other visa I'm needing to get will cost us 10,500 AUS dollars. I do like it where I live, but I dont LOVE it. Its very country, and convenient and I'm having the hardest time making friends because of it. I've noticed my mood swings getting worse and I'm about 80% sure its because of the stress of this situation.


Something else I feel I should mention is the fact that his parent took out a significant loan to build us a small trailer type thing on the property because there is no where nearby that we could rent a house. This makes me feel a bit stuck and like I owe them something but they would have eventually had to build something due to my boyfriend getting older. They've also brought a small 10,000 $ car for me to drive however everyone has agreed its more of a community car since everyone in the household uses it. These are things I know they can sell and get money back on so I'm still a bit unsure about this part of my feelings. 


My boyfriends life is dedicated to the family business and I hate it because its kind of taken the opportunity of him living in America with me away. My grandma died while I was over here and its kind of opened my eyes up to the cons of living here. I wasn't very close with her yet it hurt me knowing I wasn't there to say goodbye. I dont want to know what it feels like when someone close to me dies. Another thing I dont want is to visit home once every year or 2 and my family not knowing me and vice versa. 


My family is on the high end of the lower class so I know they'll never be able to afford to come and see me. (Plane tickets vary but average price is about 2,000 and thats buying 6 months in advanced) That hurts as well. I left home right after high-school graduation basically, so yea I'm only 19 trying to figure out where to go now and its so hard to choose between my boyfriend and my family. 


I'm really just kind of venting at this point because I have no one to talk to about this that wont be biased. And its easier to type will crying hysterically than talking while doing so lol. I hope you guys can give me some advice on anything that you can. I don't know if I should go through with the visa because I do know that it will put me through a very large financial strain and I'm afraid I won't want to stay here after I spend all of the money and put in all the effort.

69,"So I have this coworker that keeps trying to flirt with me and I find it annoying. I don't know how to tell her it's unappreciated because she appears to be a sensitive person that would take it hard, especially from a guy she likes. She told me to my face that she liked me, and I was like ""cool, thanks,"" because I couldn't think of a nice way to say ""I don't like you back."" Overall she's a nice person and I respected her for having the courage to tell me, but then she kept on trying even after I didn't say it back, or give any indication at all that I liked her back.

I had hoped that my lack of response to her attempts at flirting would help her to get the hint that the feelings are not mutual and get her to stop, but they don't. I am writing this because it appears to have gotten worse, or maybe it's just gone on long enough that she's done stuff that definitely shows a lack of boundaries.

She keeps walking up to me and touching me, and the worst is when I can't see it coming. She doesn't do it very often, and it's usually tickling or a tap or something and no groping or anything sexual (at least nothing I can really interpret that way). I tend to just walk away as I find the possibility of upsetting her by telling her to stop worse than simply not saying anything. However, that always occurred in the kitchen where guests couldn't see us. A couple days ago, she walked up behind me and tickled me *while I was carrying drinks to my section,* and then it just hit me that this is not okay. This is not just some friendly crush. This is someone not reading my responses to their behavior and not having respect for not only my boundaries, but the boundaries of the people I am serving.

All I said was, ""uh... I could have dropped the drinks..."" which I find to have been a weak response.

Rant aside, what do I do? She's well-liked where I work, and I'm not exactly bottom of the barrel, but I don't want to cause drama. But I definitely want her to stop trying to flirt with me. How do I get her to realize how uncomfortable she is making me without making her upset?",14Mar2017,2
71,"Hi, all. Creating a throwaway for this one. Let me give some context for the situation.

I am in my early twenties, and though my mother is only in her early sixties, she is not in good health. She smokes heavily, works in a heavy smoking environment, spends long hours on her feet, struggles to breathe walking around the house, does not eat healthy, and gets generally no form of exercise minus walking around at work. She's taken care of other people since she was a kid, and as a result has no savings or plans for retirement.

Her mother was deceased by my mother's age. I am constantly terrified of losing her. I stress out postponing dinner dates with her in fear of something happening to her. I think about her dying daily, and often cry about it. I am the youngest child, and my older siblings are in no way, shape, or form half as organized or disciplined as I am, so I know when she passes, all of the arrangements will be on me. My mom has openly told me she doesn't expect to be around to see my children. I am terrified of losing my mother, I know it happens to everyone but as a kid I never worried about it happening to me at such a young age. My dad is in his late fifties and just recently said goodbye to his last remaining parent. I would be so thankful if my mom would live until I was in my fifties, but I understand that's just not the reality.

To the point, my mom didn't get her first tattoo until she was in her forties. Now, she's got a few, all things she likes and has been interested in. She's half-way mentioned, with no real seriousness, that it'd be cool for us to get matching mother-daughter tattoos. I have no tattoos and even though I enjoy them on other people, I have no interest in having any of my own - I'm too indecisive and constantly changing to ever lock in on a design that I'd like on my body forever. I partially fear that if I don't take advantage of this that when she passes, I will regret it very much. I've also considered that perhaps a matching tattoo would help ease my mind about the entire idea of her dying, knowing I always would have a piece of her with me.

Sorry if this seems silly, it's just been weighing on my mind pretty heavy and I'm not sure what to do. I don't really want a tattoo, but I think I might enjoy having that piece of my mom with me forever, and I think it would make her happy.",14Mar2017,2

I'm having trouble with friends and family. Everyone seems to fuck with me making jokes and what not and most of the time I really don't care I just let it roll of my back and laugh it off. Then some days someone starts on me and I feel like collecting teeth but I don't want to have to resort to dealing with people in that way. I've told people before things like ""hey not today"" however i feel like anything I said went through one ear and out the other. The owner of a hobby shop me and my friends visit once told me to my face that I have that ""Fuck with that guy kind of look"". Whatever that means. The reason deep down that I'm even writing this is that I have two buddies that have gone to great lengths to help me but they mess with me everyday. They troll a lot of people too, one of them just rubs me the wrong way a bit more because he acts like nothing anyone says gets to him, tries too hard to be the Alpha male anywhere.

She recently moved 2 a different city 2 hours away and she asked if I was going to prom. Long story short she said that if I decide to go then she'll come with me. But since she is 2 hours away she is going to need a ride here to my city. She said she'd ask her mom and that's where I need help. I really like this girl and it would mean everything to go with her it's just that I don't want to keep sounding pushy and asking about prom all the time. I mean snapchat obviously isn't the best way as most people just open them. If I text her, how would I respond? Prom is still far away it's in May but you know it's the only thing I'm looking forward to and again just over thinking about it. Any help would be appreciated!

81,"I've been having problems with my mother at the moment as she has been quite volatile lately.  I'm 18 and currently still living at home as I cannot afford to move out yet but I am saving up. Anyways, I have a boyfriend who I have been dating for about 9 months now. Up until 2 weeks ago, she loved him and only had kind things to say about him. 2 weeks ago, my mom called me up and starting swearing at me down the phone because I didn't answer her text promptly (I was at church with my boyfriend) and this wasn't the first time this has happened (whenever I'm with him, she incessantly texts/calls me). He went to talk to her that night and asked her if she had a problem with him which she denied, and she was most affronted by that. 

Long story short after that she said terrible things to me such as telling me that she wishes she never had me, that she wants me to get the fuck out of her house, never see me again and talked non stop shit about my boyfriend. It's quite bizarre as I obey her rules, do all my chores, and am respectful of her. She ended up apologizing for the things she said but now she's resumed the same behavior, except it's more directed towards my boyfriend now. She insults his family members who she has never met saying that they are nutjob Catholics. Tells me I'm too pretty for him, that she hates him, and that she'll throw me out of the house if I go out of town with him for a couple days. 

A little background informatiom about her: she is in an unhappy marriage and is separated from her husband, doesn't have a job, spends all day on the couch watching shows, and her dogs are the only thing that bring her any joy. I just want her to be happy and I love my mom but I don't think it's right that she's inflicting her misery on me. ",14Mar2017,1
82,"The past 2 years i've taken public transport to get to my college, it's about 20ish miles from home, about a 25 min drive, but an hour or an hr and a half on public transport. I've only been driving my car to the college since last semester (around september), and on the days i worked.

I crashed my last car on the freeway going to class last semester. There was a lot of traffic and i made a terrible mistake. Since then i wasn't comfortable driving, i was depressed for a while, and i became apprehensive when driving. Driving became more stressful and wasn't fun. I spoke to a counselor and she helped me realize that the car meant a lot for me because it was in my family for years, and that relieved some of the stress of driving.

My parents don't like the idea of me taking the car there without needing to. There are times when i am late to class and public transport wouldn't cut it, but that hasn't been the case since last month. Whenever i would take the car there (whether necessity or just for kicks) i took the streets which i found safe as to avoid freeway traffic, but it also took about 45 mins to get to class. Lately i've been taking the freeway because i feel more comfortable and because driving on it has finally been  fun again after my accident. When i know the freeway's at its busiest (8am and 5pm) i take the streets to school, otherwise i either take the freeway or a mix of both.

Taking PT on the days i work is a huge hassle. The timing of the bus and/or subway is critical, if i miss one thing then i'm late and behind by a lot. Last semester i worked 5 or 6 days a week, so i practically took the car everyday to avoid being late. This semester i only work 4 days 2 of them being on schooldays. However i've been taking the car 5 times i week: 2 just for work, once for intramural sports at my college, and 2 just for kicks and convenience. Those 2 days i take the car so i have all my workout clothes stored until that workout class. It's really convenient for me, i have a 2 hr break between 2 of my classes, so i have homework and books from other classes in my car (again, it would take at least an hour there and back to my car if i took PT).

I can't justify this to them if i'm honest, i know they care so much about me which is why they want me to take public transport. I can't even justify it for myself. The only thing that is justifiable in our eyes is taking it on the days i work, but other times it's just ridiculous. I feel bad about lying, but not when i'm reprimanded for taking the car.

My mom found out i took the car there (and she kind of knows it still happens), she was irritated. My dad found out (i guess from the odometer of my car), he was mad but ended up telling me to be safe on my way there. Today again he asked me if i was taking the car all the way there and i lied or else he'd be mad.

EDIT: i'm very used to lying, i've gotten good at it. I've also been taking the car when i go out with friends",14Mar2017,1
83,"I think it's their kids, I don't get this with other people's kids.  But their kids are always sick or injured in some way.  His wife is super controlling and never wants to make adjustments that are against her grain, even if it's for the better (he's openminded but in the relationship she trumps him so it makes no difference).  I've been friends with him since elementary but as soon as they started dating, and ever since, if I want to see him, it's a package deal.  I bring this up for two reasons:

- it bothers me that his kids are always seeing the doctor or hospitalized for some nonsense, it's to the point that even medical staff have made harsh comments about it to his wife who then becomes livid

- I want to keep in touch with him, but my life keeps getting busier and busier, there is no way I can afford to keep getting sick because of something they aren't doing right (really his wife because again so controlling he can't even suggest or try to intervene without her threatening divorce)

From what I can tell, it's a nutrition and general health care thing.  She doesn't work, but doesn't clean much.  They're always eating fast food.  The kids basically run their routine (youngest is 3 oldest is 8) so a lot of baths/toothbrushings/handwashings/bedtimes are skipped.  She has plain given up on doing laundry because in her own words ""They get it dirty again so fast.""  I've smelled their youngest walking around with a dirty diaper and crying about it for hours without either of them doing anything.

They aren't uneducated so none of this makes sense to me.  I want to say something but feel like no matter what it'll be blown out of proportion, again they aren't idiots, it's like they regret having kids and are just giving up and hoping the upkeep of less intelligent life they created magically takes care of itself.  I know that is extremely judgmental but nothing else makes sense.  Again even medical staff have said things to them at this point but nothing sticks.  The alternative is finding a way to slowly distance myself because at this point I am getting close to just blurting something, and I can't take being sick all the time from basic stuff not being done (when I myself try very hard to maintain health so I'm not infecting others from negligence), but I've been his friend so long I have a hard time making the call to just fade out.

Thoughts?  I don't want to lose someone I've known for a long time because I know I can't get similar relationships now that I'm older, but I know if I just leave as it is eventually I'm going to say something honest and then his wife will take it as a burned bridge.  What do I do?

Please does anyone have anything?  I think a lot of the guilt is knowing what the kids will have to continue to live with if I leave.  If it was just my friend and his wife I could probably accept just leaving but I got attached to their kids like they're my own except I can't say or do much of anything because they aren't my own.  It's the bonding thing.  Their kids latch on to me.  Even his wife has commented they like me way more than most.  They're always upset when I leave.  Maybe it's just because on some instinctual level they see me and know I'm healthy and could help them feel better because I care.  But again what can I do?  People don't like being told they're doing wrong by their kids even when it's obvious stuff like this.  What can I do?  That is a serious question.  What can I do but walk away and try to forget about knowing kids who are going to grow up stunted because parents that should know better are basically giving up, just waiting to become a bigger issue down the line because maybe no one but parents can really do anything and they aren't anymore???",14Mar2017,1

93,"Ok so here's how it goes: I'm paying to live in a basement suite, with a family above me. They have two daughters. Now I have grown to love these girls like sisters. So you can imagine my shock when I began noticing stuff of mine going missing. I don't have a lock on my door or a separate entrance. 

I took notice when my favourite pair of jeans went missing. A pair of distinctively ripped jeans that I would notice from a mile away. I had been missing them for a month, and I had asked the parents if they had seen them in their daughters' laundry at all. Then, her mom found one of my favourite sweaters on her floor. I had not given her permission to borrow it. 

Fast forward to tonight. I went upstairs to ask my landlords something, and I walked past one of the girls' open doors. There, sitting on her bed, were my jeans. I asked her parents if I could talk to her about getting them back, and apparently the girl had been telling them they belonged to her friend. So I asked her a few questions about them. My jeans are a size 26 while her friend is a size 24. The tag had been cut out of them, so I asked if I could try them on. 

They fit me like a glove. If they had been a size 24, I would have not been able to do them up. She then says to me ""well, go ahead and take them, but they belong to my friend."" Which leads me to believe that they are mine. If they belonged to her friend, there's no way in holy hell that she would let me take them. 

So now that I have them back, what do I do? Let the situation go or talk to her? I'm just disappointed that she lied to me more than anything else.",14Mar2017,1
94,"I apologize if I'm posting this in the wrong subreddit, my problem is complex.

Also, wall of text ;)

I'm a 22 year-old female, currently an international student in BC, Canada. As a result of fear of my parents, my gullibility, my lack of spine and their own mindsets, I'm stuck in a foreign language major. My parents won't let me change my major or add any other major that I actually care about. They say English would be too easy for me (which I say is bs) and they have no money for a second major (which, I guess, is fair, but only makes my life harder).

I don't want to be a translator or part of academia. I have no money of my own and am financially dependent on my parents. I'm not doing too hot studying-wise, because I'm depressed, anxious, angry and done with the whole situation. I've been studying 95% of my whole life (straight As at school) trying to earn my mother's love (spoiler: didn't work) and the burnout, as well as all the resentment and the general misery, broke me. A younger depressed me didn't really know what kind of person she was. Scared of losing her parents' financial support, she agreed to whatever her mother suggested and wouldn't even imagine what she would eventually find herself capable of being passionate about.

After dabbling in astrology, Tarot and wasting a bunch more years on depression, I'm a more self-aware person now. I don't want to continue my foreign language major. I know society frowns at people without a bachelor's or any other kind of degree, but I'd rather not go insane for a relatively useless (especially for my purposes of not being a translator or part of the academia) major. What I do find wise and healthier is getting a job and making money, so I'm not financially dependent on my parents anymore. Once I will have worked and lived as myself for a while, I will consider going back to higher education, with the benefit of being able to choose what I want to study and seeing what I can work with financially.

There are three issues here, however.

First and foremost, I'm on a study visa right now. Staying in Canada would mean getting a work permit, which is a process neither I nor my parents know anything about. So, I'd need help and advice from the Internet and people around me, my parents can't help me here.

Secondly, the only good thing my parents can offer me is money, and even that is temporary and definitely not set in stone. Otherwise, they only make my life worse. If I go back to my hometown, they'd give me the whole negative 'I told you', 'you useless failure' and the rest of the downer, doomsaying, emotionally abusive dealio. They might throw me out and disown me.

In addition to that, if I go back to my hometown, I'll be in a quite stale environment in which I won't be able to progress as much and as successfully as in Canada. In other words, Canada is much cooler and better in terms of opportunities than where I'm from.

So, tl,dr: got stuck in a Night In the Woods (video game) scenario, only without the murder cult deal and parents aren't as helpful, and I'm not a delinquent. And no band. Should've gone to a trade school.

Please, give me advice and feedback on my situation, how I'm handling it so far and enlighten me on options I might be missing! I'd also love to hear similar stories and how they got resolved.

I have an employer who I've worked with for a year now. She's worked for this company for 10 years and she has this natural sarcastic personality and masks a lot of her feelings. I've realized there are times she wants to break down, but she tries to set an example for all of us by being strong. She's very introverted and is the no talk, wants to get the job done kind of person. 

Surprisingly, I've grown quite close with her. We haven't gone out or anything outside of work, but she's let me into her personal life a bit by telling me stories about her and what not. I'm assuming that's her way of getting close to someone. Anyway, recently she found out her sibling and her nephews passed away from an accident. They were all very young. In addition, she discovered her boyfriend cheated on her for the second time. She found out the same day her sibling and nephews died. 

She's gone through a lot. I hate knowing that she crying at the back. She's the kind of person who doesn't admit that she needs someone to hold her through hard times. I want to be there for her, but I know it's not appropriate to forcefully be there for her when she's not use to that kind of affection other than her family and boyfriend. Her birthday is around the corner and it kills me inside to see her like this.

Is there a way I can help her without directly forcing her to let me help her. I know people have their boundaries. She's not an affectionate person. She's such a hard worker -- I want my co-workers and I to at least do something for her without her feeling cushioned or uncomfortable.

Now, at the age of 18, my biological father's wife, or my stepmother, contacted me over Facebook, and out of curiosity, I responded. She sent me pictures of me when I was young and with my father. She told me about how my mother had cut off connection with him, after she decided to engage with my current father. My biological father had tried to gain custody, but as I stated above, my current parents wanted no contact with my biological father, and the lawyers made that clear I guess.

The thing is, I am still strong in faith, I read the Quran daily, and I pray daily as well without being forced to do so.

But i'm just not comfortable doing it anymore. Also worth noting, in my experience, this kid doesn't take no for an answer.

We're going to a sports game tomorrow and he wants me to buy him alcohol before the game so he can down a few before the game, and probably wants me to buy him drinks during the game too.

114,"I seem to have been born without that gene that makes you think babies are cute. I absolutely adore small fuzzy animals, and I even find many inanimate objects cute, but I've never found a cute human baby. At best I find them tolerable, at worst I find them irritating and disgusting. Same goes for children -- I do find some kids (older than 4) cute, but they mostly just get on my nerves. 

Also, I'm an artist with a day job to pay the bills, so I treasure every free moment I have to make art. With a kid, I'm worried I would lose what little time and energy I have.
 
When my wife and I got married a few years ago, we talked a lot about the issue, and I made it clear I might never want kids. Her dream is to have grandchildren, but she decided we should get married even if it means she can never fulfill that dream.

Now my wife is 29 and I'm 27, and although she hasn't been pressuring me, I know that she really wants children. I love her and don't want her to reach old age without fulfilling her dream of having a kid. I also suspect that the older I get, the more I will want to have kids. And although I've read conflicting evidence on the subject, general consensus seems to be that fertility chances start to drop after 30, so I wonder if we should start planning for kids now rather than later.

We don't live near any relatives to help us care for a kid, so one of us would probably have to quit their job or at least go part-time. We would have to be more frugal, but we could handle it... I'm mostly just worried that the kid would take me away from my friends, artistic activities, and other hobbies.

To summarize, I don't like kids, and I'm worried having a baby would screw up my comfortable lifestyle. On the other hand, I love my wife and want her to be happy, and I'm worried that the longer we wait, the harder it will be. I feel like my reasons for not wanting a kid are pretty selfish, so sometimes I wonder if I should just give it a chance. What do you think?",14Mar2017,3

116,"Hi, I'm a 18 year old college freshman attending one of the UC schools in California. I have been struggling the past two quarters or so with my major, Pharmaceutical Sciences. I originally loved science when I came into school in 2016, but I have slowly grown to hate the subjects because I just simply cant understand the material. I don't want to pay for tutoring, and in retrospect I hate people as well, so I have no choice but to study on my own for the most part. My life has been going to shit the past few months. I love being here, but these subjects are killing me. I was unable to pass the 1st bio class I took for my fall quarter, and barely able to pass my chem class. Right now I am placed on academic probation and I need to acheive a quarterly and cummulative GPA of a 2.0 to atleast have a chance of staying. For my first quarter, I thought of it as an adjustment period, as I needed a job as well(because I need to survive). So, I thought in January 2017 ""Oh, most people don't do so well there 1st quarter, so I'll be fine."". Nope, literally about to receive perhaps the same exact grade for my chem class as for my bio, and my other classes are doing fine, but they're not enough to balance out my gpa to my requirements. I have been doing everything for what my contract asks so hopefully when I make my appeal to stay at the university, I think I have to chance to survive. My job, mental attitude, and overall drive, is being lost. This quarter I wanted to go to the gym every week at least 3 times, but haven't been in close to a month mainly because of my life being drained right now. What time I don't spend working, studying, in class,eating, or sleeping, I don't have the energy anymore to do anything else. I have missed two days of work in the past week or so because I just haven't been able to wake up for my shifts (I am an extremely heavy sleeper, so my alarm is practically useless for me). I am trying to switch my majors, but I need to make it through this quarter first before I am able to do so, and even then, I don't think I meet the basic requirements for it. I'm talking to counselors (both academic and clinical) because my mental state is far from okay. I've been having depression affect my sensibility as well, due to a midterm for chem that I study my balls off for and receive one of the lowest grades in the class. I don't know what to do. Even my parents, people who are always going to be there for me, are thinking that I am just a bad student. I've had two mental breakdowns (not like extreme cases but more of screaming for about half an hour while crying) in the past two weeks. I'm barely eating at the moment, and I am losing drive right now and becoming emotionally and mentally drained. I've been put in a rut and I can't seem to find a way.

118,"When I was ten my father cheated and left my mother, younger sister, and I. My sister and I haven't heard a single word from him since recently. His wife, mother, father, and sister have died. He has retired. I think he is lonely and regretting that he has no one now. 

The thing is, he caused a lot of pain. I had to grow up fast because of him. Even when he was around he wasn't much of a father. He has now written a letter (sent through my mother to give to my sister and I) explaining how sorry he is, recalling memories (that are barely true), and asking for forgiveness. He even has the gall to mention that I had some part in stopping communication with him, a ten year old. 

I don't know what to do. I don't see him as a father. I don't hate him because I am not that type of person. He is basically a stranger to me, a stranger that had added to the difficulties in my life.

earlier today my wife and i were in bed and i was horny so like every other time before, i tried geeting her in the mood. She said we didnt have the time. So i thought something along the lines of "" be a man, take control"" she has told me that turned her on before. So i suprised her and went down on her. At first she said my name and then said no. I thought she meant no as in we dont have time as she earlier stated, sh didnt push me off or anything. So i kept licking her for a bit and she became receptive but not like ""omg your blowing my mind"" more like ""were married so ok lets get through this"". She has been that way before so nothing seemed amis. I got on top because that is what she likes and i start kissing her. She wouldnt kiss me, and she never has done that before so i stoped. Like pulled out of her and looked her in the eye and asked what was wrong. She told me to finish so one of us could enjoy it, so i did.

Then after she got up and walked away and shut down. I knew it had something to do with the sex and i thought, ""geeze i cant do anything for my wife at all"". But when i finally got her to talk about it she told me that her no meant ""get the fuck off of me"" so i asked her why she didnt say anything when i asked. She said that id already started so i might as well finish. I felt like complete shit at this point and was trying to talk to her and she told me how she had been raped before and i gave her something like a flashback.

I love my wife with everything i have. This broke my heart, not only what happened to her before but for what i done as well. After seeing my guilt and remorse she told me that it wasnt me, that i didnt rape her but i know she loves me and if the shoe was on the other foot id say the same no matter what because i love her. I have a super high sex drive (i want it every day sometimes multiple times) and she dosent she almost never starts sexy times.

I want to seek medicine or therapy to supress my libido and testosterone but she dosent want me to because she blames herself for our sexdrive difference.

My dream is to build a little eco-resort on it or to do something where I can earn a decent living from it. My issues are (and the reason I would like a bit of constructive advice):

- I live in Australia, so currently distance is a problem
- I have no money. We are a single income family struggling to make ends meet (wife and 2 kids) so my earnings are used to pretty much survive on. This also makes travelling to Fiji difficult.
- I have about $17,000 of debts I need to pay off, after which I would probably be in a better position to actually travel, but due to issue no. 2, the debt is taking a (very) long time to pay off.

134,"Background: 

I've done a year of Engineering. I tell myself that it wasn't that difficult and that I only failed out of it because I didn't study at all and I partied too often. I didn't get back into it as I thought going straight into the workplace would be better since I don't enjoy studying too much anyway. 

Few years down the road, I need to get back into school and get a bachelors for a career progression. I plan on taking school part-time.

I require a specific degree for a specific position within my job (military). I have narrowed down to possibly taking either business admin or computer science. 

I'm considering business admin because I was told that it was an easy program. I was also always told that I'm a people's person and that I would excel in business or social work. I'm not opposed to going into this program as it is a broader degree and hoping maybe one day, out of the military, I can land a management job pretty easily. 

I'm considering Computer Science because I love applied science. While I never excelled in math or physics all my life and I did drop out of Engineering, I loved the program. I enjoyed my mathematics and physics classes. The workload worries me but because I am part-time, I am thinking I can possibly scrap by with fewer course load per semester...However, I'm also thinking that no one is ever going to hire me, if I ever leave the military, because I scraped by and didn't excel on it. 

As you can see, I'm definitely considering working in the civilian sector in case I get released from the military. Which is better for employment opportunities? 

Which program do I take?? 



TL;DR: Love applied science but I suck at it. Never ever thought to take business but I heard it was easy. Which one? ",14Mar2017,1

136,"Hello guys. 

I'm currently on my road of finding passion and what I might love and the thing that I'm currently engaged in is writing a academic paper for psychology - so this can test many subjects of my interest at once (writing, psychology, academics...).

I'm halfway through the work and project and this things works great because I'm already finding out a lot of things about myself - what I truly like and don't like, what I'm good at, what I'm bad at.

The problem is tough that I can already see that this thing may not be for me and I already see many things in front of me and besides my engaged work that now look even more attractive before I started this whole psychology thing...

Now the question that I'm asking is - should I just grind through and finish my current project and only after that move on to the next one or should I let go of my current psychology project, save a lot of time and already hop on to that glowing pursuit and profession that I know I might love for death.

I know intuitively that I should finish, but I'm still thinking that the whole point of my psychology work was to discover myself further - I already did that but the problem is not at the end but in the middle of my work and now I have ended up with this unfinished work, new discovery and from that - a lust for next, very potential endeavour with which I'm very sure about it may be my final passion.

I signed out some equipment under my commander's instructions (I'm in the military) and passed them to whoever needed to use them. 

That person misplaced those equipment, which if not found, I would have to pay for them - the military doesn't care if you didn't use the equipment, they only care about the person who signed the equipment out as that person is deemed responsible by the Army's standards. 

That being said, I would like to clarify that this was my first time signing anything out and I didn't know better. 

Ultimately, my question is:
Should I be confronting and trying to make the person who actually lost the equipment pay? This person happens to be a friend and a coworker I see on a regular basis.

I start happy, but something always seems to pop up within a few hours to throw me off. It's almost a relief to feel sad again and not have to pretend to be happy.

when my sister was about 9 our mother got a better Job tat would pay more but it would make her quitting time to be about 11:00 PM and not to mention the extra road time it would to actually reach home

so i was given the responsibility of talking care of her


I would sleep in same bed as her comforting her and telling her no monsters existed and stuff like that then when she fell asleep i would go back to my room  sometime she would just come to my room all on her own and lay there.


this continued till she was about 10 years old and i was 14 and i finally noticed how weird it started to become and told her that i couldn't to this anymore then she started to cry saying i didn't care for her and locked herself in room i tried to get her out for a full hour and apologized finally she came out and the sleeping in the same bed continued 

finally when she was 12 years old i convinced her to sleep in her room. but she would still occasionally come to my room and lay there with me while i was asleep.

that brings us to right now where our situation is worse than it has ever been

150,"Hi guys! I'm at my wits end. I live on the 1st floor of an appartment building with 18 flats. For a few months now, I hear a buzzing sound in my bedroom and sometimes also in other rooms in my flat (but only those next to my bedroom). The sound is especially noticable in (but not limited to) the quiet hours, mostly at night and early morning, when the other residents settle down and traffic is less. Sometimes I can also feel my bed vibrate slightly. I think that the noise comes mostly from one wall, but it is hard to tell. In order to find the source I have disconnected my appartment's power - no change. Also, I asked other people, if they can hear it. The good news: They can, so I'm not going crazy (yay!). The people living right next to me are never home, so I could not ask them yet, but the sound is also audible in the flats below and above mine, though much less noticable (but I checked in the afternoon, so maybe other sounds made it less noticable?). Neither of them got new electronics recently.
The house is built of concrete and my bedroom shares a wall with the elevator shaft and what I think is my neighbours living room. The internet says that I either have tinnitus (no, other people hear it, too) or a defective heating system (heat is not on at the moment and we use district heating with water in our building). Other suggestions where ""esoterical"" (bad cellphones+wifi!).

The sound is there most of the time, with only short breaks of maybe a few seconds. To me it sounds like the noise a power supply makes. I tried recording it with my cellphone in order to know the exact frequency, but the noise is too low. I would guess 50 Hz.

I have a few ideas where the sound could maybe come from:
- my neighbors that are never home have a fridge/tv/electronic or kitchen device/air dehumidifier/etc. that is up against our shared wall
-the elevator has some kind of problem

Did any of you have a similar problem? How did you fix it? I have already contacted the landlord and my neighbours but since I'm going crazy, do you have any ideas where this could come from? Maybe you have some ideas on what to check out with my landlord (he is coming over for a listening appointment next week - hopefully he can help!)

I'm pretty much the type of dude now who would rather just smoke some ganj with his  buddies and watch a movie or get food or whatever. I lift and workout religiously and i feel that my resistance from drinking has overall helped me with that as a whole. The problem is that i'm still friends with the same people who partied with me before i made that change in my life, and they're always asking me to drink with them and get ""blacked out"" with them. I know that they must have noticed my absence of drinking because it's been like 7 months since this has started. Most of my friends just think that i'm drifting away from them, but the truth is i simply just don't want to drink and i hate being pressured into it. I know that if i go out to a party i'll be asked to drink, and if i reject i'll get called a bitch or a pussy or whatever and i just don't want to go through that every singe time i go out. i just don't enjoy drinking like i used to, i don't think it's that hard to believe. and why would i partake in something that i don't enjoy doing? how do i get my friends to stop pressuring me into drinking, and just accept that i don't enjoy it as much anymore without sounding like a bitch? I just want to be left alone on this topic.",14Mar2017,8
161,"So picked up this extremely shy girl a few months ago and I kid you not when I say she is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. She's a pale redhead who is shy and loves video games and anime. Problem is, she's shy girl who loves videogames and anime -_-

Apparintly, I was the first and only guy to show interest in her (according to her) and she doesn't talk much. we exchanged numbers and I texted her later that day and the 2 days after but she didn't responde. So I moved on

However now for some reason after 4 months, I am suddenly attractrd to her again... I really want her to give me a chance and god she is just so f'n beautiful! Should I text her again or let it go? It could be a bit weird for me to text her 4 months later but I can explain how she is so beautiful and enjoys the same stuff I do. What do y'all think?

Edit: I did manage to make her laugh and start a small conversation. And she showed some signs of interest like sitting in an empty seat allowing me to sit next to her and so on.",14Mar2017,1
165,"Ok, I don't post here a lot, but i really don't know who else to turn to about my particular.. predicament. 

It's a bit of a big pill to swallow so I apologize in advance if I lose anyone during my explanation. 
BASICALLY, I've been dreaming about a girl a few times a month, ever since I was 8. It's the same dream, the same girl, and the same words that get stuck in my head. 
The kicker? I've never met this woman in my life. Now, let me explain. 
I can only really remember the dream in pieces, I see the girl down a long hallway, she's tall, maybe around 5'9"" with blonde hair that's braided and tossed over her shoulder. She has an athletic build and looks to be around her very early 20's.  She's very pretty, and tends to always have this really big ""hey goodlooking"" grin on her face. But the MOST memorable feature about her is her eyes. The best way I can describe it is that they have the color of.. warm honey. With golden flecks mixed in, and they are big. In the dream I start to approach her to I guess tell her something, and her smile turns into a frown. She turns around and runs away, and a voice that I can't even desricbe keeps saying ""save her"" over and over again. That's usually when I wake up. 
This isn't too big of an issue though, people have weird dreams all the time, I get that. 
What is bothering me is that for the past few weeks, I've spotted her outside of my dreams. It's never for more than a few seconds, like a glance as she's walking around a corner, or in a passing car, but I have no doubt it's her. I've even come close to catching her on the rare few moments when I have seen her. But whenever I get close, she's gone. 
What should I do? Should I keep pursining her a little more agressively now? Should I see someone about my weird dreams for fear that I'm going crazy? I've been dreaming about her for so long, and to finally see her around is kind of freaking me out. Any and all advice is appreciated, thank y'all in advance!",14Mar2017,0

I wouldn't mind doing it again, but when I was looking two years ago I remember finding a location that advertised specifically toward hosting parties and corporate events. The ""house"" looked like a house, but on the inside the place was 'tricked out'. It had a crazy indoor pool with a slide, full service bar, huge screen up over the pool, just set up for hosting an event, less so for a traditional vacation type stay. I can't remember where it was located, but I haven't been able to find it or anything like that this time round. Anyone know of a location set up for hosting an ""event"" like this?

 She claims she is just tired, and i can respect that. Buti fear for the kid as mother should provide more care i think. Especially as i can't be as close as father should be.

181,"I'm a 25-year-old man, and there's only two things in my life that I've ever managed to not completely blow off: my son, and my fiancée.

I'm lazy, and it's not a conscious decision, it's something that's been my main personality trait since I hit puberty; I half-assed my way through my GCSEs, got kicked out of two sixth-forms (not for bad behaviour, but for laziness), and I've had way more jobs than anyone should have had in less than a decade since they left school.

It's really easy to blame it on conscious decisions not to do something, but I always begin things with the best of intentions. I've tried starting my own business from home - I bought all the stuff I would need, set up a Facebook page, for a friend to design logos, sent off the logos and paid for 1,000 labels to be made and started selling my product, for maybe a month, before I stopped caring. It's been the same pattern for every job I've had, I'll be the hardest worker... for a month and then I'll wake up and I can't physically bring myself to leave the house.

I've tried everything, every bullshit self-help and life-hack guide: 'set yourself small goals', 'don't overwhelm yourself', 'change your diet and get more sleep'. Nothing changes.

Me and my fiancée recently moved in together, and I kept the house spotless, made sure dinner was all home-cooked and healthy, and on the dining table for 6 every night so we could eat as a family (with my son and her daughter)... for a month, then suddenly I find myself sweeping dust under the couch, forgetting to do the dishes and using pre-packaged food from the microwave.

I never seem to care what I lose on the process. In setting up my own business, I spent 10x what I got back in sales, and losing that money doesn't bother me. Losing out to people when I enter a competition of any sort, be it employee of the month or something else doesn't bother me.

Maybe not caring what I lose is my problem, I've never really had money, or success, and losing what little of it I have doesn't bother me. But I don't want to lose my son or my fiancée, so I make the effort with them. Maybe my laziness stems from a lack of risk for my failure, I don't care about being the greatest and then my only motivation is the risk of loss, which rarely exists.

I'm in my second year at university, and both years have followed the same pattern, I've been a model student, for the first month and now even the fact that I won't get my degree doesn't make me fucking care enough to go and do it.

I expect no sympathy, but I need help. The idea that 'you're lazy because you're lazy' is horseshit to me, I can't just 'go and just do something', I wish it was that easy, I wish I could just stand up right now and just do something about anything, I'm scared that I'm mentally ill, my brain and my body won't let me even try to succeed.

I have my dark moments, but I don't think I have depression, I have no suicidal ideations, quite the opposite really as, as an atheist I fear death, the idea that one day I will cease to exist keeps me awake at night, and even brings panic attacks. Despite this, I can't physically bring myself to live life to the fullest and achieve while I'm still here. If the limited span of human life can't motivate me to make the most of life, then what can?

I feel low, I feel worthless, and I hate myself and love myself in equal measure. I need help, I need advice, and I'm at a loss for how to find it. It took me 4 hours to muster up the energy to write this post, to sit down in the comfort of my own home, and move my thumbs...

The company I work for recently acquired a few more clients and we'll be moving in June 2017 to a better location that has a bigger office. It's a very small company (5-10 people) and there isn't an opportunity for a promotion. I don't dislike my job, but I know it's not what I want to do. 

My issue is I'm done with Philadelphia (I've been here 6 years) and really want to make the move, but I want it to be strategic and not make a hasty decision. I also won't move until I have a job lined up.

For those who have contemplated a similar move or have gone through a similar experience, would you stay at my job for another year to get more experience or just move? By the time I'm looking for a job in New York, I'll have 8-9 months experience.

190,"Hi guys,

I recently broke up with a girl I had been dating for almost a year. I'm okay breakup-wise, but I think I'm coming to the realization in my life that I have never really been alone for any extended period of time. Since I was 16 years old (I am 23 now) I haven't gone any longer than 5-6 months without being in an at least semi-serious relationship. I think this has impeded my growth as an individual. Now I feel lonely constantly and I can already feel myself drifting towards trying to find someone else to be with. I really think I need to be alone for awhile. How do I start to go about this? It sounds stupid, but I really just don't know how to be okay with just myself for company. 

I have some really good lifelong friends, but I am currently in veterinary school on St Kitts in the Caribbean, so while I talk to them often, I don't see them a lot (maybe once every 6 months). I also don't really have any really *good* friends down at school. I am well liked, and I know a lot of people down here, but there's not really anyone I would feel comfortable confiding in(which leads to me asking the internet for advice lol). I think my lack of really quality friends down here is also contributing to the feeling of loneliness I have. Before, I would spend all my time with my recent exgf. I think I just am used to eating all my meals with someone, always having someone to talk to at the end of the day etc. Sorry for the wall of text, just thought maybe some people have been down this same road and might have some tips for me.

TL;DR: haven't not been in a relationship since I was 16 (now 23), afraid I have inhibited my growth as an individual, and now would like to learn how to be okay just being *me*",14Mar2017,3

192,"I don't get in arguments with my mum very often, but when I do my sister always barges in and makes it worse. She does it on purpose to deliberately make me even more angry because she seems finds it freakishly satisfying and hilarious when 2 members of the family can't talk to each other for a night. She is honestly the most spiteful person I know.

When she hears an argument going on, she will listen in and do the following:

* Agree with everything my mum says in a really annoying suck-up tone.

* If I am saying a genuinely good point, she will tell me to get over myself (even if I'm not that bothered)

* Call me dumb if I make a genuinely good point.

* Sometimes record the argument on her phone for whatever reason, but purposefully making it really obvious.

* She will go up to my mum and hug her, and when my mum isn't looking smile at me in a really malicious way that she knows makes my blood boil.

* If my mum threatens to confiscate one of my things, my sister will run into my room and grab the item, then walk into the room we're arguing in and proudly declare that she's hidden it.

She does it purposefully to annoy me and suck up to mum. I try to bring it up, but my mum just dismisses it.

What can I do? She is making every argument get out of hand, and my parents refuse to make her stop or leave the room. For goodness' sake, she's too old for this pathetic behaviour.

195,"I work in a classroom in a school for children with special needs. All my co-workers in this classroom are females in their early-mid 20s. We are always working as a team and just by nature of the job, we are sometimes physically, really up in each other's personal space. This is fine and expected, except when it comes to this specific co-worker. With her, it has been very, very difficult. 

She is a very nice person, but is terribly unkempt, and it has gotten worse in the past few months. To be specific, she wears the same stained jeans daily, and every single day, they are drooping down to the point where either half of her bare butt, or her underwear (she doesn't wear any some days) is showing. When she sits, the jeans slide so low that they come to her mid-hips, and so you can imagine how much of her butt hangs out. On three occasions, her jeans have been so low that her pubic hair in the front is visible. On one occasion, her underwear was almost entirely out and there were heavy skid marks on the underwear (and I don't mean I could see the shadow of skid marks through her underwear, I mean I saw the actual skid marks, which means she turned the underwear inside out and wore it again). Once, I attempted to subtly draw her attention to her dress: I was waiting with a student behind her and I whispered as if I'd only just noticed, ""Oh hey, your pants are kind of falling down."" She replied, ""Yeah, I know"", pulled them up all the way right after I said that, and then has never once pulled them up again after that (this was back in December). Although that instance made me not want to bother again, keep to myself, and spare her the embarrassment, I am now wondering if it is best to speak up since for the past couple of months, she has started to smell. It was a slight musty smell at first (started in December), and I hoped she might notice and have more time to shower/clean up when we were on a few work vacations. However, it has only gotten worse. She now smells faintly of feces, and when she leaves or is in rooms, the odor is heavy and headache-inducing. I find myself actively avoiding coming into contact with her, distancing myself when she stands next to me and asks for my assistance, and holding my breath when she walks by to avoid feeling nauseous. smell. I am wondering if this - combined with seeing her butt cheeks, crack, and pubic hair daily - means I should really say something. I should also note that this co-worker, while I am 90% sure she is not homeless, has been vocal about her lack of money at times and she also has very odd/nonsensical behaviors that make me wonder if I'm stepping into mental health territory: 1) she stores slices of pizza andin the closet where we keep supplies and coats instead of the fridge 2) she wanders the streets (her own words) all night after work parties/events, and then shows up the next day with the same clothes from the events in plastic bags 3) she left her car running for 12hrs in a parking garage so as not to be late for work 4) so many more. 

Anyway, I have decided to tell the supervisor about this. I am not the only one in the classroom who notices (comments about her stench, butt crack, and pubic hair have been made), so I may ask other co-workers to help me, maybe not. Should I write an e-mail or tell her in person? How do I phrase what I want to say?


**TL;DR:** Co-worker at my job (we work 1:1 with children with special needs) is VERY unkempt - biggest issues: 1) she wears the same jeans daily that hang so far down that half of her butt and some of her pubic hair is visible (and when she wears underwear, it is also visible and skid-marked)  2) she has a strong odor that is very feces-like, making it hard to work next to or with her (this job relies on teamwork, so this is important).

During the first three weeks I dealt with it just fine, I was able to do all the things at home that I'd been postponing for three years, I took care of myself, went to sleep without worrying about work and many other great things.

Unfortunately I'm a person prone to depression, I have a low self-esteem and I'm very anxious, such that I had panic syndrome when I was 15. Every day I have to fight against my subconscious, it's like I have this inner voice saying: ""you're not capable of anything"", ""you'll never achieve anything"", ""all your choices were mistakes"", ""look at you, you're 27 and haven't achieved nothing worth"". I try to deal with it since I was a child, probably because of how much bullying I suffered.

Since I got fired this voice started talking louder, I got way more anxious, depression kicked in and I feel really hopeless. I even made a joke about it to my girlfriend, saying that I'm going down a really steep slope on a sled and my three reindeer are called Depression, Anxiety and Low Self-esteem.

I got a job interview at TOTVS two weeks after getting fired for which I didn't got the job, and I know I wasn't confident during it. I felt like a child presenting in front of a class. Although I told the interviewer all the ""great things"" I did at KPMG, in my head I was doubting myself, the quality of my work and if I should be proud of what I did. Even now, while writing this post, I don't feel comfortable about my english. Although english is not my primary language, I used to trust my skills.

I also play at a taiko group. Before getting fired, I had overcome anxiety, I was able to play in front of other people and trust what I practiced, I was able to feel the music, the rhythm, which was very though for me during the first six months. Saturday I had to play with 4 other colleagues in front of our group, as I stood up to play, the room got bigger, my hands and feet got cold, my mind was all over the place like a cloud of bees and I made a lot of mistakes, I felt like dropping my drumsticks and crying.

I've been watching Chef's Table on Netflix and whenever they show a chef's overcoming story, I cry like a baby because I also want to overcoming what I'm going through, but I'm freaking lost.

I'm posting this here because I feel like I'm at the bottom of a hole, I look around and see no light. I don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.

205,"I thought I'd use my skills in IT to help others. I have depression, so sometimes I just need to stop and try to cry my emotions out, but I'm 21, so I don't often have actual tears. I'm learning programming and 3D modeling so I can make content for others.

I have 1%ile processing intelligence, (as measured by my old special school's IQ test in 2015. I stayed on school premises and did link courses with a couple of colleges.), so I can't do simple tasks as quickly as others, but I also have 99%ile verbal comprehension intelligence, so I can do very complex tasks really easily and quickly compared to other people.

I don't need much motivation to stick at doing something, but I also don't ever have much motivation, given that I secretly (only secretly because I don't mention it much) hope for the worst, for everyone, including myself, and don't really want to help people, but just do so because of morals that bind me to the task.

Sometimes I write a little story fragment. People say my story fragments are really good. I do 3D modeling with Blender and Python programming. I usually work pretty quickly, given how complex the tasks are. I often find that as soon as I've finished one task I know what to do for the next task, and don't get stuck that often, unless I'm doing something new that I don't know about very well, like using classes in Python programming, but even then, I google it, and if that fails to fix the problem, I just post a question about the problem and solve it with the answer I've been given.

Because I'm immoral at heart, struggling to behave morally, I can't always get myself to do the right thing. My brain revolts fairly often. Now it even seems like all my actions are done by a separate person. :P

I can't control my body, but it usually does things for me. It only cares about me. It doesn't mind being selfish on my behalf.

It agreed to warn people that I might do something horrible one day, but no one will take the precaution of locking me up somewhere, to be safe.

I can't commit suicide. The knife won't touch my skin. I try so hard and don't even feel afraid of it. It's like I just put my fear away. I'm a danger to myself and others, but can't eliminate the threat.

I hate good, but MUST, just must, try to do what is right all the time. I'm like a moral demon, but no one else can see inside my mind, so they don't know it.

Should I do game development, and why or why not? Is there something that will be more helpful to people? I hate this, but please give me advice on how to better help people.

Thank you.",14Mar2017,1
207,"Hey all, I'm looking for advice on my shared housing situation. I live with two other roommates, and we tend to have dishes and trash pile quickly. How should this be approached? Me and Roommate A tend to think that chores should be done relative to the amount of trash/dishes contributed. For example if the majority of dirty dishes are Roommate B's then he should do the dishes. Same for trash too. Roommate B, on the other hand, disagrees with this and tries to lobby for scheduled chore day for dishes and trash duty. It may seem crappy on my part, but I have a meal plan at my university, and tend to believe that my (literally) zero contributions to the dirty dish pile should exclude me from that sort of duty. The other bit of reasoning behind this is that I'm also not his mother. To clarify a couple of things: 1) this problem exists with the trash, and pretty much mimics the dirty dishes, so I left that out. 2) me and A are only proposing our way because we don't feel it to be fair that we have to clean up after a slob.

210,"I recently crossed swords with a rich and politically connected man whom I shall say, is quite prideful and cares very much about image. None of our dispute has being brought forward to the public (settled almost privately...lots of gossips) and basically from what I have been hearing, he obviously doesn't like me and I am seriously afraid he might hurt me some way years down the road as a revenge (etc, denied jobs).

From my own observation of him, he likes to create rivalry and hurt people for power's sake, ruined people just because they are more popular (he boost to me about how he plotted to ruined a guy who is popular with girls) and have absolutely no qualms about making enemies. I tried to reason with him (it was a year ago) how making enemies is *bad* because you never know when you might need them. I think I caught him a little off-handed and he took a while to tell me that he doesn't care because all the person he runs down are...""useless/powerless"" in a sense.

Now when I try to greet him on the street, he just looks away but he did wave back to me. He had also blocked me on some social media platforms and been basically ignoring me when we meet each other at public events. From my friend's information (who is still in contact with him), I heard he is gossiping about me like how I got rejected by a company which I am sure he has no relations/influence over. 

Now, knowing his character (how he runs down people who had never hurt him but because of jealously/rivalry/dislike) and knowing he doesn't like me, what should I do? What more can I do, to evaluate his level of threat to me? Should I initiate contact with him, like ask him out for lunch? 

I thinking how he might not choose to mess with me because if I brought forward my case to the public, it will mess with his reputation (and mine as well) and basically cast him in a very bad light. He might, mess with me, in a more subtle and covert way given the amount of influence and power he has. 

Now I do regret crossing swords with him but what happen during that time made me felt excessively unsafe which then I found out all things he did which has hurt me (he finds me to be weak?). But anyway, I am just scared of him. It is first time I ever feared someone, but because he has the character of someone really nasty, it had made me felt very paranoid and I fear for my future.

In terms of academics, both places offer courses for my major, and academics aren't really my top priority in deciding where to study abroad because I'll be going for the experience. I'll list some brief pros and cons:

London:
Pros:
- easy access to the rest of Europe (I haven't been)(this is a major pro)
- traveling to other countries is less expensive because I can take the train rather than fly
- great city
Cons:
- food is not as good as HK food
- I don't know anyone else in the program (could offer me a clean slate, but also what if I don't connect with anyone deeply)
- colder than HK

Hong Kong:
Pros:
- have been there and wanted to go back for a more extended period of time, great city
- close to Japan, where I want to go back, and other countries I want to go to
- great food
- my best friend along with another good friend are doing this program, and since I'm not the most outgoing it may be easier if they are there to meet new people with me, also if I don't go I may have extreme FOMO from my best friend being there and not me, also it would be nice to have someone I'm extremely close to in case I need to talk to someone about personal things
- nice weather
Cons:
- farther from home, family will probably not be able to visit me
- can't travel in Europe
- expensive flights to surrounding countries for trips

Throwaway account for soon-to-be-obvious reasons. Trigger Warning: Rape and sexual violence (inexplicit)

#What I Am Doing
I'm writing a dark fantasy novel series that I fully intend to publish traditionally. Within the first novel, at about halfway through the third quarter of the book, one of my characters (""A"") is raped.

#What I Am Not Doing
I am not adding this scene for shock value, to make a statement about how evil the rapist (""B"") is, ""lessen"" or ""break"" A in any way (nor is she dropped off the face of the page afterward--she's a main character), or otherwise use A to illustrate grimdarkness of the world they're in (which actually isn't grimdark, but that's a different conversation).

#Why I Want to Write It

Because I know someone will ask, **I myself am a woman and rape survivor.** Part of writing this scene is healing for me. I connect most emotionally closely with A--which is not to say A is/represents ""me"", because that's not at all true--and due to her storyline and main subplot, it makes sense that this would happen to her.

Another important reason is because it simply flat-out makes sense with the story. B has chased her throughout most of the novel and before the novel's beginning after she escaped arranged marriage to him, he gave her three times to willingly say ""yes"" to his proposal, after which he would force it, and he has finally re-captured her and has disabled her from running or fighting back.

Fourthly, it's a turning point for A. When this happens she realises she has to deal with her past else she'll be miserable for the rest of her life, and she needs to truly put down her bow and live for herself, not the dead (that's story stuff, feel free to ignore).

The final reason is because I don't believe rape is portrayed well in media. I think it's glossed over, used as a titillation technique, or just totally portrayed in an unrealistic way. I hope that by including this scene, it might jar some people who otherwise wouldn't care into realising the long-term consequences of sexual violence.

I don't want to just write this scene and then not include it in the book. I don't think that would really do anything justice. I don't know.

243,"This is really hard to type because I'm currently hiding in my closet while writing this. 

So it started about a year ago when I was a freshmen in high school and I guess everything went well for the first couple of weeks until I realized I wasn't the best in anything that involves math, so what ended up happening was that I failed algebra and my science classes. Iv'e also had one too many egoistical teachers not caring about their students and just yelling at them constantly. That pretty much made learning hard for me as I already hated the way school worked to begin with. Wake up at 6 in the morning, get dressed, eat breakfast (if you have time) and go to school. Then it lasts 8 hours straight sitting on a desk and eating shitty food, and then go home finally and do even more work at home that the teachers assign you. I did all my homework at the beggining but then it got to the point where I would maybe only have 1 to 2 hours of free time before I went to bed. Even on weekends my algebra teacher would always give us homework. 

During that same year I got in trouble a lot. Messing around in class and talking back to teachers. Later on I learned and stopped doing that stuff and strictly focused on school work the next semester. And then again, I still got tired of it, I stopped doing work, and talked to friends most of the time. After that year was over I pretty much worked all summer excluding weekends. And saved up to build a computer. 

During that same month of me building my computer my 10th grade year of school started. I had to start focusing on work and told myself hundreds of times that I was going to do good in school. Well that never happened again. I focused way too much time on my hobbies at home and missed a whole week of school once pretending to be sick but instead was at home working on my computer and playing games. I failed all my classes that semester and got in trouble a bunch of times for being late to class and not doing my work. It got so bad that my parents started getting letters home and I would have my mom come back from work in fury after getting the letters home. The school even kept track of all the things I've done from kindergarten to high school and sent my parents home a whole paper of it.

The other problem I have with school is that the way most rules are set up are just hard for me to agree with. I got kicked out of class for wearing a hat and then got lunch detention for it. I also got in a fight with some kid at the begining of my 10th grade year and the police had to get involved. I mean obviously the fight made sense that the police needed to get involved. But a hat!? come on!!

Fast forward to now. I'm on my last semester of 10th grade. I'm currently only failing 2 classes and about to get those grades up hopefully. But the issue is my report card already came through the mail and my mom called me saying that something really bad is going to happen when she gets home because of my failing classes. She also told me ahead of time that she's going to sell my computer if I keep getting in trouble at school. Well the problem is that my school sent home a letter of all the things I got in trouble for in the past 2 years I've been here and my parents still haven't read it so that's going to be a treat to read through!

I really need advice on how to deal with this. I honestly feel like I'm going to be a failure when I get older and school is just destroying my youth. I'm going to look back at high school 10 years from now (if I'm still alive by then) and say ""I'm glad I'm out of this hell"" and then continue sleeping on the sidewalk as a homeless man.",14Mar2017,1

He's hot, confident, smart, and has some awesome dancing skills, I got a hug from him and admitted to myself that I was attracted to him, including sexually.

We meet a week later as soon as I'm back in the country. We have a good meeting, and I get positive vibes. He tells me the job is mine, and unless 'this famous scientist (whose name I won't mentioned just for not giving too much away)', he would not offer the job to anyone. I till him about other job offers, he tells me that he would want to know my answer by the end of Feb, which seemed fair. He also told me that he was just made aware by HR that he'll have to the the job posting online for formality. He said he'll run the posting tailored to my resume, and will also ask me for my salary considerations, in a day or two. So I walked out feeling very good out of that interview. 1.5 weeks pass, and I don't hear from him. I write to him asking about it, he says HR is taking too much time and he'll talk to someone senior. 1.5 more weeks pass, I write again this time telling him that i was keen on joining his team, if the offer was still open. He reassures me again that he wants me a unless 'famous scientist' walks in, the job is mine and by early March I could start. So I'm happy about this. 3 days later, he emails me saying the post is up, and he asked me to apply through it formally. I do. The post is supposed to run for 2 weeks, but the poster can take it down after 1 week if they have found a candidate. 2 weeks pass, no message. The post finally goes down, and I email him 3 days after asking what was happening and when I could join. No reply. Its been 2 days now. I turned down the other jobs for this.
And I'm on a student visa, so I cannot do any other work, can't get temp jobs, and can't be unemployed for more than 90 days.

So what do I do. he has gone AWOL on me. I don't want to keep emailing him or ambush or harass him.

But I've become a giant ball of anxious mess, obsessively checking emails, losing sleep, hair is falling out. I keep checking my email every 5 m. I cry all the times. I'm so worried about my future.

What is this guys deal?
WHy is he so unprofessional?
If he were  having some troubles or HR roadblocks, or decided to get someone else, or whatever. It would be the decent thing to update me. This isn't some big company industry job, its just this guy who is in need of people to join his team ASAP (his words not mine). Wouldn't he be pushing for this? I just am so confused and scared.

262,"There's a guy in my friend group that I really don't like, and don't even understand why he's even involved in any of our group texts/chats anymore. 

Simply put, I don't like him because he always refuses and/or flakes when we all make plans to hang out, which I normally wouldn't mind except for the fact that he lies and says he's busy/tired/etc. while choosing to hang out with other people instead. 

The really infuriating thing though is that he won't just go away either. I've ""jokingly"" removed him from our group text a couple of times and he keeps asking to be added back every time, and he keeps participating in the conversation.

And if that wasn't dumb enough, a lot of what he talks/posts about nowadays in our group text is what ""cool"" stuff he's been doing with his other friends, so it's actually really annoying especially since he obviously considers himself too good to hang out with us...

Basically I'm getting the feeling the only reason he still talks to us via text/chat is so he can have people to show off to so he can feel like he's popular, which is completely inane considering we're all in fucking college.

Ideally I'd like for this guy to just go away but I'm not really sure how feasible that is, so how do I deal/cope/whatever with this in the meantime?",14Mar2017,1
263,"Background, I am not with the mother but I need to file taxes under him because we alternate years. The deal is that she is not providing the Social Security Number or card to do this and it has been a pain in the ass.

Things I know:
-He's 4.
-They don't accept birth certificate. 
-They need school record, daycare record, doctor or hospital record or passport.
-They need proof of me being the parent.

Went to hospital to get medical records for him. Got records and waited 1 hour at Social Security office. They tell me the records are fine and I have all information but they need it to be signed stamped and dated.

Go back to the records office where they only provide a signed, dated and stamped copy of his live birth which includes a notary stamp. I'm going to try this tomorrow but this may not work since it's not a recent record.

I've been to the social security website as well and It had no mention I need those documents signed and stamped. And now I'm afraid I'm going to waste an extra 1 hour tomorrow with them telling me I need some extra step and I just need to get this shit done.
Mother is not cooperative and I'd like to do this without paying my lawyer 600 dollars and a court case that she probably won't show up at anyway.

Anyone who has been through this I just need to know EXACTLY what I need. Or what I can do to provide proof.",14Mar2017,1

272,"Hi there, M/19 in 2nd year Bsc at uni.
I am very stressed out about school, however that is my fault because I have not studied anything for 2 weeks; here is the issue:
I can't focus, i am usually a good student but lately (past 2 weeks) i have had zero motivation to do anything, I wake up go to school, sit in lecture, then walk over to the library- with the intent to study- and end up on reddit for 6-8 hours.

sometimes I just stare at the wall and can;t bring myself to do anything about it i just can't study i don't know what to do. If i try to disconnect from the internet etc i just stare at the wall/ zone out until it's 8pm or so. i go home eat and sleep, then repeat.

I feel very useless and angry and disappointed because I feel like a failure. i have discussed this with my mentor- a really nice older professor whom i speak to often about everything- he suggests it is because of my career aspirations ( doctor) and my inability to achieve those high marks required for acceptance into any medical school ( avg is about 70% need at least 90%).

He may be right, i think it also has to do with seeing everyone else so successful and me just failing and falling behind everyone else. 

to add on to that, my parents- whom are supportive- especially my mother, gets very frustrated and upset *for* me  because i am not performing as well as is required.

Lastly, I have been also stressed out about my parents financial situation- both unemployed, not sure how we are living right now with no income + &gt;30K in debt. I have thought of everything, even applied for jobs for them with no luck. they are both not in the best health so cant work any labour- intensive jobs.

I feel stuck in a negative spiral that is leading me to stress which leads to worse school performance etc etc.

i just want to be out of school and do something useful / of value where i can make money to help my mother live the life of luxury she deserves but never had.

Please help, my motehr thinks i should go to counselling(psychologist) here at uni.

I just want [this shitty, poor period of] my life to be over already .

Oh I also don't talk to anyone here with no real friends, just sit alone in the library for hours[ doing nothing] 

your help is appreciated.

275,"Hey, this is my first reddit post and id like to ask you guys for some advice. Im currently 16 about to be 17 and am in 11th grade. I study in probably the shittiest school since kindergarten, where we dont study shit all day, cant go out in breaks, are yelled at every day (sometimes beaten which has happened to me a handful of times), our phones taken and not given back untill school ends, no extracurricular activities, not to mention the students, who I all hate. They are all immature and childish, and have no social life other than the one they have in school, you literally cant talk with anyone anything other than video games or a shallow topic. The only actual friends who I enjoyed talking to (and actually could talk to) were last years' 12th grade who sadly graduated and left me alone with a bunch of fucktards. They have also had the same problems with their classmates, and literally told me to simply give up and wait untill I graduate. I try to tell my parents the truth about my school, but they refuse to believe me (since its a private school and my dad is friends with the principal). All i do in class is eat or sleep since there is literally nothing else to do, I've tried sneaking my phone in a couple of times, but once i had it taken away, because in my school they have these searches (which are totally illegal in my country without a warrant signed from our parents) where they search through our backpacks and our pockets, and take away everything ""illegal"" (phones,gum,make up, and etc.) Do I listen to my older friends' advice and just bear through all this or do I do something about it?

279,"I'm 27, currently employed fulltime, and have a bit of debt that I let run away from me.

I attended college for two years, got *very* close to getting a transfer degree, but for reasons I won't get in to, I ended up dropping out and seeking employment before that happened.

Now I make a livable wage, but I am *immensely* unsatisfied with my work, and I want desperately to go back to school and find a real career.

The problem is that I can't figure out how. I *need* to keep working fulltime to pay bills. I don't live alone, so I can't just scale back and move home for school purposes. Even if I could, some bills can't be ignored. I need an income.

At the same time, the schools near me won't work for my schedule, because very few classes are available in the evenings or online. Any program I go through is going to require me to have day time hours available, and the only way I'll get *those* is if I can manage to get a graveyard shift at work, which is a whole other thing that sounds awful and I don't really want.

And basically this all amounts to me not knowing how to proceed. Am I just boned? Is the only option to find another job that can accommodate school hours? Because job hunting sounds absolutely *miserable*, and I doubt anywhere else will pay me as well as where I'm at. I was lucky to get my current job, but damn it... I really want to go back to school and work towards some thing more meaningful.",14Mar2017,1
280,"22 yo male here. The last couple of days I have been feeling like garbage. I looked in the mirror and thought, ""damn that there's a fat fuck"" while in the midst of trying to stop using tobacco. I put on a substantial amount of weight over the last year, and I've outgrown all of my jeans, so I've drawn up some preliminary plans to not be unhealthy and self-destructive. 
I've had some rather drastic changes occur in my life recently, mostly stemming from bipolar disorder. I had to leave school because I was too depressed from having to work to support myself in the college town while in school. I've been living at home and working in tech support as I recover. I'm trying to quit tobacco (smokeless, not cigs) for obvious reasons, and my diet leaves a lot to be desired. I know that there's a lot of work to be done in that department, but I just don't know where to start. 
With the tobacco cessation comes the constant desire to eat a large amount of junk food. I just eat more than I should of the wrong things and gain weight. This brings along a lot of negativity; I pretty much hate myself in many regards, and I don't know how to fix any of it. How do I get out of this? Therapy is only so effective, and I'd do anything to quell the anxiety I feel.

282,"So I've had this sweet cat for 4 years now and ever since I adopted her from the shelter she has had intestinal issues. It's always been a huge inconvenience for me, but I was able to live with it. Now, as of about 6 months ago, it's gotten to the point that she has accidents several times a day. I've taken her to several local veterinarians, given her metronidazole, prednisone, and probiotics, and even tried a few different special diets, but all to no avail. It absolutely breaks my heart, but I just can't keep her any longer due to the constant accidents. She poops in my bed almost every night at this point. I have contacted all of the local no-kill shelters but they can't take her either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: So this got a ton of support and I sincerely appreciate it. We finally found a vet that helped her find the appropriate diet and medication regmine. So far so good. I will keep you updated.",14Mar2017,1
283,"At long last, recently, my divorce is final.  In the settlement I've  keeping the house, the vehicles, and most of the possessions in the house.  When that was agreed over a year ago I thought I was lucky in that.  Since then I've gotten a new job, and as I've continued to live in the house alone for all this time, it feels like a prison.  I have a deep desire to get rid of all of my material possessions, sell everything, and move.  

I own the house in cash, it's a giant place, full of crap.  For many reasons I find it debilitatingly daunting to think about trying to do this all myself... to the point I don't see myself ever starting if I have to do it alone.

Can anyone talk me through how to go about this?  Are there services out there that do this kind of thing?  Maybe sell what they can, and dispose of the rest?  Help me with the move?

286,"Hi all,

I've written and deleted god-knows-how-many emails that I was sure I'd send to my past employer to inquire about employment with them.

Over a year ago I was let go for what I guess was underperformance. I was fresh out of college, naive, had incorrect priorities and surrounded myself with negative influences. I want, so badly, to work there again.

I talked to a few friends who still work there and some of them encouraged me to reapply, others say it's probably a waste of time. I've wanted to give it time before I try to reapply - as to be more genuine in my efforts. Problem is - I'm still worried about whether I would even be considered.

I can give more details to any questions, but I'm on mobile. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",14Mar2017,2
288,"Don't know what type of response Im looking for but i just feel like getting this off my chest in writing..and be honest. 


Over a year ago I made the decision to break up with my boyfriend with whom I lived with in Canada and move back home to Ireland, we had live together for a year and a half before the break up and before that we had had a long distance relationship on and off for two years. Me moving to Canada to live with him in 2014 was kind of the start of our face to face relationship, which sounds crazy, but we both felt so close over the long distance relationship (met up a few times for holidays) that it ""felt"" right thing to do. I was also v excited to move to a new country and get away from boring home city. He was a chef and from afar I was always interested in his job even though i cant cook, and don't really care about it personally. 


When i finally moved it was all exciting at the start and I settled in to the city. Over time, with his hours being so late and the complete differences in our jobs, especially his passion at cooking that i began to resent because of the hours, i realised how little i saw of him and started to think about the future and how it would work. He said i should support him and accept that thats the way it would be, working long hours. etc. Also, and being honest here, im irish and he was indian, i was pale and he was dark, and I always felt we got stared at all the time that it started affecting me for some stupid reason. It sounds so stupid but its true, (now I think how stupid it sounds.) 


Anyway...I felt unhappy and after fighting alot about the job and stuff, and the fact we would have had to get married quite quick for visa reasons to move anywhere (which freaked me out), I panicked decided that it wasn't working (going to work long term) and left. That was over a year ago. Initially i felt i made the right decision, for myself, for him and for my future. After a while the panic attacks, depression and anxiety set in ( I had turned 30 too so that made it worse) and I felt i had made the worst decision ever. Because i did still have feelings, missed talking to him, and his company,  but all the differences seemed too much. I thought about going back but never did it and constant overthinking regret and what ifs in my head pretty much rule my thoughts then and to this day, and i feel i havent been happy ever since. Moving home made it worse as its not somewhere i feel i belong. I still think about it everyday and its ruining myself going forward. I cant seem to move on from a decision that I thought at the time was right. Im terrified Ill never meet anyone I felt the same way about again, Im also so bored of living in the city i grew up in, i feel i have ruined my life and I hate myself for that. I want to move again but i dont know where and I dont want to be alone and lost in another country. I feel i dont trust my own decision making and fear making any future decisions as ill just regret them. He has moved on and I am happy for him, I just want to find inner peace and happiness and to smile again.  

Sorry for the rant, but i guess of all places its going to happen here, any thoughts welcome :)",14Mar2017,2
293,"   I'm 29, turning 30 in ~6 months.  
  
  History of my education:  
  I dropped out of high school due to intense bullying. I went to Job Corps and got my GED within a week of arrival. I was unsatisfied with that so I got my HSD online, a year or two early.  
  
  I then went to work in a factory for a couple of years. I was laid off when the manufacturer packed up and moved to Mexico. I tried going to a local community college, but was unsure of what I wanted to major in, or even work towards. So I have a few credits from general studies from that place.  
  
  I went to a small CDL school and got a Class A CDL. I drove for about a year; was terminated due to an driving incident being misreported as a 'sideswipe' (a hooked guard rail on a weighing scale scratched my fuel tank).   
  
  Currently unemployed, wondering if I should just go back to driving and make use of my CDL-A or if I should go back to school. I really hated how I was treated driving trucks; being forgot about while stranded at some truck stop thousands of miles from home was really aggravating.   
  
  I'm fairly confident in my studying skills, but at the same time I'm not wanting to acquire debt. **How do I go about qualifying for grants? Do I need to pick a school first?  **
  
  As for major, I was thinking something practical; something where the job field is growing. I also value appreciation over raw income, given how I felt about my last job; helping people is also something I'd like to do. So I'm thinking Associate's in Nursing is the way to go. Admittedly, I'm a little embarrassed at the idea of being a *male* nurse.  
  
**TL;DR** See title + the condition of wanting to go to school without taking loans. ",14Mar2017,1
