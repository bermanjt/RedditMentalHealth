I'm a junior now and kind of want to go back and play again for my senior year.

1,"Hey guys, I would really appreciate your input on my current situation. It's not a biggie, just something small that I've been thinking about.

So I'm in college and met this really cute girl from Texas. I definitely plan to pursue something with her. Recently I found out she's a Debutante from Texas, and a pretty big one too.

I don't know why, but I find it really intimidating that she is one. I come from a modest to upper income family, and I am a mixed guy / swimmer who was raised in the D.C. Area, which is notoriously know for being very culturally diverse.  Like I hadn't heard of ""Debutante"" till I came to this school. 

I don't know about Debutante's much other than that it is for the extremely wealthy, white (not all, but mostly), Southern, traditional. And swing dancing.  Are Debutante's known for upholding that tradition and look for a white, Southern, wealthy man? Genuine question.  I'm not trying to stereotype at all, I'm just a little intimidated if she's not looking for my type that's all.

4,"I'm 24 years old and live in a very expensive area with my parents and two younger siblings.


I want to move out and I have a buddy who is ready to move with me, but I'm on the fence and don't know if it's the logical thing to do. 


Renting a single room in this area ranges from $800-1000; yes, it's pretty insane. I work full-time, but only make $15/hr. which is enough to rent, but I'd be living on the dime. I also have about 15k saved up right now. 



It's hard living at home. It takes a toll on my mental state (being 24 years old) and just triggers my depression/anxiety. And I've been sharing a room with my 17 year old brother for the last 5 months. My mother is a bit crazy and she's hard to handle. 



At the same time it's hard to justify draining $800+ a month when I could be living for free at home.



Anyone else been in a similar situation and what would you all recommend?

13,"I just moved to New York City for a new job and am enjoying city life, but don't know that many people here. A good friend of mine from undergrad lives here as she's going to NYU for grad school, but she's busy a lot with school, etc.

I have met her NYU friends before through gatherings / parties I've gone to before I moved here (only originally from NJ) and I've become pretty friendly with a few. 

Since being here, I actually went to a bar crawl with a bunch of the NYU people without my college friend being there, and it was really fun.

Anyways, one of the girls I met a while ago who I've probably become the most friendly with texted a bunch of NYU people as well as me asking if anyone wanted to go out Friday. Me, having no other plans and enjoying their company, of course said yes excitedly.

Not to long after I got this text from my college friend:

""Hi! I obviously don't care that you hang with my NYU friends AT ALL but can you just do my a favor and not really talk about me or bring me up a lot? I'm not going to be going out a lot this semester bc I'm very intense when I have a lot of work lol.

I'm different than college Sam üíÅ""

This is where I need advice...I want help figuring out how to respond in a way that conveys I totally get where she's coming from (I actually do, i'd feel the same way in her shoes), but also in a way to make her more comfortable with the idea so I don't have to lose out on this new exciting social opportunity...

I haven't talked anything bad about her before, or even much about her at all, besides for introducing myself to her friends when she wasn't there as a friend of her's from undergrad.

I don't want to step on her toes and I don't want to upset her...but I also want to not have to be upset doing nothing Friday or in the future when there are people who mutually enjoy each other's company with fun plans...

I have some savings, little more than $3000 and I have $2000 coming back in tax returns soon. The down payment is 15%, which is $2250. I have enough money. (I also checked reviews and the trailer park had a pretty good review.  (Very few reviews about bad maintenance, people, etc).

32,"Hey,

I'm 22, and 3 years ago I landed a job in a reasonably prestigious, growing industry. I had few qualifications, no experience - so my family and I were overjoyed.

Fast forward 3 years and I've made good progress in my career. I've received 2 promotions and a huge amount of very valuable experience.

In the past 3 years I have come very far as a person, and have consistently overachieved at work.

Despite all of this, I am overwhelmed with sadness and feelings of being unfulfilled at all times. I really haven't escaped this feeling for the past 2.5 years.

While I'm good at my job, I do not take any pleasure in it. It feels as if I'm living my job. I get up, go to work, get home, go to bed because I'm too exhausted to do anything else. The small amount of pleasure I used to take from my job is long since gone - and now there is nothing but apathy.

This isn't the life I want to live, but I'm unsure how I can possibly change it.

At this stage, I take a step back from where I am and all I can feel is that I am doing everything I do for no reason. I'm just working to work, and I have absolutely nothing beyond that.

But I don't know what would be more fulfilling, other than those utter pipe-dream ideas of careers in things I'm passionate about.

I have no qualifications to fall back on, I have very limited savings and I don't even know where to begin when it comes to improving my outlook/prospects.

Does anyone out there have advice for how I could pursue a more fulfilling career, or how to figure out what might actually be more fulfilling?

35,"Throwaway account, and I'm sorry it's long


Since the end of the holidays, I've been in and out of the doctor's office several times with nothing to show for it. I'm THROUGH trying to work with this woman, but at this point the situation has gotten so complicated that I'm not really sure what to do next.


Some background details to begin with:

- 26 year old female, generally good health
- I've struggled with mental illness in the past, but throughout the fall I was feeling my best and healthiest.
- Since the beginning of 2013, I've been prescribed 30mg/day of Vvyanse and since the beginning of 2015 I've been prescribed 15mg/day of Lexapro. I also take birth control (Orsythia).
- I quit my full time job a few months ago and my health insurance is through the state now
- I had been getting my prescriptions from a great psychiatrist for almost two years, but I'm no longer covered to see him. I've switched back to having my PCP write them.


So here we go:

Every time my health insurance has changed, I've had to get my Rx for Vyvanse prior authorized since it's a controlled substance. My new insurance won't authorize it unless you've tried at least two other stimulant medications. I've taken Ritalin (bleh), so my PCP asked if I wanted to try Adderall. I agreed and started 20mg/day of the XR right after Christmas.


Within a couple of days of starting it, I was feeling like hell. My back was killing me, I had no appetite or energy, I was nauseous and dry-heave-puking (including on the sidewalk down the street from my house‚Ä¶lovely, right?), lots of bloating/pressure/pain. At first I thought ""man, this Adderall is killing me,"" but I was having urinary symptoms as well, so I went to a Minute Clinic on 12/30. They diagnosed me with a bladder infection, gave me an antibiotic and some Azo, and sent me on my way.


A few days later (1/2), someone called from the clinic and said my urine culture had come back negative. She asked me some questions about my symptoms then told me to stop the antibiotic and see my PCP within the next 24 hours. The office was closed because it was the day after New Year's, so I went to one of their associated hospitals. I didn't want to wait - I'll admit that I'm a hypochondriac and that phone call got me in a tizzy. They look at my urine in the ER and say ""nah you definitely have an infection, you just didn't get the right antibiotics. We'll call you when the culture comes back if shows that you'll need a different one, but Cipro should do it. Follow up with your PCP when you finish it.""


I was sort of feeling better, but not a whole lot. Different symptoms kept coming and going throughout the week. Antibiotics tend to make me feel like crap, so I wasn't sure about its role in everything. When I finished the course, I went for a follow up. The PA told me that the culture came back negative and that I never had an infection. Terrific. My urine came back clean that day, however, and in so many words the PA's reaction was ""I guess that worked, not sure how, but yay!""


Ok, but I'm still having symptoms. Particularly back pain and bloating/pressure/pain in my lower abdomen in pelvis. Frequent and urgent urination, too. We discussed whether switching my medication might have a role. She apologized and said it was the insurance company's decision, not the doctor's, which I knew anyway. I'd much rather have Vyvanse than Adderall, so I was kind of relieved when she suggested that I switch back. She referred me to the office's psychiatrist and I got an appointment scheduled (a couple weeks ahead). Lastly, she pressed on my belly a bit, said I was constipated, and gave me an Rx for Miralax. I tried this out for about a week - it was nice to get the pipes cleaned out, but I still wasn't feeling back to normal.


At this point, the nausea's still coming and going and I've puked on the street multiple times now. My back hurts when I walk, after I eat, after I drink coffee‚Ä¶and the pain moves, it varies. My urinary urgency is so bad that I've wet my pants more than once. I'm also supposed to be getting my period, which reminds me of something else:

In November, I was seen for a cut on my hand. At that visit, I told the doctor that I hadn't had a normal period in several months - instead, I just get one or two big, dark brown/black clots. She tested me for pregnancy (neg) and told me that it's normal because I take birth control. I start to wonder if that could be related to everything else and I make another appointment.

I relayed everything above to her. She asked for a urine sample and told me I wasn't pregnant‚Ä¶which I could've told her myself, nothing's changed since she last checked considering how shitty I've been feeling. She tells me again it's normal for women to stop getting periods when they take birth control. So I guess it's irrelevant? I asked about the rest of my urinalysis. She didn't have it but said ""it would be done and results available."" Never happened.


Her diagnosis this time was that I have overactive bladder, which she said might be a residual effect from the UTI I just had (wait, what, the one you told me was never an infection?) and that I was having gas pain. Her suggested treatment - kegels, ""mind over bladder,"" and Beano. Okay, great. My appointment with the psychiatrist was coming up, so she said we should wait to see how I feel when I switch back to Vyvanse.


Only I go meet with this guy and he doesn't agree with long-term stimulant use. He also said he didn't think my symptoms were at all related to the Vyvanse or the Adderall. Okay, great. I make an appointment to see the PA again since I figure she'll want to write the Rx herself.


NOPE. She's decided to go with the psychiatrist because ""he's the professional."" I'm at a loss at this point. I explained that I see where they're coming from, and I can start cutting back, but I don't feel comfortable going cold turkey right now on something that's worked great for me over the past four fucking years considering all this other crap that's truly souring my life. I just want one constant back in my life and see how I feel from there. Still nope. She pulled a complete 180 on her previous treatment plan and diagnosis. Also refused to refill the Adderall Rx. Instead, now, she instructed me to keep a food diary to see if it's an allergy. She also suggested that I have a condition in my GI tract that's a result of smoking marijuana, and told me that I should give it up.

This sounded like bullshit to me, so I looked it up when I got home: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndrome

Turns out I was right - with a whopping 98 recorded cases and the fact that I don't even come close to fitting the profile, it IS bullshit. For the record, I smoke an occasional to moderate amount of marijuana. The only reason I've picked it back up regularly lately is to relieve my goddamn pain and nausea, and it's legal where I live to boot.


So I've had it, I'm not going back. But I don't know what to do next. I'm feeling confused, betrayed, and wondering if it's all in my head. My insurance requires that I list my PCP and basically ties me to them, so if I want to see someone else I either have to try finding a new one or go to specialists. If I take the latter route, what kind should I request referral for? Do I really have anything to worry about or should I wait it out?

Thank you for reading!

TL;DR The last paragraph",02Feb2017,0
40,"I still live with my parents. I don't want to be here, and I tried to move out but because of my culture (were indians, actually Bangladeshi) I still have to live at home. 

Living at home is not the problem, however my dad micromanaging me and undermining the way I feel or my taste is.  He thinks everything I do that is different from his taste is wrong. From the music I listen to to how I drink my water, he thinks he does it better and he doesn't understand that I am my own person and I have certain preferences. He just shits all over mine as well as my mom's feelings/wants/ desires. 

My dad is very educated. He grew up in India during the caste system, and even though he was dirt poor, he manages to shit on everyone else. He likes to think that he's better than them and us because he grew up in India and ""has aristocratic tastes"" while we have less than the finest taste and in turn that means that our tastes/wants/ desires mean less than his and we should all try to get to where he is.

One of the worst things his ""aristocratic tastes"" has lead him to do is get my mom's hopes up only to crush them. My mom is a sweetheart and I absolutely love her and infact if it weren't for my mom I would never have come back after I left. Earlier last year my mom was invited to a Bengali wedding and at the time my dad said he would go so she was really excited! It's all she could talk about for WEEKS because the girl who is getting married is a distant friend with whom we grew up, and she hasn't been to a wedding for a long time. She got her outfit ready, planned out how she would do her hair and makeup and the day came and he said he didn't feel like going. So even though she was really excited for weeks, told everyone she would be there and she wanted to go to hang out with her friends and see the beautiful bride, her feelings didn't matter because he just didn't feel like it. And he thinks that's perfectly acceptable because ""they are such low class people. I don't want to hang out with them and neither should you."" he just doesn't give a fuck about what anyone else thinks, not even his own wife who goes out of her fucking way to make him happy and put his needs infront of her own. 

He does this with everyone in the family even if it doesn't concern him or affect him in any way and it's gotten to a point where I am getting fed up with his antics to where I just scream back at him in response to his complaint just to get him to shut up and let me live my life.

For example, yesterday I had a mug of tea that I was taking to school with me and he started screaming at me and my mom telling me it's going to spill on me and I should just leave it at home and telling my mom to get the mug away from me. I understand that that could be a problem if the mug was more than half full and scorching hot, but it wasn't. It was halfway full and it was luke warm. There was no way he would know this, but if I saw a grown women who has a habit of taking her tea with her as she drives, I would trust her to have a special way to handle the drink so it doesn't spill. That idea has never crossed his mind that I could have a way to keep from dousing myself in tea every morning. So I just screamed back at him ""NO I KNOW WHAT IM DOING I'VE BEEN DRINKING TEA IN MY CAR FOR YEARS AND HAVE YET TO SPILL ANY ON MYSELF!"" 

That got him to shut up, or it didn't idk because I left right after I said it, but it felt good to get it out of my system a little bit. I feel like this is the only way to actually shut him up, but reddit, I don't want to scream at him to shut him up. 

I want to talk to him like a normal human being and I want to be able to help him understand that I'm an adult and even though I'll make a mistake here and there, for the most day to day activities I don't need his input. I would like to get to a point where he let's me figure out shit on my own and let's me do my own thing without hounding me about how I shouldn't go out so much (I usually go out 1ce or at most 2ce on the weekends) or I shouldn't spend so much money( I usually don't spend more than 20 bucks).

I didn't care about school when I was younger. The problem here is that since I never tried in highschool I don't even know what I'm capable of. (CS) degree has calculus 1 and 2 and I don't know if I'd even be good at math. 

Should I go for computer science and try it out or should I go for something completely different?",02Feb2017,7
50,"I never even had big dreams in my youth.  I keep reading about people who just lost their big ambitions and turned into some kind of empty shell, but I don't recall ever having them.  I feel...wrong.

All I wanted as a kid was to be normal.  I stood out for reasons that I have no desire to recapture - I came off as too smart (don't ask - I feel stupid often), I had weird habits, and I lost attention to what I was doing in favor of reading.  I just wanted them to go away, and I mostly got what I asked for.  Now I feel like I'm rotting in how much I'm blending in.

I'm supposed to rediscover and pursue something that never existed, to try and be something I don't want to be.  Improbably, I'm still considered smart.  But a smart person wouldn't have problems like this, a smart person would figure out how to be okay with himself and I just can't.

I want to chuck this ""potential"" at someone who actually wants to change the damn world, let them try, maybe in the hands of someone who wants it it turns out not to be a fake (I mean, it's most likely a trick of SAT words that never left my head coming out in my speech) and they actually pull it off.  But it doesn't work like that.",02Feb2017,2

53,"Details needed to understand the predicament:

My brother and I are very close. He has owned this business for four years, brought me on 6 months ago, and I've been very valuable to the team. We work well together. However, I'm finding that I could complete my role in the company with less hours, which would cut expenses and increase profits. At this job, I'm making barely enough to survive. I don't have benefits. I do have a 10% profit sharing. But I'm not making ends meet and putting myself further in debt. 

Okay, the job offer. This comes from a previous company I've worked for. They're offering me 15k more, all benefits, PTO, etc and would give me the freedom to work both jobs. I know exactly what is expected of me there. I would have financial security and work for a company I enjoyed. 

My brothers company is growing, but I think he took me on too soon, frankly. Is it wrong of me to want to cut hours to part time and try and do both? Should I struggle and stick it out for the growth potential? Is going back to an old job a failure? I'm cyclical in thinking about it and need opinions.

Thanks for reading! 

TLDR: Struggling financially working for my brother but have endless potential, or go back to comfort zone and have financial security? Or both? ",02Feb2017,4

58,"Fuck me, okay. It just slipped out. A little background: I'm shit at relationships. I don't trust myself in them. I broke up with my last girlfriend (4 years ago) because over the course of our relationship, she started to smile and laugh less and less. Even when she wasn't around me, her friends found her more withdrawn. I couldn't bring myself to risk hurting her further, so I broke up with her. That was the last time I spoke those damn words until about 10 minutes ago.

63,"Gonna use my alt that I forgot I had because reasons. I guess I'll share a bit of backstory, but I'll try and keep out super identifiable stuff, but if it's rant-y or incoherent I'm sorry, I'm kinda distraught right now.

So, like the title says, I have almost no motivation, mostly in school. I've got a job that I love and I work really hard there, but when it comes to homework I just... can't. This has been a problem for the last ten or so years, and I'm a junior in HS right now. Basically, if I don't get it done in class, it rarely gets done at all.

I've always been reasonably smart, so it's not like it's been challenging for the most part - for example, I got a 34 on the ACT, and though I haven't taken the SAT I got a 1420 on the PSAT, which are both &gt;99th percentile scores. But all my life I've never had more than a 2.7 GPA! And only then it's because I usually get so much time in class to finish...  I just can't. I see my friends around me get straight A's with relative ease and it just makes me feel worse but I still don't do anything about it, and I would rather stare at my stupid math homework for an hour than pull out the textbook and do it in half that time. I have three F's and it's only the second or third week of the new marking period, and I just am constantly feeling like I've basically ruining my life. Yet STILL I can't bring myself to write my god damn English paper that was due yesterday and would probably only take a couple hours to get an A. I'm lucky enough to go to a great high school where you can earn tons of college credit for basically nothing but since my grades are so low I don't qualify. I know I could understand the material but I have started to agree that I would just fail those classes the same as my high school classes. I just can't fucking do it. I stayed home from school today because I was feeling depressed about school work and instead of making up even a little bit of it I just laid in bed all day and procrastinated it. Sometimes I wonder if my body just can't respond to what my mind tells it to do??? I can't figure it out I hate it I hate it I HATE IT GAH I have hopes to go into computer science which I love but at this rate I'll be stuck working at a shitty fast food restaurant to pay rent. I don't know what to do, I've tried every form of motivation I can think of, I'm really starting to hate myself because of it, and I was just thinking that maybe what I'm missing is somebody who's good at yelling at people to yell at me a little bit and get me on that path. Probably not, I'm a fucking worthless piece of shit that won't listen anyway but it's worth a shot right?

70,"I [24 year old female] am getting really frustrated with doctors. I have seen 3 different doctors, with 3 different diagnosis. I am in excruciating pain from the base of my skull, shoulder, arm, forearm, wrist and hand including knuckles. The pain can be accompanied by tingling or a burning sensation.

The onset was rather quick, I woke up after not working for 9 days (along with doing nothing strenuous) with swollen knuckles, like I had knocked someone in the face...but I hadn't. I assumed this would go away, over 2 weeks it got progressively worse, migraines on the right side started from the time I wake up to the time I sleep, which is not very much mind you. I am maybe getting 1-2 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky. 

I decided to see a doctor and having no PCP since I just moved I went to an urgent care I had been to before and got right in. First doctor said he wasn't sure but took an xray of my spine and neck. He said everything was fine and gave me norco and Naproxen to deal with pain and inflammation and even told me he was just going to treat the pain, but if it persisted come back in a week. I got through the next few days with the meds and managed to sleep a little more (maybe 3-4 hours max a night) and continued to go to work. 

Now over a week later I go back to the same urgent care but guess what, different doctor who cared even less than the last. She didn't even examine the affected areas and told me she couldn't do anything since it was work related  (I do work on a computer but have never had this issue before, and if work related why start after more than a week of not working?!) I told her I had been having night sweats and cold sweats and a fever that was ranging between 99 and 102 for about 4 days. At this she said I had a sinus infection and gave me antibiotics.

Not satisfied with either of these answers I saw a family Medicine Doctor who examined me for about an hour. He gave the diagnosis or impingement of ulnar nerve  (pinched nerve) starting in the shoulder. He did some massaging of the muscles, prescribed me muscle relaxers and steroids (mind you, I'm already on gabapentin for anxiety but which also treats nerve pain). So along with the new meds and the Naproxen and acupuncture I still am not sleeping, the pain is unbearable at times, I have missed work and now lost my appetite. I've lost weight and I am fatigued all the time.

At this point I don't know what to do, or who to turn to. I'm worried about repercussions from missing work and my mental state from not sleeping and being in pain all the time. They all said it should go away on its own but I'm reading that's not true. At this point I'm still taking Naproxen 500mg, ibuprofen 800mg, flexeril 10 mg, along with stretching/massaging the muscle throughout the day and the acupuncture and rest. I'm feeling like giving up.

74,"I have relatives who won't honor a request to delete material sensitive videos of my deceased grandma.  In said videos, my grandma was not conscious of the recording and was undressed getting medical treatment.  She was a person who didn't like to look unkept, and I believe would not want to be immortalized at her weakest.  They also recorded her passing.  She was deeply religious and superstitious of spirits and following last rights to make sure they didn't stay.  I cannot believe that she would ever consent to being recorded as she slowly passed away.  

Their explanation to keep said videos was to keep the memory of them taking care of my terminally ill grandma.  Ignoring the fact that she was undressed and **she** would've been appalled to know that there's a video of her undressed.  Their explanation justifying the video is that nudity isn't bad in context that it was a medical procedure.  Except she never gave consent to being recorded.  Also, they mention they *may* decide to not show the videos of her undressed getting medical attention.

I can't go out or do fun things... I cant have vacations. My clothes are well cheap(walmart) which I don't tend to care but I don't like the looks I get because I dress that way... 

But I care less about that, the fact is I spent hours slaving away and my money goes to bills and more bills and I can't seem to have any money to have fun. Even if I worked more I'd just hit the tax bracket where I get taxed higher, so technically it's like I'm working more for less? 

I've been overly stressed and I know I shouldn't care so much about not doing much... but to wake up, eat, work, then sleep is kind of a sad existence. I do eat my 3 meals a day, and I have a roof over my head, and I'm barely doing okay with the rest of the bills but that means I don't get enough to do anything.


So what I am trying to get at, is there any legal/honest way to make some side money to have say a mini-vacation, or enough to do several things for a month even if it's not often?

So I met her and started talking to each other and got along really well.

We became best friends and people at school always shipped us for sitting together (Idk y). Which actually was very annoying and well... Just recently I've started to develop feelings for her.

Let me explain something beforehand, her and me have a little game in which we ask each other anything by turns. I once asked her what would she do if any of us (my group of friends) confessed to her (Side note: this was all before I decided that I had feelings for her). She told me that she would tell either of us that she only saw us like big brothers and added that afterwards things would be awkward if that happened.

So I always tried to leave these feelings behind for now I knew that it made no sense to have feelings for her if I already knew the answer I'm going to get. But just recently have I accepted these feelings and am concerned that I might lose a friend.
I know it is up to me to tell her but I want to know your opinion on what should I do or not do.

We were once at a school event joining both campuses of our schools and met lots of friends that I made in the past. I just came in and met up with my group of friends from my school including her.

We were casually walking and she was about to fall down so I grabbed her in a way that looked like I was hugging her or something. And one of my friends (girl) from the other campus saw this and thought we were on a relationship. I know this because my best friend knows her and told her about it.

I found a job that suits my wants pretty well, and they just called me in for a second interview. But because of my current (and future) workload I'm not sure if I want to take the job.
In addition, the commute is almost 2 hours back and forth and even with the higher pay I would be making less than I do now. But it would probably look good on my resume to have experience in more than just fast food...

But anyway, I'm actually contemplating quitting working altogether--at least for this semester. And I don't want to waste my or the interviewers' time by continuously taking the interviews (and possibly the job) if I decide I want to quit working. Should I continue to take the interview(s)?",02Feb2017,1
105,"Hey Reddit!

SO basically, our 1 year anniversary is coming up and as the title suggests, I have a crippling fear/hatred of heights and being high up in buildings. Only recently have I been able to feel a little comfortable atop the SkyGarden [London].

My GF has this dream of seeing the view of London from the shard and I can't think of anything worse than dressing up and paying to be whisked up to dizzying heights for me to have a panic attack and sweat my way through my nicest clothes :|

Is there any way to overcome this sort of fear without therapy? [poor student here!] and do you have any general advice for me?! 

Thanks reddit!

It's worth noting she does respect my fear and isn't trying to emotionally blackmail me or anything to go up the Shard- I'd very much like to surprise her! But being so high up my brain thinks of how unstable the building might be and I get this dizzying headache, feel faint, sweat profusely and basically an in-built urge to run to the lift and bail from the place ASAP... But I do really want to beat this thing and do a nice thing for my GF!
Perhaps I could substitute the shard for the London eye for now?

Idk.. Im clueless reddit- please help!

TLDR; I'm sh*t scared of heights but I want to overcome it to surprise my GF with a trip up the Shard! How can I beat this?",02Feb2017,21
107,"As stated in the title, I accidentally found the house of my favorite singer while Google-searching her. I found the property sale records provided by city-data, and have verified the information by searching the county database. This house is definitely owned by her, and I believe it is her main residence. Additionally, it's only about an hour drive from where I live. 

Obviously I'm not just going to turn up at her house and say hi how ya doing. But I've followed her for twelve years. Her music has gotten me through some of the darkest parts of my life. I would love to send her a letter to say thank you, or something. 

Which is exactly where the issue is: I can send it through official fanmail channels, but she probably won't ever see it. Or I can send it to her house, where she most likely will see it, but also might get super creeped out and maybe call the cops on me or something. 

Ideally I would like to open communication with her in some way.  Is there any way to do so that isn't majorly creepy?",02Feb2017,0

111,"Okay,

I'm a 17 year old who only has 1 year to finish high school.

I have skipped almost 4 years of high school due to me suffering from panic attacks.

I've started going back to school this year, and I realized that I could grasp the subject if the teacher teached it properly (though I still struggle a bit with past year subjects).

But lately, I've been feeling depressed. Anytime I think about school or going to school I just feel extremely sad. I can't really point out why I'm feeling this.

I've also been feeling suicidal and contemplated killing myself many times but I don't think I'll actually do it.

I've also thought a lot about quitting school since I think it takes too much of my time and it also gives me a lot of pressure.

I don't know how likely it is for a person to survive without a high school diploma nor do I know if it's even right for me to drop out of high school.

Even if I continued school, I don't know which college I should go to since I don't really have anything that I'm interested in (except music, but people say that isn't a ""real"" job).

As for what I would do if I actually drop out, I would work my ass sharpening my skills on making music and hope I could freelance as a composer or something (maybe even get a job for it).

Something to note, here in Malaysia, there's no alternatives like GED (there's GCSE but it costs a fortune which I don't think my parents can afford it).

Do please give me advice on the matter.
Thank you in advance.

112,"Dear r/advice,

I wasn't cared much for when I was a child, suffered from depression from the age of 14 on (I'm now 22). I already spent 10 months in psychiatry in the last two years and are completely stable (no bigger down) since 6 months now, which I'm really happy about. I still have no real will to live, but feel quite good and happy most of the time - or, so to say, my death wish is still present when I listen to my inner self. (Side note: Don't worry, I'm not hurting myself in any way or plan on doing so and I'm constantly in therapy and talking about it.)

I'm also pretty good already in being kind to myself, taking time for myself, ... But: I'm still struggling with basic everyday tasks that mean to take care of myself, e.g. showering, brushing teeth, or, yes, just make myself a cup of tea. Just thinking of it makes me nervous and anxious.


**Fett**Two theories for why that is:**Fett**
1) Most of us can't imagine being happy as a continous state of mind. If you are happy, your mind is already expecting a kind of drop-down in some other area of your life and that expection might even be the reason for it to happen, because we are used to our own ""average level of happiness"". So, ""Don't do too many things which you could make you happy, because that causes something bad to happen"" is basically what your brain and your subconscious  mind is telling you. This is definitely the case for me. (I forgot what this theory is called, but just recently read an article about it. If I'll find it again, I'll post it.)
2) If I'm doing such things as making a tea for myself, taking a shower or brushing my teeth, I'm connecting to a side of life where I've never been before - a side that treats me nicely and makes me feel like I belong here, that I'm welcome in this world. This is all new for me, and everything new is... adventurous? and frightening. Still, I can't believe that this is everything behind the curtains, because making a tea for example triggers me really hard emotionally instead of giving me the sense of a little peace I would expect (and see with the majority of people).


**Fett**Now my questions:**Fett**

Has anyone reading this experienced something alike? How did you cope with it? How did you change, manage or managed to get along with it?
Does anyone have a theory why it might be this way? I know you don't know me, but maybe someone knows an example because of their personal history / from a friend or relative / ...

Do you have any tips? The fear of happiness is something I only found two books about (in german), which are just giving the usual kind of tips - be kind to yourself, give it time, etc. - these are things I know and practice regularly, but **Fett**what I actually need is the braveness to overcome this fear and take the first step (e.g. making a cup of tea, reading, just daydream)**Fett** - again and again, since it frightens me every single time.

Thanks for every answer,
peace and love to you,

118,"I'm a 21 year old male from the UK living at home with my parents.

I've not had a job in 2 years and I'm struggling to find anything worthwhile where I am living right now. No girlfriend... I have some friends whose loyalty I've questioned recently... they are more like ""acquaintances"" to me but I would like to stay in contact with them.

I have some furniture/belongings but nothing fancy or big, and no savings but I do have one goal... to be happy and to start a career somewhere fresh and away from here.

I just want a car, a nice little flat/apartment/bungalow... a paycheck that allows me to treat myself to basic stuff... I'm not looking to be a rich happy-ever-after kinda guy I just want to break free and be independent from this mess. 

Why do I want to leave? 

Family. I love them all to pieces but I just can't stand the drama and the backstabbing and the emotional depressive petty shit they come out with all the time. I want to drop them, but I will miss them. I don't feel like I need them and they are the ones pushing me away.

I have mentioned to most of them that their actions are pushing people apart and creating ""gaps"" in our family and everything feels forced and it shouldn't be that way, they won't change though, they have had problems with each other for 10+ years and my family really likes to hold grudges. We were once a happy family who ate dinner together every weekend (cousins, aunts, uncles, nan, grandad, etc...) and enjoyed family gatherings at Christmas/Birthdays/Days out/Holidays together.

I have thought long and hard about this decision and what is realistic/what isn't. I know there will be massive stepping stones ahead and I can do so many things differently to what I've planned which is why I need some advice... I don't know if I'm making the right or wrong decision here but I feel like this is the right thing for me.

I don't want to get trapped down in this hole. Surrounded by negativity when I can be thriving elsewhere. I shouldn't have to put up with this and I won't. I choose not to. That is my first  step to independence and happiness.


Am I stupid?",02Feb2017,1
121,"Thanks for clicking my post. I will try to keep it brief.

I am a 27 year old British woman.

In February 2016 I was living in New Zealand. I worked full-time as an ESL teacher. I had new boyfriend who I thought was awesome. I rented a room in a beautiful town. It was the middle of summer. I loved living in New Zealand and planned never to leave. Life was pretty good, not perfect, but I was happy.

Today, I live at my parents house in the countryside, back in England. I am unemployed. I don't drive. I have no friends. I have been here for over 3 months. I feel completely worthless. I wake up in the morning feeling incredibly anxious. I have let myself down, and I have let my family down. I am a huge disappointment to everyone. 

As for the boyfriend, we ended up living together for a while before I have to leave NZ for visa reasons. I was devastated.

 I flew to Malaysia where I planned to backpack around for 8 weeks before flying back to the UK for Christmas, and then back to Asia to find a well-paid ESL job (easily done). But after just 2 weeks in Malaysia I'd had enough. I didn't want be alone in a foreign country. I had panic attacks every night. I missed my boyfriend immensely. After much deliberation I decided to fly back to the UK 6 weeks early. There was no point going on a trip of a lifetime, spending all my money and not enjoying it. 

I spoke to my boyfriend every day. He had become my crutch. We stayed together, as he was applying for a job for which he would be based in Europe. I had the opportunity to apply for another NZ visa, but I didn't as I didn't want to move back to New Zealand if he was moving to Europe. He got the job. But he was going to be based in New Zealand. I was so angry, jealous and hurt when I found this out. I was furious that everything in his life was working out so well for him but my life had gone to shit, but most that I had missed out on a NZ visa. I broke up with him and said some hurtful things. I later apologised, and we still talk a lot. We talk about seeing each again one day and maybe being together. But I'm not sure that is a healthy thing to aspire to. I am terrified he will met someone else and then I will be even more hurt.

So here I am. In the space of less than a year I single-handidly managed to ruin my life. I have no idea how to move forward. I applied for a 2-year work permit to Canada, but once I was approved I felt like I didn't want to go anymore. I am scared of starting alone in a new country, even though I have done it before.

I think my failed Malaysia trip and everything that has happened has knocked my confidence completely. Not even sure what my question is, I just wondered if typing all this out would make me feel better. Thanks for reading anyway.",02Feb2017,29
124,"Some backstory: I work at a family owned restaurant. Our prep department has 5 prep cooks. I'm their best one and I was rehired back in October after living in a different state for a few months. I was also a baker there at one point. The male owner is in charge of cooks, preps, etc. His sister is in charge of the small bakery department. 

This past holiday season she used me to bake a batch of cookies, a 3 hour job, whenever she needed them because her 3 part time decorators(bread guys and head baker don't do them either)didn't want to. Had to do 12 hour days since she asked me to come in before my real shift. I mentioned to the head baker before the year was over that I would rather do it on my day off. I've only had one day off a week but this week I was given two days off for some reason. 

Last week and a half, there was a cold going around. The brother(male owner) was sick, head chef was sick, and some prep cooks were sick. I got it Monday night.  I almost called out on Tuesday but took a bunch of medicine and toughed it out for 9 hours. Figured I would rest on my 2 days off. 

Haven't made cookies since December. The sister owner comes up and tells me that I'm working on Thursday to make cookies. She doesn't ask if I'm free or anything. She assumes I'll say yes. I tell her I'm feeling sick and I probably can't. She says ""are you fucking kidding me right now?""  Told her no. She glares at me, gives me an attitude and whines that she needs cookies made. Told me to call her Wednesday to tell her if I was still sick. I was worse and didn't call. Didn't want to hear her annoying voice give me an attitude for not doing someone else's job on my day off while sick. She also just recently rehired another decorator that worked there years ago who can also make them. 

None of her bakers/decorators like making them and she puts it all on me, without even asking. One of the decorators is on some vacation, another quit so she wouldn't have to be full time because of that kid going on vacation. And the other guy just vanished, haven't seen him in a while. Her brother already told me that he needs me for prepping before she needs me for baking. Even if I wanted to be nice and come in today, I've been awake since 3pm est Wednesday.

I'm not that great with social things, I'm a quiet person with social anxiety. What would you have done in this situation? Aka not calling on your day off to tell someone you're still sick and unable to do someone else's job for them on your second day off.

I'm also expecting she's going to yell at me tomorrow but I don't care, it's not my job. It's me doing a favor for her. I already made the decision to talk to her brother about not wanting to bake anymore for her. How should I deal with both of those conversations? She doesn't listen to reason and logic. I have no problem with her brother, he's cool and recently gave me a raise. 

I hope this makes sense and that it isn't too long, on phone so I can't tell. ",02Feb2017,1
127,"So I wrote this last night. Expressing all my thoughts. I couldn't go to sleep and I use writing to get the thoughts out of my head. 

So for those that are reading, read it fully. Feel free to ask questions and give me words of wisdom and advice. 

I just want to add in in the letter is. When the time is right in future I hope we can get back together. 

Here is the letter: 

Today marks the day where I officially miss Her. 

I miss the feeling of caressing her hair, hugging her, kissing her back, neck, cheeks, and lips. She was unique and one of a kind. I can't imagine the feeling of another guy doing the same thing i've done because I was the first one to do this to her and I wish I was still there to do that. Same to me, how she treated me with love and I miss that. I want to get back with her so badly, the whole reason why I hated our relationship is because she always seemed 'busy' where I just took it as an excuse because of the lack of communication.

I feel like now I can really see how busy she is and now I feel like I will have better patience to understand that she is busy. I just want to be with her and I don't mind if i don't see her for a week. As long as I see her eventually, I will make sure when I do it will treat her as if it was my last day on earth. I will text her unconditionally about how beautiful she is and how I love her so much. If only I can either turn back time or date her again.

I miss her, I really do.

People tell me to move on and yes I get it. I've seen people done it and I know I can do it. It just I don't know how long I will suffer and I don't know how long will it be until I am happy and find someone new. 

But for now, all I want is Her. 

She was my princess. I wish we can start dating again. We already restarted as friends, I just want to pick it up where we left off and be the man I said I was going to be as I wrote above. I still love her and I can't let go. There weren't enough kisses or hugs or any love for her. I just feel that I need to do it everyday to know that I love her and to show her someone loves her so much.

It sucks though, this stomach twisting feeling we all get. She probably does not care about me and I should let go. I wonder what she is thinking about me and I wonder if it's the same.

I'm scared for the words of ""I don't like you anymore, just move on"", I, I don't even know how I would react to that. Obviously depressed at most. 

If I ever hear her say that she wants to get back together god knows I will make her my wife and love of my life. 

I miss her, I love you [name]


Also, I feel that nobody gives a fuck about me so I am talking/expressing my thoughts on notes because I can only talk to myself. 

We were suppose to have dates together, and go to [city]

I miss the fact that I wish we could've went to [arcade], or go to an art gallery or the parkour place. I mean as friends, but friends always flop on me because like I said, I feel like I am a threat of a condition that nobody wants to take care of me, I simply just want to hang out. 

As that being said, I know she probably moved on and is happier without me and I am proud of her for that. I wish I can do the same and going back to her after that to make things better hoping she will say yes because now we are a lot stronger than ever. 

She's pretty, really. Beautiful human being God has ever created. Every compliment I gave her was from an expression of my heart, body, and soul. She's amazing, compassionate, loving; caring, loyal and everything I can ask for in a human being. 

Sadly. I did not care to notice it because I was too focused on the big picture or big problem not realizing that I have the most beautiful human being on this earth. 

It's so hard to let go. Really it is. I loved her so much and I still do. She's really one of a kind and I can't think of anyone, not one fucking person that can be like Her.

Yes I had no communication. But I did not understand how busy she was and she kept telling me that. That was communication and I should have understood it. 

Although, she did say 'i have better things to do' when I was trying to fix this relationship. Obviously every time I kept trying to fix it the wrong way and ruined it. 

'Better things to do'... This hurt me a lot. It really did. The person who I loved the most said this too me. This is also the reason why I can't go back. (See how fast my mood switched?) 

Anyway, I hope she changes because of that and HOPEFULLY the next time I date her she takes everything seriously.

But only time will tell. I still love her though. 

In addition though, I can't think of anyone that matches similar to her. I mean, every girl is unique and they're all different. So, her being my first love. I just can't think of anyone else but her...
Besides... it was so RARE to even have a girl so attractive and beautiful to like me back FIRST. 

Every fucking girl I wanted to date rejected me because I was the first to try. But until she came a long and Jesus Christ the whole 19 months we've been together was just impeccable or perfect. My true sweetheart so to say. 

So, who the fuck else is going to like me first. It's so hard for that to happen to me which my self esteem is low now because i feel like I am ugly. 

Well or I can be attractive and be way out of everyones league. But nobody's 'friend of a friend' came up to me trying to dance around the question of 'do you like my friend'.

As for Her. her friends are the ones that did that. So lucky, very lucky that what I wished for actually happened. 

That's why I wish it all back, I love my queen so much. She was the first to ever love me. Thank you for making me so happy and sorry for making it hard for you in this relationship. 

If we ever, ever get back together (hoping if you're ready of course) just know that I am going to fucking love you like no tomorrow. 

By that time or now, we have a better understanding of each other. And we can pick up where we left off because damn well I love you.

In the last week it came back, out of the blue, along with intrusive thoughts, that have become more severe than usual, centred around losing a family member.
I've had intrusive thoughts before, but not to this level. I argue against these thoughts, telling myself it won't happen, but it doesn't help. I'm at wits end. Haven't had this continuous feeling of anxiety either.

139,"I'm going for lunch today with a friend I have not seen in a while, I wouldn't say that we are super close friends and never really were. We hung out relatively often a few years ago but they moved out of the city and it just sort of faded off beyond the occasional 'Hello' or dinner.  

The last time we got together was in the early summer(June/July), my mom died in August and while we didn't see each other afterwards, they did text quite a bit to see how I was doing. We would make plans to make plans but they would never materialize. In December their long-time partner was killed in a car wreck just before the holidays, I was unable to attend the funeral because, as I mentioned, they live outside of the city and I myself was out of town for the holidays. I know they are having a very hard time, as is to be expected - she has been texting occasionally about it and I expect that it is mostly because she knows I have recently gone through a similar experience. 

My boyfriend is of the opinion that this is her reaching out to have somebody to talk to about everything, which stresses me out. I believe, however, that it is probably more along-the-lines of her wanting to have a normal social interaction with somebody to have some semblance of normalcy return to their life. She has closer friends that she has probably had to talk to, but I think knowing that I have gone through a loss recently as well means I won't treat her like she is broken. Otherwise, I don't think the meeting would be for a public lunch but rather a private, quiet get together. In either case, I have no idea how to approach today. I don't know if I should be cheery, sombre... I don't know what to talk about or say and I'm afraid of seeming like I don't care or that I'm being aloof. I've been reflecting back on what I would have wanted this summer but I prefer to just deal with things by myself and having the sympathy of others makes me feel wildly uncomfortable. Maybe I'm overthinking everything and should just gauge it as it comes.

So, has anybody had a similar experience? Is there any advice on conversation topics or how to approach this lunch? I'm terrified of saying the wrong thing. ",02Feb2017,2

142,"Hi guys,

So, my younger sister (19) recently found out she's pregnant. I'm the oldest of three siblings and my parents have turned to me for help and support. 

At first my sister was happy about the pregnancy, but now she's decided to terminate it. Doctor places it at about 7-8 weeks, so still early enough to abort where I am from. 

However in order to get to the clinic they need flights and hotel booked, my parents are pretty much tech illiterate so it's fallen to me to book this for them. Here's where my problem is, I do not agree with my sisters decision (not on religious grounds, I just feel there are better options available) and have been advocating for her to put it up for adoption as she doesn't want to keep it. I've not voiced these concerns to her as it's not my place. I have however made my view clear to my parents. I've asked my mother to talk my sister through the adoption option, however my mother was against it because ""I don't want someone else raising my grandchild"". I don't know if they ever discussed it or if my mother simple ignored it. 

Is it wrong of me to not want to assist with this decision? Should I talk to my sister about it?

Sorry if this came off as more of a rant, i'm quite upset by the whole situation.

147,"Hey guys. 

I broke up with my girlfriend about 4 weeks ago now, and I still feel absolutely horrible every day. Not a single day goes by where I don't think about it, and I can't seem to get it out of my head. She's absolutely fine which baffles me (albeit she's been in a relationship before, this was my first). 

Like...I want to move on, really, I do. But I'm seriously struggling to and it's just bogging me down now. I'm struggling to sleep at night, keep getting upset over it every day, and so on...

I have hobbies and stuff I do (Musical Theatre), and I try to socialise as best as I can, but it's only a temporary help. Especially when I go out clubbing, at some point I'll think about her and it'll just shit on my mood completely for the rest of the night, though I blame alcohol for that, haha.

One of the main problems I think is that, I used to speak to her pretty much every day, throughout most of the day usually, and call her too. And I have nothing/nobody to replace that with, I play video games a lot, but I get bored after so long and find myself not knowing what to do. Most of my days are spent just... sitting alone in my room. Now, I've always been a quiet guy and sitting alone is how I've always dealt with my problems, but this time? It's not helping. If anything it's making it worse. But any effort I make to hang out with people, or message people results in me just not getting a response so I dunno what to do anymore. I feel like it's tearing me apart from the inside.

I've never had many friends, especially girls. So (I know everyone says this), but I seriously loved her and thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with her. Then all those ideas we talked about, all them thoughts, gone. Just like that. And it really hurts. 

I've tried talking to other girls and stuff, but as said, don't seem to get much response/interest. I had a one night stand a few weeks ago with someone I know from my Musical Theatre society, but that just made me realise that it's not me at all to do that sorta stuff. I'm not that kinda guy...at least that's what I tell myself. But yeah...

150,"You read that right. I'm considering leaving my stressful, though rewarding, job in the billing department of a lab, in order to nanny for a family. I'm a mother of a 9 year old, and I'm hoping to have additional children in the next few years. So it's not like my career isn't going to be interrupted soon anyway.

Cons: $2100 pay-cut (going from 38,500 to 36,400), less flexibility with coming late, leaving early, fewer days off, unable to work from home, less prestige, not relevant to my career path up until now. Also, every other week I would have to stay late so they can go to church group after work, so that would be a night I don't get to spend with my family. That's probably the only real downside that I can already anticipate would be a challenge.

Pros: much shorter commute (takes off 90mins a day), because they are right by my kid's school, more pleasant day-to-day work, less stress to take home, less insecurity (I work for a startup, never know if my job is safe), might help me in pursuit of a teaching degree, might better accommodate having my own child in the near future, may be much better for my mental and physical health than sitting at a computer all day. Would be a joyful way to spend the day.

They have a 5m and 2.5y. I haven't had toddlers in a long while, so maybe I'm forgetting just how hard it is. Maybe I'm just baby crazed and instead of waiting to have my own, I'm just wanting to jump the gun.

Also, although we aren't trying yet, we may get pregnant during the 2-year commitment with this family. Idk if they will let me stay on and bring my infant to work with me. Would you? I'm afraid to ask. I've been advised to wait and see, and if it happens, well, hopefully they love me by then, and if not, I'll have some more recent nanny experience under my belt, making it easier to get hired. I can't afford to not work when we have kids, but I do not want to put my very young children in daycare, so I was planning to work in childcare during that time anyway. 

I'm just in need of advice. I can't tell if I'm making a stupid and impulsive decision or if this is exactly what I've been waiting for and I should just make the leap.",02Feb2017,1
153,"For as long as I have had concience, I know I have had depressive episodes. I swear my life is just some periods of feeling semi-normal between periods of deep depression. I have always known this but didn't ever tell anyone because:

1. I was/am ashamed of it, since I have always been the weird kid and admitting I have depression is just going to make me more of a weird kid in the eyes of people

2. I really hate burdening others with my problems, and admitting I have depression to my parents would be quite huge for them (at least that is how I think)

3. I have always hoped it would leave on it's own or whenever I reached some kind of ""milestone"", but it hasn't and it is becoming hard to cope 

4. I once tried telling them when I was 17, but they didn't believe me since I always ""look so happy"" and my Mom even started saying stuff like ""those are Satan's thoughts in your head, go pray about it"" while my father just acted kind of ""I cant believe this"" while repeatedly asking me if I was serious and needed a therapist (I ended up leaving the room and feeling overwhelmed and alone)

How can I tell them that smiling every now and then doesn't mean I am not depressed? How can I tell them I have been hiding my depression for years? How can I convince them this is real and not just a little bit of sadness I have right now, but a sickness that is quite literally driving me insane?

I've been with this girl for awhile now and she wants to get a place. I like her a lot and I want to but I can't seem to overcome my ways for her. I have a part time job which isn't sufficient. I'm not social at all, I struggle to even make phone calls. I'm not eager to work full-time. If I'm not handed things or if other people don't do it for me(jobs, auto-repairs, paying bills) than I'm not worried about it. I know that's extremely immature. I live in a low population state and even the cities and traffic here give me anxiety. I like material items but I can easily go without. As much as I love my computer games I don't need this laptop I'm typing on nor do I need money. My mom wants to move to a different state which I don't think I would enjoy My options are getting slim.

What should I do reddit? Should I break up with this girl and get the hell out? Move to a 3rd world or something? I like martial arts so I was thinking Myanmar and becoming a monk. Or Thailand and training muay thai. Or northern Japan(im aware its capitalist) as I've been studying Japanese for awhile.

158,"Ok so the situation is as follows. I am the care taker for my parents house. they no longer live there and we are remolding the house so we can sell it in a year or so. One of my primary duties is to take care of this cat.

No one wants or can have this cat. Neither my mom or my dad want him and neither of my sisters want him.

He has the occasional throw up or pee accident about once per month, and he likes to scratch the furniture. (not good for selling a house)

Now all of that is fine by me except the biggest problem. I am the only one in the family allergic to him. I give him attention for only a few minutes at a time before I have to go hide from him and blow my nose and rinse my eyes out.

And he cries constantly, hes probably lonely but its really hard for me to alleviate that.

I have asked  a few friends if they want him but his shedding and goopy eyes turn them off. 

I am not getting another cat friend for him.

176,"Quick background: My mother-in-law has stage 4 cancer but is improving.  She is done with chemo/radiation and requires no further surgeries.  This is her second bout with cancer.  She just received news yesterday that all of her numbers are good and only needs a shot once a month and should expect to live a long and happy life.  She's 58 years old.  Her boyfriend is 66.

She lives in northern Michigan, not much around, only family around is her long time boyfriend (15+ years) who lives with her and who is incredibly supportive and is doing everything he possibly can to provide and support.  She also has some good neighbors who are more than willing to help (drive her to appointments, etc).

My wife (her daughter) and I live in Washington.  My wife has one sibling, a brother who is in the Navy and is currently inaccessible by phone or email (he knew about the first attempt) and lives in Connecticut.  We all try to stay in contact often for support.

Early January 2017, my mother-in-law's boyfriend was at work and couldn't contact my MIL, became worried, called the police, and they found her passed out in the bathroom.  She had overdosed on pills.  They took her to the hospital where she recovered.  She was initially mad at her boyfriend for saving her, and refused any kind of treatment for a few days.  She finally came around, agreed to therapy, and was released from the hospital after about a week.

By that time, my brother-in-law had flown in to prepare the house and visit.  He stayed for about a week.  My wife flew in the day before her Mom was released and stayed for 11 days.  I flew in and stayed for 5 days.  She seemed to be making progress throughout the week and seemed to be herself.  During the time we were there, we were as supportive as we could be, and helped her take care of all of the things that were stressing her out (straightening away finances, offering to help with finances, getting her insurance situation straightened away, taking care of her taxes, little things around the house that were bothering her, etc).

My wife and I left last Sunday because my MIL had a doctors appointment in Minnesota, where her oncologist is (a 10 hour drive from home due to their crazy insurance situation which we're attempting to help them fix).  Her boyfriend drove her.  She was to be in Minnesota for 7 days.

She received great news from her doctor at her appointment on Tuesday, and then we got a call this morning (Thursday) that she attempted to overdose again on pills while her boyfriend was away running errands for a few hours.  He didn't want to leave, but my MIL insisted that he could trust her, and then immediately took the pills.  She is recovering in the hospital now.  This was only 3 weeks after her first attempt.

At this point, what can we do?  She clearly can't be trusted by herself anymore.  Her boyfriend has to work to pay the bills, we're all so far away.  We're happy to take a leave of absence from work for a while, but we also can't stick around forever.  She was stressing over the fact that we were using vacation time to stay with her already.  At this point, her boyfriend has essentially said that he's done.  We're not quite sure what that means, but he's beyond stressed and burned out.  My wife is now feeling all of the responsibility and doesn't have any idea what to do.  I'm at a loss myself.

Here are my two main problems:

- I have fallen out of love with film. I used to eat, breath, and sleep film and cameras but now the idea of picking up my camera and going out and filming feels like a chore. 

- When I was choosing a major, I went with film over computer science because I liked film and it was fun/interesting. I really regret not going for CompSci because it makes sense to me and I know I will make more money doing that than working in the film industry.

The first being working in the music industry. I have produced music a little as a hobby and music is just about the only thing I am truly passionate about.

The second being government work. Becoming an FBI agent or something along the lines of that would be perfect because I want to be able to help people and make a difference.

I have done volunteer work in the past, both in my local community and I have even worked with a group in Tanzania for a short time. I truly just want to help people and make a difference.

The truth is that school just feels. . . fake. It's cut off from real life and what I am looking for is for real life. I want to be able to overcome the greatest of obstacles but I've learned that if they are not real problems, then it is hard for me to put my all into. I am desperate please help.

207,"I was working from home today and was expecting a delivery from Amazon at some point. I got a knock on my door about an hour ago and the delivery-guy was just about to leave when I opened the door. We greeted each other, said some niceties, and that was about it. About 2 minutes later he came back and advised me that there had been an issue with scanning the package, and asked if I still had it. I brought it back over to him and he scanned it again, then confirmed my name and asked if I was the only person at the residence that received Amazon packages. I confirmed that I was the only person getting Amazon deliveries at my address, then he sort of fumbled about for a bit before saying that he believed he got it situated, then left.

About 15 minutes ago I heard a knock at my door, but was in the middle of work and didn't answer it right away. When I opened the door there was a note on some Amazon ""Sorry we missed you"" paper, and a handwritten portion that said, ""Hey ____, this is the Amazon driver if you don't mind can you call me at this #"" and a number written below that. I called him, assuming it was something to do with the package, and when I called him he proceeded to tell me that he had been curious about for me awhile, and when he saw me today it confirmed that he really liked me and that he wanted to go out on a date. I very kindly rejected the offer but was very firm that I wasn't interested. He then asked if he could come over and talk to me about it, because he was still ""near my home"" and could be over in a few minutes. He said he wanted to talk to me the second time he came over but that there were neighbors around. I once again told him no, to which he said he understood, and then we ended the call.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I don't necessarily feel as though I'm at a huge risk with this, but at the same time I live alone and feel fairly uncomfortable. I order from Amazon routinely but am rarely home to answer the door, and I don't recall ever seeing him before, yet he expressed interest in me and admitted he had been curious about me for awhile? I want to call Amazon because I find it incredibly inappropriate, but even if he got put on a different route or fired, he still has my name, address, and phone number, and (probably) knows that I live alone now. But if I don't report anything, he would still be coming to my home for deliveries which I'm not especially comfortable with.

Any advice for me? Is anyone an Amazon driver or have experience with how they would handle this if I reported him? I've had something slightly similar happen with an Uber driver, but luckily nothing came of it.",02Feb2017,18

210,"So it's been about 6 months since I started going to high school here in Sweden. When school first started I didn't really know anyone in my class and only about 3 people in the entire school, which led to me being able to talk with everyone, making lots of friends during the first few weeks. I'm a pretty open dude so I can pretty much talk to anyone without any real trouble.

After a couple of weeks in school I got to know a classmate really well and now we're what I'd call best friends. though over the these last few weeks I've grown kind of tired of him following me around everywhere. If I go to the library he follows, if I want to talk to a girl in private, he usually butts in.

I feel like this has also kind of ""disrupted"" my ability of being able to talk with other people since I'm afraid he'll randomly pop up out of nowhere with random things in the conversation.

213,"Hi, all. I'm a 20 yo female, first generation college student in my third year. I go to school 3 1/2 hours away from my family. 

This past weekend I had gone home to surprise my younger sister for her birthday. She just moved back home after spending one semester up here with me and getting so homesick that she threw herself into a depression.

On the way back, I was feeling kind of empty. It's been a while since heading back to school gave me the excitement it used to. When I was about 80 miles away from school, it started snowing bad. I hit a patch of ice and slid off of the road, totaling my car. I walked away without so much as a scratch.

My mom and her wife drove all the way up to get me and bring me back to school, despite having to work the next day. I kept bursting into tears - that car had been my mom's wife's and she had graciously given it to me without having a replacement. She knew I couldn't afford a car on my own and I still can't. They both assured me that what mattered is that I was okay. Then my mom said something that's stuck with me - if we can't find the money to buy me a new car, I could come back home to save money.

Right now, I'm living in the dorms and having to take a loan out. I go to school outside of Cincinnati and the rent is HIGH up here. I have an on-campus job that I love but I only make minimum wage.

The thing about moving home is that home isn't *really* home. My mom moved about 45 minutes away from the sh*thole I grew up in. I like where she lives. It's nothing compared to Cinci but there are more places to eat and grocery stores than anyone could need. It's only 30 minutes from an even bigger city that I could go to if I wanted a major shopping spree or night out. It's even excusably close to Nashville. 

I wouldn't even have to move in with my mom. I can afford the rent down there. In fact I could afford to rent a house (with a yard!!!) for the price of most apartments here. Not to mention, my lifelong best friend desperately wants to move out of our hometown and has expressed major interest in getting a place with me. 

I could finish my degree completely online and not even have to transfer schools; or, I could easily transfer schools if I wanted to physically go to classes. 

I've almost made up my mind to move home. I'm still making pros and cons lists and meditating on it. I don't want to be too rash.

The main thing is I feel guilty. I have loads of friends up here that I adore. Making friends comes easy to me, though. I have a job I love and that'll probably be my biggest regret. It's not a job I can keep after I graduate, though. Mainly...I don't want to feel like a failure because I worked so hard to come up here only to decide I may not want to be here. I'm sure people I graduated HS with will talk shit if they find out (and they probably will since they gossip so much). That doesn't matter much, though, as I'm still finishing my degree. It's not like I've already popped out babies and gotten married before I can even legally drink, like most of them have.

 I just feel bad. Is going home the same as giving up? In my head I'm already there - enjoying cook-outs in a backyard, celebrating my best friend's summer 21st with magaritas, watching my dad play guitar around a bonfire, hanging out at the local cafe and the good pub. 

I'm a family-oriented person. I'm happiest when I get to be around my sister and my parents. I've missed out on my cousin's babies growing up these past three years. I worry about my grandmother as she gets older. 

I guess the advice I'm looking for is...how can I make myself not feel guilty? 

I know happiness isn't some ultimate destination that I'll reach one day. No matter where I am I'll have good days and bad ones. I've been having a lot of bad ones here, though. I miss being close to people who I can rely on. Is wanting to be close to my family immature? Am I letting people down if I leave here? How do I ensure that I'm making the closest thing to the best decision for me in this moment? ",02Feb2017,3

I need some help here. Lately I have been very confused and lost about myself for the first time.
Ill make it as brief as I can:
22 year old female
Went to college 3 years ago, met current boyfriend
Had some bad experiences with drugs, a miscarriage and a 'friend' who threatened me daily to do drugs with her and hang out
Moved to different city with boyfriend, lived with his mom for a year to save money, my parents did not like that idea
Moved out to own place with boyfriend, now starting to feel confused about everything or if my past is just catching up to me.
My parents dislike my boyfriend, they dislike my job (hostess in a high end hotel with good pay..) and say I cannot do it forever. I honestly don't know what to say to them anymore. It feels they don't like any choices I make.
I dont want to disappoint them because I have not told them about my past, and thus I feel I need to make them happy.

I just don't know what to do. I have slight panic attacks by myself when I think about my future because, honestly, my bf and I have had a rough year with me not knowing what I want and my sudden breakdowns. We are different people, he can be manipulative, but I love him still.

Anyone similarly been in a situation where they feel they cant grow as a person and have been in 'limbo' for a couple years, floating through life? 

Please help. I love to travel and meet people. I don't feel the same person I was anymore and it makes me sad.

Title really says most of it. I requested every Wednesday off, in advance, as soon as I knew the dates for my therapy, which is allowed by their house rules. One sick day in four months. No write-ups, disciplinary actions, anything. 

30 minutes before I was regularly scheduled to get off, my manager calls me over to him, says my evaluation is up, and I'm being let go, because ""we need someone who can make all my shifts"", and ""the warehouse just isn't for you"". Neither of these I deem to be legitimate excuses, as besides the time I requested off for mental health reasons, like therapy or psychiatrist appointments, and excluding the one sick day I mentioned, I did make all my shifts, and I dare say I was good at my job.

Now, I know, because of some legal rigamarole, they don't need a reason to fire me during an evaluation period, but if Canadian law prevents any sort of discrimination for mental health reasons, does this mean I have a defense, or am I just shit out of luck?

241,"I didn't know where to post this, but here it goes. So I got back from a 3 month backpacking trip in Southeast Asia 2 months ago.  Before that I was living in NYC (just finished college), but sold everything and moved back home before my trip. I left New York for many reasons, mainly for the reason it's so expensive and that I would never be able to travel--which is my passion--so I basically had to sacrifice it for a better quality of life. Travel is my meaning in life and I'm willing to make sacrifices to do it. 

I'm back home now with two job offers. My intention is to save up so I can take another trip, hopefully in the fall.  The problem is one job is working retail (on commission) and its seasonal so it might end in May/June, and the other is part time helping out at a small (run by two people) marketing agency.  I'm torn between which to choose.  My parents want me to obviously go for the marketing position as it's what I went to school for, but after multiple internships, I realize I don't really like marketing and office environments. With the retail job I'll be able to make and save a lot of money and will be able to travel months at a time. My ultimate goal is to be a freelance writer, which I'm getting into now, so no matter which job I take I'll be doing that on the side with the intention of eventually doing it full time (hopefully). 

I just want to see what everyone thinks.  Should I take a risk with my future and go with the retail job, but have the freedom to travel like I want? Or should I suck it up and go the safe route and do the secure job that will ""build my resume?"" I've always believed that everyone should do what they love and that you should work to live, not live to work, but now I'm having doubts that I'm not investing in my future and years down the road I'll regret it. I left New York so I could have the freedom and means to travel, which makes me think why did I ever leave if I'm just going to go back into a job that I could've done there that wasn't bringing me fulfillment?
