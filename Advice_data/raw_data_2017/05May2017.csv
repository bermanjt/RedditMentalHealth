0,"Hello everyone, This might be a little long but I really need some help. I'm brand new to reddit, but I really need some advice on my life. To give some perspective, I'm a gay male in college and I just within the last year became comfortable with myself after hating myself for almost my entire life (I grew up in a Christian Conservative family). Before I graduated there was a guy who led me on. Honestly I would've never even thought he was gay if he hadn't treated me the way he did. But a little over a year has passed and we kind of lost communication and all we do is text occasionally, started by me. We have good conversations and I don't annoy him (I made sure) but I'm the only one starting the conversations... He used to pursue me and then after we graduated it completely stopped. In high school I wasn't in the place, my mental health was in the toilet, to start any sort of relationship with him and now I'm scared I somehow pushed him further into the closet. Now I'm considering trying to move on, but I've had 3 other guys flirt with me, some even similar to him, and it does nothing but make me miss him. I try to move on and then I get this massive feeling that I'm leaving the only person I'll be happy with... I want to hang out with him, but it just doesn't seem appropriate to ask him to hang out out of the blue. We never hung out before, or even made plans to, and we are pretty different people. i wouldn't even know what to do. I just want to see him again because he was always completely genuine when he was around me, not all this acting like something he's not junk. Any advice on the situation?",05May2017,1
1,"Basically, there's this guy who I hate. I'm not friends with him in any way, but he's on my team and he's just always... around. This guy and I do not agree on anything and I find his sociopolitical views quite misguided. While I am a liberal who believes in gay rights and racial equality, he is a conservative bigot who doesn't know anything about politics and calls gay rights ""disgusting,"" refers to me as a ""liberal piece of shit,"" and is an all around douchebag. I don't know what to do. Every interaction with him makes me want to scream and I can't take it anymore. Any advice?",05May2017,1

9,"Hey people! I'm 21 years old guy and I need an advice or maybe just opinion on my situation.I work as a nurse at local hospital and since I live alone I had lots of free time so I looked for a second income. I work with one MLM company but later realized I actually hate it. After that I got an offer to work for another company, I had a meeting with two guys from there and I started working part-time. From then, I started realizing that I may be a people pleaser person.

I love my nursing job and I just wanted to make eg. 200 bucks extra on my second job. But guys there told me that I will be the next best, I am gonna make lots of money like others etc etc. So I started spending all of my free time with them, I was tired after a 12 hour shift and they called me to come to office with them, I did, I didn't wanted to let them down. It's important to mention that this extra job doesn't have any fixed times you have to work. I could even work from home. And I realized it's MLM too.
 
Then one of those guys became my very good friend, we spend a lot of time together, but when I realized that I always agree with everything not thinking about what I want our friendship started getting colder. So for example, after one shift at hospital I was dead tired. My head was spining I was totally done. I fell asleep at home and woke up around 9:30 am at that time they usually want me to be in the office. So one of them texted me like ""What's up with you"" and when I explained him he started telling about how bad it is to sleep so long and that I'm not productive like that.

I get random messages from him, always asking what I am doing and then when I say something he always asks if it's productive or questions like that.

So recently I started doing things my way, and even my best friend is turning against me. I refused to go out with him after a hard day which I never did before and he now always talks about how I changed and that I need to ""fix myself up"" . There's nothing wrong with me I'm just trying to finally be myself. He works in that crazy company too and he too always checks up on what I am doing and ""makes sure it's productive"". Higher ups from there call me and want me to quit my nursing job because they say they see potential in me. But I love my job, I'm even planning on moving to a helicopter rescue team later. 

Tomorrow one of them want's to meet with me, even my best friend told me to go and talk with him because ""I need to be set on a right path again because I changed"". 

Am I doing something wrong? Also, they made me believe that when I quit this MLM I will throw away a once in a lifetime chance, I want to get rid of that feeling somehow.

It just feels like the world is turning against me since I'm trying to stand up for myself. Thank you for any kind answer. ",05May2017,0

I have not been very physically active because I am just so tired all the time. I want to change, but I am failing in every aspect. I try and then I break down, and lose focus.

21,"Back in November I had to find a new roommate to fill an emtpy room in my house.  Not too long before that I got a Labradoodle puppy named Lonnie.  I ended up finding someone that seemed to fit well (ill refer to them as X), but for some reason I was a bit apprehensive.  As the months progress i find several little things about X i dont respect.  She has brought over several (with my permission) former drug addicts for dinner which makes me uncomfortable, but try to see it as a way to broaden my horizons.  Ive had talks with her about it and made it very clear if anything happened then there would be an issue (theft, violence, etc.)  One of her friends who i like quite a bit has a dog as well which gets along with Lonnie really well.  In terms of a roommate X can be really great, x makes dinner, x hands out shots all the time, etc.  Fast forward to a month ago, x made and left a chocolate cake out on the counter, knowing Lonnie can be somewhat of a counter surfer.  With my luck Lonnie ate the whole cake!  X was very apologetic, but offered no kind of reimbursement for what had happened.  X, for the most part seems good natured, so I chalked it up as a loss, and an honest mistake.  Lonnie made a full recovery and everything was back to normal.  Over the next month i find out X has 2 kids that they don't have custody of with two different partners.  This fact, in particular, bugs me coming from a single parent household.  However, i chose to look past it given it does not effect me directly.  X pays her rent, her friends havent fucked my shit up, and shes hardly around the house to bother anyone.  Fast forward to yesterday.  One of my other roommates has been out of work for sometime allowing him to take care of the dog during the day (Lonnie is horrible in the crate).  Y, the roommate who has been out of work, finally locked something down for work.  Knowing the dog would be in the crate for 8 hours X offered to take Lonnie to the beach with her friend and her friends dog.  Now at this point i have thought of the pros and cons of this situation, but was thinking in terms of crate for 8 hours vs fun time at the beach with another dog.  I was hesitant, but ultimately decided to let her take the dog since X's friend owned a dog and was super good with her dog.  Now comes the sticky part....  On the way to the beach X stopped at a grocery store with Lonnie and her boyfriend/girlfriend.  X went in to get food and x's boy.girl friend stayed in the car with the dog.  When X came back she opened the door to put the groceries in the car and Lonnie ran out.  X attempted to get the dog, but, sadly she ran into the road and was killed.  Lonnie was just about to turn 1 and was treated as a family member by myself and other roommates.  My question for you is, What now?  Im devastated, as i said i was very attached to the dog. I am unable to fix the situation since a life was lost, but want what i had back very much so.  Do i continue to let X stay here? Do i ask for money to help with getting a new dog (as I said i so badly want what i had again with Lonnie)?  Any help or advice is appreciated. 



Other facts....


X has two DUI's
I own the home further complicating things financially and adding to stress (id need to find a new roommate in a short amount of time)


As it stands now, this event happened earlier today and i'm waiting on hearing from X and what he/she plans to do.


P.S. i apologize for any typos or any information left out, ill check back to see if i need to disclose anything else for advice.

I am a 25 year old woman. I have only had one sexual experience, but i have developed a huge fear of having HIV. I took 8 tests this past year, and all were nevative. The last test scared me because the lady taking the test seemed unfocused and took  a lot of blood. I am worried that she reused a gauze pad that may have had blood from another person on it..since then I have developed mouth ulcers and a stomach rash which has sent my worries over the edge.

To give some back story, he was upset that he wasn't invited on a camping trip with a few other friends of ours. However, it wasn't our decision and our other friends decided it was probably best not to invite him since he used to date one of them and she was bringing her new bf. Plus, we didn't have any extra room or gear for him. Therefore, they didn't want to stir up drama. He became upset and he's been being distant and treating my gf like shit.

I didn't even drink it in class so I don't know what the big fuss is. She gave us a rules/guidlines pagei n the first day of school and it might've been briefly mentioned that loud drinks weren't allowed but I think she went way overboard.

27,"Step mom and dad divorced last 4 days ago actually , I felt very close to her during there marriage. Before the official divorce they just had a breakup, where she moved in with her daughter.

Basically, she texted me yesterday saying "" hey sorry I was being weird the other day, it's just this was the month me and your father went on our first date and the first time I met you, I was getting sentimental. I replied saying "" no I understand, it's ok, are you sure you don't want no contact from me so you can recollect yourself?

She replied "" No babe your fine, maybe we can just touch basis once a week, unless you need to talk or something. "" In my mind I think that was her distancing herself, yeah it was sad, because we usually texted more often. So I texted her sure that sounds good, can we talk on the phone if you don't mind? "" I only asked that because I just wanted a clear understanding were to draw my boundaries.


I never got a response from, her, so after 2 hours I texted "" Hey I understand it's ok, I think maybe we should completely cut contact so you can heal, you don't need me causing a burden to you, it was a blessing knowing you, you have been very kind, staying in touch with me and checking on me. I just wanted to say bye, I hope you and your daughter stay safe, and I wish you happiness in life.

She texted me saying thank you, and I replied "" kick ass in life "" and she texted "" haha I should start with your fathers "" and I texted "" haha going to miss you. ""



I'm really torn up, I just never had a strong bond with anyone before. She taught me how to cook, and I remember me, her and my dad decorated the trees outside for Christmas, helped with my college process, cooked for me, and it really hurts remembering all these things knowing it'll never happen again. 


Today I texted her this "" hey I know yesterday I mentioned us completely cutting contact, but I just wanted to say that if you ever need or want to text or talk or anything, I'm here. If not thats cool to, its totally up to you. Take care. "" She responsded saying "" Thank you "" I replied "" No problem "", then she texts "" Me and your father have both moved on, but I will always be there for you "" I replied Thank you, and I want to be there for you as well "" 


So that was it. Do you think when she said I'll always be there for you "" is that her way of permanently saying good bye? Do you think she still wants to be a part of my life but to a lesser degree? Do you think she'll say hi now and then, or  was that her politicallyly saying good bye? I figure the best thing to do since I told her she could text or call me, that I should probably leave it to her to contact me?

Thanks.

34,"So this will be a long post, I can feel it. I'm 17 about to be 18 in a few days and up until, I'm gonna say November of last year I lived with my Biological mother. It wasn't a good childhood if my mother could buy pill to abuse she would. Along with the fact she was Bipolar and would never take the amount of medicine she was suppose my life was terrible. It was like we'd have good days sitting down watching movies, normal family things. Then the next day she'd be screaming for something that happened while I was at school, something that I couldn't have done.
Then she had a break down when I was 16, she thought that people were trying to kill us and dragged me across three states and would pull me from school. I eventually psyched myself up enough and called CPS and I got removed. I know live with my dad and my step-mom. I've never had a good home life. I never had birthdays, went to the theaters 5 time since I was 6, never allowed to go anywhere, had to teach myself how to take care of my hygiene etc. I had to lie to do a lot of stuff that normal kids just had to ask to do. So, lying became a part of my natural life, I was never caught cause she never cared. If I lied I got away with it but if I told the truth I got in more trouble then I thought it was worth.
Life was good there for the last bit of 2016, cause I'm living with my step-mom and Dad. Then I told a few lies stuff that I had been doing for so, long that it was normal to do my step-mom got mad at me. Then the day before yesterday I turned of the air conditioning, cause this house stays at 65 and I like heat. When she came home, and got mad, she asked me about it I didn't think and said that it had been like that since I came home from school. When she realized I was lying she got mad and wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the night. And Today I told another lie and she got pissed at me. As she was yelling at me in the car on my way to school, she said that if I didn't get my act straight before I turned 18 she would kick me out cause that is her house (She bought before her and my dad were together) and she won't put up with my shit just cause I'm her husband's kid.
I mean if she does it's not like I don't have anywhere to go I talked to my friends about it and they offered their homes if she ever did but I just always thought that maybe this would be the time. It feels that I just can't do anything without making it worst. If anyone has advice or heck, anything, I'd take it.

35,"I bought a musical instrument from an online supplier but the color was significantly different than the single photo on the webpage. I emailed them about it and they explained that the instruments are colored with a process that is inherently inconsistent, which I understand. The color I got is not bad or displeasing to me, but I am definitely disappointed.

So, **to be clear**: There is nothing wrong with the instrument's performance, it is just not the color I was expecting.

The company offered to exchange my ocarina for a different one (and they provided four photos to choose from), but they all look almost the same as mine, so an exchange would be pointless. Alternatively, they offered a 50% refund if I keep my current instrument, which would be $34 back.

The company advertises a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and I suppose I am only about 90% satisfied with my purchase, but I am still a bit morally conflicted on if I should accept a 50% refund for only about 10% dissatisfaction.

39,"I recently turned 23 and I feel so absolutely lost and stuck.
I spent my entire childhood and teen years moving from place to place (military dad) so as a result I never got to really keep any friends and I've never had a girlfriend before because I was switching schools every 6-12 months.
I also never finished highschool, due to the amount of moves we did my grades just kind of slipped and I dropped out around grade 10.


I of course have never been to college and had never really planned to either, that doesn't bother me much. But I'm at a point in my life where I think I've finally found my passion, and I want to go into the music industry somehow (Not necessarily just writing/playing my own music, I am open to nearly anything as long as it involves music in some way). Problem is, I've never learned how to sing or play any instruments, and I have no experience so I'm worried it might be too late for me, don't most people start that kind of thing really early? 

My parents are tired of me living at home and not contributing and are also seem worried about me ans my lack of motivation. I've never had a job before because I've just been trying to find my footing in this world for the last few years, figuring out who I am and what I want to do with my life. And I admit that I've struggled with procrastination and pure laziness, as well as anxiety and fear of change.
Now that I've decided on doing *something* with music, I feel like I've finally got some sort of direction to go in but I have no idea where to start. I currently live in an pretty small town and am quite isolated. There aren't many opportunities regarding record labels, recording studios, even just music stores around here. I mean, should I just go out and get a guitar and teach myself to play to get my big toe in the water? I have limited funds due to my lack of a job, but I am unable to drive because of some medical complications that make me a hazard on the road. I was thinking of finding a temporary job that allows me to work from home for a while to get myself started.

I really need advice on what my first step should be, what I can do to bring myself closer to my goals. I want to become more independent from my parents and get going on my career, and I think I'll naturally start to make more friends and meet people once I'm out working and experiencing more of the world. My inability to drive is a bit of a challenge, but I do have the option to take buses from time to time if I need to, and my parents are willing to drive me around a little if I need them to. However I can't see them really being OK with driving me to and from work every day, which is another good reason for me to try and work from home for now.


But seriously you guys, what the fuck should I do? I feel like I'm way behind everybody else my age, I'm mad that I've wasted so much time and I want to make some real progress but I'm totally stumped by what to do first. I'm also anxious about changing my life, but I know this is something that **needs** to be done soon or else I'll regret it for the rest of my existence.

50,"I've been really trying to get some things figured out before I enter my junior year of high school next year. I know this sounds pretty early for some people but it's better early than late. One of those things is what I want to do after high school. I've always dreamt of going to a good college or university, but I've been having quite a bit of trouble lately. 

The first thing is my major. I want to be a comic artist/cartoonist, something along those lines. My trouble is finding the right major. There's so many for me to choose from, depending on where I go, which makes it all the harder to choose the right one. I suppose this ties into choosing my minors as well, and I'm having the same troubles. I think for my minors I would want then to help me if I ever decided to try to do my own projects on the side (maybe full time someday, who knows).

The second trouble is finding the right college/university. I truly have no idea where I should go. Many have said to me that I should go to a art school like SCAD or Ringling, but their tuition is pretty high up there. Others have argued that going to a regular college/university would be better since I would get a general education which would help me in the future. I'm really not sure on what to do. Both seem to have their pros and cons, I just don't know which is more beneficial for my case.

The third trouble is (of course) tuition. I'm not from the wealthiest family, my father lives on disability and my mother isn't in the picture. My oldest brother is also about to go to college soon, so that makes things even more difficult. I would really like to try and find financial aid and scholarships that could help the costs, and I know scholarships vary on the school and state. I currently reside in Florida, and I know the in-state tuition here is said to be the best. Hopefully that bit of information is helpful.

This is about all I'm really troubled with. Advice on any of the above would be greatly appreciated!",05May2017,1
51,"Ok I give up and I'm not really sure where else to post this to. I'm dying to get some feedback! If you know of a more appropriate subreddit please let me know! 

I have a RC-1 Looper that I'm using with my Dean Koa acoustic electric. I have a DigiTech RP350 effects petal that I'm using to improve my acoustic sound.  No matter what level I play at, if I strike a hard high end chord (i.e. D major chord) and try and loop it I get terrible distortion on the play back.  When I play it regularly I don't get the distorted chord, it's only when I loop it.

My set up is as follows:

She started off just having conversation but later progressed into calling me things such as ""babe"" and has been getting more hands on too.

Not even apples, chips, shakes, etc.. If I use the microwave I'll get yelled at.

What's crazy is that my stepdad was always allowed to eat whatever and whenever. But he scolds me too.

58,"So tonight my friend asked me to do a kick boxing class with her at a local LA Fitness. She gave me one of those 3 day free passes to use when we get there. 

I go up hand this guy my free pass and say I wanted to use it, then he kind of stood there not saying anything and says ""well hey let's just go over here to a table"" I thought this was odd as did my friend since I wasn't signing up I just wanted to get into the class for the day. We go over and the guy (who still is holding my three day pass ticket) puts it in the table and says ""yeah so uh just put down your first and last name your email and phone number."" I didn't think this was a huge deal since I know they love to spam call you people that get those free passes. 

So I take my class all is dandy, I get home and I get a Text from a number that says ""hey what's up. I'm the guy who works at LA Fitness, you got a boyfriend"" 

Should this be something I call the manager about? The fact that I probably didn't need to put my info down on that three days pass that HE probably kept has me a little weirded out. He took MY personal info to hit me up. 

Is this something I should alert management about? What do you think? 



Update:
I called LA the next morning and spoke to a manger and then another manager later, sent a screenshot of the text and was rest assured by two women that it sure will be ""handled"" the one manager was actually so shocked and disgusted that this had happened. She sent me another two weeks free pass (thought they could have done more honestly but I'll take what I can get) and hopes that I return and don't have a bad frown about the whole ordeal.... we shall see.

So once I entered middle school I kind of became awkward. It's weird because I was never awkward. Then I developed a speech impediment (I don't pronounce things as well as before). This has really been affecting me because now my friends don't really want to talk to me, as I can't even carry on a conversation. I've been super depressed as a result. To try and alleviate it, I have dedicated my self even more to school (I have a 4.3), I've been listening to music a lot more, and I've recently started to get more into clothes. It helps a lot, but ofc that isn't going to solve all my problems.

I'm super friendly and everyone likes me but that's about it. A large majority of my friends, basically ALL of them, go out and party, smoke, drink, do drugs, etc. I'm the only one who doesn't. I go to school and I hear about everyone's experiences and I feel so left out. Because they all go out together and do those things they seem to have a closer bond, which I totally understand but I can't help but feel awful when I constantly get dissuade from conversations. On top of that I always get ditched by my 'friends' for them to go hangout with the kids who do drugs and smoke. My friends are literally the type of people who will ditch school to snort adderall or get high just to come back and goof around with each other. It's at the point where they constantly hound me to start smoking and drinking because I'm the only popular kid who doesn't. I don't have any desire to do drugs or smoke. The only thing I have considered doing is maybe drinking a little for my birthday coming up but even then I don't really feel like it. I'm not going to cave in and start doing everything they do because that's just not who I am. I'm the good girl. I'm just not sure what to do. It's not like I can just up and find new friends because our school is tiny. I mean our town's population is 3-4k. Everyone at my school knows each other and I hate to say this because I know it sounds shallow, but only the lame kids don't do drugs or smoke. Everyone does it. The hicks, the jocks, the popular chicks, and my group of friends.

63,"Hey guys, so here's the story, its long so hang in there. I knew this girl from high school. After graduating, we reconnected shortly after leaving her boyfriend (because of abuse). This happened in August of 2016, we would hang out constantly, then one day out of the blue, she blocked me which I thought was odd. Turns out she went back to her abusive boyfriend again. Well I dont talk to her again until recently, we reconnect again. She wants to remain friends and I agree to this. But because her abusive dickhead boyfriend is a monster, he monitors everything she does. He doesn't like her having guy friends (controlling) so to counter this she puts my contact name as ""Jessica"". He finds out and is now pissed, as he claims to know all her friends and their is no Jessica. Now a little about this dude, he is a cop for the police department in the area I live. This is physical abuse for sure, although I do see signs of mental abuse as well. He is very controlling, and has her in the mindset that when she is abused, she deserves it. I wanna help her I really do, but people around me are saying to stay out of it, that if it was that bad she would get herself help to get out of the current situation. But morally I wanna rat this dickhead out to whoever I need to because my thinking is you are either part of the problem or solution. On the other hand, she has told me not to intervene.

i'm aware that my early life decisions may have not been the wisest, so can we please skip the part in which we point out how much of a naive young adult i am.

so like a lot of kids who grew up playing music and fell absolutely in love with it, i withdrew from my classes at 18 to pursue it with all i had.  then life happened, chased partners, lacked discipline, hit writers blocks, became paralyzed with importance and so forth.  i've heavily enjoyed my early twenties and have had experiences i'm beyond grateful for; but i'm stuck.

i'm 26, turning 27 this summer.  i've been a barista for four years.  and i really don't know what to do.  i'm still very drawn to my creative endeavors, but can see how regardless of anything i'm able to create, i will remain at square one, in poverty.

i don't want to remain single forever.  you need money to date, that's for sure.

i've begun giving the idea of school some thought.  but i just don't know what to go for.  i'm interested in biology, nutrition, psychology, philosophy, and fields of that sort.

i also struggle with the thought of letting music go.  i'm and all or nothing kind of individual, and it's hard for me to really immerse myself into something without the thought of mastering it which of course requires time.  and between working a full-time job and spending the rest of my waking hours socializing and devoting time to music or study, I can only do so much and not both.  if i try to do both, then both will suffer.

i've given computer programming and coding a thought as well, as I can teach those things myself without college on the side and raise my chances of earning a comfortable living in the near future.  but the thought of staring at a screen for so many hours sounds highly unappealing and extremely boring for me.  work needs to be intrinsically interesting clearly.

so yeah, what the fuck should i do?!  any tips or wisdom any of you may have that may steer me in any sort of direction?

66,"I'm sorry if this post violates any guidelines. I saw one of the posts on the front pg asking how important looks are, and I feel that I need some advice.


In the comments, someone wrote that he went from obese to looking like an underwear model, and he realises just how much looks matter in terms of how he was treated by people. I too went from unfit (really really skinny, like 6'2 120) to 180 and pretty jacked.


However my face is really bad, even with a good haircut/shave, i have been told by girls that they would date me if they saw me from the neck down, but my face is a no-go.

Not to take away anything from what others have accomplished, but I guess I fell on the short end of the stick in terms of facial looks, and it definitely sucks being on this end of the spectrum.


My struggle is not internal. I am fine accepting the fact that I'm not a looker. I know the usual advice is to be funny and personable, but how do I deal with the external shunning from others due to my looks? 

I've confided in a few good friends who are honest with me and they agree that i don't look appealing at all. It sucks because I love socialising but it's hard when you try your best and get ignored because of my looks. Before you say I shouldn't be hanging out with people who judge me solely based on looks, I can't blame them as honestly (as my close friends have said), I really look unappealing.

67,"I'm an undergrad, and I was hoping to do research on campus for the summer, but I didn't get funding. The PI I currently do research for said he was sorry, but couldn't support me through his lab funds. I really thought I was going to get the funding so I didn't apply for any places (a mistake on my part, I know) so now I feel stuck on what to do.

I emailed another professor on campus whose research also interests me, and they said they only had unpaid positions open &amp; that I could feel free to meet with them tomorrow. I was hoping to get a funded thing there, but now I feel like if I told her that she'd think I was just asking her for the money and not genuinely interested.
Her research is really really cool &amp; I feel like I could get more involvement than what I am in currently. Her projects seem like very student driven projects, which to me signals very flexible and work in = work out. But I don't really know, because I haven't worked with her. Also, I feel that I won't be able to do meaningful work if I work in her lab &amp; my current PI's lab. Also, if I work with her lab unfunded then why shouldn't I also work in my current lab also?

71,"Alright I need some serious advice. So I fucked up big time with my roommate, who is a very close friend of mine I've known for a good eight years. I invited my girlfriend of eight months to sleep over at our dorm. Thing is, I forgot that my roommate had an exam the very next day (he already told me this), and I was the one that told her that it was okay. We were PDAing pretty loud, like idiots, and it distracted him to the point where he could only study after we fell asleep at like 5 AM. I was totally ignorant of this, and I'm a total idiot for that. But now apparently he holds a serious grudge against her, and actually hates her to the point where he wants to ""cut her head off"" (just hyperbole, he doesn't actually want to kill her). He even told me the only way that he'd feel better is if I personally told her that he hated her, or I allowed him to tell her himself. Or, by his permission, I can just leave it unresolved and tell her nothing. 

Now, this happened a few days ago, and he had only told me this an hour ago. He sent me a message saying he wanted to talk and I told my girlfriend because I already assumed it was about her, so maybe we could both formally apologize to him. But no, he is incredibly adamant that ""hating her makes him feel justified for being annoyed that night."" And he can't bring himself to hate me because we're close friends, and he's convinced that I only did this because of her influence, which made me careless, so it's technically her fault in his eyes. He never wants to see her again because even the sight of her now sickens him, according to him. I feel like I kind of have to tell my girlfriend this, but she's pretty sensitive about stuff like this, so if I tell her this it might really scar her and her relationship with people in the future, and our relationship, because she thinks she's burdening me. Even though this is all my fault (she didn't know about any of this), he won't bring himself to transfer the hate to me. 

Idk what to do here. I feel like this is going to make things awkward between him and I forever. Not only because he hates my girlfriend, but because he's holding such a strong yet easy grudge against a person he barely knows, for a mistake that /I/ made. Do I tell my girlfriend /all/ of this? Do I bring her for a formal apology.. even though he won't accept it? Or is my roommate actually a sociopath? When he told me this, he wasn't angry. He was just telling me this, with a friendly tone. Now, it's important to know that he has a past of holding grudges against people for wronging him just once, even if they didn't personally attack or insult him... he seems to relish in hating people. So I don't know what to do here. I've told my girlfriend nothing thus far, except that my roommate wanted to have a serious talk.  

EDIT: He really prefer I tell her that he hates her... he really seems keen on that idea. 

EDIT: He says he feels like he did okay on the exam, but we don't know for sure until grades are released. He's not really focusing on his exam performance though, he's really focusing on how much he hates her now.

EDIT for clarity: 

- When my roommate and I started to talk, I admitted to him that it was all my fault right then and there, because I already knew what I had done wrong.

- He wasn't really in a position to tell us to be quiet because we were doing things like making out, giggling, etc., though we were doing our best to keep quiet, we shouldn't have been doing that in the first place.


- The reason she was sleeping over is because we were studying for finals together and it was just convenient because the library is a two minute walk from my dorm. It's finals time right now, and spots in the library fill up fast so we want to go early. 


- My gf is the type of person to overthink things and I don't want her to feel like SHE is the bad person in this situation, and that I am. I feel like she would really care because she might think that she's intruding on my life. She always tends to take on the burden of fault.",05May2017,1

81,"Hello Reddit,

As the title says, I've got a little bit of a conundrum that I could use some advice on!

I share a house with my SO and another couple and are on good terms with one another for the most part.  My SO and I occupy the upstairs, they occupy the downstairs.  The house was built in the 1950s and doesn't have any cooling, which can make summers a real scorcher.  This isn't a problem for the downstairs dwellers, as it is the lower level and remains cool throughout the summer, but upstairs where there are all of two windows and a screen door temperature rise to uncomfortable levels.  The solution for us has been to open all the windows and doors, and set up fans to get a breeze going through the place.  This has seen us through some past summers with only mild discomfort, however recently the downstairs roommates adopted a cat which has expressed the desire to explore the greater outdoors.

My SO and I were consulted before they got the cat, and while it wasn't an idea we had a ton of enthusiasm for, it wasn't intended to be our responsibility, so we didn't see why we should stand in the way.  The landlord approved it, and they adopted.  There wasn't any contract or agreements that were drawn up about it.  There was a verbal indication when it was discussed that the cat would be encouraged to live downstairs, that's where the cat stand is set up, food, water, litter, etc.  It's not something we really thought needed any sort of enforcing or additional discussion, it simply didn't seem like it would be an issue.  The cat has mainly stayed downstairs, but forays upstairs, usually to sleep on a couch.  We've only had feline visitations into our personal rooms once or twice.

Fast forward to spring, when things start warming up.  Downstairs is still fairly cool, but upstairs is starting to get a bit toasty.  On warmer days, we've begun to open the windows and doors to keep the temperatures down.  A week ago while I was in my man cave, my roommates cat paid me a visit and beelined it for my opened window.  I quickly shooed the cat away and shut my door.  The following morning, my SO had left the door to my man cave open without knowledge of this incident and we had a kitty convict within minutes.  The escapee was recovered quickly, and the situation rectified for the time being, but this clearly isn't an isolated incident.

In our efforts to keep things cool today, my SO left the upstairs door open but with the screen door closed.  Unfortunately, the screen door has a broken latch, so when the roommates noticed this and saw (or perhaps had already experienced the escape risk) they closed the door and put a note on it that it should remain closed.  This isn't an issue - a door with a broken latch only presents a minor, but easily fixable problem.  The real problem is that as things continue to heat up, internal doors and windows in our section of the house need to be left open to maintain any semblance of a comfortable temperature - greatly increasing the risk of kitty breakout.

I don't want this to be the impetus for a shift in responsibility on the part of myself and my SO to restrict the movement of the cat, and things will definitely heat up both literally and figuratively if they expect us to keep our doors and/or windows shut to prevent this from happening.  Iâ€™d consider it inappropriate to have restrictions imposed on our own comfort by shutting doors and windows during this upcoming season.  It seems that the easiest solution would be to install screens for the windows, however these are side-hung windows, so opening and closing them would require reaching through said screen.  Iâ€™m not opposed to this, but I also donâ€™t believe that this should be our responsibility either.  Perhaps a kitty-gate at the top of the stairs would be another appropriate solution â€“ still, I think this should be our responsibility.

Iâ€™ve got no problem discussing this with them and Iâ€™ll replace the latch on the screen door within the next few days so that itâ€™s no longer an issue.  If the situation were reversed I definitely wouldnâ€™t want to make this their problem.  In fact I declined to adopt my retired motherâ€™s deaf cat for just this sort of reason.  I loved that cat, but it would yowl at the top of its lungs when it got restless in the middle of the night.  I wouldnâ€™t want to inflict this upon myself or others that need a full nightâ€™s sleep.  I guess I would expect the same of another pet owner in regards to this situation.  Am I wrong to think that?  Where should the responsibility for this lie?  Does anyone have any advice concerning the situation or have some ideas that might prevent escapes while keeping things cool?

TL:DR  Roommates cat believes it is an outdoor cat.  It is not.  SO and I live in a section of a house which gets uncomfortably hot during the summer.  We want to keep our windows and doors open, roommates donâ€™t want their cat escaping through said doors and windows.  What can we do to accomplish this and whose responsibility should it be?

84,"Sorry in advance if this isn't the right place to post this. Just looking for some advice for advancing my career. A bit of background info: I've been working in the same company for 3 years now. It's the first professional job I've ever had, and I got it straight out of university. I knew in the beginning that it wasn't exactly my dream job, but it was definitely a start and I learned a lot initially. But now I'm finding that I'm bored because the work is so repetitive and mundane (software testing). I feel like there's no career progression if I stay in this job, but at the same time, I don't have experience in any other fields since I've been doing the same thing ever since I finished university. 

&amp;nbsp;

To break it down...

**The pros:** 

- workplace environment is great, with friendly coworkers and the occasional free tickets to sporting events (our director is cool like that).

- job security - I have bills to pay, which I can afford to pay with this job.

- it's somewhere where I'm gaining experience before I can get a different job.

&amp;nbsp;

**The unknown:**

- Consistent wage where I earn enough to live comfortably now, but not enough to look for the future (buying a house etc).

- I'm good at what I do, but it's not challenging or engaging.

- I'm gaining industry experience, but it is not necessarily experience in a field I want to work in.

&amp;nbsp;

**The cons:**

- I'm bored and uninterested in what I do. The work is mostly repetitive.

- The wage, while acceptable now, is not ideal for my near future. The wage I'm realistically aiming for today, won't be matched with pay rises at my current job.

- No room for career progression.

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, do I stay in a job with a good workplace environment, and a consistent but low wage where I'm bored and uninterested. Or do I take the risk, try something new, in an area I haven't got much experience in, with the hope to earn a better wage or put myself into a position where I can advance my career?

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",05May2017,1

87,"I'm graduating this year and I really wanna go to Mexico to help build houses for the locals. The issue is that my parents won't let me go because they think I am going to Juarez Valley or something. I have tried to convince them that it is in Tijuana which is very safe. As parents from Australia they don't have a very good idea about Mexico. I have saved the money and I will be 18 by then, what should I do? I actually want to do this instead of schoolies which is Australia's spring break. What really pisses me off is that they say Mexico is very unsafe when in schoolies (which they are willing to let me go on) it's very safe while kids do speed, drop acid and get completely plastered every night. It's probably safer in Mexico than schoolies tbh and I have less of a chance of getting coward punched by a drunk teen in Tijuana.",05May2017,1
88,"Hey there, I am in a weird situation. (tl;dr at the end) 

I am 27 and have completed my Master of Science last year and have been hunting for a Job for almost exactly a year by now. It was pretty difficult and I had reached a point where I would have taken anything. Today, of all things, I got two offers at once, both with some significant pros and cons and I could use some advice.

One job is the opportunity to work three years for a Phd in engineering (in Germany they call it Dr. Ing.). It is a cooperation between my old university and a pretty large and renown chemistry company. I already know some of the involved people in the project. They all are really capable and nice. The project itself is quite a challenge, and since the company is paying a lot of money to the university, they expect quite a lot. So there is some pressure included. However, I think I can manage that and I see a lot of potential in it as well. Payment, however, is mediocre. (around 27k â‚¬ pre-tax a year - I should mention that my wife already has a pretty nice salary that could provide for both of us. [No, I don't want to rely on that and play videogames all day :P ]) Working times are surely more than 40h/week. Additionally I will have several working locations, one of them is a 1.5-2h drive (one way). Probably, I will have to be there 3-5 days a week. The other locations are not woth to mention (like 30mins by bike or so). With this, I see the chance to qualify (get my Phd in engineering, which is kind of renown in germany) and have better chances on the long term. I also get to know people in the company. So I hope for being able to get a job there, once I completed the Phd project (to their satisfaction, I hope). Additional long term bonus - if I manage to get a Job there after the project: At the moment, chemistry is one of the best paying industries in Germany.

The other job would start one month earlier and is some kind of public service, the work itself is probably a little less exciting than the Phd project. And certainly with less potential for the future. Nevertheless, since I am freshly graduated I could still learn a lot. It is pretty nicely paid (around 45k â‚¬ pre-tax a year) with a company pension plan on top and only 38.5h/week. Since it is realted to the public service, the development of the salary is regulated as long as I stay in that position. I think there is less pressure involved here. It is relatively close by, about 30-45min (one way). They have pretty nice offices, a low hierarchie and people seemed nice in the job interview. With this, I would have much larger short-term benefits. I would acquire working experience but no academic title.

So that are my two options. Right now, I am tending to go through the harder Phd project (you know, leaving comfort zone and stuff) and invest for the longterm benefit. But I would be really happy to hear some opinions.
 
I should mention that the guys of the first option are already counting on me. They would start right away if they could, but since the university is involved, there is a lot of bureaucracy to be dealt with and they are working as fast as they can to get started (at least that's what they say). So there might be some hard feelings if I turn them down now.

So this text turned out to be much more wally than I intendet. Sorry for that and any mistakes. 

Tl;dr: 
Option 1: medicore Payment, long way to work, more pressure and work, but a lot of potential. investment for long-term benefit. 
Option 2: nicely paid, shorter way to work, less work, less exciting (I speculate) and potential. larger short-term benefits.

Thanks for reading and your advice!

94,"Ok, so this is long, complicated and overall a bad situation. I previously had seasonal employment at a 24-hour gas station, meaning I worked there during my break from college. I worked in this place for about two years and did my job well.

Here is where it gets stupid, my last summer working there I was living with my parents, I had been scheduled to work the day I needed to move back to campus, I was preparing to go in and my mother informed me a co-worker had called and asked to take the shift as they were under hours for the week, and so my family agreed and I appreciated it I found out today my family decided to call in sick for me and not bother to have me do it myself, at the end of that semester I got a call from my parents claiming I had been let go from the job via mail. When I went in to fill out my separation forms I was informed my family had called to quit for me, I had not been let go, but by that point it was too late in the employment season to hire me as they had full staff. 

However despite this the manager was polite and cordial, and placed an x in the ""eligible for re-hire"" box and told me to keep them in mind if I had the need later.  This morning I stopped in to see about getting my job back, and the same manager was in, I talked to her and she told me that my separation was ""not on good terms"" and that I could not be re-hired as a result, not only this, she claimed in front of higher management that I never filled out my separation forms, I informed her that she was the one to have filled them, and that she had marked me as a re-hire and she just claimed she would check my file.

My question is this, how will this negatively impact my future employment options? I'm worried this one idiotic situation will prevent me from getting a job in the future and the worry is making me physically sick, I hate the thought that a dumb stress fueled mistake in my 20's may have permanently messed up my life

TL;DR my family basically ran interference in my employment, quit my gas station job for me while I was away at school, and even though I was marked as a possible re-hire the manager is claiming I am not as I left ""on poor terms"" I am worried about this effecting the rest of my professional life

So i am a 19 year old male. I graduated high school in 2016 and have not gone to college. My parents pressured me to go, but i didn't want to go becauae i have no idea what i want to do in my future. I'm lost.


I work in construction with my dad for the time being since graduation. I have finally gotten to the point where i *despise* waking up at 5 am and coming back home at 7 pm. Whats the fucking point of living my shitty life if im going to slave away in 100Â° heat or 30Â° cold? I'm trying my absolute hardest to make my dad proud, but its slowly eating away my sanity as well. I can't handle another fucking day here. 


I need help. I need *something*. A goal, a wish, ambitions... something. I don't want to work in construction... at least not in this company. It's corrupt. Apparently if you marry into the company, you feel like tough shit. I have more dirt on my hands in 1 year than these types of assholes have im their 5 years married into here.


Please guys. I am asking for your help and forgiveness. I just... need something to let me know that something is worth fighting for. My dog is keeping me in this life, but i am afraid that one day will be my last because i am going batshit crazy and i might off myself. Should i go to college and just study something? Help


edit: Thank you for your replies! I am still at work until 7... again. So i will reply to as many messages as a can.

111,"So I have been at a technical college in SC for the previous 3 years (started Fall 2014). I moved from NY therefore paying out of state tuition for the first year (2014-15), then applied for in-state tuition for 2015-16 and was forced to prove that my parents did not support me any longer. Which is the case, as I moved out and have not received financial support from them since then.
***
Fast forward to this year, I've applied and have been accepted to a state university. They have requested that I fill out state residency certification, which I have done. And they deemed me a non-resident. Despite being living in state since August 2014, licensed in state since October 2014, worked 2 jobs (one part-time and one current full-time), and purchased a car and registered in state in December 2016. 
***
According to the school, financially independent students:
&gt;Financially Independent students are those who provide the MAJORITY (51%) of their own support. That support may come from earnings or income from employment, investments, or payments from grants, scholarships, commercial loans in the student's name or payments made in accordance with a court order and some, but not all, trusts.

This applies to me, IMO. As I've been supporting myself for almost 3 years... 

This follows that previous paragraph on their website:
&gt;If you are financially independent, your residency is based on whether you have physically resided, and been domiciled, in South Carolina for the twelve (12) continuous months immediately preceding the date classes are scheduled to begin for the semester in which you wish to claim South Carolina as your state of legal residence.

This also applies to me I believe, as I've physically resided in state for almost 3 years. 
***
Maybe I'm missing something in the finer details or something, but I can't seem to find it. It seems like I would have a good case at getting a decision overturned, but I'm unfamiliar with this process since it states I cannot apply for residency review again for the same semester.

I have a graduate degree and I think I have my sanity other than PTSD and other severe anxiety.  Otherwise, I don't have friends/family, I don't have good credit, I don't have any savings, I don't have my health - can't even walk, and there's a lifelong history of violence and abuse and poverty.

It's all my own doing as I stayed in an abusive relationship for 6 years too long.  By the time I was ready to leave, he made sure I had nothing to leave with...  On top of that, I mean, I may never be able to walk again...

I guarantee you if I end up on the streets and something happens to me, it would be exactly like that...  

I'm not close enough to anyone to matter.  We've had fun together and I'm sure I'm smiling in their photos and maybe they can remember my name... but, no one is praying I'm ok before they go to sleep at night. 

Even at nearly 40, is there time for me to have a life where people would care if I live or die?  Is that possible with all of the obstacles in front of me... I mean, I have to be able to walk, see about 6 specialists with no insurance, get teeth fixed, file bankruptcy and then, rebuild credit, find a job, get a car, get a house, lose weight, then, work on my mental health from the abuse... 

i'm just worried I'll never fit in again and, because of that, never have a life and never have any sort of support system.  I've had friends at other points in my life but before, I was able to fit in because all of my scars were easily hidden...  Now... not so much...

Please read the whole thing.

I'm 17 years old and I am really interested in filmmaking . I love seeing other peoples work ,how they do what they do,learn about their stories and watching tutorials on film making.

I graduated high school  and its time to start applying to colleges. 

I ended up applying for a degree in Business Administration [BBA] (something which I have NO INTEREST in) and I was rejected by  one of the universities I had applied for( I already knew I wouldn't get in) and honestly I don't even care.I suck at these exams.

I have this hollow feeling in me right now because I know I like fimmaking ,I know I have interest in it.
Whenever I start looking at stuff related to filmmaking ,I feel this interest and happiness in me. 

Like you know the feeling you get when you are doing something you like..but at the same time when I check out stuff related to the Business degree I had applied for ,I just feel pissed off,angry and depressed.

My parents are supportive and want me to be happy (like any other planet) but you know at the end they want me to be safe ,financially stable and have a secure job.
(get what I am trying to say here ,right?)

I am not after that.I can't imagine myself sitting in a cubicle ,doing boring stuff I have no interest in and attending meetings in a room with a long table.I just can't do it.

I wanna be doing something I like doing! I know it's not gonna be easy but I am ready to work hard.
I don't see a point in living a life doing something miserable and then just die.

For some reason its hard for me to decide if I should just get a degree in Business from a university ,something I have no interest in. Get a job..work..work..then die or Go to filmschool...and do something I love..

The manager at the hotel has done everything for me. He's made accommodations for my current school schedule, allowed me to work despite not having 1-year's availability, and even rented out one of the suites to me for a few months to live in. Though I am good at doing my job, I've been late to work a handful of times, swapped shifts, and taken 2-week long vacations (all of which they've been very considerate of.)

Even after everything they've done for me, I can't justify putting a part time job before university. It makes me feel incredibly selfish and guilty that their efforts were not enough to make me stay.

So after seeing somebody in Trevor's apartment cleaning up and feeding the cat, we weren't as worried anymore. Well he showed up back at home yesterday, and my boyfriend chatted with him in the afternoon.

Trevor had left to get himself some help with his addiction. He had started using again (specifically what he was using, my boyfriend didn't ask) but now he believes he has the tools to stay sober and also get over the depression that he has been dealing with.

My boyfriend told him we were worried about him and Trevor was surprised but happy about that. He also said that we're here if he wants to chat or hang out or anything, and Trevor said it would be really helpful if they just hung out every once in a while, shoot hoops at the apartment court or whatever. 

So that is the update. I am very glad Trevor is ok and had the right mind to get himself help when he relapsed.

I have a friend who is in a bad relationship and her family and I want to tell her that she needs to get out of this relationship. We think she is in denial and we want to tell her to get out of the relationship but we don't want to be so aggressive with it that she feels backed into a corner. Any advice on how to approach this topic with her or any thoughts would be really helpful. Here is the back story for clarification:

My best friends sister has been in a relationship with a man for almost 10 years. At first we all kind of thought he was a prick but nothing he did was a cause for concern. One night about 8 years ago we were hanging out drinking and he called my best friend a bitch out of nowhere. Her drunk ass escalated the issue by punching him in the arm and he stood up and shoved her full force into the TV. He stormed out and since then we have never liked him much. I tell that part of the story since I do have personal bias in this situation.
Since then he has gotten very weird. He constantly talks about how reptilian aliens have infiltrated the government and how he has found ways to see them. He says that the other planets in our solar system don't exist. He believes he can curse people. For example, my best friend's, dad's, best friend had died and Jerkboyfriend said it was because he had cursed him. He is also not at all supportive of my best friend's sister (we shall call her Shelly). Jerkboyfriend is always calling Shelly a nerd and talking down on her because she likes star trek, star wars, anime, ect. Jerkboyfriend does not ever go to any of her dance events or family functions. Currently Jerkboyfriend does not have a job and has not for 3 months.
The reason I am seeking help is because Shelly is now pregnant with a rainbow baby. She left him while she was pregnant, the first time, because he was unsupportive. When Shelly had her miscarriage a lot of bad things happened around the same time and because Jerkboyfriend was supportive and loving to her through the ordeal, she took him back. Now that Shelly is pregnant again, he is not supportive once more. Jerkboyfriend has expressed that he will not be at the hospital when the baby is born, he does not want anything about the pregnancy on facebook, and he doesn't even want to tell him mom; ""She will find out eventually.""

Didnt really have  a social life all those times and am still socially inept.

All things said I am in a good position in life except for the occasional flare ups( and the massive fall in confidence and faith in myself due to that. I go to a decent enough college and my grades are not bad. However probably due to being ill a good part of my early life I developed no ""passion"" in any subjects, there were just subjects I like studying and those I didn't, which makes me jealous of people who have a passion so to speak in life. I also am socially awkward and hide my condition from anyone I know except family. Its really embarrassing for me to disclose this.

138,"I was one of those people who believed in themselves to make a difference, I'm not one to give up and I'm always keen to learn new things in different fields. I spent years thinking that we'd just blow up but it didn't work out. There were always moments of 'cool we should do this, or contact this person or that', I drove out at the moments notice to meet my co founders, if something needed to be done it'd go to the top of my list. My programming knowledge didn't involve web programming (mainly java) but I went out of my way to spend hours/days/weeks/months learning it, I started from knowing basic HTML/CSS code that looked familiar from uni to building my own website with a database, back-end to front-end. The languages involved for something like that is knowledge of basic programming principles, syntax for languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and frameworks. During our time I'd offer and drive us to where we needed to be, they drove occasionally though honestly most of the time it was me driving. It was me sending parcels out to customers. It was me talking to our supplier overseas. It was me posting on social media (i'm actually the only person that posts to two different social media platforms, one of them never posts). It's also me placing the orders for production. They haven't travelled a lot, but even decided to travel overseas leaving me to do the work. At the time i was happy to, because I was still driven but when I look back on it now I feel used. They have been overseas 3 times total - sight-seeing, partying. I went overseas once to visit family - no parties, just an old town but good food at my age I'd rather be partying living life but I chose to better my skills and make a small difference. It sounds so stupid right now.

Yes they're at work and they can't send parcels or talk to the supplier at the moments notice, but not much gets done when they get home. There's money to test new products but no one looks for them. There's money for ads but the only mention of it is 'I'll work on it this weekend'. 

I can see the potential the business can go to sustain itself but currently it's not making enough money, I'm at the stage where I can implement a new website design and an app. But I no longer have the drive or faith as I use to in my friends, though I'm going to have to force myself to not go berserk on them cause while they're in their day time jobs I'm the only one working on the company; which I don't do anymore I'm focusing more on myself. I know it takes time to build a company, but if my two co founders are doing very little work or not prioritising any of our work like I am then I don't see why I should be slaving away making a new platform for it and it's going to take longer to succeed.

Currently I'm looking for a job. I just finished a small project of my own that I can use to showcase my front-end, backend, and database work. I'm not done with the project yet but it works, as my vision for it can be expanded. I'd also like to present my idea I also have another project that I am not quite invested but have begun, both of these are quite a large task for one person.

It's not that they're lazy. They hard workers. One is a designer for a large firm and another in finance, sometimes they have their busy periods and I understand that but when it comes to the company, it's at the bottom of the list. The designer is also involved with another friend with his business. And the finance guy is more social. Other than that seems family events are more important, same with gf's and friends for that matter. I get told I'm like a brother but being treated as such is another matter regarding the company that is.

I know they think this company has slipped, as one of them occasionally offers ideas to me to build a new web app, which is nice but somehow I know they'll want a stake in it. I honestly don't feel like working with them with any new app idea, I don't believe they have the passion to work unless there is money involved. Money drives them a lot.

I guess that is my downfall and also perhaps a strength to have loyalty and belief in what you do even against the odds, maybe I'm just working with the wrong people when I thought these smart friends were going to make a difference. I just didn't believe how much they were motivated by money as they didn't grow up with much, neither did I for that matter, I'd say we were in the same bracket.

Thanks for reading about my situation, I know most of it is just me blabbering on but it's late. On the bright side of things with my time with them, we had great times and lots of laughs, I did learn a lot, and learn new technologies too, I wouldn't say it was the result of the company to learn it, as it was inevitable to learn them to progress further. 

If you guys have any words of wisdom, maybe telling me how I can let them both down or tell them I won't be participating in the company as much in the future until I'm needed that'd be great. I want to go onto the next chapter of my life (house, job, travel, a wider social circle) and I feel like they both have progressed in their life but me.",05May2017,1
141,"Side note, I don't post much at all so please forgive me for any mistakes. 

I love my mom, I really do but she's been driving me and everyone else in the house up the wall lately. I'm 19 years old and just recently quit a retail job but I'm looking for a new one. I've thought about moving out once I found a job that could support it but I really don't know where I would go apartment/rental wise. Anyways back to the issue, for the past few months all I have heard is constant complaining about anything and everything... She talks to my dad about these projects like the giant carport we started last October doing it ourselves but then complains when they end up costing a ton of money and not being done in a week even though she sits inside and doesn't really help in the process. The money issue and complaining has caused some tension between both of my parents and I just try to ride it out. She constantly acts like she is the only person that does and chores around the house like washing dishes, folding clothes, ect. but she isn't. Granted we all go through times where we don't help as much as we should but we get chores done around here. I have a hard time of telling her really anything because she is so damn judgmental, I can tell her a thousand good things and one bad thing about any of my friends and she will always focus on the bad including a girl I just met that she doesn't even know. There is just so much negativity and it has gotten extremely old. I feel like maybe if I move out or get a job or something that our relationship will get better but I have no clue. My dad recently talked to me about it because she is pissed at me but I still don't really know what I should do.

144,"I don't know if you guys know what it is. At least I did not know until my friend called it out, when we talked about it. Basically, I am a really creative person. My mind is filled with thoughts that I love putting on paper. I love to draw, write music, write stories, but I can't. For some reason I have lots of thoughts that I don't know how to put them. What I'm experiencing with those three things looks like this:

I actually can't draw but I'd love to learn to, but I can't even imagine what would I even start to draw. Total emptiness. And I know that if I would just imagine a picture, I would draw it. Not perfectly, but practice makes perfect. 
When it comes to music, which is my passion, it looks like this, that I have lots of melodies in my mind. I actually wrote about 12 different melodies which 2 of them were really great. But that's where I am stuck. What I am doing is producing electronic music on my computer and I have those melodies but I don't know what to do with them. What sounds to use, how to even build the rest of the track (intro, chorus, etc.). Again emptiness.
When it comes to writing, that a lesser problem. When I have something on my mind I write it down, but it doesn't give me what I want. I don't feel relieved. 
I mostly want to do something about music and drawing, because it's how my mind talks.

Well, today, she casually brought up that she smokes in her room with the windows open and I was not okay with that. The idea of getting second hand smoke really bothers me (even if I don't smell it myself).

146,"I'm a part time waitress and college student.  I had to leave the job I was at for 6 years due to new management running that place into the ground(in my opinion).

Got a job at a new place that seemed ok.  I was very explicit in the interview that I was only available for a max of 3 days a week until finals were over and 4 days a week through the summer while school is out; they agreed to this and hired me.

The very first week I cleared some time to bust out the 3 days of training, then they said I had to work an extra day to have my first night on the floor solo, ok I did that.

The next week, week before finals, they called and asked me to work an extra day because they were short.  Me being new, I didn't feel like I could refuse even though it was the week before finals and I needed all the time I could get to study.

They tried to call me in on Saturday too, but I had to complete a project with a classmate that day and so I refused that one.  This week is the first week of my 4 day availability which I dutifully submitted several days ago.

Today I wake up to a 6 day schedule!  What the fuck!  All arrogance and modesty aside, I know I'm good at what I do(apparently out of 8 or so people they've hired I'm one of the only three that made it through training and onto the floor) and I know that they're shorthanded but that's just not my problem.  While I am grateful for the job I am not about to burn myself out for this place.  I'm already putting up with some questionable shit there, like paying the cc processing fees on my cc tips, no ability to switch shifts once the schedule goes up, etc.

My plan at the moment is to go in today and tell them there is absolutely no way I can work 6 days a week and if they won't change it I'll work out the current schedule til Sunday and then I'll be out.

Anyone have a better plan?  I know that if I roll over this time it'll just keep happening and I don't need this kind of stress. ",05May2017,1

153,"I work in an architecture office and spend a good amount of my time preparing proposals for open requests.  Last month, in preparation of one such proposal, I was tasked with putting together some renderings that required me to photograph the building in question.  The lobby of said building could not be captured well without a good wide angle and our office cameras were unsuitable.  I proposed I bring my own camera to do the job and I was given the go ahead.  The following day I went to the building for the first time and documented the space to the best of my ability with my camera.  After the shooting was done, I returned to the office.  My intention was to upload the photos to our server but for some reason, the cables I assumed we had for the transfer were missing (some micro or mini-usb).  I went home with my camera that evening and came back the following day with my camera and the requisite cables.  I did what I had to do that day and packed my camera up in its back along with the rest of my equipment.  At some point just after office hours (people were still in the office) someone entered, hid behind some walls and columns and went to my work area where he saw my bag in the corner of my desk and took it.  He opened my bag, looked through its contents, seemingly heard a noise and ran out through a separate entrance.  This was all caught on tape as a surveillance camera was positioned perfectly to catch it all.  At the time of the theft I was not at my station, but it was after hours so I may have either been gone for the day or been elsewhere in the office.  I spoke to our accountant and my boss (who is dodging the issue) and have with me invoices of nearly every item that was in that camera bag, bag included.  A police report was filed and I should have access to it in the coming days.  The accountant keeps mentioning the office's insurance to see if it might cover it, but I believe since my company owns the entire floor (not leased) in our office building, I should be compensated regardless of the state of their insurance.  The other component is the building itself which is supposed to be secure, and since the theft of my camera they've been hiring security to patrol the building and been changing keycards and other things.  They are refusing to pay at all as is their security consultant.  What are my options?  Am I in the wrong for thinking my employer should compensate me?  Personally I think I should be reimbursed and my employer's insurance or the building should cover his loss.  If my employer refuses to pay, what can I do?  Am I screwed?",05May2017,1
155,"I've been dating this girl for 4 years and 7 months now. We've been going at this friendship-based relationship. Along the years she has always been not too serious about me, in the sense that she'd rather treat me a friend than as someone special, so naturally I'd do all the relationship work. She always had said that she wasn't that ready for a serious commitment, since college and a question of her future comes to her mind. Recently though, she had been warming up at random moments.

After Valentines' Day this year she went a bit cold on me. So I mustered up the courage to quote what she said before, that she wasn't ready for a serious commitment. I asked why she'd let me stay.

Thats when the downspiral started. The convo from there went downhill. A solid month went by from her thinking things. And THEN she decided to meet up again.

She said she let me stay, because she wanted me too stay. However she still isn't ready to commit, and she doesn't want to be selfish. That she loves me. She really does. But she doesn't want me to wait for her to be ready, because you know. The future is uncertain and all that.

156,"It's been 3 months since I last spoke to this group of friends that I had. They were really close to me, really supportive and caring. They knew a lot about me, and I think in the end, that's one of the things that drove me away.
I can't stand it when people know too much about me on a personal level, and I think I'm ashamed, because they knew about the several times I tried to commit suicide and was in the hospital.

But also, I've ghosted them a lot before. Not for as long as I have this time, though. The times before, I only ghosted them for about a couple of weeks. Two to three at most. Every time I did that, it was because I thought it was better for them if I just left, because I didn't want to worry anyone anymore.
I also think I was still ashamed and trying to run away from everything.

But one time, I started ghosting them because of family problems I had. I didn't want to tell anyone about it, because I'd caused them all so much trouble already, so instead I just fell off the radar for a couple of weeks. When I came back, everyone was... Different. (This would've been the third or fourth time I disappeared) 

I apologised, and everyone /accepted my apology/ but still acted extremely different towards me. To the point of alienating me. Everything was different and I couldn't take it because it hurt a lot to stay around people who I thought were my closest friends but were acting that way towards me. Yes, I know, it's my fault for ghosting them all those times before. It's my fault for being so paranoid and absconding more times than necessary. It's my fault for not trusting them and in turn, betraying them despite all they'd done for me. But, if they didn't accept my apology, I feel they should've come out and told me. Confronted me. Told me to my face that what I was doing was wrong and they won't forgive me so easily. I would understand, after all, I deserve it.

But I can't stop thinking about that group of friends, even though it's been so long. I planned not to come back again when I started ghosting this time, but I think a part of me seriously wants to go back.

I don't really know if I can, though. If I do, of course I'll be treated with the same alienation I was prior to this - if they even accept me back.

What should I do? I don't know what the right thing to do is. I don't know if I have the guts to go back. But thinking about this from a third person point of view, maybe it's best for everyone if I just left once and for all.

So, I'm a really talented journalist, not to toot my own horn. I have a ton of experience for my age at different publications, and I'm sending out applications everywhere in hopes of finding an exciting adventure for myself after I graduate. I plan on living with my Uncle in the city or my friend in Austin, Texas.

I mean slapping, which in reality didn't physically affect me as much as it did emotionally. I loved her with everything I had and took her to SO many shows and events she had always dreamed of since we were friends at first. However, this past valentines she dumped me and went out with another guy that same night on Valentines. This was out of nowhere and also I should probably mention that it was over text too. So not only did she dump me over text message on Valentines Day, but she proceeded to go forward with another relationship with a guy I later found out she was with while also dating me. It  is still fucking with me. After all of this she told many people that I threatened suicide if she ever left me...which was not at all true. At all. I would never take my life on such a manner. I just have yet to understand even after all of these months why she would want to pack it on with that.

169,"Finally went up to my crush yesterday. We didn't really say anything to each other. My friend was paying for a decal we'd ordered, and she said his hands were shaking when he handed her her change. He also kept looking at me when the transaction was with her. It was clear that he was nervous. I'm pretty sure it was because of me, but I don't know for sure. 

I guess I should give the backstory that lead up to this. I was friends with this guy for a while then we went to being sexting buddies, then we went back to being friends because he was worried because he knew I had a crush on him. 

He eventually ended the friendship because I would say stuff like ""I know you don't like this, but...."". The thing is, I mostly used it in jest because I didn't know how else to start the conversation. I would usually say before saying something nice, complimenting, or flirting with him (he said he was cool with my doing that stuff). I.e I would say stuff like ""I know you don't like this, but your sexy was adorable"" or he would tell me he'd been sick and I would say something like ""I know you don't like this, but I wish I could take care of you"". Also, this had been going on for months and he never said anything about it before. I called him on it, and he said he thought it would stop on its own. 

Anyway, he ended it. I asked if we'd ever talk again and he said ""maybe down the road, but I don't think you will."" He's kept me on all social media. He even accept a Facebook friend request (I'd sent it when we'd first started talking) after we'd stopped talking. I kept messaging him every so often. It's like I'm addicted to him. I still message him sometimes, but he never says anything, except for two exceptions. He'll message me to let me know he's okay after I see him get hurt in a wrestling show (he's a prowrestler), and he went out of his way to help me when I was helping my dad order a decal from the printing shop where he works. 

My friend and I went to pick up the decal yesterday, and he was sitting at the counter. My friend handled the transaction, but he kept looking at me the whole time. I can't make eye contact, but I made and held eye contact with him. It even looked like he was giving me a wry smile at one point. It was kind of clear that he was nervous. I think it was because of me, but I don't know. I'm really hoping someone could help me sort this stuff out. 

The rollercoaster I went on because of it last night, caused me to get a 6-pack of 12 proof beer and start drinking it through a straw while I watched Troma movies in VR. I got so drunk that I fell asleep on my kitchen floor face down in my own vomit. I'm not going to go into details, but I was probably the drunkest I've ever been and I REALLY embarrassed myself. 

I'm hoping someone can help me sort this stuff out because I'm really confused on what to do or how he feels. I know I should probably walk away from him, but I can't. Other women have hurt him and I don't want to just be another woman who does that. Plus I'm head over heals for him. I've only been around him a few times, and everyone of those times (besides yesterday) has been at a wrestling show, but I still feel this magnetic electric pull towards him.

Ok guys here's the deal, first things first I've been in and out psychologist and psychiatrist for the last 8 years or so. I have obsessive and schizoid features and there is a lot of discussion if I am not a full schizoid. But today I have a situation that might shady.

So I asked on reddit about a situation I'm passing (I used another account), basically I hurt someone, and I was trying to make amends but that person simply doesn't reply to me, she initially had me in her contacts but didn't reply me at all, but about 7 seven years ago she deleted me, and since then I sent her 3 e-mails and she never replied once.

I talked with fellow redditors, and they told me I should let it go. I tried to follow the advice, my family and friends advised me the same and I also tried justanswer with the same results, but in order to keep myself in check I decided to visit a psychologist. I choose a random person, it was really a first come first served case, the first one available was the one.

I told this psychologist my whole life story and that I wanted to seek treatment (psychotherapy) and she recommends me something quite unusual, something that pleases me but is wrong.

She tells me I should face her in social networks, for me that was always a no-no, if you want to contact me you should do it by email, and rarely (myself I tried to contact the girl three times in seven years by e-mail, never got an answer like I told) I personally would take it as an offense so I never did. She tells me I can not leave this feeling my whole life because it will eat me up, she also taught ways to communicate with the girl without making her feeling ""like a puppet in my hands"", she told me also I could write ""If you don't want reply just put an X if you forgive me"". She told me also I should never seek to meet this girl personally, because that's feeding my obsessive side. But wouldn't it be trying to chat with this girl also feeding it? Last but not least she told me if anything works we can try something called the empty chair, that is usually reserved to ""talk"" with dead people.

I told the psychologist my life story and she was quite shocked, she even apologized to me for having such a bad life. I never seen a therapist like. My question should I trust her or should I GTFO and find another one? Can I trust her?

Trust me, I wasn't about to go searching for someone else. As far as I was concerned I was pretty freakin lucky to have one decent guy interested.  But he won't freaking leave it be. 

All of this is super ironic considering;

A) the man's porn habit. (I don't know how much he views, I don't know if it's an addiction bit it makes me feel like s***, but that's a whole other separate issue.)

B) 2 weeks after my daughter was born I found out he had been texting his ex-girlfriend because he was lonely, and needed someone to talk to. What makes it worse is that he was really torn up over this girl, still brings her up way too often to be normal, he almost talks about her as if she was the one that got away. 

C) last year when I caught him with porn AGAIN, I also caught him looking at a ""Local singles looking for hook-ups site"". He insisted that he hadn't created a profile and he hadn't talked to or met up with anyone. He said he just wanted to see who all he knew on the site(we lived in his very small hometown at the time).

Anyway, I'm a SAHM. I stay the f*** at home. I go to the grocery store, the library and the park. I lead such a wild and deliciously depraved life. Organic produce! Whoo! Clifford! Bring it on! Monkey bars! What!?

I do not, nor do I plan on ever having, a freaking side dish. Why in the fecking feck, is this a constant theme in his interaction with me?!

182,"I (24m) just broke up with my girlfriend today because we both were just not happy. We are a young couple my girlfriend (20f) decided abruptly to join the navy with such short notice. I would have been fine with the decision however she told me. She is going to go whether I like it or not. We have been in a relationship for two years. Recently just acquired a new apartment and left job opportunities to hope we can make this work. She stays at home, and I currently work and take care of all the bills. Coming from work I constantly see her friend here that just fills her mind with negative energy and bad habits. There is hardly a time I see them hang out that they are not drinking or getting into trouble. I understand she can go out but it seems that she doesn't see why I get angry and worry. She only thinks I am in a bad mood. It's crazy that today I gave her the decision to choose myself over her friend. She packed up and left and I am devastated and swears in on Monday which leaves me in awe she just said she was I'm enlisting a week ago. Her family loves me. I am going to school to become a computer engineer and I work a full time position. I am lost at what to do next. It has completely shattered my world. ",05May2017,1

186,"My son has been in a special education program (pre-k) through the local public school system for a couple months now. His biggest issue is a speech delay but he has some other developmental delays and sensory issues as well. A couple weeks ago, he was officially diagnosed with autism. 


I sent in the paperwork with his diagnosis to the school immediately and have asked to meet with his teachers to discuss any necessary changes to his IEP. After speaking with his case manager, it would seem that the only change they want to make is just wording. Instead of ""developmental delay"" they want to change it to ""autism"". That's it. While we still are going to have a meeting, if this is the only change, it leaves me quite angry. The only specialized one on one care he gets is 20 minutes of speech a week. 


I come from a family of teachers. I get it. I'm not blaming the teachers in any way. I don't fault them for being strapped with time and resources. In the upcoming meeting though, how can I push to get additional treatment? There's a local autism school in our area but it can cost quite a bit out of pocket ($20k annually). As a single-income family, that's not feasible. BUT if the public school can admit that they're unable to meet my child's needs, and that he would benefit more from the autism center, then admission is free of charge. 


Going to the autism center would be ideal. How as a parent can I push for this tactically without insulting the teachers or staff?",05May2017,1

191,"My boyfriend had decided that this year when he graduates, he didn't want to go to college, that he wanted to go to trade school. At first, his parents really wanted him to go to college- but then they'd changed their mind when they heard about the quickness of trade school (one year to become an LPN, or licensed nurse), however he changed his mind and decided to go to college after visiting our local community college with me a few days back. Now they are telling him that I am a bad, negative influence on him because I stopped him from going to trade school, apparently- even though this was his decision. Also, college is now free in New york state. I think that it would be harder to go back to college after many years in the workforce, (like so many people have told me, they never went back) than it would be to give college a try and if all else fails trade school is an option. It's free now, and there's such a wide variety of oppertunities for him. What am I missing here?

*tldr; My boyfriend [17 m] Parents are angry that he changed his mind and decided to go to college, and not to trade school, even though it's free now and he has virtually nothing to loose and all to gain. They are blaming me because I'm going to college and he's changed his mind.*

194,"I'm a 24 y/o college dropout. I have always wanted to have my own at home business selling handmade crafts, I never saw my future self as a career woman, and I never thought college was ""right for me."" That's all changed now that I realize education may be my only way to make enough money to move out of my parent's home. My mother and stepfather recently decided to buy their retirement home and my younger brother and I had no choice but to move with them because rent was too expensive where we lived before. My parents both failed to secure jobs before coming here (they started looking at least 6 months before they bought the house and it's been 8 more months since then) and they just quit their jobs this past month and moved here. It was just me and my brother in the new house before that. Now I'm the only one with a full time job and I can't save any money because EVERYONE has their hands in my pockets including my real dad who lives nearby. My mom promised me that she would help me through college, but she's the reason I dropped out in the first place because she forced me to go to a school I didn't want to and then stopped paying my tuition. She also promised us a second car so we could work and get around, but my stepdad totaled the car she bought 6 months ago so she had to buy a replacement for herself. We lived in NYC before so we had our independence even with no car, but now it is vital. I rely on my real dad to get me to work and he causes me so much anxiety that I've wanted to quit since I started. My mom convinced me to stick it out and now she is asking me to help pay her bills. Now I'm not gonna pretend that I'm not an adult and it's okay to mooch off your parents, but I just think that she should be trying to figure out how she and her husband are going to pay the bills in the future.

It has definitely helped me become a little more outgoing, but it's starting to really wear on me. I can't handle crowds like I used to be able to, and I find myself less willing to interact with customers than I used to. 

What's holding me back is the fact that, at my age and with limited experience, I probably will end up stuck working a similar job anyway. People have suggested applying to my schools book store and such, but they are seldom hiring.

198,"Hello reddit. New user here, technically my second post, but this is just an expansion of the first in a more relevant subreddit. I'll give the complete details this time.

So I met this woman over a year ago, and as cliche as it is, I fell in love with her almost immediately. She was in a happy, committed relationship at the time however, so I kept my feelings to myself, even as they grew, and as we became closer and closer friends.

Eventually, the context in which we would regularly see each other concluded (we played a Pen &amp; Paper RPG together) and we almost completely stopped spending time with each other, and my feelings still did not diminish.

Jump forward to a few months ago and she reached out to me to come to a game night with her and her friends. I leaped at the opportunity. It may well have been that she was just reconnecting with an activity she felt I would enjoy, but when I got there it was fairly apparent that she wasn't doing as well as she was pretending to, so I was more focused on being there for her.

Turns out she and her boyfriend had started, and still are, going through a bad break up. I'm ashamed to admit that at least some small part of me was happy about that, but as a whole, I just wanted to be there to support her in her time of need. I started making the drives down to spend time with her, and we each opened up to each other on much more personal levels. There is absolutely no doubt that we've grown much closer than we had ever been before, but my perspective on whether or not that's been just as friends or the beginning of something new is patently biased.

Oh, just as a disclaimer, I am a virgin, and I've never really been in a relationship.

Anyways, I felt confident enough that we were starting to become more than friends to take the risk of asking her if she would like to go on a camping trip somewhere we could spend the night looking up at the stars. She emphatically said yes.

As soon as she did, planning out every detail felt like the most important thing I've ever done in my life. We already determined a venue (Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania; somewhere she had plans to go last fall and was really excited about but had to cancel last minute), and I've been trying to think of everything I need to make it as wonderful of an experience as possible.

Let me stop right here with another disclaimer: I know she may very well not be ready for another romantic relationship, and that she may not be interested in me that way, both of which I am completely at peace with; having her in my life in any capacity, and having any kind of presence in hers is more of a blessing than I could ever ask for. I just wanted to let her know that if/when she does decide she's ready to look for something, there will always be something here waiting for her.

Back on topic, I have a tent and an inflatable air mattress already, and I'm going to get an oversized outdoor blanket to lay on, but I wanted to add something more personal to the trip. I started making a playlist to listen to as we stargaze, but it needs expansion and refinement. The idea came up as I was listening to Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemKqzILV4w). Since then, I've added Coldplay's ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC26XpXjSVw), Eminem's ""Space Bound"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JByDbPn6A1o), Chris Hadfield's cover of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo), MGMT's ""Electric Feel"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZexg8sxyk), Guster's ""Satellite"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAkvb2Rhces), Coldplay's ""A Sky Full of Stars"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7NtW_hKJI), OneRepublic's ""Counting Stars"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg), Benjamin Francis Leftwich's ""Atlas Hands"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyue2N1XZ0M), AURORA's ""Under Stars"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWHALoCzPM), and Muse's ""Starlight"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgum6OT_VH8).

If you couldn't guess, a wistful, melancholy, and/or romantic vibe is priority one. Actually relating to skies, stars, or space is a big plus, but not essential. I don't really have a strong leaning in terms of genre, as I love the dub/trance aspects of Under Stars, the chill of Chasing Cars, and the more broad emotional spectrum expressed in Space Bound, but... no country... Also, with very rare exception, I'm not looking for anything instrumental or otherwise lacking vocals.

I'm planning on picking up a good portable speaker to play it on, and I'll be borrowing my friend's mophie to keep my phone full of juice. Also, I say quite sheepishly, I picked up a few... items... just in the off chance the mood gets a little... intimate...

But here's where I'm asking for all of your help. Are there other things that I should bring or buy for this trip? What about the playlist? Any songs you would recommend I add, or remove? And what about just how I behave on the trip? I know better than to force anything on her, and I don't intend on being too forward (we already say 'I love you' and deeper derivations of it to each other on a regular basis, so I would have to be pretty explicit to go beyond the established norm; we also hug and hold hands, so I don't feel like I'm reaching too far by thinking there's a bit more than friendship there, but still), but are there any dos and don'ts you would advise?

Again, I really don't know what I'm doing in this situation, so any and all advice would be welcome and greatly appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text; long post is long.

I feel like I'm wasting my youth and I hate that I'm not growing myself as a better person. Before this problem occurred I was attending college where I didn't knew what to major in and had no friends as well. Since this year began I stopped attending to go focus on pursuing a job.

208,"I am an 18 year old female who just finished her first year at a university. The past year I spent there was exciting in the sense that it was fresh, new, and full of opportunity, but also one of the worst years of my life emotionally as I went through a painful breakup and made no meaningful friendships the entire time I was there. Until this year I had always been an upbeat, extroverted person who made friends easily and enjoyed new situations; but something about being an 8-hour drive away from home and losing my girlfriend/best friend left me feeling extremely isolated and made every unsuccessful attempt at making friends feel like a stab in the chest. Being there put me in a dark place that I truly have never experienced, both mentally and physically. I have sense decided to transfer to another university that has a stronger program for my major and is closer to home.

Fast forward to today: I feel great. The semester has just ended and I'm back home surrounded by people who I love spending every second with. Unfortunately, I am wrestling the decision of whether or not I should take up an opportunity for an internship at my old university for a month out of the summer. The start date is steadily approaching and I cannot make up my mind about whether I could stand another isolated month away from home when I **just** got back. I get so upset when I think about having to go back, but I'm terrified of making a decision that I'll regret in the future. My mind is cluttered because I feel that my past experience at school has completely tainted that environment, so now when I think about the internship it sounds like something I absolutely do not want to do.

To top it all off, my best friend is leaving for West Point this summer (the extremely prestigious military academy, for those who are unfamiliar). She leaves about week after I would return from the internship, leaving us to miss out on 90% of the time she has left at home. As much as I've wanted to focus on my own personal development through my education (and in turn, my career), I can't help but be drawn to staying home to make the best out of this limited time that we have left together. I feel like I've been so keen to jump to every possible opportunity presented to me that maybe it wouldn't be so bad to slow down a bit. I would really appreciate any insight.


**If I say yes to the internship:**

-looks good on paper (resume, transcript, etc.)

-probably valuable field experience for my major (I assume)

-would help me comprehend whether I wanted to continue down this path (in my major) or not


**If I turn it down:**

-not emotionally taxing

-could spend the summer working and prepping for the Fall semester at my new school (I have classes I still need to take in order to successfully be admitted to my new school)

222,"Hello. I am moving to a new town, and that would turn my 5-minute commute into a 45-minute commute, possibly an hour with traffic if I had to be there at 7 or 8. I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should stay where I am or try to find work in the place I am moving to. 

I like the company, the workplace culture, my coworkers, the benefits, and most elements of the job itself, but not everything. The job can be quite physically draining, and most of the time I have to be there at 6am, but sometimes I don't go in until 11am or 1pm. The pay is decent, not amazing, but it pays the bills and even with the added gasoline expense I will still have plenty left over. I also am not sure I want to move up any further in the company. 

My biggest fear if I did try to find another job is being taken advantage of, working for a crappy boss, or having poor benefits. I currently get 20 paid days off a year and am really hesitant to give that up, but I know the commute will be hard for me, as I do not really like driving and most of the time I have to be there as early as 6am, which I don't care for even with my short commute. I also would be nervous driving home on the nights where I wouldn't get off until 10pm, because the commute is somewhat isolated. 

I think my issue is that I am just scared and biased; I've always had a fear of being taken advantage of at work since before I was even old enough to have a job, and I'm grateful that the job I currently have doesn't do that, but I don't know if that's enough reason to stay and do the commute.

&gt; This will be a slightly longer post so hang in there. First of I am 16 Turning 17 in june. However i haven't even gone to the DMV yet. The problem in not the test or the cost to get it. The problem is that i cant get the license without birth certificate or social security card.Ironically I know my social security number just don't have the card. I cant call the DMV directly because it is seven o'clock and they're all closed.Was Wondering if anyone had experience in this type of thing. I actually have a ""copy"" but i cant tell if it is certified or if it was this would be a lot easier. https://www.vitalchek.com/ that seems to be the official place to get new ones for Pennsylvania. Also on my birth certificate It says Delaware because that's where i was born. I don't know if i should be going to Delawares website to get the new certificate or if i need to go to Pennsylvania . Sorry if this is so confusing for you I promise you its just as confusing for me. How would i know if this copy is certified or not? Any reply would be great thank you. ",05May2017,2

225,"Hey everyone, 

So I realized late in my college career (transfer student) that I want to switch my major from Sociology to Engineering. 

However, I met with a counselor and they told me that I would very likely be looking at an extra 4.5 years (I have barely any math completed) at the university and that the engineering program is very competitive. 

The counselor told me I could take the core engineering classes and apply once I establish my engineering gpa. (The ""core"" classes are like the golden 4 classes that you need a ""C"" or better in, to even be considered for entry into the specific engineering department.) I feel super discouraged because my school is also impacted. 

Math isn't my strongest subject, but I feel like I could easily take advantage of the resources offered here and do well. I also want to be able to take care of my sick older sister, and ailing mother in the future as well as support my younger siblings and I feel like engineering provides the perfect lifestyle for me. I'm worried a Sociology major wouldn't get me very far financially. 

(I do have a strong interest in the innovative aspect of engineering so it's not based solely off of money.)

I feel like switching could be well worth the time and extra money, especially with the job's pay and stability, but do y'all think I have a chance? Or am I just wasting my time?
