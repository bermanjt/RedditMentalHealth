1,"Okay I need help because well I don't know what's happening to me or if it's even something to be alarmed about. I was an incredibly social, funny, outgoing person, then I kinda fell into a depression a horrible one it killed me made me dumb and a shadow of my former self. Anyways realizing I've had enough I took proper steps and pulled myself out. I'm okay now, happy and content most the time, but I now find myself wanting to be alone all the time. I do get out and expose myself enough it's just I find I do that not because I want but because I know it's bad to be a hermit, socializing doesn't necessarily stress me out or cause anxiety and I can function fine in those situations it's just I get annoyed or bored or tired and find myself pining to make an excuse to just go home and be alone. In other words I'm alone ALOT but I never feel lonely (well I guess not more than the average person). Is this a bad thing? Is it a result of my previous depression/ isolation? Am I lieing to myself?  I just don't understand. ",20Jul2017,1
2,"I've recently realised i'm boring as shit. I've spent the last three years of college not associating with my course and just being associated with these people who I don't have any common interests or similarities with just so I can get drunk. I've fucked up. The frieds I do have I don'yt feel like I know them at all. And NOW college is over. I was happy once then I fucked that up and now i HAVE NOTHING. Everything i touch turns to shit
I'm incredibly lonely and whenever I go to something and i'm just sat their around people I don't know and cant talk to. I have improved from the first part of college but i'm still this pathetic, useless , boring, no talent ass hole thats just fed off other peoples talent in order to succeed. I hate myself and I want to die.
I often think of killing myself or maybe committing a crime so I can go to jail and maybe life would be more simple.",20Jul2017,1
4,"So I've been talking to a girl on Twitter and the conversation  has been flowing great and there's been a lot to talk about and there's been replies that are many lines.

But today the replies have been coming in slower and there's been a few 1 or 2 word replies like yeah and stuff but nothing from her side that moves the conversation  on. Is the conversation dead and should I just end it or should I change the topic?",20Jul2017,0
5,"Hey guys,

I recently started my first job as a consultant in the energy industry. I was assigned a project that has to do with being on a support staff for another client. This project has been going on for years. I already had an internship in IT support and I told myself I would never do something like that. My boss had already gave me some informal training sessions on the software, and we talked about my discomfort moving forward. I literally told him that I did not want to do something like this but he is really good at swaying people into doing whatever he wants them to do. I really thought long and hard about this project and I clearly see that the new hires around me that started at the same time are on projects that I could see myself doing and truly enjoying it. I didn't want to go to work, figure out tickets that come in and then leave work. Thats just something thats not in my DNA to do. I thrive better in projects that I can see the deadlines on and see the progress on. I told my mentor when was a good time to talk to him about this and he said he would call tomorrow. I was told to reach out to different managers and directors about seeing what projects they can put me on before I talk to my boss about leaving the support team. My only real concern is just how much he can use his words to make people do what he wants. I'm never one to step on toes but this is something I DO NOT WANT to start my career off as. I absolutely love the company and the culture so I do not want to leave. Help?

6,"Im a 17 year old guy, im a bit socially awkward and struggle with anxiety a bit. 2 days ago i was at a party, this girl was there with her friends. I didnt really know the girl at first, but later on, at like 3 am, everyone was outside playing drinking games. Me and her were the only ones that didnt participate in that, we sat on the stairs that led up to the house while they played. It was a bit cold and i offered her my jacket, she said ""yes please"" and smiled at me when i put it around her shoulders. About 10 minutes later, she just put my jacket on the ground and walked away. 
2 hours later im in a bed upstairs trying to sleep, and i hear her saying that she doesnt wanna sleep with her friends cuz they are so drunk, they tell her to go sleep with me, she said: ""id rather sleep on the floor"". Then she came upstairs and laid down on the floor. They told her to go sleep with me again, and she said ok. When she got to my bed, she smiled at me and laid down. 
The people downstairs were talking very loudly and she couldnt sleep cuz of that. We talked for 2 hours about random things and then she fell asleep. when she had fallen asleep, i was awake for about an hour just laying there, it was so nice, i have not slept in the same bed as a girl before and it just felt so perfect. Ever since my father died 4 years ago, i have constantly felt that something is missing, but laying there with her, i didnt, and it felt so perfect. When i woke up the morning after, she had woken up and was downstairs already. I didnt talk to her and they left. I kinda know one of her friends, should i message the friend and talk about this? I would really like to be with her again but am unsure how i should proceed from here.
Thank you :)
    


Update: asked her out and she said yes, thanks guys :D",20Jul2017,1
8,"Ok my mother in law is not my favorite person: she is very socially awkward to the point of being awkward and weird and most people can't stand to be around her (including me). She means well, yes, but her personality is just different in general. Unfortunately she has no money and is currently living in an RV she has been driving around in. She asked my brother in law (her son) if she could stay here but he said absolutely not (another long story). She offered to give us all the money she has to build a pole barn outside and live in it. But I DONT WANT HER HERE! I feel like an asshole telling my wife that, but when we lived with her before for a short time, I went absolutely crazy and it severely affected my marriage to my wife. HELP

Edit #1: she sold her house to my brother in law for $50k less than what it's worth, and he still refuses to let her stay there. 

TLDR: Money-strapped, crazy MIL wants to build garage/apartment beside our house w/remaining funds; how do I say no?",20Jul2017,3
10,"I've just gotten back on my depression meds but don't really feel any better. That's why I'm just here to vent about what's going on, I guess. So my parents divorced when I was about thirteen. I won't go into what specifically happened but it was ugly. So I became depressed about that and several other things (mainly being frustrated with rejection by the opposite sex and social situations). In 9th grade, I had a crush on a girl and she found this out and was mean to me virtually the entire year. She called me names, yelled at me all the time, and made fun of me constantly (including telling me things like I make her want to cut herself).

I was even more depressed after that and the summer before 10th grade started, I met a girl on a penpal site that lived in another state and me and her got along really well. We were both into rock music and cars and video games and things like that. Then we stopped talking before the school year started. A few months later we talk again, and then we stop talking again because her parents found out and didn't want us talking. So that really messed things up and I very hurt and angry about it because for once I actually felt wanted and understood and accepted by somebody and now shes gone. 11th grade went a little bit better, though once again I still experienced very harsh rejections no matter what I seemed to be able to do. In 11th grade, I was diagnosed with ASD before my 17th birthday (I'm 19 now). Come senior year, I move to a new school and things were all right I guess, though the girl thing was still a problem and one of my best friends that lived in Sweden stopped talking to me before school started because I was a Christian at the time and I told her I disagreed with gay marriage (in the most kind and diplomatic way I could have).

So the girl that lived in another state started talking to me again shortly before I graduated. And she turned into a total bitch. She became very cold toward me and later on told me that I deserve to be harassed for my political views and called me an asshole. I had (well still have) right wing views at the time and was being called a racist, Nazi, every name under the sun...).

After I graduated, I moved to another state and had a hard time adjusting. So, I was very homesick and suicidal because I wanted move back to my home state and be with my old friends and all that. Then come my first day of college, I saw a cute girl sitting in the cafeteria and I (foolishly) decided to read PUA material and tried it on her. I talked to her for a bit and asked for her number and it resulted in her asking for mine so I couldn't contact her.

This same girl shows up in my English class the following semester and I try to follow her on Instagram thinking she was over the phone number thing but she denied my request. Things like that were a fairly common occurrence. I would try to talk to a girl I found attractive and they would totally shoot me down or just not want to talk which didn't help my confidence. This constant rejection is still going on now no matter what I try to do which is frustrating and depressing me even more. I've tried talking to girls in person, I've tried dating apps, nothing fucking works!

Then while all that has been going on, I haven't had a good relationship with my mother. My mother is very selfish and manipulative. If I don't do something she wants or if I don't feel like coming to see her she will accuse my father and stepmom of brainwashing me against her. She has also told me to get over being depressed (in spite of being depressed herself by her own admission) and said that I don't need help for depression or my autism because she raised me to be strong.

I've been told that I need to love myself and develop myself but my main interest is politics and history (very controversial things and I have very controversial views on those things as well). I get made fun of for my political views constantly and called all sorts of names and my mother even tells me to stop pursuing my interest in politics and stop talking about it and she (like numerous other people...) gave me a hard time for being Hispanic and a Trump supporter (people at her job were even making fun of me behind my back for that). Due to my affinity for European culture (Europe is my ""obsession"") and my political views (if you must know, I used to be a fascist and now identify as paleoconservative like Pat Buchanan), I ended up getting involved with a bunch of white nationalists and national socialists over Instagram and they eventually ended up making fun of me too for not being white and call me a traitor and enemy of the white race, etc for primarily being attracted to white women and not wanting to self-deport. I feel that I don't really have the thick skin to pursue my interests and my want of social acceptance kinda outweighs my beliefs and opinions, but I'm not really interested in much else.

Due to the harassment I get from other right-wingers and my admiration of Europe, I guess I have a case of ethnic dysphoria. I'm a Panamanian/Puerto Rican mestizo and wish I was a white, blonde-hair, blue-eyed Nordic guy. I also think that this is one reason that I can't date the girls I want since they usually date other whites from my observations. I apologize for the long novel, but all this is really destroying me inside and without my meds, every day feels like agony now. I don't know how to stop being needy or desperate. I just want to experience love and intimacy with somebody for once.",20Jul2017,3
11,"Hi Redditors, 

        I want to get a fitness tracker, but I don't want a watch of any kind/brand. I already wear a watch (I actually have multiple that I like to accessorize with). Plus, I find most all of the fitness watches/bands to be bulky/gaudy. 

        I'm also a teacher, so my phone gets left in my bag or car most days so apps that deal strictly with data garnered from my phone would subpar. 

        I'd something that can track my steps, sleep, heart rate, so something that comes with an app that'll sync all that data so I can view later. If you all could provide some pros and cons of trackers you've used/had experience with it would be much appreciated. ",20Jul2017,2
13,"Ok so I never told this to anyone and even writing this anonymously on the internet is not easy for me. Basically I threw my life away the last 6-7 years because of addiction, not drugs or alcohol, more so gaming addiction.

I was average in school, finished whats called ""realschule"" in germany and went on to a school thats similiar to a High School, it's one level below it and it's called ""fachabitur"" in german. When I google the translation it says ""Advanced Vocational Certificate of Education"". So yea it's worth a bit less than a High school graduation, but it's enough to study in germany. I started to study roughly 6 1/2 years ago, my first semester was a complete desaster, my mother was fighting with cancer, which in retrospect affected me more than I thought at the time and I was very motivated and worked way more than I did on my previous schools, but it didnt work out, I should've quit right there and said fuck it and looked for a job, there wouldn't have been a problem, but somehow I didn't wanna disappoint my family (which is the most awesome family you could imagine, which makes all this even harder, if I had a shit family I would've just killed me already, but whenever I think about suicide (which I did a lot) I always thought I can't do this to my family). 


Whatever, lets get on with the story. Once I figured I wouldn't be able to work it out in 2 of my 6 subjects I just stopped going to university and stayed home. Somehow I got even more into gaming because I had way more time available now. I somehow told myself that I'll try again next semester but I pretty much lied to myself there. After 3 years I thought I need a new start, I couldn't go on like this anymore, so I changed the field in which I was studying. But I got back into the same habbit for another 3 1/2 years now. Now is finally the time where I know I can't lie to myself anymore and I need to find a job and live my life somehow. I can't bring it over my heart to tell this to my family, which was very supportive the last few years while I lived off heritage (which I still have a decent amount of, like 50k€) because I was living as cheap as possible. I just want to fix my life myself, but I don't know how. My education was not the greatest before those wasted 6 1/2 years, but now how am I ever getting employed. How can I find an apprenticeship, how am I supposed to explain that I studied for 6 1/2 years without doing a single test. If I was looking for someone I would instantly throw my own application in the bin. So my questions for you guys are :

How should I write this in my application, how in my résumé and where should I try to aim at with my applications? I thought about jobs that don't require High school, so I at least have something that hightlights me. 
But even then, imagine I would get to a job interview, how am I supposed to explain this. When I think about it it seems impossible. I really want to make a change in my life and when I was doing internships in my time at school I always loved working, I have no idea why I even got the idea to study, because I hated school back then already. I was really enjoying working. It's just another thing that makes me question my former self even more. Why did I not just work back then, but I guess it's too late now and I have to just look to find anything that can get my life back on track. I know it will be hard but it has to somehow be possible. It can't be over right here. I have no idea where the last 6 1/2 years went, I was very depressive, that much I know, and video games were a way to just leave the real world behind and forget about anything thats real. All problems were forgotten for years. It's strange how unreal this whole time was to me, like all problems would solve themselves somehow.

So writing this wall of text was pretty tough, but I hope someone here reads at least some of it, every small advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated. I don't think I can figure it all out myself. All I know is that I was enough of a burden for my family and that I don't want to disappoint them any more. I have to somehow find a way out of this without them, at least once in my life I have to be a bit independant.",20Jul2017,1
14,"There has been a couple of feral cats hanging around in my backyard/general area yards ever since my dog passed away. We have been taking care of them since it gets quite hot in the summers. Last year they had a litter of kittens, but shortly afterwards the kittens and one of the adult cats disappeared. This year the other adult cat showed up again after being missing for quite awhile, with 3 kittens this time.

Well come to find out one of our neighbors a few houses down has a dog that has killed 8 cats so far. They don't seem to be too upset about it either, even saying that ""their dog doesn't bite them or anything, just kills them"".

What can/should I do about this? The neighbor doesn't seem to really care about it. We are planning on doing TNR and possibly getting the kittens adopted out, but still worry about the adult cat.

I am at a much higher weight than I would like to be, I don't have a job, and I am on extended hiatus from school. I have been living off of day trading for the most part, but I'm quickly reaching the end of my rope there. 

However, I have applied for jobs, I'm getting my diet back under control, I am getting back to my levels of strength I had when I was an athlete, and I have a rough outline for what was to come.

However, my roommate and I, just had a parting of plans. See, we had been planning to move in 6 months to California and seek our fortunes there. We were going to find a short lease and save up money while living in a cheap apartment, then make the jump. Unfortunately (for me, great news for him) he has found out that he is likely to get accepted to a dream college come spring semester. He is probably going to move out of our current apartment when the lease breaks in a month and crash on his sisters couch for 3 months, which is obviously not an option for me.

20,"Throwaway.

For the past 9 or so years now I haven't really felt like a person. I spent most of my childhood alone and getting bullied and walked all over at school. I then spent my middle school years getting deep into depression and abusive friendships. And now I'm in high school and it feels like I've finally hit rock bottom.

I watch as all my friends hang out and have lives and what do I do? Sit home all day. I have tried ***countless*** times to try and get together with others but nobody could be fucked to actually stick to times. People cancel last minute or they didn't check with their parents or something else comes up.

I live in a neighborhood full of attractive girls I've known for 8+ years, but I'm too afraid to talk to. I just assumed no one would like me or care anyways.

It's weird I'm just the opposite of everything I want to be. Male, black, glasses, nerdy looking. (Side note: if you don't mind please don't link r/AsABlackMan, I'm being serious and last time I tried to make a thread in another sub I was linked to that sub and was made fun of).

If it was up to me I'd be a white female. 1) because I hate being a guy and 2) I think all the racist bulying I endured in middle school and early high school messed me up. I'm just so angry all the time. It's manifested into this weird hatred of good looking females or transgirls because they get to live a life I wanted. On top of that I can't transition. Despite me looking nerdy I'm rather buff with short curly hair. I'd never pass anyways. Not like my parents would ever approve. I'd basically be throwing away my entire life and the expectations of everyone who knew me. I don't think I could handle that. For years I've been obsessed with trying to lucid dream so maybe I could just be someone else for a change. I have a hard time focusing though or even making up scenarios in my head.

I was talking to my therapist yesterday and I mentioned how I don't do any sort of physical self-harm, but more emotional self-harm. I'm in this weird abusive relationship with myself. I could cure cancer but I still wouldn't get any respect from my peers. My parents see that I spend a lot of time alone and figure that the best way to do something is by just spending more time with them. All I do is spend time with them. I'm not an only child but my siblings are all out of the house.

How am I going to stay sane the next 2 years until I graduate, or even for the rest of my life? What do I do? I've exercised (do boxing once a week for a few years now + lifting weights 3 or so times a week), taken up multiple hobbies and gotten to sleep earlier but I just get nowhere with all of it. It's really frustrating. My whole life has been nothing but failures. I couldn't name hardly any times when I've succeeded at anything or showed other people that I'm worth it.

Thanks for reading, I hope it wasn't too long. Any help at all is appreciated. I don't see my therapist again for two weeks, although I feel like I should talk to him about this. I've been meaning to but I have other things going on.",20Jul2017,1

My boyfriend and I rent a room in LA County. We plan on moving to Cincinnati, OH in the next few weeks.

We don't have too much stuff to haul out, but are curious if anyone here has any advice on trailer rentals.

Our cars towing capacity is 1500 lbs. We need a small, lightweight enclosed trailer to rent (or to buy if cheap enough). We are looking for trailers similar to Uhaul's sports trailer. None of the facilities by us have it available (or our car isn't eligible = Chevy Prizm 2000). This would be for a one-way trip.

We'd also be willing to rent a vehicle to tow our car along with our stuff. Our car weighs approximately 2,403 lbs.

The estimate weight of the car + our belongings would be 3,500lbs.

If anyone could help us out, we'd be forever grateful. Thanks, Reddit!

27,"For a long while now, I have been feeling some depression. But over the past couple of years especially, it has been getting worse. I'm in my late 30's now, and while I know I could have some nice times ahead, I have a sinking feeling that my life is nearly over, and that I have essentially wasted it. I'm not suicidal - I have lots to be thankful for and I am grateful to be alive. But I also feel cold. At the risk of being melodramatic, it's like a sad, dead sort of feeling most of the time. 

Also I have noticed I am more impatient, and irritable. I get upset about the smallest things. I'm just generally becoming a worse person, and I am certainly not proud of that. 

Anyway, there is lots I could be doing to help my situation such as lifestyle changes and talking to a professional, but I am not sure where to begin.

35,"So I work at a kids day camp during the summer and for the most part we never run into trouble. But today while we all were at our morning bible study (it's a Christian camp but it's not super hardcore) one of the campers and the counselors just walked out of the room without saying anything. I didn't think too much of it at first because if campers are upset we try to avoid a scene and quietly take them outside the room to talk or maybe he was taking them to the bathroom. After about 10 minutes with no return I started to feel weird about it, because I checked outside and they weren't using the restroom because counselors always stand outside by the door and I would've seen him, so I told the other two counselors to keep going with the Bible study while I check and see what's going on. My next conclusion was they got taken to the office to talk to one of the higher ups, and the office didn't see them either. I checked all the bathrooms and still the counselor and camper weren't to be found. At this point I started assuming the worse and I know it sounds crazy but my mind jumped to this camper might be getting violated by this counselor and I don't really wanna go into detail but some stuff happened to me as a kid and so I am super worried about that happening to one of my kids and I was frantically looking for this kid and was ready to bust stall doors down and fight somebody. And they they stroll into the main office and my heart almost gives out on me. it turns out  they went to get the kid a band-aid but they ran out of first aid forms  so he went to the office with the printer ( which is alone on the other side of the camp) and printed out one and filled it out with the kid and I just happened to miss him.

I don't want to apply for just any job because obviously past experience, skill set and education affect starting salary. 

I wondered if I list out my shortcomings and strengths if any of you would know what I should aim towards.

Photography (7/10) - self-taught, 6 years experience, Adobe Lightroom (9/10) and Photoshop CC (8/10)

Copywriting (9/10) - Microsoft Word (7/10)

Graphic design (7/10) - Adobe Illustrator (1/10), Adobe Photoshop (9/10). Experience setting stuff up for print, debossing, etc. 
*I use Photoshop, this is my biggest weakness in my opinion. 

Videography (7/10) - experience filming on indy film sets, some editing in PremierPro (3/10) but no idea how to use AfterEffects (0/10). I've never flown a drone. 

Other skills and things I know about: importing stuff from Japan, cars/wheels, interior design, DIYing/MacGyvering things, French spoken (8/10) and written (7/10), customer service skills, keen eye for aesthetics and writing style. 

So as you can see, I can't apply as a graphic designer due to lack of Adobe Illustrator experience (and I'm not talented artistically as far as illustrating, etc), photography is almost exclusively on contract basis, I'm not really experienced enough in video editing to do that and I'm not sure what to do with my other skills. Ironically, I have every skill necessary to create and brand a business (and continue to deliver several kinds of content for it) but I don't feel like I could ever find a job like that.

40,"A little background story, our parents are on vacation and left the house to me [18M] and to my younger brother [16M] for 22 days in total (we are at day 10 now). We have set up some main chores that we should do to in order to keep the house clean, have food to eat, et cetera. This went well in the beginning, but later on my brother hasn't got the slightest motivation to do *anything*.

My brother was mainly responsible for doing the dishes, keeping the kitchen clean. This was necessary since I was mainly responsible for cooking the food. I have told him several times that he should do the dishes, but refuses to do them. He complained that it was too much to wash and doesn't feel like doing the dishes. I told him that I can do the dishes for this one time, if he does some other chore task I needed to do. After this, I told him that he shouldn't wait until the end of the day for the dishes, because it's going accumulate over the day.

The next day we stumbled upon the exact same situation. He looks at the dishes, takes a deep sigh, and *walks away*??? And he is surprised that there a lot of dishes again. He doesn't do crap in the house, and is only playing Minecraft or some other game for the entire day. I told him that if he doesn't do the dishes, then I'm not going to cook. Of course, this is his '*rebellious*' time and sees this as some kind of game. I'm not sure what he has eaten today, but I can ensure you that he is underfed at this point. This keeps going on for several days now...

I don't get it, it's like there is **no** responsibility whatsoever. The house is one big mess and I'm out of ideas. I'm not going to do the entire household and serve him like some king. My father is almost at the point of freaking out (and suspects him of depression) and I can't reach my mother at the moment. Any ideas on what to do?",20Jul2017,7

42,"&gt;I had posted this on other subreddit before, but couldn't get a single reply 


So, i'm a foreigner studied in Singapore. They have this tuition grant bond scheme that requires me to work 3 years in Singapore after graduate. There's only 9 months left to finish the bond, but i had went unemployed a year ago, in July 2016. I had went to plenty of interviews but still couldn't secure a job. I had even went to other fields of job only to be told that ""I'm not suitable for the job"", or ""they are not ready to hire someone that might leave the job"", etc. Also that i realize there's limit to myself and i can't commit to the job especially one that require me to stand a long period of time in work. And i don't want to cheat my way into a job and make the boss regrets when they realize i couldn't even finish my job or do my job well.


the thoughts of being so useless &amp; worthless and the failures of job searching had crippled me with depression and constant suicidal thoughts. Right now, i think i have anxiety while dealing with people too because of the failures of interviews, and while i'm unemployed, i seek help from others but only to realize that people don't really give a damn. They might help u once when u asked them, but they will just give some general advice like ""had you tried XXX site? or YYY??"" and will never hear from them anymore, ever. 


I even started to talk with myself when i'm alone, or scolding myself, or laugh for no reasons. The funny thing is i know i'm acting crazy, but i won't stop doing it because it somehow feels good to be myself, even if it means to be crazy.


Even under all these pressures, i still suck it up and try to find myself a job just so i can solve the bond issues and hence my depression source. But recently, with the economy going worse, most jobs are only for permanent residents/citizens only. With such restrictions, and the mental issues, and low confident, and lose faith in everything, and seeing how even if i went pass this stage, i'm still fucked for life, etc etc. 


I'm panic right now. I have nowhere to go. I don't need some words of comfort, I need some actual solutions, which i know i wouldn't get at all. I'm so freaking panic right now I believe suicide is the best option i have right now.


Also if i quit the bond now, i have to pay about SGD 11k++ which i don't have the money for, nor will i asks my family for the money. a year ago, i would had about 7k to pay for it, but paying for rents and livings finished up all my savings. Which is another causes for my depression.


I believe suicide is still my best option here. But advice and suggestions are welcomed.",20Jul2017,7

Most appointments she tries to discuss my mental health and stuff but I'm too distracted by her looks, so I usually end up awkwardly nodding my head and mumbling compliments. It seems to make her uncomfortable but I'm going to choose to assume this is because she is flattered, as opposed to it being unwanted.

I'm thinking next appointment (which is tomorrow), I'm just gonna go for it and ask her to be my girlfriend. What do you guys think?

I talked to my boss, asking about it, and he said it was a mistake and it would be fixed. I then got back pay for what they had originally missed paying me.

60,"So first off, I'm 17 and I have lifted weights over a year ago for a semester class in the high school, that's it. Now I'd like to have a set schedule like a leg day, back/shoulders, and chest/arms day as well. I was listening to my dad (who used to work out a lot before the marines) and he says 6 days a week, with sunday off every week. Obviously he was a stronger person when he did that, than a growing 17 year old male.


However, I am very athletic, I play basketball almost daily, I do karate twice a week (actually a really good workout), I used to swim a lot (works every muscle in your body) and I'm just very active in any way possible most of the days. (Other than when I'm making lets plays for my gaming channel on youtube)


So I had a plan which used those 3 types of workouts, legs, chest/arms, and back/shoulders and they would alternate every 3 days with sunday off. So each would be worked out with about 9 exercises for each day total for about 90 minutes, and only twice a week for each body part. Is this too much? I'm going for more reps and not too much weight as that i'm saving for a little later. Thanks in advance",20Jul2017,1

The four women went for a walk after we went to sleep and discussed how they didn't want our friend to come along on the trips if she is going to act that way.

62,"I HATE being around my parents (especially my dad) but my mom too. My dad is loosing his job, so everyone is insanely stressed, it also means my dad is always home in addition to my mom (I'm homeschooled so she's a stay home mom... lucky me). My dad hasn't been great since I was 6, he deployed and was never the same. He didn't ever play with me or goof around anymore after that, he doesn't even hold normal conversations with me usually, everything he says to me is a complaint or a casual insult. I saw my friend with her dad the other day and they were goofing around and laughing. I had to fight back tears. I have spent the summer holed up in my bedroom, usually only coming out for 2 or 3 hours a day just to eat, use the bathroom, and do my chores. 

My mom just drives me nuts. She has a hair trigger so when my little sister does something like ask my mom for help when she's already doing something my moms response is along the lines of ""NO THANK YOU!  GO AWAY LITTLE HOOTER BOOTER!"" She does this all the time and it drives me insane. I just want to rip my hair out when she does it.

My dad is just all around awful. When I do try to interact with him (or despite my best efforts am in the same room as him) he responds in one three ways. 1) Total silence and ignoring me. 2) Telling me to do a task
3) Insulting me or something I like (You are so lazy you godawful child!, Why do you watch that stupid crap?, etc.).  Some of the things he said have stuck with me. For example he said to my mom that I was like a character from a TV show that is incredibly awkward, untalented, over emotional, and nieve, Sue from The Middle.  He said it while I was sitting a few feet away from him and my self esteem really took a huge blow. I have become scared of him, when I'm in his presence I get really nervous. So I stay in my room. I'm getting reeeeally tired of just sitting in my room all day every day, I'm not even allowed to have my computer up there, I spend the whole day on my phone just watching YouTube, which gets boring. When both my parents do leave the house and I'm babysitting my siblings (something that happens once every week or two) it is freaking bliss and I am so happy. I can't leave the house by myself because my parents are crazy overprotective. I am 14 and I have never walked down my street by myself before, and we don't live in a bad neighborhood. My parents are convinced I will get kidnapped or lost somehow. My parents expect me to get perfect grades too, (B+ is completely unacceptable and cause for harsh punishment) which is really stressful. I desperately want to get away from them, or even just have the courage to be honest about what I think and what I want in my presence, but I'm too scared.  Despite how much I loathe being in their presence, I for some reason am terrified of their disapproval. Is there anything I can do?",20Jul2017,1
63,"Cross posted from another subreddit. Anyhow, here's my problem: I'm 12 classes from graduating at the smaller of the two state schools in this state, but I recently had some things sprung on me that I didn't plan for and I'm having a tough time with the decision making here.
I moved out of state for college because the man who fathered me treated me like absolute shit on the mental/emotional side of things but rarely laid a hand on me. This started around age 6 and lasted until I moved out at 17. Couple that with my mother telling me I'd never amount to anything fairly frequently as a child, grounding me for up to 4 months at a time where I was only allowed to go to school and home (not even allowed to attend Church,) and many other things. My mother had to cosign for my apartment because I was 17 with no credit and she offered to pay for my college education as long as I got a bachelor's degree. I chose the university I'm at now because it's far enough away that the man who fathered me can't physically get here (too many health issues, can't drive after dark, etc.) and it's really inconvenient for my mother to come down here because of her job. I don't get in state tuition even though I have a driver's license in this state, I'm registered to vote in this state, I work in this state, I'm a member of a couple of social-ish groups that require you to be in the state where the group is located and have been a resident of that state for at least 6 months, etc. Basically, I'm considered a resident of this state by everyone but the university.

I've been denied in-state rates because I'm not 23 and according to the university that's when all dependence on parents stops, regardless of when it truly does. I pay my own rent, buy my own food, make my own vehicle payments, etc. all from jobs I hold. My tuition is just a gift from my mother. Well, here's where the problem starts. I was told that I'd have to help pay my tuition this fall because of out of state being 15k for a 12 or 13 credit hours plus all of the mandatory fees but I'm already working 2 jobs and barely making ends meet. I don't really have any cash to spare, I can eat out once a week as a treat, or have a couple of beers during a Japanese restaurant's $2 draft special in the middle of the week (can't do both) but that's it. That's my financial situation right now. I've explained this to her, but she says ""Tough, you're going to have to help out."" Then today she tells me that the bank won't give her any more money to pay for this semester so she'll have to take out a deferred parent plus loan and I'll have to pay a third of whatever the balance is after graduation. To which I reply ""Okay, we've got to fill out a FAFSA before the loan can be taken out."" She then tells me that she can't afford to file her taxes for this year for another couple of months, and that's the best she can do. She says she can hand me last year's and the one for her business for this year, but that's it.
I've tried talking to financial aid and a few other departments about getting the in-state rate, but every time I talk to them they always come up with new hoops for me to jump through. I get those done, go back, then they come up with something else and deny me again. I've been putting on my forms that I came to this state because of a lack of opportunity in my home state, and I had a desire to find work and better myself here. I have talked to a friend of mine who used to work for the university, and she says that pretty much the only way I'll get in-state tuition is to request an appeals board (multiple people in one room who listen to your situation and make a decision) and tell them why I chose this school instead of the 6 others that were near my hometown in my home state. 

I'm having problems with this because I'm a proud individual. I was raised to never ""air your dirty laundry"" or give the slightest hint of any problems to anyone because it shows weakness and that will cause nothing but trouble. I could go in that room and tell those people about being so scared I still wake up in cold sweats thinking about it at night, I curled up behind the bed so I'd feel safe because of the fits the man who fathered me would throw if I so much as left a shirt on my bedroom floor, how he threatened suicide by driving off a mountain with me in the truck on the way back from cub scout camp because I asked him to not intentionally hit the potholes on my side of the road as a 9 or 10 year old kid, I could talk about him throwing a nutcracker at me but it missed and went through my bedroom wall (I got it as a Christmas gift from a family friend) when I was 7 because he got mad at me, I had heard about abuse on tv and asked him what it was at age 6 because I didn't know the meaning of the word and that night he threatened to leave the house forever, and on and on. 

It could help my case for in-state tuition and I probably would be able to get a bank loan myself for the 5 or 6 thousand my tuition would be if I got in-state, but on the other hand I may not get it at all. All of those people would know the deepest, darkest things I keep from everyone I've ever met except for 2 other people (and now reddit) and I would have nothing to show for it but a huge sense of shame and a dark cloud that would follow me for a while until I'm able to get it bottled all back up inside me again. My question is this, should I go for the appeal and try to reduce my tuition so I can actually afford to go this semester or should I take a semester off, get a third job to maybe help save enough for a two or three classes next semester, then reapply to the school and hope they accept me again? Any advice is appreciated and I'm sorry for the long read.

66,"I've been a bit stressed out in recent years as my family has had a lot going on lately.

My dad's currently dealing with a lawsuit that's seriously taking a big hit on our financial stability, while my sister and I are both going to college too. The person accusing my dad of whatever keeps trying to keep the case going when he/she's run out of evidence. Our lawyer is also charging more than our family can afford monthly now lol.

My sister hates our parents and has cut off communication with them for years, even though they pay her tuition in full. My parents continue to pressure me to talk to her, even though I don't want to. She's been a major source of psychological stress on my parents and continues to blame them for all that's wrong in her life. Her eating disorders, stress disorders, anxiety disorders, etc. I'm pretty sure her resentment began when I was born. She grew up when my parents weren't well off financially, while I grew up when my parents both got a series of promotions and such. (she's in grad school now)

When she graduated from her undergraduate studies, my parents paid off her student loans entirely. When my parents confronted her about it, she just said, ""You wanted to do it, so you did it."" 

My dad's health is also declining, as he was diagnosed with a tumor on his pancreas last year and had surgery to remove it. Nobody is sure if the cancer will come back again, but the tumor was of a very rare and often aggressive kind if it comes back a second time. On top of that, he has high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and diabetes, and he also tends to eat more than he should when he's stressed out. My mom told me that the doctor secretly told her my dad doesn't have much time left if he continues his current lifestyle which will cause the cancer to come up again. 

My dad's family, his mother, is also getting older (in her late 70s) and recently needs eye surgery, but my dad's younger brother says it's a waste of money to pay for surgery on an ""old woman"". My dad has been dealing with his own family drama for a while now, and his younger brother is just adding onto it. On top of this, my dad has two jobs that involve traveling a lot, and I'm currently overseas with him. I try to remind him not to eat too many sweets and eat healthier, but every time I do, he looks at me with a cold look and scolds me while mentioning some fake reason why this cookie is low sugar or whatever. He does this a lot, I'm used to it, but I'm just not sure what else to do beyond telling him not to eat sweets. 

My mom is also caught up in the lawsuit, and it's taking an even harder psychological hit on her than it is my dad because of the amount of money they've spent on the lawyer. Her job is also unstable at the moment, so she's considering selling off a house that we have in another city where they haven't even paid the mortgage off of. We've been trying to hide all of these issues from my sister because she'd just start accusing my parents of making stupid decisions and being mentally weak or something like she has before when my parents approached her for help with smaller problems. My parents have a lot of debt they have to pay back to people when my parents purchased some other houses, and the lawsuit is setting them back severely. 

I just feel so powerless with all of this going on. I'm in college currently too, and I have my fair share of problems, but I feel a sense of responsibility like I have to help everyone - like I have to mend the relationship with my sister and my parents, help my dad with his health problems, counsel my dad about his family issues, find a way for my mom to slowly pay off the debt, and figure out a way to help my parents deal with the lawsuit. I've been finding it harder and harder to focus on my studies because of where my parents are with life. I'm not depressed or anything, I just wish I could do something to help. 

More than anything, I just want to know how to stay strong. I've broken down a few times, and I wish I could be more mentally tough. I'd appreciate any advice. If you guys have any personal anecdotes, I'm all ears.

68,"Recently started occasionally talking to my ex after two and a half years of no contact. We hadn't had a bad breakup, it was more that we were both away at different schools and I had let myself get too into the whole smoke weed everyday, fuck everything else lifestyle (thankfully I outgrew that idiocy). Regardless, I still loved her but I knew I was hurting her with the person I was being so I ended it. 

Anyway, she moved back to our hometown, and I was visiting from school for the weekend. So me, her, and a group of our friends went downtown to dance, drink, and have some fun. This was also the first time we had seen each other since before we broke up. I didn't expect anything to happen between us, but we ended up dancing together way closer than two friends would. The next day we met for lunch and talked about our previous relationship and our current feelings for each other. I told her that I still loved her and she told me that she still loved me. We both agreed that it probably was not a good idea to try dating again right now, as I still have a year left at my school 3 hours away and she's busy trying to get into grad school. Plus, she's unsure that it would even work out. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon together, and she even told me that she wished that I wouldn't have to leave. We agreed to keep in touch, and I ended up kissing her before I left. And now, even though we agreed that trying to date isn't a good idea right now, I can't get her out of my head. I want to talk to her constantly, but I resist the urge since we only just started talking again and I don't want to come off as desperate. What I really want though, is just to be with her again even though I know that long distance was one of the things that killed the relationship in the first place. I have nine months left until I move back to my hometown, but until then I don't know how to even act with her. Treat her as a friend? but I have deeper desires than friendship with her now. I don't even want to go out and meet other girls since I have my heart set on my ex. It's a situation that I'm entirely unfamiliar with, if anyone could offer any help I would be so thankful.",20Jul2017,1

75,"Lately, I've been feeling lonely, thinking that I don't have anyone that cares about me. But the thing is, I DO have friends and family that care deeply. I just can't acknowledge it in certain situations. 

For example: 
I'm currently living with two other friends in an apartment. To make it easier to explain, I'll just introduce my friends as Diana and George. Right now, Diana's sister is visiting and have been living in our apt for a couple of weeks, while George has his girlfriend over too. I don't mind having them over, because they are my friends too. Plus, it's quite fun having more people living in the apt. But for a while, I can't help but feel alone. There are many times when George would be spending time with his girlfriend in his room, while Diana is catching up with her sister. And during these moments, I'm just sitting at my desk by myself, trying to do my own thing (study, watch a movie, youtube, read, etc). I end up thinking about how Diana and George have someone that they can share all their thoughts too, while I only have myself. I keep thinking about how they have someone who cares about them, while I only have myself. 

As I mentioned earlier, I'm actually not alone. I do have people who love me deeply, I just can't grt myself to realize it. It kind of hard when I don't feel loved when I'm in a situation like the one described above. And it sucks because I get this feeling pretty frequent (2-3 times a week). 

What can I do to stop this feeling? Is it even loneliness that I'm feeling?

81,"As you can tell by the title I'm 21. I live in Miami and I attend a university studying Biology working hard to pursue a bachelors degree. About two and a half years away until completion. I also have a part time job as a retail sales associate for T-mobile. The job is very flexible, super easy to transfer stores even across states, and has health benefits. I don't want to complain much because compared to others I'm sure my life is not that bad but for some reason I feel like I need some change. I lived on my own for a bit and it was great but I was stressed all of the time because I was not hitting quotas at work sometimes. I didn't know where I was going to make the money to pay rent. That's when I realized I had reached adulthood. Eventually I came back home to live with my grandparents. Didn't quit my job but I felt the smart thing to do was go home. My job is extremely stressful and I realized that all sales jobs will most likely be as well. So I've come to the conclusion that if I wanted to be that independent again with less financial stress then a full time job was the only way to go. This scared me because managing a full time job and school might actually be harder than I think it would be. So I started diving deeper and I thought about positions as a dental assistant or maybe even in a dental office making equipment . You see I aspire to be a cosmetic dentist in LA or NY or maybe Miami as well. These jobs could be good for me when I apply to dental school because it shows some experience. But you see I couldn't just stop there. I pretty much have been treated horribly most of my life by all the people I used to consider close. Friends flaking constantly, ditching me on my birthdays, one boyfriend cheating and the other just leaving for no reason. I'm very prideful and I truly hate the idea of letting others walk all over me. so I'm pretty much lonely at the moment and kind of embarrassed to still be living at home. Sometimes I think about transferring to a t-mobile somewhere far away and just grow again. Maybe then look for a full time and be more stable. I'm ever so grateful for the family I have and how much they have supported me and helped me through out life but I just feel like something's off. I want more.

My boss passes me on the way to her, taps my shoulder and tells me I can sit back down. He walks up to her and kisses her;

joe's daughter has been telling me about what's going on so i'm sorta in on what's going on, so I send a snapchat to the groupchat where we have people in my position, none of the bosses or the cooks, i don't even think they know about it. 

His daughter replies to the snap telling me that this is who i think it is, his ex fiancé. Joe's daughter doesn't approve of this, and neither does anybody else who works there. So, Joe has been trying to hide it. 

Now this would've been fine, but Joe's daughter confronted him about this situation; in the process telling him that i had taken a picture of them and shared it with them. 

i'm afraid that my boss and i will have conflict because of this, and result in termination. this is a job i can't afford to lose.

I am, and have been, suffering from depression since ~2014. During these last few years, there have been multiple times where I would sleep 15+ hours a day for a week, would get very little social interaction, and hardly spoke to anyone.

I, quite often, will completely butcher a word/sentence, usually because I'm speaking in a rushed manner. I have to consciously slow down my talking so that the person I'm with will have an easier time understanding me. 

I can't even do small talk right. I'll pass by a coworker and they'll ask me something like ""What's up?"", and I'll reply with ""Good"". This, I'll put down to me turning off my brain at work because I have the same meaningless conversations with different coworkers all day. 

On the rare occasion that I'm out in public, I get very self-conscious. Everyone can see this little bit of cat hair on my shirt. They're looking at me because I'm moving my fingers weird. They're judging me because I haven't had a haircut in a while. Even if I tell myself that none of this happens, I still *feel* like it goes on. I constantly feel like I'm being watched.

In social settings, I'm very quiet and usually won't speak unless spoken to. I don't voice any of my concerns; I won't tell anyone if I'm inconvenienced in any way. 

I can't even smoke a blunt with my best friend without feeling bad that I didn't put in for it, even if we've been friends for 10+ years. 

I used to work out every day and was very proud of my body, but in the last few years, I haven't gained any weight, I've just lost muscle and replaced it with some fat.

109,"Hello, I am a soon to be 22 year old Norwegian who has just finished my bachelors in Economics and administration. These three years have been really tough due to a lot of changes in my family.
 
Who am I? (short summary)
I have always been hard working, and always got the best grades, but during these three years I have been struggling to continue this ""trend"", if you may. I went straight to university after finishing high-school being really motivated and ambitious. I have always had a job besides school, active with sports and music production. I have always been very social and not afraid to take chances. So you can see that my days are pretty much filled up. I am half Norwegian and half Turkish, with my parents divorced. I have always had a great relationship to my parents, even tough my relation the Norwegian side is ""colder"" than the Turkish side, which is more affectionate and more open to show love. (Cultural differences)

The ""turning point"":
After the passing of my grandparents a lot of sudden changes started happening to my family. It was almost like they were the glue holding the family together, which I have just realized. I gradually started losing contact with my family in Turkey and due to several cancer related issues and deaths, my Norwegian family has slowly become smaller. Don't get me wrong, I handle the actual death pretty well (i guess, as I see it being very natural) but it seems like everything has become more chaotic and ""distant"" in my life. 

 The second big thing was that my father married a woman I had never met and came home with a new wife and half-sister. This is now three years ago and with her only speaking Russian, I have never been able to communicate with her. This has made it extremely hard to actually develop a relationship to the mother of my half-sister, which again is really sad. I didn't think of it as much before, but I guess I have realized that it has affected me more than I thought. 

Now only focusing on me; As we grow older we take on more responsibility finding new challenges, finishing school to create a life for our selves. During these three years at university I have had a total of four jobs. I started working at a bar (still do), driving taxi (still employed), had a marketing and sales job one summer and got a job as Account manager and head of marketing for a startup and the end of my bachelors (which I still have). I have always felt a need to stay active and to actually have a job (even though I didn't really have to). But after my first year and all the changes started hitting me, i lost focus and motivation and didn't really know what I wanted to do with this degree. I decided to take marketing as a main subject and I am content with that decision. Still didn't get the best grades, but managed to push my self to ramp it up the last semester. So with my diploma and a job I should be happy, right? Well, one of the problems; I also started investing a lot and playing poker. This went great from when I started till about the beginning of the 2nd year of uni. Not getting in to the amount, but I was up a lot. I was still good at poker and knew how to invest smart. But with the lack of motivation and focus, with all the things happening in my life I started taking bigger chances to hopefully be able to just do whatever I want and leave the mess. This ended with me spending almost all of my student loans (which I hadn't touched) and savings (not all, but major parts of it) up until New years of 2017 when it hit me. I just had to quit, when it became and ""addiction"". Not really the gambling side (not anymore atleast), I have realized but and addiction to striving to get out of everything and be independent! (Which I guess isn't too uncommon)

My focus on music production started crumbling, but my passion for music always stayed there. Music has always been my best way of showing emotions. But I have been able to pick that up little by little.

After working as a Account manager for almost five months now, I have realized that this firm is absolutely not right for me, due to the professional relationship with the boss (I like him and he likes me personally, but yeah), different views on strategy, lack of professionalism on his side etc.. So I have decided to quit. I still have jobs to fall back on, but non of them make me really happy.

What does it come down to?
A little more background on my psychological past; I have always been very strong, never depressed and always been motivated. 

Nearing the end of my studies, this has started to tear on my mind a lot. Thinking everyday about what I have done wrong, what I should do and how stupid I was. I refuse to label myself as depressed and I don't blame my parents for anything, but I can see my mind on its way to depression if this continues. I have not been able to speak properly to my parents about this at all, except mentioning to my mother how my relationship to my dad has affected me after my stepmother and sister came in to our lives. I have not spoken about the monetary losses or anything else for that matter. 

So I am now sitting at a job that only tears on my energy, feeling like my life has stopped progressing. I can't really see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore like I used to. I wan't to do so much, but a newfound fear of failing and lack of ""energy"" seems to stop me from going for it. Does anyone have any advice to get out of this ditch? :/

I am sorry if this seemed chaotic in any way.

111,"TL;DR - Any jobs you know of that can care for a family of four and four cats? And any alternatives for even if you have a bad back/are out of shape, just in case?

So, a bit of background on me, I'm a 23 year old dude in Houston, TX. I've been unemployed for 8 months because I quit when my previous manager insulted my mother, and I was too stupid and lazy to inform the higher ups about it. My education level stops at high school because when I tried to go to college I kept failing a classes because I didn't (don't) know what I wanted out of life and it all felt like a waste of money until I figured it out. 

My dad has been out of work for at least a year, I think longer, because he hurt his back and has been getting half pay from them ever since. That's stopping soon. And yeah, I live with my parents, because I have no money and no place to go. He can't work such a physical job anymore, dad only makes money now through selling things on ebay that he finds in thrift store, so he can't make the money to pay the house and food and bills and most anything. My mom has never had the best health, and she doesn't even do much in terms of house work, much less something that'd make money. My brother is only 14, so there's isn't anything he could do to help. And remember how I said I've been unemployed for 8 months? I can't find shit. I've applied everywhere I can think of. I run a shitty facebook page and I'll try selling shirts there soon, but there's no way in hell to live off teespring with a target audience of 20,000 weeaboos. No offence to them. Mostly good people. 

I've always wanted to do game design or be a writer, but I never found programs for me at the colleges near by and my parents were adamant that online schools weren't legit. I mean, I've convinced my mom that Full Sail is probably real, but now we have no money for tuition of any kind. Also I never learned to drive legally because they would never find the time to take me to a driving school or even to the DMV. I'm 23 and don't even understand what I'm supposed to do about that. I Google it and it's all geared toward people that already the basic stuff, and I don't know the basic stuff. 

My mom has gone right out and told me that I need to try harder to find a job so I can pay for everything in my dad's stead. So now I guess it doesn't matter that I couldn't be a game designer writer or something else, because my future for a long time now will probably just be providing for a family I didn't even get to make. 

But basically, I have applied to as many places as I can on and off for months, yet I've heard nothing back and will be told not to call and check if I try. I don't know what options I have left, if any. Please, if anyone can think of anything for me, it'd be much appreciated. ",20Jul2017,3

The second I realized I put out the mini flame so it could've been a lot worse, but there's a bald spot, also my brain thought the best solution was to move the couch and cut hairs from the carpet from underneath the couch and put those on the bald spot. Anyways my parents will 100% notice soon if anybody has an excuse that would be very helpful Tl;dr I burned a hole in my carpet and I cut up some carpet from underneath a couch, what's a good excuse for something like this.

115,"I just had ""the talk"" with my mother about where my life is going and how I'm wasting it. It didn't feel like a very productive talk, more like I was being berated for not being who I was when I was younger, and for not knowing my place in the world. Immediately after that I started looking for plane tickets to just leave.


I've been working in a local theatre since I graduated with an engineering degree last year. The pay is low and it's ""below where I should be"" but I get along really well with everyone there, and it's the first thing I've semi-enjoyed for a long time. Mostly due to this and the fact that there's a sense of freedom in work schedules without the classic 9-5.


Since I've been working there, I have submitted a few applications to ""serious"" jobs, only the ones that I think I would enjoy. Unfortunately, most of these are looking for a better candidate and I have been unsuccessful with those. As I don't know what I want to do with my future this is the route that I am taking whilst I am still enjoying my job.


I'm not depressed, but I regularly ask myself ""what's the point?"". I don't have a clear path for my future other than pipe dreams where I would need another source of income. I went travelling for a month last year and it was one of the best experiences of my life. As I have saved a lot of money, I'm thinking of doing that again but for a much longer period. Sort of like a hard reset.

134,"I'm an interior designer and work for a small firm. There are 3 of us in our department. Two of them have been with the company for 3+ years. Both were fresh graduates when they entered while this is my 2nd job. The other one resigned and is rendering work till the end of the month. Due to my boss being a bitch again for the nth time yesterday, which got my co-worker fed up, she submitted her resignation today. So now, there's only me.

Now we all hate the management. Aside from being overworked, we were just not learning anything anymore. My plan was to stay till next year and resign, just enough to save up some backup money for when I become unemployed.

I definitely did not see the other one's resignation coming as both of us talked and were planning to stay till next year. 

I'm left with all the burden and work load of two people. To add to the problem, the resignation is effective immediately so she's gone tomorrow. It's a week of deadlines next week and I have to bear all those by myself. No turnovers, no new employees, no replacements, just me. 

I talked to my boss if they can let my co-worker stay for 30 days till they could find a replacement because I cannot handle it alonr but just told me that they're alresdy looking. But we have deadlines next week and I can't do it by myself.

My supervisor gave me till Monday to decide if I want to continue working with the company.

I'm so stressed not only because I am parting with friends but also because of the heavy responsibilities and duties left to me. 

I'm already 27 and extremely worried that if I leave right now, will have a hard time finding a job but at the same time, it was also my plan to resign, only now it's going to be sudden instead of planned. Also, I live in the Philippines so employment is difficult.

138,"For the last 6 months I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety. This is primarily due to being bullied at work. 

To those who know me, I don't take kindly to anyone giving me shit but when you are dealing with passive aggressive behaviour and planned humiliation in the work place it is so much harder to deal with. I'd rather someone tell me to my face that I am a twat or whatever but no, hiding behind underhanded remarks and the guise that they are helping me to purposely make me feel like I am worthless. 

It is easy to look at someone and they seem OK but inside they feel like they are dying. I have myself tried to take my life and I feel ashamed and regret my actions but I am still here fighting my demons and one day I hope I will win.
 
However, once again my hand is being forced to do something I do not want to do. I have to make a formal complaint against these people before anything is done even though they know about the bullying, in essence they are calling me a liar. I believe the reason they are asking me to do this is that is near impossible to prove passive aggressiveness but the effects are literally life changing. This would give my employer the reasoning to dismiss me and there would be no repercussions as they appeared to have done all they can.

I do not think this is acceptable and could also be construed as a form of bullying.

142,"My friend is in a relationship with someone who I think isn't right for her.

The hard part is, her partner was initially my friend first, and I met her through him and we became great friends.

At first, it was great - they seemed to have a great relationship, one to envy...but they moved into a house together and I just see a huge change in her (for the worse). When I asked her about it, she confirmed everything that I suspected.

When we first met, she was such a force of life - bursting with energy and fun and such a spark to her. She's a naturally very positive person, and very similar to me in that way. But over the last year it's like her light has been snuffed out. Her partner complains about EVERYTHING, he hates being around other people, he's always moaning about something. They love each other, but they have zero in common. But she has compromised EVERYTHING for him, and he has compromised nothing for her. She adores one city to live in, he refused, so she moved where he wanted to go. She does all the housework, he does none, or the bare minimum, and then wants praise for the tiniest thing he does in the house (when she gets none for all the work she does every day). They have very different tastes in going out places and music - and he complains when she listens to the music she wants to listen to in the house, and she has to listen to his stuff all the time. 

The main reason I'm writing this, is that she is stuck in her life. She's always dreamed of travelling the world. I am trying to encourage her to keep going for her dream, but she's worried about what everyone will think. She's currently at University, but hates it, so wants to leave, but is scared of letting her partner's parents down as they were so proud that she's ""making something of herself"". She's also worried that leaving to go travelling will ruin her relationship and she'll come back to nothing and have to start all over again....

I want to tell her to just go for it, as she shouldn't let anyone else stand in the way of her dreams and it could be the best opportunity of her life to go and find a different perspective on things. But I'm afraid that she's going to succumb to her situation and not take the leap.

How can I advise her without being the bad guy telling her to end the relationship as it's pulling her down?",20Jul2017,2
144,"So, this is my first post ever. I had a bit of a shock this week. 

My parents split up when I was 7 ( in my early 40s now). My ""father"" went off the radar at that point. I saw and hears nothing from him until I was 14. He came to see me and made all these grand promises of how he wanted to be in my life. You probably won't be too surprised to know that he didn't.

This was pretty hard to deal with and felt like a huge rejection.  He was a biker though, so I kinda told myself that he wasn't prepared to be a father and tried not to think about it much.

Then about a week ago, I was googling him out of curiosity and found his obituary. He died a few years ago. I was sure he had been murdered or something due to the lifestyle he lead. He wasn't. He died comfortably in his sleep  after an illness. 

I found an old friend of his online and they confirmed it was him.  they told me that he was living with my half brother at the time. I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. I had no idea I had half siblings! 

Guys, this hurt so bad. Not only would I never get to have closure with him and tell him how angry I was at him for being sucha shit, it turns out he was able to be a father, just not to me. He wrote me off like I never existed! I am so angry and hurt. I feel like I wasn't good enough, like I wasn't worth his time.

At the same time, his son wants to hear from me. I definately would like that. it's not his fault that his father was an asshole. How do i get past this? What the hell do I say to my brother (?).

I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease approximately four years ago and began treatment around the same time. The diagnostic was a very long and excessive amount of tests and procedures which ultimately led to the decision.


For those of you who don't know what Crohn's Disease is.
I was put on an infusion treatment that costed nearly $10,000 every time I got it which totals up to ~ 20 times(I could find the exact amount of times after a little bit of searching if needed).


Fast forward four years and we are here. My new adult GI doctor, we'll call him Dr. Robert, has performed an endoscopy, colonoscopy, and also had a Prometheus test done. All of which came back negative.


I am also a medical cannabis patient, and therefore Dr. Robert believes that either the marijuana has miraculously cured me or I was misdiagnosed originally.

My co worker has been showing signs of flirtation to me, I think, but I don't know if it's just my interpretation or if it's actually weird. 

Incident 1: we were texting about some work related stuff and I sent her some kind of meme, and she responded with ""lol I love you"". This was weird and I told her it made me uncomfortable, and she dismissed it as something she normally does, I didn't think much of it tbh.

Incident 2: when she got onboarded to full time I offered to take her out for lunch. I don't remember the context but at one point she grabbed one of my hands with both of hers. Iirc she was excited. I didn't say anything about it, but it was weird. 

Incident 3: office prank I won't go into, as it could be revealing, but she left a note on the prank that said ""love (coworker)"". I didn't think too much about this one.

Incident 4: at work she got something to work that she'd been struggling with and she grabbed my hands again. I should have said something but didn't. 

Incident 5: she leaves about an hour earlier than me. I had been helping her quite a bit that day, and I got super busy right as she was leaving. I was focused so I didn't see/hear anything but she left me a note that said ""have a great rest of your day! Love, (name)"". I approached her about it and told her it made me uncomfortable and she started acting upset. She became very terse and apathetic.

There are other smaller incidents too. 

Sometimes she complains about her BF, and talks about how they enable each other but they're in love so they are going to make it work. She'll sometimes complain about the fact that he has no job and doesn't want to do the dirt to get one etc. Etc.

I don't think I can pass university.

They already said things that make me want to give up.. it makes me so sad and useless/worthless... 
My dad screamed "" She won't study at all "" and when I asked about transferring to college he's like ""No, you already failed enough, go get a office job or work at the restaurant"" 
My mom's like ""Studying wasn't made for you, go be a garbage cleaner.""
and my middle sister is like ""I hope you go fail and die""
And these words never left my head, I just feel so overwhelmed and stressed by my living situation, sometimes to the point where if I die, I don't gotta go through any of this. 
If I didn't live with my family, I feel like I would've had more motivation &amp; put in so much more dedication/effort into my studies.
But as of now, I just feel like calling it quits.. because all my family (especially my mom and middle sister).

183,"I have stupidly gotten myself into quite a pickle. I've been in an off/on relationship with a girl for several years. Late last year, after she got evicted from her apartment, estranged herself from her family, and returned from a brief trip overseas, I allowed her to come stay with me in my apartment.

Seven months later or so, I am practically a prisoner in my own home. She is legitimately crazy (bipolar or schizophrenic, or both), and refuses to get help for it. Everything to her is a joke or a setup, and she sits around playing Candy Crush all day, waiting for someone to tell her the ""truth."" 

I've given her a 30-day notice to leave, which of course she barely glanced at, tore up, and threw in my face. If and when I evict her, she will essentially be homeless, as she has no friends and she is estranged from her family. I don't feel good about making her homeless, but at the same time I can't keep living like this.

If anyone out there has made similarly stupid mistakes and has any tips for me, I would be appreciative. I figure this could go down any number of ways, none of them ""good.""",20Jul2017,2

He said that he'll pay me 25% commission per customer, and that his average sale was $1000 per customer. To be fair his products do range around the $1000 range. 

So I said that I'll do it if he pays a $100 upfront deposit. (I only wanted $100 for redoing his Facebook anyway) He said sure and that was a drop in the bucket. He said I'll make six figures very quickly if I work hard enough.

188,"He's almost 30, has never held a serious job, still lives at home, and is becoming increasingly disrespectful towards my parents. 

My father has provided a very comfortable lifestyle for our family and in doing so, unwittingly created a monster in the process. 

My brother attended university after graduating from high school with plans of Law School. He fucked around way too much and befriended other students who lived extravagant lifestyles. His, ""friends,"" all came from families with multi-million dollar businesses and had no real need to obtain a degree other than to say that they, ""earned,"" one. This mentality rubbed off on my brother who then began to constantly emulate their lifestyle and beliefs (somewhat hardline islamist). 

By the time he graduated, his GPA was too low for Law School and his degree was essentially worthless due to his lack of networking. His, ""friends,"" all entered their family businesses and continued their lives, while my brother had to move back home with nothing more than a $100,000 piece of paper. 

This all happened 6 years ago. He's worked a few entry level jobs, but he always lost interest and eventually quit. He changed his career path towards Medicine (either PA school, or Medical School) and spent 2 years taking pre-requisite courses, but changed his mind about it last year.  

For the past 5 months, he's stated a friend of his is attempting to get him an interview for a job that actually pays well enough for him to move out. 

This has been fruitless so far. 

Throughout all of this, my brother has become increasingly disrespectful towards my parents. Examples include, berating them for small mistakes, losing his temper and cursing loudly around them, and making expensive/pointless purchases at the disapproval of my father ($5000+). 

To top it all off, my father has been having cardiac troubles for the past few weeks, but my brother's behavior has not changed at all. In order to ease my father's recovery, we needed to provide a stress-free environment. But, the berating, cursing, and general disrespect continues. 

Any attempts to address these issues just leads to more anger and disrespect. 

I'm not really sure what to do. My parents have both expressed their concerns to me, but my relationship with my brother has been rocky to say to the least.

193,"I feel lonely. Everyday I wake up and wish I hadn't. Every night I try to go to sleep but it takes hours because I can't stop thinking. I think about how alone I feel. I feel alone because I don't have many friends because it's hard for me to make them. I made one friend recently, but it was a girl. Nothing wrong with that is there? Not at all. It's easy for me to befriend women because my first best friend was my tom boyish sister. But then I ended up liking this girl. I told her and the feeling wasn't mutual. That wasn't exactly said, as she made excuses about herself rather than just saying she's not attracted to me. But that's alright now I have a friend. But I still feel empty. Some back story, 7 months ago my first long term relationship ended (3 years). Not only did I lose a loved, but I also lost a best friend (of 6 years). Two months later I had my birthday. I'm 20 years old. I have nightmares about my ex everyday. I dream I tell her how I feel, how I want to take her back, how I want another chance and she ignores me. She lives her life, goes on roller coasters, vacations, dinners, lunches, walks, even dates while I sit there next to her the whole time telling her I feel. After 4 or 5 months of this I Try and talk to her again. She gives me a generic 'we have no animosity, I've moved on you should too bye ✌🏻' she even used that emoji. No more nightmares after that day, as they have been confirmed to be a reality. I realize I need to move on. I have so much affection to give and no one to give it to, and thinking the way I have been has just made me hurt and cry for the past 5 months. I want to find someone new but I have depression and I have social anxiety, so I sit in my room for hours trying to figure out why I'm so isolated and alone. Now go back a month or two ago. I accidentally made a friend without even trying. She comes over every week late at night and we talk for hours and hours. One time she remarked how she had so many notifications because we had talked for 5 hours straight and she never had to look at her phone. It's so much fun and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even after her rejecting me we have still stayed good friends, and she still comes over 2-3 times a week. But I need more. I need someone I can hug. I need someone I can snuggle. I want to be someone's priority. To her I am no priority because right now with her difficult circumstances she's her only priority. I can't ask to snuggle her because it would be just weird. Asking anyone to snuggle is weird. But I just want to feel less alone. I have good friends, I have family, I have a best friend, but I need something more. I don't want someone to love because I know loving is hard. I just want someone to care about me, and I want to care about someone. I would ask any random girl out but I'm not like that. I need to know who you are, learn to trust you, see if you trust me, have deep and revealing conversations, and learn about you first. I did all that with my recently made friend so I fell 'in like' with her. I want to find someone who can hold me and care about me but because of my inability to even make a friend I have no chance at finding anyone. I say I FEEL lonely because I do have friends, we hang out we laugh we enjoy each other's company. But I still feel empty. What can I do to feel less empty?

Well time went on but for some reason I kept getting more near her.

I've been at this place for 9 months and I am part of a team of 6 including my direct manager and the GM.

I possibly have an offer from a bigger chain/brand hotel. 20 miles, 30minutes away from my house. Much bigger team to work with, various positions and levels. Bigger hotel. Different crowd of guests (airport guests mainly). Start at 12/hr and I only know one person that works there who's sliding me in for an interview.

Though my cumulative GPA was only around a 3.0 (poor decisions in my early collegiate career), I was able to finish with a 3.75 major GPA. Initially I figured I would graduate and immediately land a good job in either the financial industry or tech field, however this is just not the case.

219,"I purchased a laptop through AMAZON with an included 1 year warranty protection plan from the manufacturer (ASUS). After having many problems, I decided to turn to a legal firm about what I could do to refund the laptop and be done with all this headache/hassle. This is a copy of the initial situation that I sent to them:

ASUS ROG G751JY-DB72 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop, Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M Graphics (G-SYNC), 24 GBS RAM. I purchased this product on August 15th, 2015 originally for $2,152.68. The item arrived but was defective so I returned it for a replacement which I recieved on August 30th. About 3 months in, the left side USB ports on the laptop stopped working completely. It was a bit of a minor problem as I had a total of 4 USB ports, 2 broke, and while they needed to be fixed, I couldn't send the laptop in for repairs right then as I was using it for school, I decided I would send it in later when another problem might surface and it would need other repairs. In March the Bluray disc drive stopped working, and in May the charging circuit on the motherboard gave out, the charging cirtcuit apparently died on it as it would not charge when plugged in to the wall outlet, the power cord itself however, continued receiving power. I called ASUS about the issue and they recommended I set up an RMA and send it in. Two days later I left for a trip from my home state of COLORADO to CALIFORNIA. ASUS has a repair facility in UTAH, so I called their support and asked if I could just drop it off at their repair center instead of needing to send it by mail for fixing which would take much longer... I did that on June 4th. Two days later, on the 6th they replied to me with an RMA number. They also confirmed and said yes I could do that (They did that verbally on the phone). I dropped it off with a place called ""SUPERIOR COMPUTERS"" which was a direct repair/replacement facility of Asus' on June 7th in Utah. I gave them the RMA number ASUS provided me with and left it to them, they said they needed to replace the motherboard and that it would take 7 to 10 days to fix... Over the course of the next month, through to mid july I continued calling and speaking with Superior computers about getting my laptop back, erytime I called they said they hadn't fixed it/hadn't recieved a reply from ASUS for a replacement motherboard yet. I was leaving on a trip to Japan in August and called almost 50 times from when I dropped it off to when I left for Japan.
Eventually in september, we got fed up with waiting for them to fix it and asked for the laptop to be returned to us and we would set up a new RMA and mail it to Asus directly this time. They received it and sent it back in early October to repair the bluray drive, the USB ports and the motherboard. It returned to us mid November. We got it back with all those issues fixed, however, new issues had surfaced. Everytime I opened the lid of the laptop there was an electrical popping sound from inside the laptop. It was also missing a stick of DDR3 Laptop RAM from inside (The computer comes with 24gbs of RAM but was returned to me with only 16). I called and a new RMA was created and I sent it back to be repaired for the third time the next day... I got it back just after Thanksgiving, but in the process of return, FedEx-who Asus had shipped the unit through, had severely damaged the laptop and it had to be immediately sent back and a claim was filed with fedex while my laptop was being repaired. (Also to note, when it was returned, though damaged by Fedex, it was still missing the original ram stick, it still only had 16gbs instead of 24) However, this was my 4th time sending it back and I didn't want to deal with a $2,000 laptop having been mishmashed/repaired so manytimes.. I called a supervisor and asked for a full replacement (We recorded this call). The supervisor said they would send in a request for it and get back to us, they never did. We called a few weeks later to get a supervisor (we also recorded this call) who said if it had any more issues we could call and get a replacement the next time. I got the laptop back on the 31st of December, 2016. However, it was/is still missing the ram stick (Which I called asking to be fixed more than 30 times) the USB ports on the left side do not work once more (one of the original problems that I sent it in for), and over the last two months the laptop has crashed in the middle of work 27 times. Also to note, with the screen brightness turned all the way down, and the computer put on optimization/battery mode.. It lasted only 40 minutes from a full battery charge to completely depleted.
I've called and spoken with the ""Highest authority"" who said they don't do refunds and they only thing they can offer is a replacement of the laptop.
Amazon on the other hand, offered a replacement of the laptop OR a 50% refund on the laptop. (I would not keep the laptop)

That was all in January-March (2017). I sent that letter to a local attorney firm I had a membership with. Who, over the next 4 months, assisted in drafting a letter and sending it to ASUS in an effort to ask for a refund. The letter was never answered, and when I called the firm about it, they said after further review of ASUS's warranty guidelines, that they had no obligation to refund my laptop or to really do anything else. By this time I'm way outside of the extended warranty period offered to me by ASUS and I don't know what to do at this point... I contacted them because I believed it could be disputed under consumer protection/Colorado (where I reside) Lemon Law, but that doesn't seem to be the case? What should or can I do? The laptop barely functions now...

I thought this was awkward and rude to me and my friends who were all wondering why they didn't join us if they RSVP'd.

Eventually, I invited him to hang out again as I had an extra show ticket to give away. He came and asked if it was OK to invite this person. In seemingly no time, this other guy just showed up (it would have taken him a long time to get there) so I think he basically already invited him and just asked me if it was OK after this person was already on their way.

It's really distracting. I get that he's attracted to this person and wants to hang out with him, but I don't care to be his excuse to do so. What is the best way of asking him about this?

It's so weird I don't understand like what could possibly make this my most publicly attractive state? ",20Jul2017,2
227,"I'm writing this post a little buzzed due to a celebration of me getting a new job so there may be some errors in grammar and spelling.

My boyfriend I started dating 6 months ago. We've both had jaded pasts with bad relationships and bad home lives so we decided to the best route was to be completely and utterly open with each other about our pasts. Well, about a month into our relationship, he tells me he has a daughter. While he is a little older than me (22 and 29), I had never heard about or seen his daughter so this threw me through a loop, so I asked him about it. 

He said that she wasn't his biological daughter. At 17 he was made the godfather of his friends' daughter. A month later both of them passed away (I have never asked how, it is not my place), so, at 17, he takes this little girl in and raises her. He had moved out of his house (again, bad home life, so he was living on his own.) 

Two years go by and the little girl's grandparents find out she exists and want custody. My boyfriend being 19, gives her up without a fight. He loves this little girl, but the grandparents can give her a better life than he can. 

They took her away and all he knows is the city where she lives, he knows nothing about her after that. She's turning 12 now. That was 10 years ago.

Well that never bothered me. Until...one night about a month ago he and I were drinking when he came to town (we're long-distance.) He told me that, while he was living alone, this couple really became his only friends. And they had a threesome. The baby was born 9 months later.

I asked him if he thought the baby was his. He originally told me that he kept telling himself she wasn't. 

I'm not going to lie, I freaked. Silently and quietly. The next day it came up again and I told him how it had bothered me, he said that every baby born into his family had white blonde hair and blue eyes when they were born. This little girl had brown hair and brown eyes. 

That should be comforting...if I didn't understand basic genetics and dominated and recessive genes. 

So it could be his daughter, it could not be. I don't know.

Now every time it's brought up, it feels like a little knife in my chest. 

He and I were talking about booking a flight to wherever we could find a cheap flight. I found a flight to the city where she is living currently and before I could think, I said the city. And he reminded me why he didn't want to go. He would constantly be thinking about her and wondering. I wasn't mad, but I got that knife again. I can't explain the emotion. It's not jealousy. It's not anger. I don't know what it is.

I'm so confused. Why do I feel this why? Am I wrong for feeling this way? ",20Jul2017,1

230,"The Dunkin Donuts that is closest to my work is occupied by this middle-aged, probably unemployed, dude, who brings his own coffee, and sits in the corner, reading The Boston Herald. The first time he started talking to me, he seemed pretty innocent. We're both regulars there, he asked me about my motorcycle, we talked about sports, and finance, since we both work (probably worked* in his case) in that field.

After a while, he started asking increasingly personal questions. They were really innocent at first, so I divulged. Eventually, I started noticing that he would say some mildly racial things about the neighborhood that I told him I live in, the area where the Dunkin is, the area where I attended university in Boston. It was at this point that I realized I didn't want to talk much to him anymore.

From there, the comments about women, races, and nationalities got worse and worse, to the point that he seemed to be foaming at the mouth and talking loudly enough that anyone around could easily hear if they paid attention.

This past Monday, I went in, grabbed my Order-Ahead drink/sandwich, and turned around swiftly. He saw me, and followed me over to the napkins/straws counter and started up again. I would respond with ""Uh-huh"", and ""Yeah, sure"", because I didn't want him to suddenly get violent (who knows...).

I leave, and he literally follows me to my car, I get in, and he is standing in the way of my door closing...still going on and on. I turn on the engine, and he goes, ""Oh yeah, go ahead, but roll your window down"". I close the door, and unfortunately, since it's like 95 F with ridiculous NE humidity, I, kind of, do have to roll the window down. I peeled out as soon as I could, but he walked right next to my car window until I hit the gas hard.

I think he thinks it's okay to talk to me like that because of some perverse thought that since I'm a white guy (very german-looking with blond hair and blue eyes), that I must also be a mouth-foaming bigot.

I know it seems obvious to just not go to the Dunkin anymore. But it's not really about the coffee... I feel like I should tell Dunkin Corporate about this.... this guy drinks coffee there without paying for anything (he's asked me for food on two occasions), and he spouts probably the most racist things I've ever heard in my life. He is a major detractor to my and probably others' interest in going into that store. Obviously, he's a f%&amp;#ing racist and that's pretty obscene. So, the list goes on and on, supporting the decision to do something about this guy.

The problem with reporting him is that he knows the office park where I work, what my car looks like, what town in the greater Boston area where I live, the school I attended, my first name.... I'm kind of terrified that if this guy is even slightly off his rocker, that I could be in some mild danger.

Thoughts? Anyone with similar experiences? Love for Dunkin?

**tl;dr:** *dude blatantly spews racial smut to me every morning that I try to get a coffee, and I feel obligated to report him to Dunkin Corporate, but I'm worried that he might retaliate*",20Jul2017,5
231,I'm a 21 male who is in college for computer science (still have 3 years left) I work in sales and do just fine for myself financially. I met my dad for the first time in my life last year and have met up with him a few times since then. He seems to be very well off and continues to make subtle hints for me to move closer to him and maybe work with him at this company he is high up in. He knows I'm not totally interested in that kind of work because I love computers. So now on to the problem.... he called me up and asked me to take over the companies website and creative marketing. I'm more than capable of doing the project I just don't wanna take his hand outs and that's what this feels like. I've shot down the ideas of working for him in the past just because I don't wanna ride his coat tails but this is a serious opportunity. I don't know what to say or if I should even consider the job offer. Please help. ( I've only met up with him 3 times in my life. He never tried to be around when I was a kid.),20Jul2017,1

235,"My friend did everything right. He came over to my house and told me he's going out with her tomorrow. I told him it was OK but I don't think I am. The thought of it has been turning my stomach since he left. 

So a little back story. 

Me and her weren't together that long. It was only 5-6 months but we had all been friends for years before. We actually started off in similar circumstances to what is going on now and I feel quite hypocritical feeling bad when I didn't really consider the other guy fully at the time.

It ended with me treating her terribly. Twice. She was going back abroad and I pretty much ignored her once she was gone. I can't defend what I did at all.

He's my best friend. She helped me through the toughest period of life. I can honesly say I want nothing but happiness for the both of them. Just not together. 

He's only just out of a 6 year relationship and she is leaving the country again in a few weeks. I'm pretty sure this won't be going anywhere and that makes me feel worse. 

I know that me and him will be friends no matter what happens, we've been through way to much for this to get in the way. After treating her so badly I don't want to be the Dickhead again. 

Do I tell him or not?  As I said, I know I'll get over it whatever happens, I just feel really shit right now.

240,"As the title says, I found a lump, hard textured, pretty mobile in one of my boobs. As far as I know my medical facts, girls my age often get fibroadenomas, which are benign breast tumors. Mine has a very considerable chance of being a fibroadenoma or a fatty cyst.

Now, I don't know about my family cancer history, we're very stranged from them. I've never had a good relationship with my mother and I don't know how she will react if I tell her.

I fear that her overreaction might be much worse than taking my chances and sneaking out to have a mammography. 

Should I risk it and go alone?

Risk it and tell her? (She might rip my head off, call me a bloody liar and ignore me, make a gynormous drama about herself, or actually be supportive and help me, which is unlikely.)

Ignore it and see if it shrinks when my estrogen levels go down?

242,"To start here is some backstory: my dad is super religious, very stubborn, has been slightly verbally abusive for my whole life. My mom divorced him when I was 2 for all these reasons. The past few years has mostly been arguments over our disagreements, and every time he calls I go ""here comes a 3 hour argument.."" 
  He's been off and on dialysis for the past 2 years. He goes through cycles of realizing he needs it, and then changing his mind thinking Jesus will heal him instead. Cycles of liking the Drs and then thinking they are lying or at least being manipulated by Satan. (I'm an atheist) I told him this last time that if he were going to quit again I couldn't continue with having a relationship due to the stress it causes on not only me but other family members who then count on me to fix his decision. As well as all the medical trips I have to take him to just to get back in the system. I feel like if it's not toxic, it's at best a negative relationship. I would not have ever talked to this kind of a person had he not been my father, so why should I have to just because he is? 

My grandma called me today, crying, begging that I try to make it up with him, now that he has quit dialysis a month ago, he may not have more than a few more weeks to live. She thinks I'll regret it and Satan will make me feel guilty for the rest of my life, also it hurts her so bad. Now of course I don't want anyone to hurt because of my decisions. I don't know weather or not I love him, but I can say for certain I don't like him. 

After she called I have this feeling of guilt for making her and other family members feel this way. How should I handle this?",20Jul2017,1

245,"I've been friends with Claire* for over 7 years. We go to the same college. Nothing big has gone wrong per say, but this isn't the first time I've questioned the friendship. Thing is, I'm pretty sure she thinks everything is fine!

We used to see each other a lot and talk about a lot a few years ago. Now when we get together, I don't really want to go. We usually go out to eat, and our conversations are intermittent. She always wants to talk about the same three things: her bf, her bf's family, and the group of girls that hate her for dating her bf. That last one I thought got left behind in high school. Many of our convos consist of her showing me convos she and her bf had over text. Another thing I'm worried about is that since starting college, Claire's lost a lot of friends. Me and my other friend are her only gal pals left. She's also tried pushing me toward guys I told her I'm not interested in.

A while ago she was having family issues, so she stayed with me for a few days. I wound up watching video after Youtube video of gamer stuff, forcing myself to laugh so she'd think everything was fine, or pretending to be interested watching her play video games. Which is fine, but I'm not a gamer and she knows. At least I think she knows. Lately whenever I say something serious to her, she kind of brushes it aside or starts bashing one of the girls again.

I just backed out of a trip with her because I honestly don't know if I'll be able to get along with her for a week without either getting bored or exasperated. Is there anything I can do to salvage this? If not... I still don't know what to do. I can't just let the friendship die, since we go to the same school and I feel kind of obligated. Plus, I feel like it would turn into a big nasty blowup.",20Jul2017,1

251,"Hi everyone! So i am a Senior this year and throughout my Sophomore and Junior year I have always had this idea of what kind of degree I wanted to go into college for, Film and Television. I have always loved movies and TV shows and the idea of being able to work on movie/ TV sets or behind the scenes excited me. I have enjoyed filming and editing content for projects and classes so much that I convinced myself that it was the perfect area to go into. My problem is leaving junior year and into the summer, I have felt that compared to other students at my school, i am very unskilled and that my ideas for content aren't as good compared to others. I also feel as though because I am not producing as much of my own good content over the summer and its almost August (i know I can make something great but nothing has come to mind at all its like a huge brain fart) I feel as though compared to more ""motivated"" or more ""constantly producing"" creators I would be considered more of ""dead weight"" and not someone who would be somewhat successful in the film business. Also adding onto this issue is debating whether or not i should change my whole idea of being a film maker and go into another hobby that I love which is makeup. I love makeup and am constantly creating new looks on myself. I always practice when i'm bored ,especially during the time range of 12-2 AM, and i think I can be really successful at it if I continue to broaden my horizons and practice more. Because this ""pre-college"" crisis has been filling my brain lately, I have been thinking about the idea of going to cosmetology school rather then going into college to be a film major. Idk i think that if I were a makeup artist i would have more of a chance of getting jobs and making money, but on the other hand I would miss out on the chance to work in the film industry. I love both hobbies but i'm not sure If maybe i'm overthinking this or what but any advice is helpful! What do you think my odds are in both industries? Do you think i should pursue film or being a makeup artist? I'm very conflicted. Thanks!",20Jul2017,1
