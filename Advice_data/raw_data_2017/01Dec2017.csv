2,"Hi!  I am new to Reddit so I am not sure if this is the right sub Reddit to post this so my apologies in advance.  
I have a friend who just told me, and our group chat of friends, that her mom is probably dying.  She is in the hospital right now, in ICU, and my friend has to go back, from uni, to be with her.  My friend has known that her mom has been sick/dying for a long time, so she says she is fine but obviously when a parent dies it is hard.  I guess I am just asking if there is anything I can do that would help her?  I know everyone's experience is different, but if there is anything I should/shouldn't say to her, or something I could do or get her to make her feel slightly better then that would be very helpful.  Again I know everyone deals differently, but I am not good with these types of situations and I always offer help and a should to cry on/someone who will listen to them.  Any advice would be helpful so thank you again!",01Dec2017,1
5,"This story is slightly complicated, so please bear with me. During my english class, i sit with a large group of friends. There's this guy in the group, who we all absolutely hate. He relentlessly creeps on my good friend, trying to touch her, staring at her tits without shame, trying to ask her out even though she has rejected him. Needless to say it makes her throughly uncomfortable. 

Worst of all, he is a horrible mouth breather. My good friend has issues with loud breathing and mouth noises, and this drives her insane. It gets to the point where on bad days, she starts to tear up and has to go hide in the bathroom to get a break from these noises. I have no issue with that kind of thing, and it even puts me on edge. I know it is unintentional on his part, but its become a huge problem. 

He can't stop talking. No matter what we are doing in class, if the teacher is talking or we need to be doing work, he will continue to talk. He has severe ADHD, but refuses to take his prescribed medication. My friend and others find it hard to get work done, because he will continue to talk no matter what anyone says to him.

We've all tried to talk to her about it, but she's scared to hurt his feelings. The've been friends for about a year now, and she is his closest, and seemingly only friend. I try to distract her by talking, he interrupts me. She tries to move somewhere else, he will follow her wherever she goes. I will put physical barriers, notebooks, chairs, desks, between them, he will move past them to encroach on her personal space.  

She refuses to let me or anyone else talk to him or tell him off. He has no other friends, and is painfully socially awkward. I don't want to sound like an asshole, I sympathize with those who find it hard to socialize, but this guy has become a huge problem that I don't know how to solve. ",01Dec2017,4
6,"My tendency is always to offer advice, to help solve their problem like you would a puzzle. Is this just annoying?

Also I'll say, perhaps, this isn't so bad. Other people have gone through it before. Or it's not so serious. I'm guessing none of these actually help.

What should I do instead? I'm thinking I need to validate the other person's feelings but how. 

Especially when the other person is saying they're, like, worthless or hopeless or made all these mistakes etc? I can't just validate those kinds of feeling when I don't agree.",01Dec2017,1
7,"About a month ago I matched with a Japanese girl on Tinder.  I’m learning Japanese myself, and she’s an exchange student here learning English.  We hit it off on tinder pretty well with a mix of English and Japanese, and agreed to meet up some time.

Couldn’t really get a day planned to meet, until a few days later where she out of the blue asked if I could get lunch with her and her friends.  I obliged and it was a ton of fun, after I dropped them off she and I talked about next time and sent all kinds of smiles and winks over text.  Next time ends up being a week later and we go to the mall together and just do some shopping and eating at the food court.  It was ridiculously fun, I loved and enjoyed every second of it.  We get back to her place and talk in the car for a while and she tells me before she leaves that next time we should go back to the place we went for lunch, it was really good.  We text again after all flirtatiously and she says she’s looking forward to next time and so am I and so forth, super cute stuff.

This was two weeks ago.

We were trying to get something going before thanksgiving as I was going away for a week, but it didn’t pan out last minute.  We texted off and on about random stuff while I was away, and on my last day, I shot her a text saying when I get back, we should do something, what day works for you? No response, so the following day at the airport for hours bored out of my mind I sent her a snapchat message asking if she got that text.

“Yup”

Won’t lie it stung, but I said:

“Okay, let me know if you’re still interested then...”

“Interested in what?”

“Going to (restaurant) or pizza or whatever we decided last time lol”

“Can you take me to (restaurant)?”

“Absolutely, when?”

“I’m not sure...
Depends on hw”

“Okay that’s fine, just let me know whenever you can
I’d love to go again with you some time :) it was really fun”

“Oh really? I’m glad :)
I’d love to go again too !”

And that’s where we’re at folks.  I’m feeling really conflicted on the issue and the signals she’s sending me.  Even though it was only two “dates”, I could really tell how much I enjoyed them more than anything else I’ve done in the past year.  I’m just having a really hard time between wondering where she stands and reconciling that between a language barrier (if there is one, but the above texts are all English) or if she’s just really hard to text.  In person we’re talkative and chatty and really happy, and when we don’t text about planning something we’re also as happy and flirtatious.  She’s a college student and of course has a lot of homework, as am  I (though an intern this semester, so homework doesn’t exist), so I completely understand prioritizing that. Am I just being crazy and overreacting? I really don’t want to let her go, I don’t know where this will go, but I don’t want it to end here.  After meeting her I managed to end an extremely long MMO addiction because I really truly felt that this was better worth my time, but now that I have so much free time I think my sanity is fading.  All my good friends are from high school and not anywhere nearby (though we still group chat almost daily), and my coworkers are 40+ older guys who aren’t quite the “hang out” type.  Looking back I now see how much that game was my life; I think I’m better off for having left it, but I also really don’t know where to go from here.  ",01Dec2017,2

Today, I could’ve SWORN I locked it but I was standing there, pants down and someone walked in, apologized then closed the door immediately. It the most embarrassing moment of my life.

9,"Me and my friends are 17-18 so keep this in mind during the story. So this started back in halloween. Me and a close group of friends went out for a few drinks at one of our houses. Well when we all left, none of us drunk or anything but we stopped somewhere and hung around there for like 30 mins because some people's feet were sore. Well I noticed a black mercedes drive past and take pictures of us and I thought ah no big deal it's legal but then I seen it a second time guy doing the same thing. After that I was a little sketched out and thought nothing after 15 mins passed. At this point we were ready to go home anyway well not me I don't live in the town we were at I was staying at a friends. When we all got up and ready to start walking we all notice the exact same guy doing the same thing so at this point we split into groups of three and ran in all different directions. Everyone else got home well with no problems but my group were followed it felt like at every other corner. Everytime we looked around we saw it. When we got to my friends front door the guy slowed down and us being 17 year olds with a bunch of adrenaline in them decided to run at the car but before we could confront the guy he was gone. Nothing happened 2 weeks after halloween. When it started again I was home alone with my sister and I see a all black tesla parked outside the neighbours house with the lights on inside the car and 4 guys just staring at me when they noticed me and didn't even flinch. Then drove by slowly for 30 mins just looking into my house. Now I see an all black car every week with the guys in them always looking at me. I've brushed it off as coincidence and paranoia but it could be something different. My dad was into a lot of trouble with the law years ago not going to say what it is but it wasn't murder. He was on the run from the law and the I.R.A so there is a very small chance that it could be the I.R.A and the only reason these things passed my mind is because that night 2 weeks after halloween after my dad had got back in from work he was very sketched out and sprinted into the house and stared outside the window for about an hour. Is there anything I can do or even should do, we did tell the police the day after halloween and turns out some other people had seen the same car. This story is 100% true and I am looking for advice on it as I am genuinely scared. If you want to know the basic thing my dad had done back then just pm me.",01Dec2017,0
10,"Ive always been pretty tough with my emotions, rarely do I cry... in fact I think it's been years, but today I just had a huge panic attack in the middle of my math class and started crying uncontrollably. It was a buildup of a ton of things happening around me and I just couldn't keep it all in anymore.

11,"As per title, someone I used to work wants to try smoking weed, and has been “pointed in my direction” (I’m not a dealer, I just smoke a bit by myself).

I understand that it would have been difficult for them to ask in the first place, and they are a bit naive and vulnerable, so I’d have to ensure that they would be safe and in good hands.

12,"Okay so I have a bit of a problem, hence the reason I’m on this thread in the first place. I have been in a relationship with a guy from my high school for quite a bit of time now and we have a very strong relationship and rarely, if at all, get into any disagreements. He means a lot to me and we have a strong bond. He’s a hardworker and well-liked by his peers, as am I, so we really have nothing wrong in our relationship at all. I have absolutely no complaints.

On the other hand, my best friend is also a fantastic person but hasn’t always been there for me. We have drifted apart and came back together throughout our friendship, but never lost the title of “best friend.” We have amazing laughs and times together, but sometimes I do feel pushed to the side a little bit. Other than this, she is genuinely a good person and I honest to god love her presence and enjoy our friendship.

Now my problem is that I have a very important dance coming up that is the only one I will be able to attend with my boyfriend at all but this happens to be on the same night as my best friend’s sweet 16 which is also a one time event. My boyfriend already took out cash to pay for my ticket and really wants me to attend the dance with him. My best friend on the other hand also really wants me at her party. 

I was thinking that I could go to the dance and then go to her sleepover that would have much less guests than her actual party. It would be a second more intimate celebration and I much prefer these smaller get together settings anyways because I can interact with her more. Today I talked to her about this proposition and she told me that I could stay “if there was room.” So this plan is not guaranteed even. 

I’m honestly not sure what I can do at this point because both events are at the same time and I would truly feel awful if I had to pick one or the other because that would be super unfair. I’m afraid of splitting the events in half because that would just stress me out and my boyfriend would not get the full money’s worth of our tickets if we left the dance early. Should I choose one over the other or does anyone have any helpful advice on how to make it fair between them?",01Dec2017,1

18,"Hello. This is the first time I've posted to this subreddit so I hope I'm following the guidelines. But I need advice.

Background:
I work for my local hospital as a lab tech. I'm a recent graduate and have been working there for about 1 year. Our lab is very departmentalized so for my first year I worked in one department and now I'm being trained in another department.

Situation:
I'm being trained on a new bench. It's my official second day on that bench. This bench deals with Bone Marrow samples so it's very complicated since the samples are considered irretrievable. Anyways, I'm working and have to refill a reagent which is mostly Methanol (toxic and flammable). As I'm combining the methanol and other component I ask my senior (aka the on bench supervisor) if I can mix by inversion. He turns to me and asks me if I've gotten a Post Secondary education. I said yes in Biology (pretty standard for my field). He then asks me if I've taken a chemistry course. I say of course. Then he replies in a bit of a condensing tone, ""Well you should know the chemical properties of Methanol"". 
To me it sounds like an insult. Or maybe a crappy joke. But regardless I felt embarrassed and angry.

My question is should I go to HR?? He's my supervisor and he's really close with all the management staff. I'm just a newbie and don't want to cause trouble but I feel like shit.",01Dec2017,1
20,"I am a 21 years old college student.. I want to hang out with people, get a hobby, be obsessed with something but there's nothing. I find almost everything so boring.

I just don't care and then we have nothing to talk about and soon there is awkward silence between us.

22,"It seems that no matter what I do or say that my MIL always has something negative to say. She tells me over and over that I need to go to school to get an actual degree (fiancé and I can’t afford it right now) and has asked me how it feels “going no where” in life since I’m a receptionist. 

When my fiancé and I started planning our wedding we talked about how we wanted something simple, 10 people, outdoors, etc because we wanted to save for a house VS splurge on a wedding. We probably aren’t even going to go on a honeymoon because a house is what really is important to us right now. She told my fiancé I’m cheap and doesn’t understand why she won’t listen to her ideas with the wedding. Her idea of our wedding was for my fiancé and I to pay for all of our guests to go on a weeklong cruise (she called it an all expenses paid vacation while we got married). She’s very selfish and had a hissy fit when I said we couldn’t afford a honeymoon for ourselves yet a vacation for 10 people. 

My fiancé and I have decided to wait to have kids because we want to be married, in a house, student loans mostly paid off, etc before thinking about kids and she asked me why I hated children. 

I can’t even eat or drink anything without her saying “don’t forget you have a wedding dress to fit into”. I find it really rude considering I dealt with an eating disorder for nearly 6 years and she still makes comments about how much I eat.

27,"Hi everyone, my situation involves family issues, a failing business and a move away from home. I'm young but still living with my parents. We were in a city but had to move about 5 hours away for my Dad's work. I was 18 at the time we moved. We kinda moved from the country to the city. My mom started up a business doing lets say arts and crafts. She was struggling at first so she got me to help out. I made the business successful so she let me run the place which was fine by me. This is where everything goes bad. My mum develops an addiction to gambling and over time loses all the money they had saved up. This absolutely destroys my parents relationship but because they are very traditional and care about their image they decide to stick together. This already caused a lot of issues for me because I'm the only one left at home. They would fight and argue non stop about the most dumb things. Their fights would be on and off for about a year all while I'm managing this business. I start to travel back and forth between my old city and where we are now to get away from all their shit. It kept getting worse and what made me the most mad was the fact that there was no resolution, it would always just be 2 weeks of absolute hell in our house then back to normal. This was a recurring cycle because my mum got diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. They would always brush over her mental health issues because she is a nurse. Whenever we would try to get her help for her depression and addictions, her pride would always lead to her saying ""I'm not a crazy person, they'll put me in a mental place."" It got so bad that one night coming home from work I caught her trying to kill herself. She was screaming at me ""Tell your father that he got what he wanted."" Apparently they had a fight and my dad decided to stay in a hotel nearby that night. That night still haunts me today, having to find all the rope, knives and pills in the house and hide them from her. I'm pretty sure that is where my depression started. Our business is starting to fail because I'm losing motivation, I've gained tonnes of weight and don't know what to do. I'm thinking about moving back where all my friends are. I'm scared how my mum will take it because my other siblings didn't move out on good terms with her which led to her mental state.

So this chick is insane. Borderline personality disorder, extremely manipulative but flat out oblivious towards her lies. Went from 50/50 to my mom’s bf having full custody in January, he had a 730 evaluation, which was totally screwed up and incomplete,  and the judge decided to go back to 50/50 less than a month ago. 

Saturday night, R came home from her mother’s, and my mom’s bf was giving her her medicine, and found 13 xanax pills in her case, asked her about them and R said that she takes them for anxiety and it’s fine because J had been giving them to her for a long time, back when they were still married (over 5 years ago). My mom and her bf told R that that’s absolutely not ok, it’s dangerous and illegal, R freaked out telling her dad he has to PROMISE that her mom wouldn’t be in trouble. 

Mom’s bf told minors counsel, Tuesday she met with R and R told her that her mom gave them to her. MC chick immediately ordered an emergency hearing for Wednesday morning. 

J said that R must have stolen them from her. Yes, she incriminated her 12 year old daughter for stealing and abusing a controlled substance. J’s attorney then suggested that my mother gave/planted them on R, and last night my mom was served a subpoena for a deposition. 

For now, the judge wants the evaluator to investigate, but the evaluator is crazy too and included descriptive lies J made to make my mom and her bf look awful on the evaluation, then added ONE sentence stating it’s fallacy. 

J also said in the evaluation when asked if my mom is a good parent, “no, because she let her kids drop out of school and they’re medicated”. My brother and I are in school. I am 17 in college. We’re both on medicine for depression/anxiety and ADHD that we were prescribed obviously because our mom isn’t the crazy one, and we’ve been in therapy. 
J started giving R her own prescription drugs when she was 2, and ordered the same prescription for R from doctors because “it works for J and R has the same thing because..” 

This is only .00001% of the story, fucking insane right? I want to find a way for the evaluator and judge to take this more seriously. May have a CPS case, but I think it needs to happen sooner than it will.

40,"I started 9th grade four months ago and it has been some of the lowest times for me. To fully understand my situation let me give you a little background. Im in this program known as the scholar program and I have been for the past 3 years. It's an accelerated learning pathway where I take a series of rigoures courses to help aid myself to college. All of my classes are predetermined and I have been with the same classmates, every period, since 6th grade. Now I've met a few close friends here, but it's few and far between. I've been bored being with my same classmates and have no friends outside of the program. I feel as if I am extremely lonely as I rarely speak to them outside of school and those inside of the program have formed small cliques. I often find myself alone on weekends and my phone seems only to be useful to call my parents. I always see everyone so happy with tons of friends on their side and get jealous over it. I had a girlfriend for a brief period of time to my surprise. A close friend that made me feel special and a little happier during my dark times but we broke up. She doesn't even talk to me anymore, throwing away a friendship I valued for years. 

It's also comes to my mind that I don't know who I am. I'm insecure and care about how people perceive me. I don't know what I want to do in the future. I don't know what kind of person I am or what to be. I can't seem to find who I really am and find myself copying the styles of others. This identity crisis topped with the loneliness is killing me inside. I wake up tired then I'm really sad arriving at school. I give out false reasons if I'm being a mute or giving off a  depressed look. I normally act happy but some days it's hard even to do that. I just don't know what to do or who I am. I want acceptance but I'm not sure how to achieve it. I'm not happy with myself at the end of the day. I go home all depressed, go to sleep, then cram in the little work I feel like doing and repeat. I see other people's lives and I want them. I often  daydream of what could've been if I wasn't  stuck in my bubble of classes and insecurities. 

I've recently been hating school a lot more than I use to. I have trouble paying attention in class and find myself turning to a ""fuck everybody"" attitude. My grades haven't been great this semester I'm stuck with a C in my math 2 B's in Spanish and Chem, with the rest remaining A's and even those are slipping. My work habits are deteriorating and I find myself tired and easily annoyed giving bare minimum to pass myself through my classes. Im often distracted on figuring ways to be more appealing or things I rather do. I'm not sure what I'm going through. I know I have a high focus on school always have but I think with my loneliness and missing identity makes it hard. I'm also a little burnt out putting so much effort into my work previous and don't feel like doing it again. I don't know if I want to continue in the program I'm in but I know if I quit I will truly be lost. My mom's been recently disappointed with my actions when it comes to grades and things making me even more sad. I look back on my grades seeing so many places I can improve but I'm such a huge procrastinator it's hard. I care, I really do but I just find it hard to concentrate and not procrastinate. 

Tl;Dr All in all this year is no where near my best and the next three weeks aren't looking bright. I want to do better at school. I want more friends and I want to know who I am. I hate my don't care attitude right now it makes it's hard to focus and enjoy things. I am really sad as of now and don't understand my life or how to fix it. I turn to you as a therapist as sorts as I can't get one. I just am willing to take any forms of advice as I'm in a unhealthy state of mind affecting my work and life more than it should. Thanks for listening.

43,"Hi, everyone! So unfortunately, it is the night before a really big math proof is due, and there is one girl in my group that hasn't done ANYTHING. For context, this is a fifteen-twenty page math proof, I'm one of the only ones in my group (of 4 including myself) who seems to have a good grasp of the math that we are explaining, so I have usually done the bulk of the work, this is our fourth group project together. Usually the person has usually contributed something to our group (introduction/conclusion) but it is due tomorrow and she hasn't done anything. I've already typed up about 15 pages, and there are two problems left that I'm trying to hold out on her to do, so she can at least contribute something. Our last group project, she half-way did a problem, and then never finished it, so I had to revise her work and do all of her work last time, too. I am really considering her reporting her to my professor because I know I will be up late doing her part of the project, and I have a quiz tomorrow that I will not be able to study for because of her lack of work. She will get a zero if I say something, if reported, as my professor can see the revision history on our paper of who did and not do work. He only checks if someone asks him to check. Usually I would let this roll off my back, because I understand people have busy lives and sometimes just don't have time, but this is the second time she has done this to me, and it's really frustrating that I have to suffer because of someone else's negligence. Should I report her?

47,"I am a sophomore in college approaching finals. I'm failing all of my classes badly. I would have to ace all of my finals to have a shot at attending next semester because I am already on probation warning (got poor grades last semester, but not nearly as bad as they are now). 

I hate college so much. I can't sleep at night because of the anxiety and I have to drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee every morning to help me stay awake, which only exacerbates the anxiety and keeps me up as I also drink a couple in the afternoon or do espresso shots. In order to fall asleep I have to have a couple of beers and smoke weed. It is genuinely fascinating to me how at the end of the summer I was anti-drug, didn't drink, was in great shape, and had an interest in a lot of academic areas. Now it's all going downhill and I can't think of anything except how bad I feel, which leads to me not going to class and shirking when it comes to work, which in turn is making everything worse. I have tried to escape this vicious cycle and I just cannot do it. Every waking moment is horrible for me. My favorite thing in life right now is sleeping (actually feels amazing, it's the silver lining of the situation).

I can't imagine failing out of college. My whole life I've had an ego of intelligence. I come from a good family of a lot of smart and successful people, I was in the gifted program through primary and secondary school, always in high-level classes and I thought I was going to be a famous economist or at least be an impactful teacher so I can help people. I'm at a really good liberal arts college.

I've always been the ""smart and lazy"" type, but I've always HATED the lazy side, I don't identify with it at all. There are some things that I've been super passionate about and done independently (I learned Japanese in high school through the internet and skipped 5 semesters of it), but anything I've ever had to do for class has always numbed my mind. I wish there was some kind of magic bullet to fix it but I know it doesn't exist. So I accept that I will probably fail out.

I feel like I would be okay if I could have a ""fresh start."" Different location, different things, different people, everything reset. It's an impossible scenario but my life feels like I'm in a house that is on fire, if that makes any sense.

I have a beautiful girlfriend I met a couple of months ago who is loving and caring, but it's exhausting putting up a shtick so that I seem happy around her.

What can I do when I fail out that will feel satisfying to me? I want to help people. I want to make a good amount of money. I want to have a career where my opinion matters and I can use my voice frequently. I've always had a ""last resort"" plan where if my only option is to be forced into a low-paying trash job I would commit suicide. Very unlikely to come to that though, I think I'll find a way. I'm just extremely lost and sad and have no idea what to do. The worst part is my GPA after this semester will be like 1.6 and I will not be admitted to any other schools. I need to satisfy that ""intelligence ego."" I don't want to be another schmuck who hates his life. I want to explore and experience life. I want to be happy. Thank you for reading this.",01Dec2017,8

Last week Barbara called out Anna for reporting to work late. Anna was upset and suddenly informed me that a situation happened between them a couple of months ago that is causing friction. 

I spoke with her about it today and she told me that the two of them had gotten together once outside of work hours. When Anna got there, she was surprised and scared to see that a man was also present. Barbara then propositioned her to join them in a threesome. Anna was shocked and upset. She declined and left but the whole thing made her very uncomfortable and she has been trying to avoid her ever since... Anna's shift follows Barbara's and she has been coming in to work late so as to not have to speak with her.

Barbara is coming back into work tomorrow and I'm not sure what to do. We have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment, so I'm inclined to let her go but there is really no evidence except Anna's word.

I don't want it to look like we are indirectly terminating her for coming forward about this either.

55,"Hello all,

I was rear ended today and I’m working with the other persons insurance on correcting any damages.

What I can see is my bumper has visual dents. I know a body shop would look at that, but I’m more worried if there was any damage internally to the mechanics of the car. After the accident I smelled rubber but I’m assuming that’s because she was coming to a complete halt. I was able to drive my car home which was about a mile or so. I just want to make sure I get a thorough look at the car when I get an estimate for any damages. Does a body shop look at any other damage besides the cosmetic damage caused be the accident? Or should it be assessed by a mechanic for any internal damage?

The other persons insurance company stated that a claims adjuster will call me tomorrow to explain my options but I just want to go in prepared for where I will take my car in. I don’t want to have issues in the future with my car because I didn’t get the proper assessment.

Thank you!

58,"Some background: I've been friends with this guy since middle school but we lost contact shortly after and bumped into each other again a couple years ago. Since then, we'd been seeing each other a couple times a year as he lives out of state and comes to visit for the holidays.

He's a great friend and he treats me well when we hang out, but there's one thing that really bothers me: he's chronically late.

We made plans for 5:30 today. He tells me he'll be here around 6 and then informs me that he's caught in a standstill on the highway and he'll be a little late. Ultimately he arrives at 7 and at that point I'm already in my pajamas after a long work day because I'd decided I'm not going to put up with him being constantly late every time we make plans.

When he arrived at my house, he texted me from his car and asked me to come out and at least give him a hug before he left. I'd let him know around 6:20 that I wouldn't be able to go out at all if he'd arrived much later because I work fuck early and can't sacrifice precious sleep to hang out late. Ultimately he pulled out of the driveway and left when I told him I wasn't in the mood and was going to bed instead. He responded by apologizing and saying he was bummed because he had no idea it was my birthday today. He also said ""I tried my best to get there, but the world is inconvenient at times. If I had known the conditions I would have left much earlier.""

tl;dr, friend is always late, put my foot down and cancelled plans when he was late today. Should I have handled the situation differently?",01Dec2017,2

63,"I have lived in my apartment for about 5 months now with my SO. We are both considerate of our neighbors, don't wear shoes in the house (fully carpeted upstairs apartment), never run the washer after 8, keep the TV at 30 or below and all around, just try to be very conscious of people around us.

The day I moved in my downstairs neighbor had her music blasting. It was Saturday so I brushed it off, but immediately freaked out. To keep it brief, she religiously uses bass or surround sound on her TV especially on the weekends and blasts it-it even flows into my side rooms. We put in a complaint to the main office and the sent her a letter. That seemed to ease a bit, but she continues to STOMP everywhere, like excessively. She slams EVERY door, every cabinet, slams her toilet seat down after every use (and we can hear it from any room), and she seems to sprint from room to room heavily whenever she so feels like it. 

One morning she had started blasting her TV SO loud at 9 30 AM, that I had to call the office and send a letter to the super. I went to her first to speak to her and she was a LUNATIC. I wad calm and polite and she was screaming at me. It seemed as if her justification for being a maniac was that she could hear us walking around (on the second floor). We hear her VERY loudly walk around on the first FULLY carpeted floor. So I left the conversation immediately because she was very aggressive and I felt a rush of anger sweep over me. I reported it. The supervisor said nothing can be done without them personally verifying it. 

Today, she has been EXCESSIVELY loud, running around her apartment LOUDLY, vacuuming at 9 30 at night, running her washing machine, jumping around-she is clearly doing it for personal reasons. I refuse to engage. The supers wont do anything unless they come here to hear it and by that time-she may have stopped, especially if she sees them come to the door.

What can I do? I cant study for my grad school classes and I cant get into bed early (I wake up at 4 30 am). I tried to talk to her and she was a nutcase (by the way she seems to be around my age, and I am in my early 30s). I am right now trying to tape her making noise on my phone.

71,"(There's a synopsis at the bottom)

I may have pissed some very shitty people off. For background, I generally go unnoticed in high school, especially where I live. I'm just an seemingly nerdy girl that most people don't look twice at. Many people don't remember my name. However, today, I may have made a mistake. (I'm also a sophomore) Today, in class, I heard the kids sitting in front of me making fun of an Indian girl. They were using a mocking Indian accent, and a boy (we'll call him Boy X) grabbed her face, poking her forehead. ""Where's your red button?"" They said. She looked uncomfortable, and shifted away, telling him to stop. I knew this girl personally, and could see on her face that she was uncomfortable. As the period dragged on, it was obvious that the boys in front of me were not contributing to the group project we were working on at all. I discreetly motioned the girl over and asked her if she was fine. She nodded, but grimaced. I could see she was exasperated and getting teary. She told me what else the two boys had done. They had disrespected another girl by stealing her food, and throwing it in the hallways earlier. Now, I'm no snitch. Normally I would've spoken up then and there, shutting their idiocy down. I was intimated by the look of Boy X. He's the typical popular rich white boy, and I was too nervous to say anything directly. She gave me permission to tell the teacher, since she was scared. I pulled the teacher aside (a sweet, old woman with a heart of gold and an unfortunate penchant for believing that everyone is good). I told her first that they were slackers and assholes, then brought up what the boys had said. I thought she would take the reasonable route. Maybe give them a stern talking to, and give them a zero or something. Instead, she wrote a referral with my name on it, and talked to them privately. Boy Y apologizes halfheartedly to the girl, but Boy X begins to threaten her. ""Did you fucking tell? Was it you? Look at me, you bitch."" She denied it, but kept mum about who it actually was. He gathered the rest of his friends in the class, complaining loudly and saying repeatedly ""If I find out who snitched, I'll fuck them up!"" As the period ended, he found the rest of his friends, and basically started a witchhunt for the snitch. I'm afraid someone who knows what happened will tell him (or one of his minions, for that matter) and I'm going to get jumped or something. He's a violent kid. There are 4 girls that I suspect might tell, and girls talk a lot amongst themselves, so I'm afraid something will get out.

So the day before yesterday she said she was kicking me out on Monday because she wants her baby to have the room I'm sleeping in. So I really don't know what her real reason is... I can't believe she only gave me 6 days... That's not enough time and I don't even know how renting works and idk how to afford it. I never finished high school because it was homeschool and my parents divorce ended that and my dad let me have time off too come back from my family split up. I just don't know anything at all. I just don't know any of this stuff... and I'm expected to be out  on monday I didn't really believe it until today when she told me the other day I thought she was pissed off about something she's done it before. its real though. 

i do have like 2 other places to fall on. my other sister said i could sleep in her laundry room my dad will probably be like yeah you can sleep in my car or something like that. Other than that I have no idea what I'm going to do. I have a job I need to keep which if I go to my other sisters Its close enough although she really doesnt want me there. If I go to my dads I would lose it because he's too far. I'm stuck and don't know what to do and the clock seems to be ticking even faster now that I know I only have until monday....

92,"So, my girlfriend of about 4-6 mos (When we started dating isn't clear because her parents aren't THAT okay with it and they get pissed when she asks them if its ok for us to be dating, but they like me and allow me in her presence on special occasions. We are also 14, but please still take this seriously even though we are supposedly stupid and reckless teenagers.)has had a lot of issues at home with her parents being verbally and physically abusive. Her mom has been threatening her about being sending her to foster care for a long time, but she has been getting very worried recently.

We went through a whole epidemic together right before the time we got 'together'. We got very close from the experience and now I am the first person she tells if something happens at home. I am very worried about her wellbeing and we are both scared that if she is taken somewhere, that we wouldn't be able to see each other for a long time. Her mother once took her to the police station at 2 AM last year to turn her in. It didn't happen and I'm unsure about all the details and I don't want to ask because I know it is a very touchy subject. Also, she has very clear signs of OCD/Anxiety/Depression which even the doctor brought up the last time they were there, but her mother decides to accuse her of making those things up and that she is an attention whore. I talked to my mom about it and she ended up found a way to get my girlfriend (not at the time) to a couple therapy sessions or something. It ended up not being the greatest thing because her mom was in the room the whole time and she was worried that if she talked about it, her mom would get mad and scream at her and make her feel like shit when they got in the car.

Enough backstory, if something ends up happening to her and I knew where she was and she was in a foster care of sorts, would I be able to visit? Also if anyone has any ideas on what I can do to help/suggest to her. I am very lost and I'm trying to help the best I can. I feel like I can do more, just need more advice to make sure what my gut is telling me is correct.
Thanks to everyone who responds, means a lot.",01Dec2017,2

Despite this, my family criticizes my eating habits, the foods that I choose to eat, and the amount of time I spend working out on a daily basis. I brought it up with my mom, and let her know that it hurt my feelings when she said these things, knowing my past. And that I would just hope that she would know better than to commentate on it all when she knows it is very sensitive to me. She told me she thinks I am being oversensitive, then told me I am making her feel like a terrible mom and cried. My question is, Am i being oversensitive? And where do I go from here?

My school also had a Japanese class, which I took and loved immensely. I’m wondering if I should continue my Japanese studies or start completely anew with Korean.

You might be wondering “Why Korean though?” Well my husband is in the military, and there is a small chance we could eventually be stationed there, it wouldn’t be for a while, but it’s still something that sticks in my mind.

96,So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 4 months now but our connection is great. I actually see a future with this girl and wonder if she’s the one. She recently turned 18 and so she went to buy a pack of cigarettes just to “say she could legally” and a few weeks later I noticed one missing. I didn’t think anything of it because I assumed she smoked one just to do it and then was gonna throw them away but now she comes over smelling like smoke and keeps a pack and lighter in her car. I love this girl to death but smoking is gross. I don’t want to choose to spend the rest of my life with someone that isn’t even going to be there for all of it if she continues. I tried telling her it was bad for her and that it could become a habit and that I disapproved but she just brushed me off.

97,"So here is the situation. I'm currently in high school, and I've been really close to, lets call him Paul, for a really long time. Now Paul and I are close, we spend a lot of time together as we do many of the same activities in and outside school. I don't have any classes with Paul, and there are many aspects of his life that I am not involved with. He likes to go out on weekends, while I am an introvert who would rather watch a good TV series. He spends a lot of time with girls, while I am completely socially awkward around people of the opposite gender. Paul and I share almost everything with each other, including very intimate details about both of our lives, and I couldn't wish for a better friend. But at the same time, I feel like I need him a lot more than he needs me. He has plenty of other close friends he has gained over the past years, and I don't really have any close friends outside of him anymore. I recently learned that he turned my notifications off on some forms of social media (he doesnt know that I know this), so he also doesn't respond to me quickly at all, despite spending 90% of his life on his cellphone. We still talk a lot at school and when we are at our extra curriculars, but it seems weird that he would do this. I am probably being incredibly petty, but I fell very weird, as I don't have very many close friends, and he is the only person who knows the intimate details of my life, while I fell like he has many close friends like me. One other thing that bothers me is that he never seems to want to go out with me. I really want to go out with him, to parties or various other events, but he doesnt seem to realize this or doesnt care if he does. To be fair to him though, i used to not want to go out with hime, but I have now told him I want to go out with him, and nothing has changed. I also seem to have to contact him every time I want to talk to him or get together with him to do something, and he never really takes initiative when it comes to me. I'm not really sure what to do, and maybe I just need to get closer with my other friends, but for some reason I've felt like he is the only friends I have who I want to share things about my life with. I have a feeling this is all just me being an insecure teenager, but I am not sure that I am ever going to be able to shake this feeling unless I just point blank ask him if I am his best friend, which I don't think I actually want to know the answer to, and I also don't think that is a fair position to put him in.

98,"apologizes if this is posted in the wrong place, I hardly ever post on here.

I work at a leading electronic retail store, I was hired a few months back for the holidays but was brought on as part-time and not seasonal. The pay is pretty decent. 
 
I fucking hate it.

As of late, I come home and drink while online job hunting for what I actually studied in college (Film/Video Production and Photography).
 
Retail is retail and the customers will almost always suck, that's how it is.

It's the management I really can't handle. Most of the people are ok but the ones I deal with directly the most are some of the snarkiest condescending people I think I've ever met, or at least worked with.

Example: Today I had a customer who was looking for a manager. As a manager was approaching I pointed him out and the customer stopped to talk to him. 

Later, this manager confronted me; ""Did you tell that lady I'm a manager?"" I said that I did. The manager then proceeded to tell me not to ""sandbag"" him like that again. AKA he was on his way to do something and I slowed him down. He could have easily called over another manager who was ""more qualified"" or whatever and gone about his business and had us wait, there was no line.

A lot of the time I feel as though I'm being talked down to and as if they think I'm too stupid to grasp what they're saying or I'm being annoying with my questions; when they say they encourage them. 

A lot of it is petty but that's the kind of thing that really gets under my skin.

While these managers/supervisors might not be saying anything 'wrong' I think a lot can be inferred in 'how' it is said.

Do I quit? After/before the end of the holiday season? Am I being a little bitch? Do I stick it out?

TL;DR - I hate my retail job and ""leadership team"" what do?",01Dec2017,2

101,"Hi guys, I am a married adult man; earlier I went into a bathroom at a public business and there was a 10 or 11 year old kid washing his hands, bent over to reach the faucet.

As I fit by my right wrist area brushed across his butt briefly. I instantly started freaking out and hurried into the stall.

102,"I dated a girl in college almost two years ago, that was the last time I saw her. Here it is now, I walk into my local grocery store and we make eye contact.

Went to college an hour and a half south.
She is from two states over.
My town has the population of about 1200.
I have a current girlfriend of about 1.6 years who is also very suspicious of my ex coincidentally moving to my town.

103,"Long story short, I exploded on my best friend because I felt betrayed by her. If you would like to see the details I made a post in r/confessions and r/depression about her and the situation. I caused her a lot of pain, made her cry and harm herself, and want to take her life. I had no idea that I would cause her that much pain, especially when I said what I did to make her feel that bad, because when I said it I felt like she didn't even care about me. I feel so guilty. She's the closest friend I've ever had yet I caused her this much pain. I feel so terrible.

She's such a sweet person. She's very caring and cute and just the greatest friend I've ever had. I'm so clingy towards her and she's there for me so often. I really feel awful for the pain I caused.

If you don't want to bother looking at my earlier posts, I told her to die in a hole and if she messaged me again I would make her life hell. I know this was awful of me, but she did something that really hurt me and I just exploded. It would take a while to explain so look at my earlier posts in you're that curious. When I eventually decided to talk to her again she told me how hurt she was, and she eventually threatened to kill herself so I messaged her mom to make sure she would be okay. I was hoping doing this would make her understand that I do care about her and I didn't mean what I said. That didn't work at all.

We argue a lot, but usually when we explain both our sides we quickly forgive each other. However what I said this time was just so nasty that she feels scared to try to be my friend again.

I am going to give her space until about mid December, and then I was thinking I would try to have a friend message her. I was going to let my friend explain myself to her, last time we had a fight this bad and he talked to her, she quickly unblocked me and tried to be my friend again.

What I want to know is, should I be trying to fix things? I'm the only friend I think she really ever felt comfortable venting to, and at times she says I'm her only real friend. I want to try to be her friend again, but I'm scared I'll hurt her again because I'll be explosive. Since I've said what I did, I've become less insecure and hateful to myself so I think that will make things better between us, because it won't hurt as much as it used to if she upsets me. We make each other very happy but also hurt so much too. I really really really don't want to let her go. I genuinely care about her so much. Just sometimes she does things that really hurt me.

God I feel like a terrible person. She deserves a better friend than me. I wish she would just know that I care about her, and I wish she would understand my hurt when I said what I did, but also understand I didn't mean it. Fuck, aaagh life is a pain in the ass. I miss her, I want to hug her and cry and say I'm so sorry.

115,"OBVIOUSLY a throwaway. I'm 34 years old, male, gay, but I can't help but find myself attracted to children, male or female. I've had these feelings my entire life, that I can remember. I have not ever, and will not, act on these impulses, primarily because I feel like anyone who does deserves whatever comes to them. For the first time in my life, I saw a psychiatrist today. And I desperately wanted to tell her. But I have read too many stories of those who have done so, then been reported because of reasons. I have done nothing wrong, and have no plans to. And honestly, 34 years on this planet, and I have managed to keep myself from doing anything, including an active prevention from being in a situation where I COULD do something. I will admit, the main thing keeping me from admitting this to her was that it will go on my medical record, where my doctor can see what we spoke about. But I'm feeling scummy and just wanted to see if anyone has any experiences or thoughts.

EDIT: this really blew up. Lots of suggestions that I fully intend to look into, considering I'm unemployed currently so I have plenty of free time. I want to make sure that I am not a danger, but I also want to not go to jail for what basically would amount to a 'thought crime' at this point. I will admit that I have stumbled across links to what I assume are actual child porn sites on various *chan sites, and have reported them and walked away from my computer to decompress. I do honestly and truly feel that I'm not going to act on these impulses, I actively remove myself from situations when I have the opportunity and subsequently feel any urge, but I want to be able to spend time with my nieces and nephews and not wonder if I'm going to impulsively do something truly terrible.

116,"This is gonna require a lot of background so bear with me: I work for my local Parks and Recreation District, and they have wonderful benefits that kick in after working an average of 85 hours per pay period, and at no point dipping below 60 hours, over the course of 6 months (Medical, Dental, Personal and Holiday Leave, etc). Pretty standard and fair right? I was employed back in February and didn't really know about the initial ""85 hour average"" requirement, just that 85 hours was the cut off for receiving the good benefits. I was working 95+ hours a month on top of two other jobs, and then in May I suddenly had only 1 or 2 shifts a week. I figured I'd just supplement by taking extra shifts at my other jobs and didn't think too much of it. In July I ask HR about what I needed to do once I became eligible for benefits. They respond that I won't be eligible in September like I initially thought because I dipped below 60 hours back in May. I was very annoyed that I wasn't informed of that little nugget of info to begin with, but since my hours were fine for June, figured waiting for December wouldn't be too bad. I worked a lot for them over the summer, getting well over a 100 hours a month for July/August/September. I was averaging 95 hours at that point and decided that at the end of September I would take a week off for my first ever international trip, since obviously I could afford less hours, so long as I didn't dip below 60 for that pay period right?

Getting time off was a breeze and I had an amazing trip. Get back and my schedule has me down for around 50 hours for the remaining 3 weeks of the pay period. No problem. I usually end up covering 1 or 2 shifts a week anyway and figured I'd be well over 60 by the end no problem. Unfortunately, October turned out to be slow as hell (all the tourists left). Everyone was getting fewer hours, and I wasn't the only one looking for shifts to cover. Finally about a week before the pay period was done I was still under by and hour and a half and desperate. I sent out a plea explaining why I needed just one more shift and my supervisor came through like a champ. She cut a few hours here or there from those who could afford it and got me 6 more hours that week. I probably checked that I was over 60 hours 9 or 10 times and came to the same number. Yay!

Another thing you should know is that I'm anal about recording when, where, and for how may hours I'm going to work, as a way of juggling the two jobs and so that I always know exactly how many hours I'm getting every week. I did it just as a way to be extra organized and on top of things, writing everything down on a printed schedule with every picked up shift and hours for each job. It's easier to visualize and I never miss a shift because of it. However, once the month was over, I *regretfully* would just toss the old schedules in exchange for the new. I was keeping track of my Parks and Rec hours in a google doc, but I only put down the hours for each month, not individual shifts (because I wanted a place I could check if I was staying on track for receiving benefits). It's no help because it literally just says June: 75 July:105...etc. 

The November pay period ended and was the 6th pay period since June. Today I asked HR again if I was now eligible for benefits and they reported that I had only 58.5 hours for October and that my benefit probabtion had restarted in November. I responded that there had been some kind of mistake because I specifically remembered being over 60 for that period, and they checked their records and said it was still under. 

I am CERTAIN that my math was correct for that pay period, and I worked over 60. But I didn't save any of the notes on my hours because I honestly never thought I'd need them for anything other than being organized. I saw that I was good, gave myself a pat on the back, and threw out my evidence.

119,"So, I quit my fast food job to accept a housekeeping job at a nursing home. My agreed pay before I started was 12/h, which was great compared to what I used to get, but the drive is around 40 minutes to get there. So anyways, I got laid off a month after starting. and so did half of the other staff did as well, due to too many people on the payroll. Come to find out, my checks were shorted a large amount. I did calculations, and my checks were shorted to 67 hours for two weeks, instead of the 75.

After a week of waiting to see if I would be compensated, I text the administrator and ask him to look into it. And he sent me screenshots of my hours, showing they were correct, except my pay was 10/h... this is nearly 130 dollars difference after taxes. I’m now employed, but damn it, I want the money I worked for. He said “I’ll see what I can do.” The fucked up part? It shows on the document I signed that I AGREED to be paid 10/h. I quickly realized that the document was forged, as I am very observant when signing documents.

On one hand, I am terrified to stay here in the house I bought. I feel like I will be doomed to a boring and uninteresting life of routine with no excitement. I have this imminent fear that I am settling down in this city I’ve known my whole life for good and will never experience anything new. I’m afraid that, by not going with her, I am missing out on an adventure. I feel like there are certain things about her I will miss. There’s some deep feeling like I am never going to meet someone like her again.

127,"      To start off, I just want to say that I am absolutely head over heels for my girlfriend. She is everything I have always wanted and so much more. I know it sounds really cheesy, but it is true. There is something that has been really bothering me for a long time and is now beginning to affect our relationship. This problem is that she is still in the closet. 
   My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now. When we first met, she was in the closet and only my immediate family knew I was gay. Since my family is super religious, I never actually told them I was actively dating girls. 
   After we had been dating for a year, we decided to move in together. It was all so exciting and we were so happy. She ended up proposing to me and I have never been so happy in my entire life.  The next thing to do was to tell our families. I had a rough conversation with my parents about how I was engaged to a woman and that we were moving in together. Then, I had some other heartbreaking conversations with my very, very conservative grandparents. All of this was difficult, but I did it for the love of my life and I didn't regret it at all. 
Well, my girlfriends never told her family. Her mom and brother know, but her dad and the rest of her family have no idea.
   I didn't want to push her to come out because I know it is a very emotional process, but after two months we sat down and had a talk. She decided to take back the proposal because she didn't want to tell her family. It was absolutely heartbreaking for me. Even though I was scared to death,I was willing to tell my family about us, but she isn't willing to do the same. 
   It has now been almost a year from then and we are still in the same place. I don't know what to do at this point. Whenever I go to family gatherings with her, I am always her ""friend"". It has gotten to the point where I have to tell her I don't want to go visit her family until they know about us.

131,"TL;DR I left it out for a few days and the thief stole the engine and the transmission and a few other smaller parts. The theft took place on high school grounds and the thief must have trespassed to get to it, but I don't believe the police will investigate much of anything. I thought to search my local craigslist to see if the thief is trying to sell it, but I came up with nothing. Is there anything I can do? The only piece of evidence we have is a lighter that the thief probably dropped on the ground.


Long story: I spent nearly a whole year building a three person go-cart from scratch, made from scrap parts and basic tools. Me and my friends built it and we really love the damn thing and are devastated that it was destroyed so abruptly. We gave it to my old high school baseball team to replace their broken golf cart and to give it a place to stay. We were working on it last I was back from college and left it out behind a shed at the very back of my old high school (it was in the shed before last week, but we didn't have the keys to the shed so we asked the coach to open it so we could work on it, then we left it out there). The thief had to have known that it was there or else has some seriously strong eyes because it was so well hidden that even people with directions had a hard time finding it. It is such a depressing thing because of all the time we spent on it and how much fun we had building it. Now it's ruined. Whoever stole the parts also damaged the functions of the kart by hammering into the axle and bending the sprocket and damaging the brakes.

Here's what I can offer so that your advice can best help me:

- I don't think the police will care too much as the theft involved items with total cost less than $1000 [ but much more valuable than that in our hearts :,( ]

- The thief most likely knew where it was because you could not see it if you weren't looking for it

- Taking off the engine and all the other parts would require a good amount of time and tools, it was pretty hard to get on and off

- The only evidence we have is the thief's lighter, so it was probably not a kid

- Construction workers have the best access to this part of campus because it is right next to where there is an ongoing construction of solar panels (also could explain how the thief knew it was there and how they had the tools for the job)

- The kart was left in a ditch presumably because the thieves wanted to work on it in a larger area, but didn't want to move it to the street for obvious reasons

- The thief took our license plate (it was just there for fun because the thing was almost as big as some cars) with California license number 91317G1

- [Here is the model of the engine that was stolen] (https://www.amazon.com/horizontal-shaft-overhead-valve-engine/dp/b003xbbv24)

- [Here is the torque converter that was stolen] (https://www.amazon.com/Torque-Converter-218353-Clutch-russopower-hee90301944628543/dp/B01M236GWY/ref=sr_1_20?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512107952&amp;sr=1-20&amp;keywords=torque+converter)

- If there were some security cameras in the area, how would we gain access to the footage? Does there need to be an active investigation or could we just ask the high school employees? I don't think there are any but it's worth a shot



I know may not seem too big of a deal to most people, but I'm willing to seriously investigate this because it is such a shitty thing to do, I just want the thief to come to justice or something.

On my mom's side, there are very few issues; however, terms are not the same on my father's side of the situation. He can be quite narcissistic at times, always thinking he is right in every situation.

140,"I just turned 20 years old a few months ago. I flunked out of a private college my freshman year because, well I don’t really know. It started out great, I was going to classes, I was going to track practice, I started making a schedule, etc. But it all became repetitive I guess. Soon, I found myself skipping classes, sleeping irregularly, not eating, and lost ALL motivation. I figured track was the problem because that’s where I spent most of my days. I didn’t even like track in the first place (My father ruined that for me in high school) so I ended up quitting thinking that it would help fix my sleep schedule and gain my motivation to fix my grades. Long story short, it didn’t happen that way. I started talking to a counselor on campus, she told me I was depressed (I’ve always figured I was since I was young but was in denial), but I even stopped going to those appointments. 

My life was miserable there. I am currently on academic probation and am working full time to pay for community college next fall. But now I find myself skipping work and sleeping irregularly again. My depression gets especially worse around the holidays. I know that I have to go to work to keep my job and to make money for schooling and I want to but I just can’t! I don’t know how to explain it! There have been days lately where I would get plenty of sleep and be ready to start working, id get in my car, drive the hour it takes to get there, but just end up staying in the parking lot and sleeping. I just feel down all the time and I’m tired of it. 

I know that if I was doing something I enjoyed I would succeed in it, but this is where I need advice. I’m not passionate about anything and don’t really have any skills anymore (Track and football were my only skills).  The only things I could see myself doing and enjoying would be traveling the world and/or modeling. I don’t want to sound conceited because I’m not, I really hate myself and who I am, but I’m not a bad looking guy. I have no idea how to get into it though. I’m from a smaller Midwest city and male modeling isn’t really mentioned here a lot. 

I would love to travel the world and get paid for it. I’ve lived a very sheltered life and I want to see what is out there. I want to see how other people live. I’m no photographer and know nothing about photography but I think that’d be pretty cool too. I don’t know how to even make that a reality. Instagram models and the such just seem to be lucky or have connections. I know I’m not the only person with these dreams but I feel as if this is the only way I will be truly happy with my life, and it can happen if I just knew who to talk to or where to start. 

If you took the time out of your day to read this, thank you.

I'm planning on asking out one of my best friends tomorrow, assuming everything goes as planned. Now, where I'm from, when you're asking out a friend you don't generally just ask them on 'a date', you really are asking them if they want to he in a  relationship with you. After all, when you already hang out alone together all the time, what does one date really tell you that you don't already know?

So anyway, I have in the past tried to wait until she was leaving to ask her out so there's no awkwardness regardless of her answer, but this is problematic because usually my roommates show up or something before she leaves, not to mention it's hard to just do it in that one moment when there are so many times throughout that I'm feeling more confident. As such, I don't want to wait till the end - I just want to ask when it feels right.

My question is, what happens if I ask in the middle of our hang out and she says yes? Like, of course we will probably plan a date or something, but do we just continue hanging out as if nothing has changed? Do we do that and just hold hands or some shit also? Do I go straight for the arm around her shoulder? Like, what do you do after the fact?

If she says no I'm sure she'll awkwardly leave or we can ignore it and keep doing what we usually do, but I'm not too worried about that.

Honestly I'm not super worried about it as we are close enough that I'm sure she'll laugh any awkwardness off with me not knowing what I'm doing, but I'm curious how others would handle this still so I'm not completely clueless.",01Dec2017,3

I put my foot down at first and said absolutely not, the charge if they catch us is out the roof and I don’t like cats anyways. She took this as me “being mean to her” and claiming that she was “lonely and needed one”.  She promised to pay he fees if we get caught.

Two months ago a stray kitten literally runs up to us on our porch and proceeds to fall asleep on my roommates lap and falls asleep. Drunkly, I say “ if there’s any way you are getting a cat, this is it.” 
The kitten has lived with us since and at first it was great. She took him to the vet, bought him all the necessary stuff he needed, took time to see him everyday, etc. 
Flash forward to now: She has a new boyfriend and between him and school she spends almost no time at home. His litter box does not get cleaned on a daily basis. He is alone in her room most of the day. When she is home and her boyfriend is over she kicks him out and closes her door. Several times me or my other roommate have had to feed him because he is crying at the door. She spends most nights away at his house. 
I have tried to confront her about how we should not have to take care of him because it is HER cat but she makes an excuse and fixes it for a day or so.  I have told her that she needs to spend more time with him and she blows me off. This, to me, seems like abuse.

154,"When I was a child I grew up in a remote town. In 2006 to 2007 I had a teacher that just emotionally bullied me and other students, yet the teachers would just manipulate or lie about incidents basically gaslight children to make them think they're wrong, whatever happened is normal, or you deserved it otherwise tell other people in town how bad you are. I could write a novel on the stuff they inflicted/allowed to happen. They were all in all neglectful, bullying, did things classed as child endangerment, one spat in my drink they made me then told me about it when I was alone, and so on. We were 11 to 12 years old.

The main teacher that did things has now won awards for being a teacher, is a vice principal in another remote town (in another state), and a 'tribal elder'. I did message her about her behaviour in our school and she tried to totally gaslight then dismiss me, and pretend she thought highly of me. Also asking why I didnt say anything sooner. Well for one I was getting my life together and two I told her I've been talking to other students who recall incidents with her too (i didnt tell her but one student developed an eating disorder because of her constantly calling her fat) then she blocked me. The worst part she's also partly illiterate but is somehow a school teacher.

I'm considering trying to get records of more incidents from other past students about that school/teacher. I want to have a case opened or some sort of investigation. I hate when people in some form of power abuse it, I also don't think the teacher especially would suddenly stop. She basically got more power over children.

No matter how much I or anyone else tries, he can't get over it, it's been years now and he says he thinks about it every day, he said he thinks he is a monster, a pedophile, and that he wants to die, when he went to university he purposely chose one in another city just so he wouldn't have to worry about anyone else finding out. 

Right now he has a psychiatrist he sees every week, he's tried hypnotherapy, he's on anti-depressants and today I talked to him on the phone for an hour, he is in pieces, he said he wants to kill himself and I am so worried, he's a good person and he needs to see it, I don't know what to do anymore, I've said everything I can think of, how can I make or help him get over it?",01Dec2017,1

162,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. TLDR at the bottom. 

This all started because of my ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI (primarily inactive, also known as ADD) when I was in 2nd grade. I used to take medication, but it had terrible side effects like making me loose my appetite and forcing me to be really skinny so I stopped. I was doing okay in school. 

However, when junior year came along, my mom started freaking out about how I am going to survive in college. In the beginning of summer vacation, I was referred to an ADHD specialist because I my mom thought that me not doing as well as my friends in school had something was a result of ADHD and that it is only going to get worse when I go off to university. 

When I first met the specialist, I was extremely skeptical of her abilities because she looked like she was 60 years old and (no offense to the older folks here) lost some mental capabilities. Plus I didn't really like her because she was extremely weird, and tried to crack the shittiest jokes all the time. That and the fact that she would not stop talking and COULDN'T EVEN SAY MY NAME properly made me dislike her really fast. 

So I met with her like once a week for 6 or 7 weeks straight. During the first couple of meetings or so, she did the usual IQ tests, metal strength tests, mental weakness tests, speech ability tests, and whatever a normal psychologist does. After that was all over, she started getting into the ADHD specific ones, like attention retention testing. 

Keep in mind that I already didn't like her from the beginning, and the first couple of meets with her didn't really give me any reason to like her anymore. For the last couple of meets, she did some ""personality tests"" which asked random questions trying to gain an insight into my character. 

During these tests, she asked a bunch of yes or no questions, and TOLD ME to answer ONLY with a yes or no. So naturally, I complied, because I wanted to spend as little time with her as possible and didn't want any trouble. She then pointed out that I don't talk much, when she had literally told me to only answer with a yes or no just minutes before. 

One of the questions asked if I usually engage in small talk. I answered no and when she asked why I told her because I thought small talk was boring. I know plenty of people think small talk is boring, and just because you think so doesn't mean you are autistic. 

I would like to point out that I didn't really do much talking on my own while I was with her. This is partially because I didn't like her, but also because I was always extremely tired and exhausted whenever we met. For some reason, she was only available in the afternoon. This happened to be right after 3 hour tennis practice. In the middle of July. In California. Where it was 110 degrees out. From 11-2. 

Anyway, after the meetings were done, she said she wanted to meet with my parents separately, and I assumed it was to discuss my ADHD and any updates, or maybe new excises I can try to help me retain attention for a longer period of time. 

Well, after the meeting, my mom came back with a rather sad look on her face and didn't talk to me for the rest of the day, while my dad came back with an extremely confused and puzzled look, almost like he didn't know if the ""specialist"" was talking about his son. I couldn't get much input from him as he was gone the rest of that day. 

When I asked my mom what she had said about my ADHD, she said that I didn't have ADHD at all, but instead had high functioning autism. This is wack for two reasons. 1) I know I still have ADHD and I know I don't take medication for it. I still find myself getting distracted from things I am not interested in, just as I was in 7th grade. I still find myself with the ability to hyper-focus on stuff that I find myself really interested in. 2) I have absolutely no problem communicating with other people, even if they are complete strangers. I don't have a problem making new friends. In fact, I quite enjoy being out with friends and going out to make new ones. 

When I asked my dad for input later that week, he said he was also extremely confused by what the ""specialist"" said because he knows I've never had any trouble going out and connecting with others and expressing myself. He was extremely surprised to hear that I was supposedly autistic and that my ADHD had supposedly vanished into thin air. 

My dad doesn't think that I have autism, but my mom is a different case. Every time I confront her and try to tell her that I think that ""specialist's"" diagnosis was wrong she tries to be really comforting and say that it's okay to have autism and that I will be able to find ways to work around it. 

Let me remind you that this so called ""specialist"" was an ADHD specialist. Not an autism one. I saw a bunch of ADHD diplomas and certificates on her wall, but I did not see one single autism one. 

I keep telling her that I want to get re-evaluated because not only did she say that my ADHD was gone but she also mid-diagnosed me with autism. I kept trying to point out that she was a freaking ADHD ""specialist"" and had nothing to do with autism but she keeps evading that question some how. 

What do I do?

TL;DR: went to a so called ADHD specialist to re-evaluate and she ends up telling me that ADHD was gone and that I have autism, which are both clearly wrong. Every time I try to tell my mom she won't hear any of it. What do I do?",01Dec2017,2
163,"Me and my friend started applying for jobs together two weeks ago, since we have to do an internship for 4-6 months starting from January.
My work is appreciated just as much as their’s in college and we are ranked at the same place. however, my friend lacks basic presentation skills where I ace ahead of them.
We both applied to a lot of companies and I got called in for more interviews than them, currently I have 1 offer standing in front of me while I’m waiting to hear from the other 2 places I recently went for an interview. I am someone who is also of a very helping nature so initially wherever I applied, I shared it with my friend as well because they needed companies to apply to but the same response from their side was never there and I don’t think it’s even wrong.

Anyways my friend had an interview today at a very good company they didn’t share the name/info with me about and they got the job, though I am very happy for them, I am somewhat jealous because I feel like they didn’t exactly deserve it.. (not that I do or anything) but a part of me suddenly shut down when I received a phone call from them saying “I GOT THE JOB” and I have been feeling very weird and rather stiff since then. I did sincerely congratulate them but a part of me feels sad because I have no certain yes from any places except one which is just a mediocre company and not the best to work in (last minute resort).

I know what I’m feeling right now is sheer jealously but how do I cope with it.. it’s killing me somewhat knowing they got it so easily and that too at a good company. I am unsure about my feelings right now..",01Dec2017,2

167,"Found out on Wednesday, that one of the owners caught my coworker ‘pocketing tips’ (owners words) this past Friday.  This coworker I work most, if not all, of my shifts with each week. Here’s the kicker - said coworker wasn’t fired. I find this extremely problematic - we pool/split tips behind the bar.

I have voiced concern about working with said person and how I felt uncomfortable- for the business as well as myself because who knows how long this has been going on or to what extend - ie. not putting drinks in system and pocketing that as well. The owners expressed their remedy - moving coworker off bar shifts to serving tables - but I feel like because it was tips, and not money directly from the cash register, the owners aren’t viewing this as stealing - which it is, just from me, not them. I had to work with this coworker tonight and the night was awful for me. Constantly on edge and worried. Have a shift again Saturday with this person. The owners solution is to count and split our tips for us at the end of the night - which to me is crazy! Not a solution and not in any way, shape, or form your money - and I told owners, if someone is going to steal tips, they will do it off the bar if they know they can’t skim off the top anymore at the end of the night- the response I got was ‘at least I’m making it more difficult.’ I’m angry. I want my coworker fired but since the owners clearly view this person as essential to their business, I feel like I should quit because I’m not sure how I’m supposed to get past this. But then I remember I have bills to pay  and no trust fund to fall back on because, I mean, I clean up dirty napkins for a living.

Any input anyone has - thoughts/suggestions - I would appreciate. Last night was a struggle and I’m too inside my own head about this (I consider this a personal attack, stealing my money) and I feel like I can’t think straight.",01Dec2017,21

171,"I was waiting for the bus a couple of hours ago, when this absolutely gorgeous young girl (looked around 20yrs old) strolled up and started waiting for the bus too. So being a guy myself, I had a couple of glances at her since she was really pretty (who wouldn't?) and found myself becoming a little attracted to her.

As the bus arrived, I let her go on first - like I do with every woman (just being polite), and overheard her buy a ticket to the same place I lived. What made me smile a little and think ""Awh, she's adorable"" was how shy and unsure she was about using the bus service (nearly forgetting her ticket and such) - clearly she doesn't use the buses often.

Nearly the whole bus journey was normal - so I'll skip the details on that, but when arriving in the town we'd both be getting off at - I didn't see her getting ready to get off the bus, so I looked over and saw her fast asleep. Now, I know how much it sucks when you miss your stop, so I can't imagine how it must be for her considering she's quite shy and unexperienced with buses - so I decided to wake her up and let her know she's going to miss her stop (hoping that was the polite thing to do). 

She looked at me and gasps, grabs her stuff and quickly runs off the bus.

So, was this the right thing to do? I don't know if I seemed a little creepy, frightened her or anything similar. But being slightly attracted to her, and knowing that she's going to miss her stop otherwise, it seemed the right thing to do.

TL;DR - woke up a girl on the bus - so she didn't miss her stop, and I'm worried I creeped her out.

173,"Hey fellow redditors.

I've always wanted to start my own company and actually do something to leave behind something even after I'm gone. Over the course of the last 17 years, I've always been in this dilemma - I no longer find much value in schooling and I can't see what else I might be able to learn from another 4 years in college - the thought of coming out of college like just another product of a factory just depresses me. 

I have several ideas, but two of them are actually viable - however that's where my problem begins :/

Both of them solve important social issues that exist in countries worldwide today. However, they're more of solutions to social issues and monetizing them will be extremely difficult, if even possible. I haven't run the numbers, but I can't see a way to profit off this (it's basically a platform for users, and my profit margins would be transaction fees.)

The idea of doing this appeals to me - but as I just said - the idea of living off donations and out of homeless shelters until my idea hits widespread adoption (if at all) is extremely difficult to stomach. I'm still in my last year of school, but I already consult for a firm and I could easily see myself making very good money getting a secure job in the future.

So I guess the real question I have is - what would be the best thing to do? Should I just take the risk? Or go to college and run the risk that someone else might start this business while I'm still in college?

Thanks for any advice :}",01Dec2017,2

Recently just came out of a break up. We broke up, it hit me really hard and I had anxiety attacks, started hearing voices and depression and everything. Me and her sort of got back together a bit later but it's definitely over now. I learnt from my mistakes and I'm not letting myself get back into that horrible stage again.

At the moment, we are having some family trouble and so I am helping my parents out by running a convenience store for them. Because of this, I work here 9am - 9pm. During the day you get times where it's busy in the shop and times where it's dead and I've come up with three major things I want to do to incorporate into my life to a) move me out of this situation and b) keep my mind occupied lol. They are:

1) Write my book: I have a good book idea, want to write it now.
2) Develop my app: Have a good app idea and am planning it but want to take it further and actually start making it.
3) Invest in crypto currencies: I used to be active on the stock market and I want to now learn and shift towards cryptos.

My problem is that in between shop life and having three pretty full time idea's, I don't know the best way to manage and organize myself in being able to make the most of all three ideas.

Any ideas on how I can go about doing this?

My day is roughly:

Get to the shop for 9am. Up until around 11am, I am busy re-stocking, dealing with in store sellers and morning customers. The shop then quietens down until around 2ish when the lunch time rush happens with maybe some afternoon sellers. The from 4-6 it can get busy with school kids and after work people coming in. Then up until 9 oclock is hit or miss. With either last minute customers or alcoholics coming in or noone, but from around 7 is when I start my cleaning etc. In between all this, I am either doing nothing or restocking.

I try to lock up and leave at 9 on the dot so by the time I get home, eat dinner, count my money and prepare things for the next day, it is usually 10.30pm. 12 hour shifts, 7 days a week makes me feel lazy and cba doing anything lol apart from getting in bed.

182,"Okay for the last 3 years I have been suffering from some sort of unknown illness that's pretty much makes it damn near impossible for me to think straight and more then half the time I feel so absent minded almost like I'm just entirely blank and this feeling is killing me because in the past I was always thinking of shit but now I feel like thoughtless and pretty stupid honestly.

I have been diagnosed with eustachian tube disfunction, enlarged adenoids, and tinnitus. Pretty much like 3 different ear disorders. I in the past have had issues focusing on certain things conversations being one of them but I have always had a really good memory and have felt intelligent but I feel like if lost that one thing I value the most.

I'll add more past history so you guys have a somewhat clearer picture of what's going on. It all started when I was 18 years old and I'm 21 now. I worked on phones a while then and I remember working on I phone prying on a small metal piece held by strong adhesive which ultimately got loosened and actually flew into my eye and left an cornea abrasion.

I thought at the time that maybe that had something to do with how I feel today because all of my memory issues were followed up after. Doctors on the other hand think otherwise they have performed 2 CT Scans, an MRI Scan, hell even EEG Scan all coming back completely normal. I don't know if my problems were coincidental because I have some pretty bad sinus problems.

I also have this pressurized feeling above my right eye, temple of head that had been there since that shit scratched my eye. I have no idea what it is but I also have a bunch of issues with my right ear. Pressure in my head builds up and there's this popping noise I hear before the pressure subsides which is likely a result of the eustachian tube disfunction. 

Really I'm just stuck I have no idea what to do my insurance sucks and it takes me a very long time to go in and see the right specialist. I don't even know what test I should get done at this point to be honest. My pcp told me to see a psychiatrist because I might have add but the thing is as stated before my memory prior to this was pretty good. I don't know what to do but all I can say is this is ruining my quality of life in every way. I've gotten worse at everything down to socializing, reading, writing, and just common task. For instance forgetting common phrases, words, and other pieces of information that I would ordinarily know instantaneously.

The only thing I really want more than anything is to get is to get back what was stolen from me and that's my memory and my ability to think. Some of you might think this post seems nutty but let me tell you it's been a long hellish road that hasn't progressed really at all for me.  This illness is stealing everything from me such as ability to converse with people. Not to mention college which is pointless if you don't retain what you've learned. Having any meaningful relationship with anyone and the list goes on.

191,"I've been best friends with a Lesbian for over 2 years, problem is; she’s gorgeous and I find her attractive There's always been this strangely functioning equilibrium between us. We are on the same frequency, finish each others sentences and can basically communicate without having to express ourselves. We talk to each other about basically anything, and we resolve any problems we get pretty much immediately. I can have incredibly stimulating intellectual conversations with her. We see each other often and this electrical connection we have .. its so much fun!

Dancing is even more telepathic, its like we can predict each others movements. We're both solid dancers and it’s hot, when go out we often use it to wingman for each other.

The only problem is; I am incredibly attracted to her. She's the hottest woman i've ever gotten close with. She has this sassy teasing disposition about her, her whole being just radiates sex. I’ve never been in love with her, but there are these periods when I feel like I might be developing feelings for her. This leads to some complications. Being as close as we are, we often sleep in the same room and don't shy away from walking around half naked around each other. We sometimes cuddle and i've played with her breasts. For her, she just likes the action. I get turned on by it. She does notice so she said she doesn't want to go further and give me any wrong ideas.

Making things worse, she's very sexually open and doesn't mind making out with men when she's out and no interested girls are around. She basically gets free pickings. According to her its simply about having something to do. She did say some months ago that she gets incredibly turned on by strong black men, she almost slept with one over the summer. She often talks about wanting to be dominated by them. She has never fallen in love with men before, but the fact that she has this raw sexual attraction to some of them makes me feel jealous. In some weirdly Freudian way, I get turned on by it. I often fantasise about her having sex with men. I think it is my subconscious telling me I could be with her.

These thoughts have not stopped me from being intimate with other women, but I wish I could get rid of these feelings of jealousy so I can fully enjoy our unique friendship to the fullest. I have started to get worried that we might be slipping apart because of the underlying tension. Basically, I have found a golden friendship but I feel like my sexual attraction to her is causing complications. What do I do?",01Dec2017,2

195,"Hi, everyone. Before you say anything, yes, I've been to see the vet a few times and the diagnosis is clear. He has a soft jaw, so his teeth are sliding back into it, breaking it and getting him unable to eat. Our vet recommended giving him vitamin B and trying some soft food. Well, what kind of soft food though? I've tried giving him apples, wet oats, wet rabbit food and he won't eat it.

197,"My fear is that I don't know what to focus on in my life. 
I feel as though I have great potential if I focused, and didn't take serious consideration
of other tasks. For instance, I could focus on guitar, and play in a band. I could focus on 
drawing and if I keep my nose to the grindstone, I'll see improvement, and maybe I'll even
be able to work on a project like that. There's even a bunch of other ideas like electronically
producing music, or being really great at one fighting game or shooter. 

All the while I have a day job which seems to only give me enough time to give two or three hours
to one or two of these practices at most. If I'm even able to get myself to attend to one skill
at the end of the day, and not just browse the web or play a non-competetive game, or read a book
even, then it's even harder to do it again. 

Ideally, I'd like to become proficient in multiple if not all of these things, as I find worth
and joy in all of them. However, I feel that I simply don't have the time to become deeply proficient
in them. 

On top of all this, my social/dating life isn't exactly booming. I feel that being in my mid 20s, I'm
feeling as if I'm past some threshold that makes attaining my ideal method of life impossible if not
unnecessarily cruel to myself, as I may benefit more of attempting to fix my social/dating life rather
than chase multiple pipe dreams.

198,"A week ago, I matched with a girl on tinder and we seemed to click pretty well. After some talking, I get her Snapchat from her and we move to talking there. This SC account is definitely hers, and I don't doubt that she is who she says she is (she gave me her full name and I did a Facebook search; same name, age, location, etc.), so I'm not worried about anything in that regard.

But the day before our scheduled date at a restaurant, she asks if we could move the location of the date to a ""more intimate"" place she knows, and that she wants it to be a surprise. She also said that she'd want me to just pull up to her house and let her know I'm there instead of coming to the door, because her family can be too nosey sometimes.

Now again, I never doubted that she was who she says she is. We've texted everyday since swiping and nothing about anything she has said has ever appeared sketchy, and I like to think that my B.S. detector is pretty on point.

But I am new to tinder, so I'd just like to know if anything about this throws up any red flags for anyone or if I'm just over thinking.

204,"One of my friends of 8 years has recently stopped talking to me. Nothing happened, no fight, nothing. Only 4 months ago we were overseas together. We had some minor disagreements and bickering over there but we always resolved things and were fine not long afterward. Bear in mind it was a long trip, so tensions were bound to escalate toward the end. On the plane back to our native country, we even discussed that despite any disagreements we had, we worked well together overseas and we wanted to do it again another year in the future. For about a month post trip, things were as usual. This is why I just don’t understand why she isn’t speaking to me anymore. It’s now been two whole months since we last spoke. She has tagged me into some memes on Facebook and what not but I see this as a pretty poor excuse for communication. I’ll be honest, I haven’t really tried talking to her, but it makes me so upset that she hasn’t tried talking to me at all. I have always felt I was always the one initiating conversation and hang outs. I feel like so much damage and betrayal has been done without anything happening at all. Now I feel like I’m left with the question of, do I sever my ties with her completely, or try to make amends? I’m reluctant to do the latter, because it’ll just be another instance of me being the only one maintaining the friendship. Frankly, I highly doubt she is affected by/has even noticed that it has been long since we last spoke. We were such good friends, what should I do?

209,"Sorry in advance if this is a little long winded… This morning I received a text from the owner of the company I used to work for (at like 5:30 in the morning). She let me know she had a position open that she wanted to discuss and to call her when I had some time.

A little background to set up the call: I worked for tech start up that has been in operation for about 10ish years. When I was there, the job was extremely demanding and I found myself being the “Johnny-on-the-Spot” of the office typically working around 55-60 hours a week. My boss, the owner, was hot and cold. Some days I felt like I was about to be fired for little to nothing while other days I was her star employee. I will also note, it payed fairly well (70K a year with full benefits, 401k matching with no limit, and bonuses as my boss saw fit which was pretty frequently).

Ultimately, I left as I was constantly stressed by the workload, the hot and cold nature of my boss, and I felt the long work hours took A LOT of time away from my family. I was offered a position with a hospital in an area that I had wanted to move to for some time. It was somewhat of a step down monetarily as well as the workload.

I love my job now… It’s really about 40 hours’ worth of work in the month so I have A LOT of down time and the people I work with are awesome. The bad about it: I make less and as a result we are always stressed over money. I should also note that shortly after I was brought on, some policies changed and as a result I haven’t see a raise or any of the bonuses I was promised when I started.

So back to the call from my old boss: She explains that the current team I was a part of is “drowning” and desperately needs help. The team is going to be reorganized where there will be a group handling account  management, an individual who will be handling the top 10 clients, and the new position. The new position would be training new clients to use the software as they come on (traveling all over the US to meet and train), working with new clients for a few month period, handing them over to account management when the training period is complete, and finally overseeing the department as whole.

The offer of this position came with the following:

A minimum 2 year commitment from the company (I would be paid for 2 years regardless of performance or if the company was bought out, I would be paid for the 2 years no matter the course of action by whomever purchases my company). 

Full benefits starting day one that include a 401k with the company matching what I put in, also without limit as to how much they would match.

It would be a work from home position to start. If I committed, the company would be opening an office in the area that I am at to get me a secretary and to also house a handful of tech-support positions (password resets, low level troubleshooting, etc.). I would have to travel as needed to see clients and most likely travel around 100 miles a few times a month to the home office.

Lastly and probably most importantly, it would pay around 120K (about twice what I make now) as the base salary. I would receive bonuses as before and have an option to receive commission on any sales that I assist in (5% for the length of the contract).

I thanked her for such a generous offer and let her know that I would need to think it through before making a commitment as this decision would affect my family, etc. So now I feel I’d be an idiot to pass this up but it would be way more stress, way more work, and I’d be back to an environment that I couldn’t wait to get out of before. I don’t think I turn this down as the money would be great for my family, and the commitment would ensure that we would be able to hold a certain standard of living until my wife finishes with school (full time nursing student). What do you guys think? 

Am I an idiot for not accepting right away? 

Do I just suck it up and go back to it for the next few years? The worse thing that happens would be to endure any hardship until the wife is out of school and working, allowing me to then leave and find something different.

Does absence make the heart grow fonder? 

I’m just unsure the all of the pros here fully outweigh the cons of going back… I need some advice.

214,"I started at my current job in customer service about a year ago. This is my first non-restaurant job out of college, and while it's not exactly what I want to do long-term, I love the company and have generally enjoyed my time here. 

Some background: the company is a startup that has experienced tremendous growth since I started. When I joined, there were maybe 20 people working for the company. Now I would say there are about 50, and this is after a lot of turnover. When my two supervisors were asked to leave when their jobs became obsolete (some foreshadowing for ya), I was promoted along with another member of my team to take their positions, we'll call him Adam. Adam and I effectively ran our team for about 7 months. The two of us moved away from speaking directly with customers and focused on administrative tasks, passion projects, and boosting team morale. 

As the company grew quickly, we realized that we needed a bit more leadership and guidance to build the team to be what it needed to be. Our interim manager was busy with her day-to-day responsibilities outside of the customer service department, so Adam and I set out to hire a permanent manager. We got approval, set up a plan with the higher-ups, and about a month ago, Gina was hired.

Things were great in the beginning. Gina carved out time in her schedule to meet with Adam and me to talk about the history of the team, current practices, and the vision that the two of us had for the customer service department. We talked about our goals and she assured us that she would allocate the time and resources necessary to help us reach them. 

Things turned drastically a few weeks ago. Gina started to withhold important information from Adam and myself. He and I began to feel as though we were floating through our days with meaningless work and too much time on our hands. Yesterday, in a 1-on-1 meeting with Gina, she broke the news that the structure of the team will be changing in January.

Essentially, she gave me two options. I can either continue at the same pay rate but go back to doing the work that I was originally hired to do (answering emails and phone calls) OR she would help me ""find something else externally."" I took this as her gently letting me know that it's my time to move on from the company.

Talking to customers all day is extremely emotionally draining for me. Not to mention that at this point, I haven't spoken to a customer on the phone in over 5 months, and the emails I answer are of the basic, pre-written response variety. I am out of touch with many of our newer policies, and feel that I have graduated out of customer-facing interactions. I don't mean to sound entitled, but I've been dealing with much higher-level situations for months now and would need to be re-trained on the base level tasks that are about to be put on my plate.

I realize that this is typical startup bullshit, but I can't help but feel like I've been slapped in the face. Returning to the position I originally had feels demeaning and unreasonable. I would happily continue with my current position and act as an assistant to Gina, but she's looking to hire an assistant from outside the company--someone who is heavily invested in a customer service career path who has extensive experience. 

And to top it all off, I have some pretty inflexible plans for 2018 that are throwing a wrench in the works. I planned a 2-week (paid) vacation in January, and I'm moving to another city next summer. I'm already stressing about finding housing and a job in my new city, so the thought of applying to places now is daunting. 

So I'm wondering what my next move should be. My current job is flexible, pays well, and offers great benefits. However, after this experience, I feel as though I could be asked to leave/fired at random in the future. I am also dreading the work that I'm about to be tasked with.

Should I start applying and withhold the fact that I'm moving in 8-9 months from potential employers? Or should I stick it out and risk being generally unhappy for the time being so that I can have a stable income--at least, until they decide that my time is up?

Fast forward a couple hours where I teased her by saying “oh I didn’t realise you had a cute butt chin.” 
From here on she was pretty standoffish and I could tell it affected her (still kinda baffled me though as to why), a short while later we ended up walking home and as I went to leave I could see that she was crying. She said that what I said was basically uncalled for and super rude. She kept crying and asked me to leave, and I did once her friend asked me.

220,"Hello there people of the Reddit! My wife and I are deciding where to live and while we do some independent research of our own, I thought I might reach out to the Reddit community and see what other information and opinions I can get. I suspect this will get long winded because there is a lot to consider, so check the bottom for TL;DR...

I was born in NJ and lived there all my life....until about 2 years ago when I moved to Chicago to live with my (now) wife. We met through a random chance match on Tinder while I was on a layover in O'Hare. My wife grew up in the west 'burbs of Chicago and was close enough to the airport to match. Yada yada yada, match made in heaven, I move, we get married. Woot!

Being from the east coast, there is a lot to explore out here in the midwest. My wife's brother lives in Michigan north of Detroit and works in the automotive industry. This is important because my wife and I are both gear heads. This is exemplified by the fact that we matched on Tinder because I saw her '13 Challenger R/T on her profile. In any case, we have spent many weekends out in Michigan doing all sorts of fun things from breweries, wineries, camping, off roading, boating, etc. Over the last two years I have found much love for Michigan. And given that the majority of automotive manufacturors are located in the suburbs of Detroit, the wife and I planned to move out that way after the wedding. I could find a software engineering positions with either one of the big three, or a supplier, or really anyone in that space. Things are generally cheaper out there, taxes are lower, etc. Additionally, we would be near her brother and his wife and the idea of our kids growing up together was a real big plus. 

So about a year ago we decide that our plan is to move out to Michigan after our wedding. We got married in July and as things settled down we started to consider this more seriously. We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment with our dog. We have a combined 6 cars between my wife and I. Most of them run....most of the time. We have two detached garages (thanksfully). One of which houses the '13 Challenger and the other is my workshop. Whatever car needs fixing or modifying ends up in that garage. The rest sit in the parking lot. Our original plan was to just buy a house, but then we decided we should rent for a year because we will have to orchestrate moving across 2 state lines (with 6 cars), finding, buying, and closing on a house on top of finding TWO jobs, getting settled, etc. The list goes on, but obviously there is much to do. And let's say we line everything up and something goes wrong with the closing on the house....well then what? Again, we decided to rent for a year, then start looking to buy once we get settled and have jobs. Our current lease is up in February, so we decided not to renew our lease here in the west Chicago burbs and plan to move out East.

Then, two days ago I have something akin to panic attacks and start wondering if this is the right move. Why did this come on so suddenly? I have no idea. I was all about the move since we made the decision and didn't think twice about it. But I guess I started reconsidering and wondering if we should just stay in Chicago. I think part of the issue for me was that I have been looking for jobs in the Detroit metro area for a few weeks now and nothing has really come up. Every so often I get a call from a recruiter, but it's not really what I'm looking for. I suppose I got spoiled when I moved to Chicago and I get pitched a new job almost every day...even when I'm not looking. The job market out here is just absurd for software developers. So I start to wonder if I'll even find a job, and if I do, will it be the job I want? This leads to a spiraling chain of thinking and rethinking and several sleepless nights. Our timeline is drawing short and we have to give our apartment complex notice of leaving in like 2 weeks if we decide we are moving.

So with all of this, the wife and I have been talking about what to do. Being the logical creatures we are, we decided to do some research this weekend to figure out what is best for our future. We are trying to look at things like prices of houses, taxes, salaries, jobs, school systems (we want to start having kids soon), crime, etc. While we start looking at the facts, I wanted to hear some input from the community. Perhaps you will think if something we haven't. So, reddit....what do we do?

TL;DR - Moved from NJ to Chicago 2 years ago to live with my (now) wife. Originally decided to move to Detroit metro area after the wedding, but now we are having second thoughts. Which suburb is better to live in to start a family? Chicago or Detroit?

My dilemma is whether or not to work an internship during the spring semester or to turn it down and keep focusing on school only.  A little background, I am majoring in Human Resource Management and I have already worked two HR internships while in school.  When I work during school, my grades slip.  I have less time to do stuff and it feels as if my time is always spent worrying about everything.  When I don't work, my grades do well.  I have more time to spend with my friends and girlfriend and I have way more time to actually focus on my studies, rather than mindlessly rushing through assignments, exam prep, etc. and not really learning the material in the way I'd like.  This particular internship is with a leading technology company and they want me to work 24-30 hours a week.  This semester I will be taking 15 credit hours and it all just makes me nervous.  Money is not something I have to worry about at this time, fortunately.  I live at home and am blessed with wonderful parents who take care of me.

238,"Hey guys. So this is long. Sorry about that. 

On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, my wife has agreed that her friend can come drop her 10 month old and 2 year old off at my house. The first couple weeks we watched the girls, no problem. Then things started getting messed up. 

For example: Our friend would tell us that she would have the girls over by 9 or 930, and then either show up late at 1015 like she did today, or not at all. There was even one time when her sister showed up at like 230 because dropping them off had ""slipped her mind"" or whatever. 

This woman's better half left her in a pretty bad situation. I get that. It sucks. She has a job and nobody to go to. We're watching these girls so she can go earn a paycheck. 

My issue here is, that she and I aren't really even acquaintances. We don't speak on a regular basis. I don't feel comfortable around these girls. At all. Plus it's two extra kids to try and chase after, and I already have three.  

What do I do? Suck it up and deal with it? My wife told me that the help is always appreciated and she would have been totally screwed if she hadn't had the help that she did when we first started seeing each other. 

I get her friend needs help. But she's never communicative, never punctual. I would be more willing to help if she was, but I don't know how to go about it other than saying, ""If you can't be here when you say you're going to, then I can't watch your kids anymore.""

I left that job, and I'm working with my roommate now, its a call center like job. This is only my first week there and I'm already doing great. I'm very confident in myself to quickly pick up and learn new things. But I can tell that I don't like this line of work at all.

I am very optimistic but the slightest bit of sadness brings me down. I do not want to feel sad or anxious around him. he always tells me to ""open up"" and ""you can tell me anything"" but I feel so guilty bringing all of my moop on to him. It is simply not fair.

254,"So, i'm not even sure how to start, but the thing is that i've been severely 'down' for the past 4 years, using pot everyday all day, isolated in my room, being supported by mom and really wanting to do nothing but anarchy.

I have been destroying myself, socially, physically and mentally, at some point i just had this desire to die.

I believe the World is an evil place, filled with conspirators every next corner, i must be extremely carefull about them or else i might get fucked, decepted, dead or god knows...

My mindset goes like...

Everybody is a liar.

Girls these days aren't worth it.

Studying and college aren't worth it

Relatives are the worst 

Those are some things my mother keeps repeating and repeating, for every girlfriend there's a reason it's not happening, for everyone there's a name, for every event there's a conspiracy beneath...

Being a man while also happy and satisfied with life is 'homosexual' (guys, i'm not even joking... She also said depression is homo when i mentioned i might be suffering from it)

So, i think all the shit i've done might not be 100% my fault, of course, it was me who did all of that, and i'm not trying to adopt the 'it's somebody else's fault' mindset here -- In fact, because i just realized i might be that person - I want to make sure, i want to change, i don't want to be a fucking negative depressed scared little mouse who runs away instead of dealing with things and people.

But, before we get to my fuck ups, please, help me understand if i have a crazy mother... So that i can plot my plan to get away..

When i was twelwe something happened, i'm not sure if it was a fight among the family, me getting to teenage and being exposed to the harsh brazilian enviroment, my dad being an alcohoolic and all while also simply not giving the smallest fuck to their children (We found out about a child he abandonded after 15 years) made (perhaps) me vulnerable to it, maybe it was due to some other reason - But - we moved to Japan, and once we got there they put me in this japanese school.

I knew how to say good morning, thanks, and perhaps i'm sorry, in japanese language. Yeah.

So, my moving around begins...

One year japanese school, moved to another city, begun work ilegally at this japanese factory at the age of 14 -- My mom was proud because then i could have my shit -- Begun getting overwhelmed by work and decided to go back to school. My mom consented.

This time it was a brazilian school, and god, it was amazing, i can say that this was the one and only happy time in my life i can remember, it lasted one year.

For some reason, i went back by myself to Brazil while my parents stood in Japan, i decided i wanted to study computer science and i'm just not sure why exactly i made that decision. 

So, back to Brazil, public school, at first i felt extreme anxiety, i remember some guys tried to beat the shit out of me in the first year, i didn't know why, i think it was because i would face them and apparently it wasn't something you were supposed to do in Brazil. 

I was so scared and i was just fucking froze the whole time. 

I couldn't tell people, i couldn't tell my mother because i knew the reaction would be worse than the situation. I eventually learned how to keep things to myself and to hide my problems, since everything was treated with hostility and anger.

So, instead of telling her the actual shit, i just said i wanted to go to a better school so that i could be better prepared for college later on. 

She agreed.

Anyways, to give some examples of this fear of mine about talking things off, back when i was working in this factory, at some point i lost appetite and i remember she looking at my packed lunch which she prepared and angrily saying "" The whole food is in here, if you're not eating i'm not wasting my time cooking and you just buy whatever the fuck you want to eat"". 

The problem was never the food but my appetite. I never realized that, in my head i was just picky for food.

Ok, at some point this dude came out of nowhere wanting to include me (So far was the loner), and we became friends almost co-dependent level kind of shit. He introduced me to this girl with the intention of us dating and i just went with it -- I was 15 and had nothing to lose then. 

So, new school, new friend, girlfriend, new life. 

I was back - finally motivated, playing games, doing excercise, thinking good of the future, reading several books and even after 2-3 years lost due to japanese school/factory work, i could still do decent and keep up with everyone else. 

Anyways, about to graduate 3rd year, happy af with all of it, wanting to college and shit, but then, here was the thing, the girl in question was daughter of this medic guy, who was relatively rich, and my mom said i'd better break up with the girl because she was too rich and they wouldn't feel comfortable with it.

So, yeah, this year was the year i begun doing pot and smoking cigarretes, later i tried cheating the history test and got caught.

Left school.

Begun working another factory and found this other girl who i dated for a few months after getting married.

My mom hated her, she was a whore and i'd be cucked, she only wanted me as a passport to Japan. 

She helped me with cash to the marriage, we broke up and went back together several times until finally going to live together. 

It didn't suck, it wasn't a breeze because we were both poor and had to work and manage shit by ourselves by the first time, but after a while i had this job and we were living quite decently. 

Now, pay attention to it, we broke up, because ME didn't felt like commiting to a long-life thing. It wasn't because the girl sucked, nor because she was a bitch nor nothing. I just felt that there was more to life and went with it.

Once we broke, i just left the house we were renting, left behind all the stuff to her, and kept liking her as always, except that i just didn't want the thing, know what i'm saying? I'm 22 right now.

I went my way, walked around some streets to find a place, migrated from friend's house to friend's house and in my head i was right about that - I left mom's, i went to live by myself with a girl, not i broke with her, i go my way, right ? Isn't that the ethical, moral shit to do ?

I believe it is.

Except that my mother was desperately trying to contact me, going nuts on worry and thinking all sorts of shit. She found me, asking me to go back home, offered me the car to drive, offered me everything -- Lemme remember you guys that i was two-fucking-two years old.... 

So, she paid for a place to myself, gave me the car to use, gave me all shit i needed for my house.

Now, after a while i decide to go to Japan on my own, i just feel it's time for a lonely journey. 

Yeah, except that the moment my mom knows, she begins preparing to move there with my father aswell.

We go, they go first (because my father is 2nd generation, he will always get his visa quiclky).

And after a while there i reach. 

K, i was happy, i was nice, i didn't want to talk to any of them even tho we were there all three of us. 

After a while, once she realizes there's this girl i'm on to (via facebook), she calls me out of the blue with the following say:

""Oh i decided to call you so you wouldn't feel abandonded""

I remember she existed due to the fucking call btw.

She said she'd come visit after a while.

The day she came, the only sentences that stood with me:

""By the way you dress you'll never get that girl you're into""

""You place is a fucking mess, lemme give it a clean up"".

And that's it.

Ok, after a while, talking to the girl and all, she was actually very very into me aswell, but i begun getting depressed at this point - I begun not trusting her, doubting that maybe she was just playing with me -- I was already fucked up in the head at this point.

I moved back to my mom's after a while, but then it's when the dark phase begins - I didn't want nothing to do with anything anymore - I just wanted to play music, games and fuck it. 

I was angry. 

And then after a few more jobs/places, i just went back to Brazil, begun doing pot, my mom would send me a few bucks every month, and believe me or not -- It is the ONLY MOTHERFUCKING TIME i felt like my mom would not trigger something on me. It was the one time i was in peace.

After she came back, and we begun living together, me being the big fucking potatoe loser and she supporting my pot addiction while doing everything else (Cleaning room, laundry, etc, etc, etc...) Things was just kind of fine. 

And then, about 80% of her sentences (maybe even more like 85, 90%) begin with ""Will you want this ??"" OR ""You're not gonna want this right""?

The reason i'm meantioning it it's because it is worth mentioning, everything she comes to say to me begins with ""Would you want something?"", or ""Your not gonna want.. &lt;whatever&gt;""?? 

It's always about trivial things, like a food, a pair of socks cleaned, a grossery, it's weird.

It is absolutely insane, and i don't know anymore what is normal and what is not.

Last year i begun doing theatre, and everytime i went out travelling it was like ""Oh god with who? What time you're back? I worry so fucking much"".

But, if i waste my life inside my room doing absolutely nothing - Then she is totally fine with it.

Not a single time, and i swear to jesus fucking chirst, she came to me and said ""GO do something with your life"", unless it was something very specific she wanted me to (chore or whatever).

Sometimes i have the feeling that all she wants is a guy in the house -- Fuck that your son is a person, who cares that he has a penis and desire to meet and date women ? Who is actually giving any sorts of fucks that he actually wants a life ?

It feels like something unconcious, i don't know my people.

I need advice.

If you made it so far. If you have a say on this, please, do not hurry.

I TA a first year comp sci course where I just supervise a room where students can work on their assignments the professor has designed and ask for help if they need it. 

I ended up sticking around like 30 minutes extra after the last class to help this one girl, but not before some friendly teasing (she teased back so it was pretty cool). Off the clock, unpaid, so thought I would have some fun while im at it.  During our convo I had mentioned I wish the prof made the assignment due earlier because I have to mark it and study for my exams coming up too. She says she thought they were auto marked and I'm like they are, but a few other TA's manually take a look incase people try to game the system, and she laughed saying people did game the system. Anyway I helped her and filled in the gaps  in her understanding, and she personally thanked me and left ~30 mins after the allocated time.

Anyway the day after and now I'm curious about how  people were gaming the ""system"". As a Lab TA, I don't have access to any of the students' email lists or anything as I'm just around to answer questions.

That class was also the last class and my duties are pretty much over, and I only know her name, would it be awkward if I looked her up on social media and ask her how ppl were gaming the system? Pretty sure she wont tell me, but maybe after the course is done she might. She also seemed like a cool person, so theres that too. ",01Dec2017,7

266,"So I don't know if this is one for r/relationshipadvice or if it is good for this subreddit as well but here it goes.


So for most of my life I have struggled with my personal emotional, mental, and overall view of myself.  I'm a 26 male and have never really been on a date and had only one sexual partner.  I've looked into changing my sense of style and even made a few changes in hygene as well as daily rutines but my depression seems to prevent me from getting to the root of the problem. This has poured over to my relationships as well.  I am not where I want to be in my relationship life, people around me seem to have it easy where I seem to be nearly or close to the way they are and yet still not get a relationship or even a hookup.  


Now as far as hookups go I don't think that it is my lifestyle choice or something I want constantly, but would like every now and again if both parties are up for it.  I really, really don't want to become one of those incel people because I know I have to make a change in myself but I feel so fucking lost and everytime I look for flaws my mind always goes too deep into it. 


Recently my roomate has started a relationship with his girlfriend.  As much as I want him to be happy having her over constantly has put a strain on my mental health, I keep thinking ""why isnt that me?"" ""How can he get a relationship and I get nothing?"" And so on.  I also feel this deep anger and envy that I fear will leak out and destroy my very close friendship with him.  Plus being the third wheel constantly is very depressing.  This again puts a strain on our friendship because I feel like my depression and anger show and I kill their fun.  

A factor that prevents me from going out is that Im in a super tough financial situation which I currently am focusing most if not all my attention on, and my roomate helps the best he cab with our rent and all but I pay the majority of everything, which leave me with little to no spending money for myself, but ill go to financial advice for that one.


Again I think my depression is definitely a factor in all of this but I want help in getting advice to maybe see what needs to be changed and what needs to stay the same, I will answer questions if you need more information but I feel as though I'm at a point in my life where I need to change and change quickly because I fear I'm headed down a dark path that I can't and won't be able to get out of.

Anyways, we chat for a while, she really turns me on and I let her know that, and I discover the feeling is mutual. She compliments me and I compliment her and that continues for hours. Finally, she agrees to strip down for me while I masturbate. I do this. She is hesitant to take of underwear, but I ask her to so she does. She is an ""untouched"" virgin and wanted to keep it that way, so I just asked her to take the underwear off and that's it. She then asks if she can put on her clothes but I respond with ""Little bit more, not done yet"" as I was close to the climax. All of a sudden though, someone bursts through the door of the room and starts yelling at her. I spring out of view of the camera and she freaks out, as would anyone, and starts yelling at him to get out, probably her older brother or her father. Anyways, all of the sudden the video chat ends, and I'm sitting here like, ""What the FUCK just happened!"" . Anyways, is this illegal? Will I get in trouble (she does not know my real name but she does know which state I live in)? How can I fix this? Please help me as I am distressing and very confused

TL;DR I met a girl on Chatspin (another site [like Chatroulette and Omegle](http://chatspin.com)), she agrees to strip for me but someone breaks into her room and catches her in the act. She freaked out, I closed my cam immediately. Is there anything illegal in what we did?",01Dec2017,24
274,"I'm a 19 year old girl. 

My brother is going through this phase, where everyone around him are basically mouth-breathing idiots according to him, basically just taking up space and being INCREDIBLY annoying to him. 

I don't know if this is just puberty, but everytime I try to speak to him and try to understand why he is acting a certain way or saying certain things, it's almost as if he makes it into this really complicated and existential thing, where everything is about how religious people get to blame everything they do on their God, and that politics is a big scheme to brainwash everyone, instead of just focusing on the topic at hand. 

 It's really frustrating, it's as if he is unable to take responsibility for his actions. His arguments are always really vague and he sounds really patronizing when he defends himself, and making you look like an imbecile for not agreeing with him. 

I'm a big believer in just listening to each other and trying to make positive changes, instead of just mindlessly defending yourself because you're to proud to admit defeat, which is something he does, unfortunately.  

I'm not saying everything he believes in is bullshit, because of course it isn't. But when he is not able to argue his points in a clear and constructive way, I just can't agree with him on anything, because I don't know what I'm actually agreeing to.

I don't know if I'm being too harsh, but I just find it so infuriating that he just can't seem to listen. Everything has to be about this 'bigger picture' of things, not just the problem that's right in front of him, you know?  

Is there anything I can do? Do I just ignore him when he gets these moods, or is there something specific I could say to him? 
Am I being unfair? 

TLDR;

My 16yo brother is having an existential crisis, unable to remain objective and listen to people around him, making very vague arguments and explanations for his actions. 
Is there anything I can do? Do I just ignore him when he gets these moods, or is there something specific I could say to him?

278,"I am 15, and in my sophomore year. Last year, I left my old school due to toxic friends, and the depression I was suffering from. I switched to homeschooling. 

It's been great so far, my grades have improved, and I can take charge of my own education. My issues with depression and anxiety have gotten better, too.

Here's the problem though; I don't have anyone who I'd call a friend. My old friend group from the last school I was at were talking trash about me behind my back, and I ended up cutting contact with them. 

My ""best friend"" lives in the apartments next to me. I put best friend in quotations because lately, she's been distant. If I ask if she wants to hang out, she'll say she's busy. But, she's homeschooled as well, and she's just as socially awkward as I am. She doesn't really get out much. 

I really would like to confront her about it, but every time I get ready to do so, I have a panic attack. 

Basically, I need new friends.

Now, a word on who I am: I'm introverted, honest, and have really dark and sometimes self-deprecating humor. I call people out on their BS sometimes, and I'm a pretty open person. I watch YouTube and run a meme page, and I also really like to write, it's literally my favorite thing to do on the planet. People always say I'm really mature, but that's only true some of the time.

Unfortunately, a lot of teenagers these days aren't very similar to me, at least the ones I've met. They're shallow, loud, reckless, and fake. Honestly, I can't stand teenagers in California, they give me a headache.

I've talked to my dad about getting out and meeting new people my age, and he suggested we find a church. See, I'm a Christian, but I'm not like everyone else. Going to church makes my insides crawl, mainly because everyone there is so fake. 

The only place I could think of where I'd actually meet people I could see myself liking is group therapy. Obviously, I probably need to go to church AND group therapy, haha. 

I need suggestions, and I would also like to know if there's anyone else in the world in the same situation as me. 

Thanks, Gale.",01Dec2017,6
279,"I do music, art, and writing as hobbies. 
However, because of the internet I’ve been able to have a small audience for it. The internet has enabled me to have a creative outlet for my work. I have a really small fanbase, it is microscopic basically. But it means a lot to me and I do appreciate the little fans that I have. If net neutrality gets repealed, I’m afraid that I won’t have a creative outlet anymore. I upload my music on YouTube and I have a website. It’s off of a smaller hosting service, I’m planning on switching to Wordpress hosting before the 14th. I know that Wordpress will survive the net neutrality repeal because they’re worth over a billion dollars. I’m worried about people like my friends and fans being able to access my content and my website. My idea that I had in mind to deal with this is to spread my content across multiple platforms. For instance, Wordpress will be my main website, and I’ll also have a page on Blogger, Wix, Weebly, etc. For my music, I can upload it on Dailymotion, Bandcamp, Souncloud, ITunes, Cloud Services, etc. Any suggestions on how to deal with this unique dilemma I’ll be faced with of net neutrality is repealed?",01Dec2017,7

Today when I was walking down a corridor I bumped into someone who I went to school with (year above me; I graduated from that school 3 years ago). We rarely interacted, but when I bumped into him today I initiated polite conversation, but briefly because I didn't want to hold him up because he was likely visiting an ill relative (he was with someone who was probably his dad). I felt like the conversation was awkward because of that, and he was always a shy guy, but he messaged me this evening asking if I was free next week to go for a coffee. I'm not interested in him, or dating in general at this moment, but I don't want to have to give him my life story in rejecting him.

Critically, he may visit the hospital again while I'm working, and my job requires a lot of going out and about in the hospital. I have to reply to him. But what do I say? I'm busy?

I feel like my friends at school aren't really my friends. They never invite me any where and every time I ask why I wasn't invited to something ,when everybody else was, they always come up with bullshit reasons why.

The small group of people who I see outside of school around once a week are now hanging out with people who I get shy around. Those people include my ""crush""

I call her my ""crush"" as I'm sick of her yet like her at the same time. Sometimes it feels like she is the only person nice to me. I also don't even want to be attracted to her and just be friends. Yet my stupid self some how got to thinking about her once every hour. She is also the only person that can make me feel good about myself yet at the same time feel shit as I can't talk to her because of my shyness.

My shyness is killing me. I sit alone in 4 of my classes and the depression from it is affecting my school work. It also makes it very hard to go outside and do basic things like apply for a job.

I'm constantly told that I'm stupid for what age I am. I am 15 and my parents always uses that as an excuse why I can't do something. For example: getting a job even tho it's very hard with my shyness.

I sit next to assholes ,who call me their friend, in some of my lessons, they constantly remind me that I'm ""useless"" and can't do anything.

Random encounter and my kid got bitten, thankfully nothing extreme, a couple stitches and the physical wounds are healing.

It wasn't exactly the dogs fault, I'm not wanting him or the new owner to deal with any repurcussions.  I'm having the Health Department breathing down my neck about the dog and rabies, the dog doesn't have rabies.  He's a house dog.

292,"20/M Long story. Im basically in the worse position in my life, Ill start off with the fact that im unemployed but looking Ove moved between jobs, Right now im in tough situation my physical health isnt the best at the moment, I have what I think an un-diagnosed auto immune disease (Hashimotos). Now Im pretty much fighting this all by myself, My family are really supportive other than 1 sister, And my parents dont even try to understand me.

We had an argument about my auto-immune disease because of how much I paid to see my endocrinologist (£130), I wasnt ever going to tell them but I know what they are like, I might lead to physical abuse, But my mum went through my draws and opened my letters to see it. 

On top of all this ive had a lingering ankle problem from last year and I get to see a physio next month on the NHS, truthfully I think it requires surgery :/ Didnt get it checked sooner because my parents were pressuring me to get a job, (Ive decided university isnt for me right now. so I didnt tell them, I still havnt. So i put it on hold instead of looking after myself.

Now I really want to start to change all of this, Ive been in a really bad position for the past few years of my life, Every year I think this is my worst year and it cant get worse, but it does.

Ive also some to the conclusion that I want to move and my parents saying to me ""maybe you should move out then if you dont like it"" and after going through my letters my mum said "" I do what I like, you live in this house"" Both my mum and dad say nasty things about me which really doesnt help my situation, Theyve been like this with since I told them im not going university. They look at me like im the biggest disappointment. I get scared/anxious in the same room with my dad or when he talks to me. 

I want to move out because my parents are controlling, pressuring and exhausting physically and emotionally. They blackmail me all the times. The sad thing is I dont have the money, I dont where to go, I dont what to do first in terms of my life. Its also going to be hard to afford the endocrinologist.

I have somewhat of an idea what I want to do in the foreseeable future, but right now Im just stuck, I wish time would pause while I get my health sorted because it stops me from doing so many things :(

Thank you for reading Im sorry if this isnt easy to read, Im writing while crying after a huge argument, I dread to see what happens tomorrow.

I just wanna do this all quietly, on my own. Im at that point in my life where I just want to do anything and everything for myself and to improve my quality of life, I love my parents but I just dont see myself happy here. I want to be more independent, take care of myself and learn new things like how to cook.

304,"About 2 months ago i broke my knee in half and had to have surgery. While i was in the hospital i met this nurse (20F), who id later fall in love with. I (17M) told her everything about me. We did MDMA together. I had been in relationships before but this was different. She was my favorite person, i was willing to put my life on hold to be with her. I wanted to join the military, and live on the coast. To me it wasn't my goal but my dream. I hate the mid-west. For her i decided i wasn't going to do that, instead id move down to bowling green, KY. The last place id ever see myself going or even want to go. But i would do it for her. Maybe we rushed things. But we really clicked that well. At least i thought we did.

4 days ago she left her apple watch at my house and i found out she was still texting her ex. I told him immediately what was going on, how she was cheating. He did not know and was probably more hurt than me, they were together for 3.5 years. He had some idea but wasn't sure. Poor guy. I felt terrible. He even got her the apple watch. I was scarred to tell him honestly, i'm a small guy and he could kick my ass. Hell from what i heard about him i figured he would. But he appreciated me telling him. It was the least i could do. More than anything i wish it would have been the other way around. That i was the one been cheating on after 3.5 years instead of 2 months. It hurts me knowing i did that to someone. I cant imagine how bad it feels. If i was in his situation i may have killed myself.

These past few days I've been drinking, taking hydrocodone, and etizolam non stop. Time feels like its been moving by differently. Almost faster. Its more bearable. I don't think i am suicidal, but I've been having these thoughts. That if something happens to me from all this i don't really care. The only thing that was stopped me from out right killing myself is my dog. Shes like my kid. I either get cheated on or left in every relationship I've been in. This feels like the final blow. Like this is the standard.
She has been trying to text me, it feels like fucking harassment. I would block her and she would text me from a different number. I bet she is reading this considering she has my Reddit username.

Maybe 3 weeks later I got a girlfriend. She's been my good friend for a year and a half, but we recently got really close, I would say maybe 1-2 weeks before I got on Zoloft. So now I have a girlfriend and I'm making decisions that I think will make me happy. I feel really good. My problem is I'm not sure if it's my life that's gotten better (it has) or the Zoloft that's making me feel good, and I'm wondering if I would still be happy without it.    
The main reason I'd like to taper off it would be because I have a really low sex drive now and have trouble getting erections. Which is bad timing because my girlfriend and I are starting to become sexually active with each other. I did ask my doctor today at my follow-up appointment about this side-effect and he basically said ""It is really common, sometimes it goes away, sometimes it doesn't. You'll have to decide if its benefits outweigh that.""    
So I guess I have a few questions    
- How do I know I'll still be happy off medication?    
- Will this effect go away any time soon if I stay on it?
- How would I go about tapering off Zoloft?    
- Can I just resume my normal dosage if I feel depression-like symptoms recur?

We are trying to find her, I want to help my friend be at ease to at least know if she's alive. The problem is we don't know if she changed her last name or where she is possibly living. She could be anywhere at this point. We can't afford to pay for an investigator at the moment. We don't want to post about her on social media asking to find her because my friend's family.

315,"Re-Post from Adoption Subreddits 

I recently placed my newborn with an AMAZING couple in July. Even though they have last seen me only once since leaving the hospital with my daughter, they have been, just...incredible. They were unfailingly patient with me in those first weeks when I was most wracked with guilt and shame and postpartum depression was kicking my ass. I was having major separation anxiety, and so I texted about once a week asking for just..a picture of whatever she's doing right now. Every time, they'd send me a bunch of pictures, and like, the last time she ate, when she last slept, whatever she was up to (even though she's an infant. I knew full well she was either sleeping or pooping or eating.) They reassured me that they were  excellent care of her. And they still do.

We've had 1 in-person visit since then, and it occurred to me at one point, very consciously, that she was more theirs than mine. On the one hand, it broke my heart and felt absolutely unbearable. But I also knew that anything less would be concerning. They're perfect with her, like she was born to them. They love and adore and care for her, and are able to provide for her in ways I know I never could. 

We have a  get-together scheduled for Sunday. It just occurred to me that I won't see them again before Christmas. I need really thoughtful gift ideas....they're pretty affluent, they don't NEED anything....just something to help express my gratitude for them, their patience for me and the love they have for our daughter.

Any suggestions or ideas would be SOOOO appreciated!!

THANK YOU!!!!!!

316,"First of all, I'll explain my background. I've been working for my current employer for 10 years. I started when I was 20 years old and I was hired to log soils, do basic surveys and a little bit of drafting. I was getting paid 35k. Over time I got real good at CAD. 

Then, about 4 years ago I got moved to the drafting department. I got bumped to 50k. Since I have more time in the office and with cad. I decided to learn programming during and after work hours. I've developed so many plug-ins in my own (most of it was during my own time) and helped automate a lot of our work. Everyone uses them now in the company.

I felt I wasn't being compensated enough so about 2 years ago, I've applied for a job somewhere else. I got a bump in payrise, now to 60k. The other company rang me again after 6 months to match my new pay but I ignored them.

About 6 months ago, my boss left which left me doing more advance work. Not just cad anymore. I also work 55-60 hours a week during weekdays.

I have applied at a recruitment place and now he's got a lot of companies interested in me despite me saying I won't jump ship unless it's more than 80k.

I really like my current employer. But I've become so bitter and burnt out recently. I want to give them a chance.
I would stay if they offer me the cad manager role because the current one sometimes ask me on how to do things. He's got more experience but I believe I'm a lot better than him. Also, is it unreasonable to ask for them to pay me more than the competitor's offer?

Should I pitch it in before an offer?

Or should I hand my resignation then pitch it in when they present the counter offer? I feel real bad because I tried to jump ship not that long ago.",01Dec2017,1
319,"Hey everyone. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read. Also apologies for the length.

My BIL is a drug addict, deadbeat father who was arrested and sentenced for B&amp;E and larceny. He got out of jail a few months ago and ever since has been terrorizing me, my husband (H) and his family. He broke into my home when H and I were out of the country getting married. He stole thousands of dollars of items from H's family over the course of his release to pawn and sell for drugs.

Well we decided to put up cameras and security systems. Lo and behold we caught him on video breaking into our home. We gave it to the police and he currently is awaiting trial for burglary, home invasion w/ weapon, and larceny.

He's looking at 7-21 years. My in-laws have begged us to drop some (not all) of the charges. They claim that it's too long and they will be 80 (or dead) by the time he gets out. They have been enabling him all his life and it's my belief that they will continue to do so.

I refuse to drop the charges. IMO if you do the crime you do the time. No exceptions. 

Are H and I in the right? I do not think I should compromise my convictions because of an emotional plea. As much as it hurts, I believe this needs to happen. Am I being heartless? Or are they making an unreasonable request?

TL;DR: Caught ex con BIL burglarizing home. In laws begging us not to drop some charges because they might not be alive when he gets out. Are we being too harsh? ",01Dec2017,1
321,"I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from a decent school with a 3.2 GPA who has been trying for months to get a job related to my degree. I have no relevant work experience, and I have only had part time jobs. No employer has even requested an interview. What can I do to overcome my lack of experience, and where can I look for job opportunities?",01Dec2017,1
323,"Hello everyone this is going to be a doozy but I am at the point where I could really use outside advice. I started at my job 2.5 years ago and I really lucked out. It’s a small company owned by 2 middle aged men and a lot of the company is friends or relatives. I was pregnant at the time and a they have always been so accommodating to me. My husband is finishing up school right now and I am the sole source of income. My bosses let me work my schedule around my husband’s school so we don’t have to pay for child care (which we can’t afford).

So here is the issue, one of my boss’s nephews works in a department that works closely with mine, let’s call him Jeff. I work in the same room as the other’s boss’s sister in law (Amy) who has known Jeff 12+ years, he is about 5 years older than me. He started hitting on me shortly after I started working here but I honestly didn’t pick up on it because I was PREGNANT and MARRIED. Eventually it got to where I noticed what was going on and I would politely remind him I am married but he would always just ‘joke around’ about me being too sensitive. 

Once I gave birth and came back things escalated, he has the only key to the storage room so when I needed anything he would kind of ‘jokingly’ trap me in there and comment on my looks or even ask for a hug or high five. I never gave in and let him touch me, I would always remind him I am married but then he would make it out like I was being sensitive and he is ‘only joking’. He would constantly comment on everything in my life thinking he had a right in his mind me and Amy are his best friends. Eventually I grew some balls and started being dismissive and a bit mean to him, but apparently he liked that so it never stopped and just made him compete for my attention.

I can’t go to HR because she is basically a surrogate mom to everyone in the family she has known Jeff forever and he even lived with her for a while. Everyone is very closely related here. I also can’t go to my boss because he is family and I am just some girl who got hired here. I can’t leave this job because I am the source of income for my family and no other job would let me pick my schedule like this. 

Things have gotten worse recently, he has been explosive and unpredictable. He’s going through a hard time trying to get his ‘wife’ from an arranged marriage in another country over to the US and it is not going well. A few weeks ago he said a comment about shooting someone or himself (he actually has a gun at home he talks about a lot) I honestly don’t think he ever would but it is a scary thing to hear.  Amy told her brother in law and his response was ‘why would you tell me that? I don’t want to hear about that!’ He was mad she brought it up and he did nothing. Earlier this week he joked about shooting his wife if she gets out of line when she gets here. And today a big argument happened between Amy and Jeff, he cussed her out and in the end said ‘oh what are you a lazy ‘N word’ now?’ None of us are AA but I felt a chill go through my body when he said that and it really upset me. 

He is up in our office trying to be buddy buddy 2-3 hours out of every work day. I know he is here more on the days I am in the office. If I shut him out and ignore him he bugs me more because he wants my attention, if I tell him to stop it turns into a joke to him, I can’t go to upper management without fear of what Jeff will do when he finds out or in fear of getting fired. I’m scared and uncomfortable at this point, the last 2 months have really escalated and I don’t know how he will act from day to day. I can’t loose this job but I hate being here. 

Amy is very dismissive to everything, they fight a lot but they always make up because they are basically family. I told her he was making me uncomfortable and she just kind of brushed it off. ",01Dec2017,2

327,"Male, 30, slightly overweight but physically active, not depressed(clinically), travel for work and I'm currently in California.

I've always had a lack of interest in school, but I've always enjoyed learning on my own and, often watch documentaries and etc. There were a few teachers that would keep me engaged, but only for a short while, before I wound up just sitting there either doodling and/or just staring at the chalk board. 

It didn't help that I was an army brat either, so when I was 16 I wound up dropping out and getting a G.E.D. My family moved afterwards and I was essentially isolated(outskirts of a small town) with no car, no places to walk to, no way to send a resume other than to call random businesses and, no way to contact friends.

I eventually managed to steal a couple thousand dollars from my parents and made my way out of state to a friends, I wound up working minimum wage jobs, got a car and, went to college for a few skilled trades courses (automotive repair and welding) but nothing ever really came of them, due to my inexperience and lack of references.

I tried a few apprenticeships as well for tool and die, CNC and the Electrician fields(which is what I am doing currently). I do fine in them, in the sense that I bust my ass. However, I can't learn the material.

No matter what I've tried, it feels like there's timer in my head that wipes everything clean. Not only that, but my stuttering is getting worse, I often lose things, I imagine doing/seeing things, I've been getting ahead of myself a lot, I've been a LOT more irritable and I sometimes feel like I'm losing control of my body... Hell just writing this I've made numerous typos, where I thought I pressed a key, have forgotten how to spell words, lost track of what I was saying and etc.

I've talked to a therapist and a doctor. My therapist hasn't really done much other than give me mental exercises to try and reduce my irritability and, my doctor has done three different tests with no negative results.

331,"Hi friends,

So I’m a Male, 26. I’ve been in a long term relationship with my SO for 5 years. She’s a female, 25. As of late she’s been wanting to return to her hometown Chicago. I have always lived in Southern California. I have established friends, clubs, and of course all my family is out here. I’m very family oriented. 
  I didn’t take news to her wanting to leave California very well because of course the thought of that is terrifying. I felt frustrated and sad because I love this woman, planned to marry her and settle down with her. The idea of leaving my life behind for a new one was like I said terrifying and sad, but after doing thinking I would be ultimately happy to follow her. She’s very understanding of how I feel and wants me to go with her. 
   We had a long talk this past Monday and laid out our feelings, goals, plans, just everything was laid out on the table. Lots of crying because we don’t want to lose each other, but we are scared that I might have some resentment towards her if I move and am unhappy. 
    Shortly later after the conversation she broke down and told me she doesn’t want to, but suggested a “break” not a breakup. The least possible communication so we could both get our emotions in order and time to think all this through. I agreed. I began packing some of my stuff and she said that she doesn’t want to break up but just wants a break, so she said to just leave my stuff at her place. I said okay. 
   We haven’t talked since Monday and I’m getting a little frustrated because nothing’s resolved and just don’t know what to do. I’m on the edge of just messaging her and letting her know that I’ve done my thinking and would like to talk to her tonight and either stay together or break up. 
    I just feel so frustrated with this break because nothing is resolved, it’s been the same.  

Any advice guys is really appreciated or any insight to why the break was suggested in the first place. If she doesn’t want to lose me and doesn’t want to break up but wants to take a break? I’m confused 

Thank you. ",01Dec2017,3

I feel like a regular person would be very happy about this but I'm not, like, someone might say,"" This is the perfect opportunity!!"" She's suffering.
