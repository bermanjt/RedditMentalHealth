0,"I've (F21)  been living with four other people, my bf (M28), this chick I'll call Justine (F20), her bf (M22), and another guy I'll call Bowls. 

When I and my guy moved in, I provided glass cups, mugs, many bowls, a couple plates, pots n pans, and misc kitchen stuff. Justine brought plates (we have so many fucking plates) and plastic cups and other things. 

My boyfriend and I eat a lot of fast food or stuff you pop into the microwave and eat. Basically we barely generate any dishes. 

On the other hand, everyone else makes dishes but will leave them in the sink for weeks. This is gross, unsanitary, and smells. Not only that, but it's some of my dishes and cups that are dirtied by other people, and I feel that because it was used by someone else, they should have to wash it, not me. 

I've wanted to have them stop using my dishes for ages because of this. 

Yesterday, Justine and I got into a fight (personal reasons), and now I definitely want to tell them to stop using my dishes, though it wouldn't help the situation. 

There's only about four months on my lease left. 
Is this fair? Should I do it?",08Jul2017,3
1,"I made a really big mistake. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. We really love each other and we have a great relationship. 

Last week when he was out of town for a business trip, I was at a friends birthday party. This guy I didn't even know came over and started talking to me. I tried to ignore him at first, but he just kept on making me laugh, so I began kissing him. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, we were having sex at our apartment. 

My boyfriend doesn't know that I hooked up with another guy, so what should I do? ",08Jul2017,2
2,"I'm 22. I have never had a ""real"" job. I've only had volunteer positions and the last volunteer position I had, I left because my mother invited me with her to travel. 

I desperately need a job. 

I have social anxiety as well as slight hearing loss in one ear. While my other ear seems to be fine, sometimes it's like it takes me brain a little bit too long to process what's being said. So I have to ask them to repeat what they said several times.  The idea of working fast food/retail **terrifies** me because I don't do well with being yelled at and I'm not sure I could handle drive-thru. 

As you can imagine I'm in a tight spot. I have many questions but I'll just ask the ones I think are most important. 

1. If I were to work fast food would it be reasonable to ask to work anywhere but the drive-thru? I'm a very quick learner and follow directions with no problem. Registers scare me but I think I could handle it. 

2. I have basically nothing to add to my resume but my name. I have several volunteering positions but two of those were 10 years ago. The other....I volunteered to help my roommate. So I'm sure many places wouldn't really consider that. 

3. I have NO references. None. 
I had to drop out of college almost 2 years ago because I could no longer afford it. I don't even have professors to add. 

4. How do I fix this god awful mess? I very desperately need a job but I know I am NOT what any employer would want. Where do I start? Should I go back to volunteering? 

5. I'm very petite. 5'0"" and not even 100 pounds. Many places have physical requirements like lifting 50-60 pounds. I CANNOT do that. My wrists are 5 inches round....with basically no muscle to them. I can push/pull. My legs are very well toned. You know how many joke about skipping leg day? Well I've been skipping arm day for YEARS. 
As long as I can use my legs I'm fine. 
How am I supposed to get a job being so scrawny and useless? 

TL;DR: scrawny, useless, no previous job experience at 22, social anxiety with mild hearing loss and a slow brain. Trying to find a job. ",08Jul2017,2

7,"19/F home for the summer, and as of right now, I feel sort of directionless. I only feel alive when I'm out doing things. For example, I just had a short vacation with my family, and I was really happy and had fun. The next day after coming home, the same urge was back. It feels like I'm looking for something more, you know? Nothing is stimulating enough. 

I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just having a life crisis or it's some kind of cabin fever (I do work 25+ hours a week at a fast food place, but even during long shifts I'm completely bored and am waiting to get off so I can go home).

9,"I have a Dell Inspiron 15 which is touch screen and a week ago the charging port broke. I opened the computer and it seems that the charging port is connected a screw by a piece of plastic which keeps it in place.

My question is should try to fix it. I tried seeing how much it would cost and from what I've found I would have to replace the motherboard (he port is attached to that) which is almost as much as the computer.

Or should I just buy a new computer. I have only had this one for a little over a year but I'm starting college in the fall and I want a computer that won't have any issues and will last be through school (I'm thinking a mac).

11,"So I've been dreading summer because I know there's not gonna be anything for me to do. Come summer, and I haven't been invited to anything. None of my friends have asked if I wanted to do anything and all of suggestions to do something have been met with ""sounds fun, I'll get back to you,"" with no reply.

&amp;nbsp;

As a bit of backstory in the winter they ghosted me because I was (admittedly) too clingy and judgmental. Since then I've always been hyper cautious around them, knowing what I do and say may be misconstrued. That said, I still have had great times with them and things have gotten better. Another notable piece of backstory is that one of the girls, we'll call her Lucy, has started dating another friend in the group who isn't too fond of me, possibly because he may sense that I like her too, which I do. Anyways her, her boyfriend and a few other friends have gotten very close especially when they were ghosting me.

&amp;nbsp;

Now that summer's here I planned on getting closer to this friend group, specifically Lucy. However, as Lucy has just got back from Europe she wants to spend a lot of her time with her boyfriend, we'll call Cayden. This means that I can't really spend any time with her solo and no else in the friend group has invited me to do something. Basically, it's Nick who's dating Claire and Lucy who's dating Cayden. They spend a lot of time with each other and I'm almost always the second thought. Unless I'm either Claire or Lucy's boyfriend, I'm gonna be a second thought. Additionally, because of Lucy and Cayden's personalities their relationship has never been too strong, so they're probably not going to be together too long. I'm hoping hat it fades soon so I could try to do something with Lucy.

&amp;nbsp;

As no new friendships are a possibility (trust me, I've tried), I'm not sure how to fix the situation. If possible I'd even love to spend every day with my friend group because I love them that much. It's just that they're so caught up with their own affairs that they don't really involve me in anything. Should I talk to them about it at the risk of them seeing me as pushy/clingy again? What should I do? Please help!",08Jul2017,1
13,"OK. RANT TIME.

So, I go to a university and took a class which I wanted to be a Teaching Assistant (TA) in. I knew from the start I wanted to do it, I was passionate about the class and worked SO hard for it. 

I went to every SINGLE resuscitation with all the current TA's to get my name out there and to truly understand what the position involved. By the end of the semester, all of the TAs (there are several) knew me by name. They as a group even wrote my letter of recommendation. 

I went to office hours with the professor every few weeks to make sure she knew I wanted it. I asked her what I could do to be competitive, asked her all of these questions about what I would do..she led me on like I was gonna get it. 

I stayed up late for hours doing literate reviews for her, I helped with any issues going on in the class, tutored other students and so on. 

Despite that I went to all my classes, all the resuscitation, worked my ass for it, I got an email saying I was not selected. I just wept. I usually don't get too upset about these things, but this was hours and hours of dedication to the course for this position and she simply said no. I feel like I wasted so much time, so much effort, everything. Here's what pisses me off, I gave advice to other students on what to do to get it (e.g. go to resuscitation to show your name, ask questions in class (and show up), show a general interest (mind you this was already several weeks into the class so I felt like I already had the upper advantage and wasn't worried they'd show more). 

So, now I turn to reddit for advice. How do I get over this feeling of just being crushed, disappointed, and moronic. I really just don't get it. Everything about my current situation just seems awful. I don't wanna get too deep but I have other things going on in my life too (like my depression, my parents marriage falling apart, my brother being arrested)..I feel like I am in a dark place and that all the lights are burned out.

14,"This is posted on a throwaway account.

I’m a father of a daughter and a son. My son has picked up a very bad habit. He constantly masturbates for long periods of time. I first caught him doing this a few months ago. His bedroom door was wide open, and he was lying down on the bed fapping. Over time, he began to jack off more frequently. I checked his phone’s history, and there were records of thousands of porn webpages visited. I told him that it was unhealthy to jerk off for hours on end, and he shouldn’t be watching porn (he’s only 13). But no matter what I did, he continued to masturbate. Every time he goes to the bathroom, I hear fapping noises for as long as an hour. Just a week ago he got suspended at school for jacking off in the restroom. What should I do to make him break this bad habit? I have no control over what he does in the shower, but seriously...jerking off from bedtime until 1:00 a.m?

16,"So i'm 26m I've only ever been in 4 relationships and they all ended rather poorly. Longest was 10months. I'm a hopeless romantic kind of person. My last relationship was 2 years ago. I have tried to meet new people but I'm not good with clubs and bars. I've tried online and that has gone nowhere. I guess i've developed a certain routine on trying to get to know someone.

If i send a message i usually give a compliment and ask a little about the other persons life.(wether they respond is a whole other story)When i do get a response i dont know how to get the conversation past just asking about their likes/dislikes.
What am i doing wrong?

(In-person-dating)
I've never been good at approaching people in general so walking up to a girl and asking her out takes alot out of me. I've got my plan layed out in my head and wheni walk up i just stop and dont do it. What do i need to do to overcome this? is it fear? Rejection? I've watched other people do this with ease and I tell myself i can do but i cant. 

I'm at the point where it feels better to be used then to be useless.

Should i stop bothering with relationships even though it's a driving factor in my motivation?
What i mean by this is when i'm in a relationship i do better at everyday things including taking care of myself, otherwise i live a rather mundane life. I'm nice all the time but being nice doesnt get me anywhere? I've had friends say your to nice. I've even had friends say your cute but that doesnt mean anything to me. nice and cute dont get you anywhere. 
A little about me is I'm in college still and i work for myself. I help organize some pickup games for sports. I try to be social but when im in a group with people i tend to just freeze up and not talk.

17,"I was never really told about AP classes at all by teachers or school counselors during freshman to junior years.  I suppose it's also somewhat my fault, I never really looked into it.  

Now that I'm going into my senior year, I've realized that maybe I should've taken AP classes.  So from what I've seen, my school only has one AP class, AP Lang (small school).  Idk if these count, but I took Precalc 1 last year and I'm taking Precalc 2 this year.  I'm going to talk to the VP before school starts for advice, but is there anything you guys know of that I could do?  I've heard that to get into good schools, you have to take challenging courses, so I'm kinda worried.

So far, I've taken 4 years of math (Alg 1 - Precalc 1), 3 of history (NW, US, and world), two tech classes (Technology and computer apps), 3 English, 2 science (biology and chem), PE and sports, 2 finance (personal finance and intro to economics), 2 yrs of Spanish, and 3 religion (religious school).  I want to try to make up for a lack of AP classes, so this upcoming senior year I'm gonna to try to take extra classes.  I'm definitely taking World Religions, precalc 2, government, AP Lang, and anatomy, and probably physics since not many people do and I gotta look good.  I was also gonna try taking a different language, like Japanese, just so I know some of a different language (and I like anime, shush), and possibly a couple college classes that won't kill me, both so my application looks good and so I save money.

What do you think?  Too much?  Too little?  Should I add or remove something?  I know there's probably no chance of Ivy league, which is fine, but I at least want a reputable school.  GPA is 3.7 btw, but honestly, I could do better.

23,"I have anxiety issues. I saw a therapist maybe 6 years ago for only a handful of sessions to address some childhood problems.

Subconsciously during my appts I would hurt myself in some manner I guess as a way to try to manage the anxiety. Pinching my skin, digging my nails into my palms until they bled even. I knew I was doing it, but I couldn't stop it. At the time, I decided to show my therapist the nail marks at the end of the session. She was so shocked and looked a little disgusted. In the following sessions, she kept a close eye on my hands. We didn't get very far in our treatment before I stopped going.

So now 6 years later, I'm finally in a place where I would like to try therapy again. I found a way to do a ""televideo"" session, so I don't have to go into an office. I was hoping that would make me more comfortable and less anxious. I also came prepared with a paper and pen in my hand so I'd have something to fidget with while we talked.

However, it didn't quite work out as planned. I dropped the pen and pinched the skin on my stomach (out of camera view) until it was raw. And then I also completely destroyed this small paper I had in my other hand.

And we didn't even talk about anything too ""difficult"" today. My anxiety just skyrockets to extreme levels at the *thought* of talking about things with a therapist. I'm just not sure the best way to handle it.

So, should I tell my new therapist about this habit or just try to control it the best way I can? I don't want to freak her out like I did with my previous one. If I do tell her, do I tell her that I already hurt myself during the first session too? I'm pretty sure that would freak anyone out. Any suggestions on what I could do to help curb these reactions?

25,"There will be a tl;dr for this because I am about to share with you my situation.

As in the title, I am an international student that just graduated from college with a degree in accounting. To put things simply, I am a shit student and i should have done better. I know this. When i took accounting 101, I thought to myself, this was possibly the easiest class and if the rest of the classes for accounting were this simple and straightforward, this would be a breeze, I would get an internship by summer of junior year and land a job before I graduate. That was not the case

My passion is for animals, I enjoy being around them, caring for them, messing around with them. Ive raised rabbits, fighting roosters, turtles, dogs, cats, fishes, and even a bearded dragon. However i could never put my love for animal or science into grades in high school which is why I did not pursue it in college because I felt that my GPA would turn to shit. Problem is, my decision to major in accounting was also a bad decision because by the time i reached intermediate or advanced accounting, I couldnt do anything. I could not bother to put in the effort to pass with flying colors. All i seem able to do was enough to graduate, by a thread if I were to be completely honest with you.

Because of this, I am now struggling to get anything done with my future. I am applying for job opportunities via a program called OPT which essentially puts my name into the system and sorts of helps me find job opportunities. However, i am bound by my degree as it will only work if i find a job in my degree.

My current situation is as so, I do not have a lot of time left and I dont know what to do. I have a friend who is very much like an older sister to me who is helping me out and putting me on track. I have set up an appointment with 2 school deans Im close with through club activities and now im posting here because I frequent reddit every night without fail before going to bed and I wanted a place to write everything I felt and the things im going through in hope someone can relate and help me out.

He believes that work is holding him back now, Yeah its extra cash but he says if he grows his programming/computer sci. portfolio/knowledge he will be better off in the long term come junior year when you ideal want to start interning. The only expense he pays for now is car insurance and using loans for schooling. Which doesnt sound like much to me but he told me he would like to quit his job and focus solely on teaching himself how to Program. His father on the other hand does not agree with this plan at all. He thinks hes being a cop-out, screwing himself over and that he wont have any money in the long run. My question of this is my friend actually being a cop out for dedicating himself to something which hes majoring in ? Is he getting screwed over by not working this part time job ?

40,"So I got hit with Bell's palsy last Monday.

And I admit I'm not the best looking out there. I rely heavily on being friendly, and having a welcoming demeanor.

My doctor hasn't told me how long it'll take to fully heal, apparently it's hard to pinpoint so as far as I know this could be gone in three weeks or never.

And I don't know what to do. I pride myself on being *happy*. I've done a lot towards being actually happy and this week, whenever I passed by my mirror all I see is how I used to be: filled with rage and hate. The best smile I can get out is apparently a sarcastic smirk and while that's convenient, I'd actually like to get my old cheery smile back.

What the hell do I do? What if this is forever? I've read cases of people never getting fully healed from this and if I could I'd be bawling my eyes out.",08Jul2017,4
42,"So, growing up my parents had an awful relationship. My father would be mean and hurtful to my mother a lot, which was hard to watch because I was always very close to my mom. They finally divorced within the last few years and my mom now has a new boyfriend. I really think my mom's boyfriend is great and I am glad they are together, but the weird thing is that whenever I see them hug or cuddle I feel a deep feeling of terror and I have to look away. I don't know why I do this, it's not like I don't trust her boyfriend. I've used to feel this feeling whenever I saw anyone cuddling in front of me, but since I have been around friends who cuddle with their partner's a lot in front of me over the past couple of years I have been able to feel a lot more relaxed whenever I see people cuddle.  My mom is the exception though, I just can't stop myself from feeling terrified whenever I see her hug her boyfriend. I hope this doesn't come across as some lame woe-is-me tale, I just want to know if anyone else has ever experienced this and has any advice as to how to get over it.",08Jul2017,0
43,"I’m just really frustrated at this point—particularly with my “friends”. I have had a really hard time this past year (family issues, body image issues, boy drama [something I did not deal with until this year], and friend issues, of course [since this is what this post is mainly about]). I became depressed this year and lost motivation for things I wanted to achieve. It kind of felt like karma was laughing at me when things did not go my way (which happened more often than not). Of course, through all these problems, it would be amazing to have a supportive, phenomenal group of friends like the ones present on TV shows or whatever. However, this was not the case and still is not. The main problem with my friends is that they are SO unreliable. In this past week, 4 of my friends flaked out on me. They all claim that they are there for me no matter what and we’re best friends, blah blah. They’ve all invited me to hang out recently, so I feel like them not liking me is not the issue. But honestly, it has been so ridiculous. Here are some examples:
My friend, A we will call her, has depression as well and we have become closer this year and started hanging out a lot more. She invited me into her friend group and I get along with the other girls. I felt like she was someone I could really count on and like she was a best friend—we shared secrets and deep shit. However, recently she has been ignoring me. She only responds to half of my texts, even though I am like I need advice— it is not just banter or small talk. Then she ignored me for 2 days and then tried to get my notes from biology class (which I already took but she is taking next year). Same thing happened again today. Mid-convo she disappeared. I know she is on her phone too because she snap chatted me. I don’t know what the deal is with A. I had talked to her before and asked her if everything was good between us and she was like yea of course and then asked me to hang out.
Ok. Now onto G. I made plans with G 2 days in advance. She agreed, was enthusiastic blah blah. About 1 hour before we are supposed to meet up, I text her to remind her. Immediately, she texts back and is like I can’t go. Since I already made plans for dinner (or so I thought), I did not have anything to eat on such short notice. I am not upset that she could not come; it was that she told me last minute and she did not even say anything until I texted her. 
Then theres M. She is not a tester. When I say that, I mean it—she literally takes 3 days to text back, a fact she admitted. This of course makes it super hard to get in touch with her. She told me to FaceTime her or call her instead of text her. I do FaceTime with her and talk to her over that, but if she does not pick up, I cannot really talk to her because she does not respond to missed calls. Basically, if I want to talk to her, I have to catch her at the right time (or hang out in person with her, which I have [yesterday, actually]). 
Lastly, for brevity (which, admittedly, does not really exist in this post), I will end it with R. We facetimed a while ago but we supposed to again for the past 2 weeks because we have many life updates and gossip or whatever. However, she went out of town with her family and apparently that means she couldn’t FaceTime me. I didn’t really understand why because she was alone for several hours a day when she was away but I let it slide. Today, she got back and said she would “try” to FaceTime me. She was at her house for 4 hours, doing NOTHING, so she did not try very hard. She snap chatted me a picture of her sitting on her bed, not doing anything. Honestly, it was very annoying because why tell me you might FaceTime me but then just do nothing instead. She kept saying I will try so like I waited for her to call.
As I have said before, all these people want to hang out with me. So why tf are they being such unreliable and flaky friends? And how do I deal with friends like this? I know some people might be like “get rid of them” but I mean when I do talk to my friends I am happy. Gotta consider what makes me happy too. And I don’t want to be completely friendless either. Please share your thoughts.",08Jul2017,1

49,"Should my gym teacher get in trouble for these comments she made about male students? so I have this gym teacher in high school summer school teaching my gym class who is young, (30 I think) and she teaches physical education and English. She is a pretty cool teacher and nice. We will be about to do the swimming unit. When she was describing what stuff you need to bring she mentioned to the boys in the class that she likes the swimming unit the most because with the boys not wearing shirts she can see how youbreally look and how fit you really are. the comment doesn't bother me in the slightest , but if some kid who was around me decides to go cry about it, will she get in trouble?

50,"Despite how my post looks, I AM NOT suicidal, I AM NOT a troll, and I AM NOT asking about illegal.  
 
I have no passion for this little life of mine. I'm 23, I need a job, I need so much, yet I have nothing. No passion. The list of jobs I'm even willing to do are all absurd, and I mean absolutely childish and pathetically absurd, a little list of a few;    
  
Assassin (low end, 5k per kill, only accept jobs that involve 'street justice')   
Police Officer (dirty)    
Drug Trafficker/ Drug Dealer  
Human Trafficker   
Gang Member (obviously a violent and arrogant punk)    
Loan Sharks Thug (guy who collects the debt, violently)    
Join the military (obviously to abuse power and kill)                 
Set up cameras in highend hotels and blackmail wealthy upper middle class old men         
Commit a low tier crime and get a few years in jail, see if suffering can wake me up. (Not a job, but it is a place to live, for free. AND they even pay my utility bills too, and it might even make me suffer enough to turn me from a failure into... Half a failure. ;D)                 
 
To conclude, I need a lifestyle that allows me to do anything risky, illegal, or anything morally considered wrong.   
  
I assume this is because of my desire to experience risk, or even death. I need to risk my life to feel alive, and because I have never truly felt alive I can't simply accept a normal life. Even if I will come to regret it, I need to experience dancing on the edge of a knife before I will ever learn to appreciate living simply. Life means nothing to me, it is merely something to enjoy, thus the reason I am alive and sane(maybe) is because I have novels to read, manga I've read in the past, and anime. These few things are what keep me grounded in reality, I mean my three biggest dreams are to be transported to another world with a golden ring, to have this world transform into a level up apocalypse world where I have a golden ring, or virtual reality comes into existence. So maybe I'm not grounded given my fantasies are actually my dreams, however it is a lot better than where I Should be, given my mental crises and personality without such delusions of grandeur keeping me sane(maybe) I would have ended my own life or simply killed many others before ending my own. As I am now I can't even begin to imagine a life where I live a life of 9 go 5 slog.      
  
So maybe I need to experience death to enjoy life. The only other possibility is that I am lonely and have never connected with anybody emotionally, nor experienced any type of love within my life. Because I've never had a friend who I could voice my thoughts too, one who would even share my thoughts, for example talking about how if I could go to another world with a level up system and become powerful I'd like to see what it is like to enslave a magical race or taste what human flesh is like. Maybe this is what I need, somebody fucked up enough that could care about me, and I could care about them. BUT I can't find somebody like this, but maybe, just maybe, this is what I need my life together.... OR it could be love, I've never loved another soul, I mean sure I love my mother, my niece, and what not, but I mean real love. I've never once thought about how I could sacrifice something to make another human being happy, how I could move not in my own self interest but because I think my partner would like it. Maybe what I need is somebody I can voice my darkness to, but also somebody who I can overcome my darkness to make thems happy. OR maybe I need both. Something, Somebody, in my life. It doesn't matter what it is, but maybe I need something that will make me commit suicide should I lose it.      
 
I mean seriously, life is as important as grass, so worthless you could cut it down for months on end and it will grow back a few years later, and nobody could ever make me want to die as I am now, but yet despite it being impossible currently for me to want to die due to the loss of another human being, I actually plan to die if I fail to get my life together. Of course I don't plan to commit suicide (per-say) I plan to die in a hail of bullets or running in front a truck (I mean I did say that my biggest dream is transmigrating/reincarnating into another world after all). So maybe, just maybe, I need something to die for, not for fun or experience life, but to cherish somebody I can't replace. I think that is it, I need somebody who is both friend and lover, somebody I can die for, share my darkness with, and somebody that I could never replace, not because they aren't irreplaceable but because I am unwilling to replace them even if a better version of them showed up.     
 
I wear my darkness on my sleeve, visible to the world. But what I don't do is show how vulnerable I am despite my darkness. I am easily considered cruel, yet I am one of the sweetest men who could cherish your love and friendship beyond measure. I am easily considered passionless, yet my passion for dreams exceed the fabric of our reality beyond the realms of gods. I am a weak monster in human flesh, I need love, compassion, friendship. I also need a lifestyle. Not a job, I can't work, I don't want to work, I want to live. If I live and breathe as a Chef, I could become a chef(maybe), but if I just work in the kitchen of an olive garden then it is merely suicide inducing. A lifestyle.... Yes a lifestyle.     
   
I can't tell if it is human connection I need or not, but what I know for certain while writing this is I need a lifestyle. I can't work a job, I'd rather commit suicide (via cops or making some poor truck driver run me over). I need a job that is a life, a job that I can't quit. You can't stop being a deep sea fisherman once you are in the middle of the ocean. Maybe it doesn't need to fun and violent, but it needs to be ALL encompassing. The money I have left from the death of my grandparents is about to run out. If I can't find a job that will become my entire life, then i have no idea what I'll do with it... No I have an idea, I'll likely just end my life.     
 
Can anybody help me? I don't expect you to be my friends, I have even less hope that anyone of you will find me so relatable that you fall for me, but maybe, just maybe, one of you guys is able to take in a useless bum like me and provide me purpose, or one of you knows of some place or job or person that would be able to become my new life. Who know! I'm willing to anything, so long as it can become my everything... I don't think I can live just for myself anymore, I can't sustain that life anymore, and I can't separate my life into work and personal, I just don't have the ability, I've tried and failed 19 times, I don't want to do it anymore.",08Jul2017,2
51,"For many reasons, I have severe trust issues. My father was psychologically abusive. He was also extremely religious and a hardcore conspiracy theorist. He was accusing my mother of raping me and of being a ""blood-controlling witch"" ( yes I know). And I was still forced to live with him on odd weekends. His emotional manipulation made an nervous wreck out of 10 yo me. I was throwing up all the time even though I had no physical health problems. So that was pretty bad. The cognitive dissonance surrounding my father was fucking me up real bad at the time.

Jump some years in the future and I was in high school (secondary school in Canada), nearing graduation and I was severly depressed. I was on medication, but I stopped after a while because they fucked me up more than they helped. My grades started plummeting, I was missing at least 2 days each week, if not more. My mother kept receiving calls from school nearly every day and kept pushing me to go to school. So I lied to her and told her I was sick when I was too depressed. It was not hard to fake because I already looked like shit. Our relation started to deteriorate and part of me still resents her for what looked to me like wishful ignorance of the various cries for help I tried to send.

Jump to last year. My mother broke up with her boyfriend of about 10 years. I grew up with one of his kid and we were very close. We learned his father was sick for some time and never told anyone. My mother and I already knew he had a serious drinking problem. After they broke up, I went to my adoptive brother to tell him I was worried about his father. I was trying to convince my mom to leave him for years before she did. On his deathbed, surrounded by his children, he told them that it was my fault my mother left him, and that it was why he let himself die. Some days after the events, my mom tells me they're not allowing me to go to his funeral. I was completely heartbroken. I have never cried that much in my whole life. I was wailing for hours. In my mind, my brother had betrayed me. And he never had the respect for me or the guts to tell it to my face.

2016-2017 was a gap year for me and I was also struggling to find a job. My whole life, my grandfather was helping me financially. One day, he came back home from a trip to Mexico and he was really sick. I was the only grandkid to visit him in the hospital, even though I'm the only one who doesn't live near. I was very close to him to, I called him at least once a week and he always presented me as his ""son"" to other people. He was proud to be a father figure to me. Suddenly, he completely turned on me and cut all financial support. He told me I was just like my father, that I was arrogant, entitled and lazy.

So I don't feel like I can trust anybody. I have no idea where to go from there. How do I live that way? Where do I go from there? Sometimes, I don't even feel worthy of love like I'm a shit-magnet, how do I get past that?

61,"So I've been friends with this girl for over a decade now. We met when we were 9 years old and I instantly had a crush on her. Over the years we've crushed on each other and all that, but nothing ever happened because we were both too scared and nervous to do anything about it. But that's not important, what's important is she was a great friend. She was kind, caring, extremely polite, fun, intelligent, the full package basically. She was one of the best people I've ever met. We were probably closest when we were 15, she was a part of my friend group that I basically spent every single day with. One summer we practically lived together, we were always hanging out, watching movies, going swimming, it was the best. Now over the years she's changed, a lot. When we were at our closest, she wasn't the most popular girl, well liked, but not really one of the ""popular kids"". But then in her final year in high school she got a taste of popularity. She started acting differently, ditching our friend group to hang out with new people. Then in her freshman year in University she hit an all time low. Our group reunited for a trip to get the gang back together, and it was like she had died and been replaced by some knockoff. She was completely different, no longer was she this amazing person, she was terrible. She was extremely egotistical, extremely insecure, competitive, cold, fake, selfish, and rude at times. She still maintained the polite exterior, but she was completely different. She is like that now, she hangs out with sorority and fraternity people, she day drinks several times a week and spends almost every weekend in the clubs, she lives through social media, she spends a shit load of money all the time (despite her being a student), and worst of all, she just acts like her close group, who liked her when she was just the unpopular quirky girl, doesn't even exist. 

Unfortunately, I can't say I blame her. She never had a dad, and her mom always worked, so she pretty much lived half of her life at my other friends house (who is a part of the friend group). Because of this, she unfortunately seeks attention because she never got much as a kid. 

I'm so conflicted, I used to love this girl, I used to think that she was the best person ever, that if my friends all sticked together nothing would matter, and that we would all grow up and live our lives together as friends. I know that she was once a great person, this isn't revisionist. But I absolutely hate who she's become. I am genuinely upset being in her company in her current state. She is a young adult with her first taste of freedom, so I know this is usually an age that a lot of people go through phases, but how do I show her that she's forgetting what used to be a big part of her? Is that even possible for her to go back to the way she was? What should I do?",08Jul2017,1
62,"Throwaway bc ppl know me irl on my main account. 

When it came time for me to choose a college, i had two options: an expensive school I loved and a cheap school I didn't. Classic dilemma. I ended up choosing the expensive school for a lot of reasons, the main ones being that my parents told me they had found a way for it to work financially, and that I had no doubt in my mind I would be much happier there. 

My responsibilities in the plan were to:
-work during school year/summers
-use my AP credits (I have a lot) and take summer classes at a cheap, local school and transfer credits in order to graduate early
-look into off-campus housing for later years to save on room/board and meal plans
-take out subsidized loans of ~$6000/year

But I think my parents' half of the plan is falling apart, due to some unforeseen circumstances, and I am worried they won't be able to pay rent and tuition every month. We thought we would be able to move to a cheaper place but we can't. Plus I had to delay starting work until after this summer ends (and minimum wage is a lot lower where I go to college vs where I live in the summers). 

I really really want to go to this school and that's still the plan but from hearing my parents talk it's clear they don't really know how to pay for school and my mom is sounding like she regrets promising me that I could go. However I have not directly spoken to them about it, especially because there's been a lot of turmoil in the family due to an unexpected death. 

I don't like the idea of private loans at all. I will apply for some scholarships in the fall but I don't think my chances are good. I think college is a worthwhile investment in my future (I plan to study applied math and go to grad school) and the school where I'm going means a lot to me--it's in the state where I grew up, and i have a good support network of friends near there, unlike where I currently live, where I feel mostly alone. 

Sorry this is really long--any practical advice? And from an ethical standpoint, should I feel guilty for choosing this school? Is it more my parents responsibility that the finances aren't working out, or is it my responsibility for choosing a riskier path?",08Jul2017,1

80,"Dear reddit I write to you in desperation. 

I was talking my mom and my kids on the adventure of a lifetime, down to Chamonix and Italy for a month of climbing, hiking and exploring. I've been driving from Tromso, Norway and on the autobahn south of Hamburg the rear wheel flew of and hit the windshield of car going in the other direction. Thankfully nobody got hurt as I somehow managed to navigate the vehicle safely to the side of the motorway. Police informed me that everyone in the other car was fine, and not to worry. 

We called a tow company and five hours later we got towed to a workshop nearby, it being Sunday and everything closed, we decided to camp out in the parking lot.

Monday I talked to the workshop and they where very helpful and told me they would order all the parts needed and get me on the road as soon as possible. I talked to my insurance and they agreed to send us to a hotel in Hamburg while the RV was being repaired.

Wednesday the workshop called me back and told me that he was unable to get the axle, he had found everything else, but the Fiat specialist next door said that it's impossible to get a rear axle for a 1999 Fiat Ducato 230. Back to square one.

I called my travel insurance to ask if I'm entitled to a rental RV just so I can get us back on the road, they said that that would be possible if I only had a prepaid booking at our destination. I do not, it defies the freedom of a RV. 

So I contacted around 20 workshops, from Hamburg to Milan, and because of the language barrier most of them asked me to send an email. I have only received a response from three of them, all telling me their sorry they can't help, and with a recommendation to call Fiat Customer services or another workshop that was unable to help.

Thursday we had to leave Hamburg because of the G20 riots, our Hotel was right in the middle of it and my mom and kids felt unsafe. We traveled back to the RV to get some fresh clothes and to start calling people again. 

I called Fiat and they said it should be no problem to get the parts, it's a standard axle used by Peugeot Boxers, Citroen Jumpers and many more. They would find me a workshop and get back to me, but haven't heard anything from them yet. 

Friday I called my local RV workshop back in Norway and they confirmed that it should not be a problem to get the parts. They could order them and have them delivered to me, but it would take six weeks as their supplier is located in Germany.

The weekend coming up and figuring this could take some time to get sorted out, I asked my insurance if I could get town to a campsite (Suedsee-Camp) south of here, so that at least everyone would be comfortable while we wait, we have ran out of water and the chemical toilet in our RV has long been full. 
They agreed and said they would ordered me a tow truck for a RV and four passengers (13pm). So while we waited, we walked around the neighborhood and got a bit to eat, this is when I discovered that I left my debit card in the ticket machine in Hamburg, called my bank and got it blocked.

Around 20pm I was called by an tow-service asking me to confirm that we where three people and a car that needed to be town to the workshop we are currently located. I gave them the correct information (4 pax and a RV) and she told me that it was so late right now that they had no chance in getting us an English speaking driver, with a truck that big so late at night. are unable to help me. Ironically the tow truck that got us here is parked right in front of us.

Saturday (Right now), Still waiting for the tow truck and I'm about to give up. I feel cursed (don't believe in them) as everything I try seems to fail, the language barrier, opening hours and everything else is working against me, the whole trip started out with a Seagull shitting on my head, and since then everything has been Murphy. I'm the type of person that's not comfortable asking for help, but now I'm desperate.

**Are there any kind, German speaking souls out there, that can assist me with finding a workshop that can order parts and replace my back axle and get us back on the road?**

My hope is that I can have the RV town and fixed some where, some time next week during the next week, so that we can spend the few days we have left of our vacation on the adventure I originally planned.

**TL;DR: I need to get in touch with a English or Norwegian speaking workshop that can get the parts needed and that can replace the back axle on my Fiat Ducato 230 RV. I'm currently located 45km or hopefully soon 100km south of Hamburg and my insurance will get me towed to where ever needed. By serious request I have pictures of the damages, all the technical information of the vehicle and contact info of the works manager in the workshop I'm currently parked at.**

**update**: A kind passer by came and looked at the damages, he said it's an easy fix and if I understood him correctly (we spoke Normanylish) he's gonna ask his son who's a mechanic and ask if he can replace the axle. Also still waiting for tow truck.

83,"I wasn't sure where to post this, so I looked up molestation stories Reddit and they were mostly here, so sorry If this isn't the right place to post.

I'm 15F and I've remembered recently that I was almost molested by my female cousin who was months younger than me when I was 9 or 10 (maybe a little older). Like most people who had traumatic memories I can't remember every little detail. Some of the memory have been chopped off but I still remember how it came to that point. 
I just remember us being on the stairs and her wanting to do something from a music video (which was kissing) and we did I was the guy and she was the girl sitting on my lap. I didn't open my mouth or close my eyes and looking everywhere but at her and feeling sick. I can't remember how but I got down stairs away from her but she said if I didn't come back she'd stop liking me and not be my friend. And as a gullible lonely weird kid, I went back up and she took me to our older cousin's (who was babysitting us) room. Next thing I know, we're on the bed, she's on top of me, grinding herself on me with her hands rubbing my breast and my stomach hurts feeling like there's a butterfly tornado or something. Lucky, my older cousin came in when she did, asking us what are we doing and she says nothing while I just laid there and then went downstairs to watch tv. Then for the rest of that day I just played with cousins and just acted like nothing happened. Idk, why that was always like younger me, if something bad happened to me I'd usually come back home being upset for a little then be happy as if I had the best day ever.

But after months ago of remembering this, I feel stupid, blame myself and I have hatred for her. The very last time I'd be with her was a sleepover, she showed me her true colors. She didn't try anything with me but she and her brother were real dicks.

I'm antisocial and isolated in my house from other kids my age. But lately I've been babysitting my little cousins at my aunt's house and I'm not sure if I should say anything to my Anut she practically raised us both and I'm not sure what'll happen. I'm not sure what I'll get out of it, I know my cousin is not going to jail, I just feel this memory growing and I don't wanna hold it back until it's too late.
Idk what else to say, advice pls.",08Jul2017,2

87,"Apologies for the wall of text and horrible grammar/English in general. I'm currently on mobile and English isn't my first language. I hope it's not unreadable.

My roommate and I have been friends for almost ten years now. We met in highschool and became inseparable, as we had very similar interests, world views and humour. I (stupidly) never really thought of him as dangerous before, but looking back there always were huge red flags. So before going any further I must disclose that he has always had a deeply troubled relationship with his mother and struggled with severe depression and suicidal thoughts/conducts for as far as he or anyone who knows him can recall. More than a few times he talked about himself using terms like ""sociopath"" and, the worst part of all is that he actually confessed to killing his pet dog a few years ago after a girlfriend cheated on him, in order ""not to kill her or his own mother"" as he put it himself, which I dismissed thinking it couldn't be true and that he was just being ""edgy"". I really should have known, or at least known better than to stay friends with someone who showed antisocial tendencies so clearly. But then, we were only 15 or so and I became accustomed to his ways.
We became roommates a few years after I graduated (he dropped out and hasn't resumed his education) and things between us were mostly going well.
Two years into us sharing a flat, however, he entered what at first was a seemingly healthy relationship with someone who then got him into weed and soft opioids. More and more he started to retreat into a state I remembered from his worse depressive episodes. He and his partner were often getting into ugly fights over small things that got blown way out of proportion. Recently, in which I suspect was some sort of attempt to make up after an argument, he brought a kitten home from a friend's (his cat had kittens and was giving them away) and told me it was a present for his partner. I didn't really think much of it and left town for a week. When I came home, he wasn't there but had left me a voice message telling me he NEVER wanted to see our friend (the one he got the kitten from) again, that he had strangled the kitten and to please not tell anyone because he could go to jail. When I contacted said friend he said he hadn't even seen my roommate since the day he gave him the kitten. I'm writing this from a friend's place as I hit my head against the wall for not realizing what was always there. I don't know what to do, I'm both scared of him and for him, I don't know how to get him help or if he'd take it. I really don't think he would. I don't want to go back to our flat and be alone with him either, but I don't have any money to find a place of my own and move out. But most of all, I feel guilty for not doing something about that pet dog back then and now the kitten. 
I know I screwed up by not taking him seriously when he first confessed to killing. Writing this alone was very challenging because the details are all scrambled and I'm not sure if I left out something important. 
Please, what should I do?

91,"Hello, /r/advice. I hope this subreddit is appropriate for my post.

I don't see commitment phobia being discussed outside of romantic contexts and it has left me frustrated. Essentially, this particular issue of mine wants me to have my cake and eat it, too.

I want to have casual, no strings attached friendships where I'm able to spend time with a person (doing activities together such as watching films, playing games, eating at restaurants, and so on) without either of us feeling tied down with social obligations or emotional baggage. When one of us leaves, neither will feel sad.

I realise that it sounds like I'm looking for a friendship hookup of some sort.

.

The biggest problem here is that I want to be socially satisfied just like everybody else, but in doing so, several people eventually start referring to me as their ""friend,"" and quite frankly, I feel myself distancing more and more away from them when they say that. I think that they are ruining what we have by putting a label on it, even though I know their intentions are good. We simply have different goals. *(I'm apparently a very friendly person, and so people want to get closer despite my inner dialogue finding the other person nothing more than an acquaintance..)*

It sets me off in emotional distress, and in the end, I always cut them off, and resort to isolating myself (there is consistency in loneliness, unlike when others are around to influence your feelings and life).

The only site I found talking about commitment phobia in friendships mentioned that in order to feel close to people and accept them as friends, I need to be vulnerable with them by sharing personal details. The issue with that is that I don't feel motivated whatsoever in pursuing or keeping friendships. Why then should I put myself out like that?

(On the contrary, the only relationships I am interested in pursuing and keeping are romantic ones.)

.

**Am I alone in this? Are others also finding themselves wanting casual friendships? If I tell others about my lax intentions, will they think I'm crazy/weird? Should I keep this to myself?**

Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR: Don't want friendships, only ever interested in romantic relationships. Wondering if it is possible for others to accept this lifestyle of mine as trying to have friends only causes me distress and unhappiness, or if I should keep this phobia quiet and be more naturally distant towards others.**",08Jul2017,2
92,"Hey reddit, sorry in advance for a long post. This is a bit of a rant, and a lot of my life story since I genuinely want advice to be a better person.

I'm a guy in my second year of uni, and I've been having serious trouble managing my social interactions.

First of all, I have serious self-esteem issues, or so I believe. I can't even be sure of that, not sure how I'd get a second opinion on something like this, so keep in mind most of the stuff I write is still from my own perspective, I can't really measure if I'm biased, so sorry about that.

I used to weigh 130kg at 6ft4. That was about 2 years ago. I'm down to 104kg now and hit the gym 4 times a week, but I still have some problems. What some friend's interpret as narcissism (their words not mine) when I'm constantly fussing over appearance in mirrors and such. Some stuff I haven't told anyone else is that I've gotten something akin to bulimia, more then half of my meals end with me in the bathroom throwing up. I've taken to wearing foundation as well, which is something I feel pretty insecure about as a guy.

Might be linked to that, but I was a massive asshole in my high school time. I lived in a rural area, and got into a lot of fights. I hated being made fun of being overweight, so I just picked on others with my size. Looking back my ""friends"" at the time were a group of kids I basically tormented endlessly, and that weighs on me a little. After moving to a nicer private school, I stopped all of that stuff, but I genuinely despise who I was when I was younger, and I've tried to be a much better person since then. I've tried to keep my friend's needs in mind all the time, and for some reason I get irritated when they don't do the same for me even when they have no obligation to.

Point two, again this is self evaluation and it might just all be in my head, but I'm really afraid of missing out (fear of missing out). Though I've never shown or admitted it to them, I get really jealous and even resent it when my friends have fun without me. I genuinely want to support them, but this problem keeps souring my emotions when I think of them.

My friends claim I project a lot. This is something I'm confused on, since I didn't know what projecting was until I googled it, and I'm still not quite sure what it means, but one friends says I project on them a lot. 

Finally, I get really damn paranoid about my friends. I've caught myself thinking of them badly at times even when they've done nothing wrong, like suspecting they're talking about me behind my back and such. For instance, I constantly feel like my best friend treats me like shit when there are others around, when in reality there's no evidence to show I'm treated differently.

I get jealous of my friends interacting with others, and that usually results in me just being salty and ruining the mood when we're out, or trying to weasel my way into conversations or plans that they made amongst themselves. It's slowly ruining my relationships, and it's my main reason for posting today, because I don't want to lose my friendships because I'm an asshole.

Despite feeling like shit, I've tried to keep it bottled up and hidden. I've got a fake smile on all the time for when I'm upset, and I keep quiet for the most part aside from cracking jokes.

Thanks for reading. I could just be whinging and all of the above is perfectly normal, but it is ruining my relationships and I wAnt it to stop. In any case, sorry for the wall of text and any spelling mistakes. I'm posting this from my phone on a train home after having quite a few drinks.

TL;DR: have self esteem issues, fear of missing out, used to be a huge bully, paranoid about my friends disliking me for my possessive and jealous personality and hidden all under a blanket of sarcasm.",08Jul2017,4
93,"Just bought tickets from Viagogo to Ed Sheeran's concert next year. Problem was got charged a fortune. After trying for ages on amazons website for £89 tickets I started trying viagogo. 2 tickets listed at £179. No problem right? Wrong. Under the price in grey it said PER TICKET (which I missed at the time). 

Anyway after 20 attempts I finally got through to the final page and entered in the payment details. Then after payment went through a receipt showed £65 booking fee and obviously to my surprise a charge of £192 x 2 for the tickets (£384). Way more than I would pay. Hell festival tickets are cheaper than this! I just sent a complaint through to ask for a refund but T+C's say no refunds. They advise reselling on their website but I'd have to charge £200 per ticket just to recoup all the costs. Not sure who will pay that much per ticket. After reading about the company they don't have a good reputation. I'm wondering if I will ever get my money back or even get the tickets for that matter. I've also read that they sometimes take extra payments without the permission of the customer. Now I'm getting worried. Any have any experience with Viagogo or can anyone suggest how to get out of this? I think if I can't get my money back I'm going to have to try reselling *sigh*.

94,"When I was a kid at primary school (elementary for non-australians), my friend showed me this trick called 'Dead Man Walking'. Now, I don't remember all the steps, but here's what I can recall: 1. You get your friend/victim to close they're eyes. 2. You grab them by the wrists, and do something drastic with their arms (like shaking them, dramatically, or 'throwing' them around). 3. Click your fingers next to your victims ears. 4. Say a poem (something like: ""Dead man, dead man, come from your grave..."" I don't know how it ends). 5. Repeat steps 2-4 two more times, making sure your victim keeps they're eyes closed. 
Basically it results in your victims arms moving by themselves (like I dead man is controlling them). Kinda like when you push your hands really hard against a door frame for 30 seconds. 
I wanted to show this trick to my baby brother, but my problem is: I can't remember all the steps correctly, I can't remember the order in which you do the steps, and I can't remember the poem. So I figured: ""hey, the internet is a big place, surely someone will now about this trick."" 
Also, what is the type of trick called? Because I'm pretty sure it's not a tactile illusion, as tactile illusions make you believe you are feeling something when you're not. Or, convince you that you're not feeling something, when you are. This trick doesn't make you feel something that's not happening, as your arms actually ARE moving up and down, you're just not moving them yourself.

While I am writing this I just a bit calmed down from a huge panic attack that occurred to me 50 minutes ago due to my arachnophobia. Earlier this day I saw a mosquito so I freaked out (any insect gets me really going) but managed to vacuum it up after a sob story on a FaceTime with a friend. At 3am, I saw a decently large spider just barely crawl into a crack but I thought it was just me imaging things. At 5am, my cat spotted it on the ceiling and I froze and I started to have difficulties breathing, etc. I barely got myself to move to my phone to call a friend who was very much asleep who just told me to, ""Go to bed."" Not helpful. I then called my grandparents who are in a different timezone and it was day for them and after 15 minutes they convinced me to somehow get myself close enough with a vacuum tube to suck it up. So thinking that I didn't want to sleep in my own room, I went to my parents' room. Entering, behold, an even LARGER spider right above their bed.  I think I really lost it then. I fell and started to shake and sob on a call with my grandparents and I could feel my airway closing. A few minutes later they calmed me down and I managed to again, vacuum it in (I barely could do it it was so thick and bigger than any I've seen. It ran after the first attempt at vacuuming it off the ceiling and my heart nearly stopped.) So it's been a while and I've been trying to calm down but it's coming back in spikes and it's really hard.

103,"So, I have an online friend whom I used to play a videogame with for 2 years and he was sort of like a mentor to me. I added him on facebook and we used to chat sometimes.

Our countries are small so we do not need to travel alot. I have joined the tournament scene only recently so I have never met Tom in real life yet. May found out that me and Tom used to chat together, and I asked Tom if he will be present at the next tournament (this was in the past, the tournament already happened). Then May started messaging me to stop annoying her bf, she was insulting me, etc. Since then, I tried to contact Tom everywhere, but he was saying stuff like ""stop annoying me, just leave, I do not want to play anymore"". Then, he went to the tournament, and she went there with him to control him. She is very obsessive. I was not present at the tournament, I had something else that day. Matt knows Tom well because they have offline sessions together, May always goes with Tom and sits right next to him while they play. There are lots of things like that.. Matt told me that Tom told him many things, like that he had to give the passwords to all his social media to May, but not vice versa, that he cannot take his phone to work, he has to leave it at home with May.

*The job prospect is to work for the San Jose airport, as the protege of my step-dad.  He would groom me to take over for his retirement. The job pays about 80-90K a year.
The idea of having a mentor take me on and groom me is so enticing that I am seriously considering it. However, it would likely require me to go to court to be able to take my son out of state as my ex won't just let me go. 

I would also feel immense guilt depriving my son of having his dad around.

I'd also be moving to one of the most expensive places in the country to live.  I fear that a salary of 90K would equate to about 40K here in Northeast Ohio, and I wouldn't have the support out there that I have here in terms of folks to watch my son.  My mother and step-father are too old and sick to really watch him (he's 3).  Here I have my ex who will take him anytime I ask, and his mother, who will take him anytime I ask and overnight too.

There are so many things to consider and I am honestly lost. I could use some help sorting things out and making a decision.

108,"Hello,

So I am posting this with hopes of getting some advice and motivation.

I am a 24 years old male. Last 5-6 years have been very tough for my family - lost my grandparents, who raised me, and my mom has been basically unemployed for the last 5 years or so. My dad is an alcoholic, who hasn't been living with us since I was 5. I have a brother who is living with his girlfriend in another town.

So it is basically me and my mom living in our house in a very small town. For the last 4 years we were supporting ourselves mainly with the money I was making from remote IT jobs. Recently I got a position at a big IT company - I commute daily for about 2 hours. We have had some real tough moments and we still do, however my main concern is the fact my mom does not do much more then browsing the net, watching sports on TV and chain smoking. She does not clean, rarely cooks, and she barely ever goes out. The only time she spends out is doing some gardening.

I love my mom and would do everything for her - I have no personal life, whenever I have some free time off work, aside from trying to rest a bit, I try to clean at home and just talk with her, because she barely has any social contacts at this point. It is breaking my heart seeing how she is wasting her time - she used to have a nice career and a rather high profile position, but some people screwed her over and she lost her career. I have been trying to find a way out of this situation for years, I had some deep depressive episodes due to all that. I know that my success would make her happy and I am trying my best to provide her with financial security, but I have had my tough moments as well -I owe money to friends/ex employer, combine that with the lack of personal life, and it really is not the best picture.

What I  am asking for is just some support and motivation.. Do you think there are some options that my mom could get more social, etc? We live in a very small town, she knows everyone around and does not want to interact with people around. She loses it at times, because she realizes very well how shitty the current situation is, but she refuses to move to another town and basically relies on me to cover everything.

It should be fine, since I think I did deserve to be reprimanded for being rude and for basically refusing to do some tasks (this, I can't deny, and that part is my fault) and for not realizing that she ultimately determines whether my work is satisfactory or not, and that I let my anxiety and pressure on myself affect my work. But even though I apologized profusely and sincerely and acknowledged that I was being unprofessional and immature, when I tried to explain my feelings of frustration to her it all blew up.

She is incredibly self-important, and also previously spent a good 20 minutes or so chewing out another intern for an unspecified reason. Our ""talk"" lasted an hour, and I was unable to stop crying for several hours after, during which she pulled in the coordinator of my program and explained the situation very calmly to her, taking a forgiving stance toward me and very much being the ""bigger person."" But the whole time I felt strangely like I had been gaslighted, and the gaslighter had the upper hand with a supposedly neutral party. She had always acted more like a friend or mentor than a boss, and in that way made me want to work very hard on this project--that, combined with my drive to excel in my only career opportunity in undergrad and since graduating (I've been here for almost 2 years now), pushed me over the edge. Yet she acts like it was entirely my fault for becoming too invested. I feel like I can't explain or don't know exactly why, but I feel emotionally manipulated, especially since she constantly makes a point of saying how much she has done for me and I feel like she holds it over my head, which is another factor in why I pushed myself to work so hard. When I tried to explain myself to her and my program coordinator I came off as defensive and rude, because I got frustrated at my inability to explain how I felt. 

TL;DR I think I might have ruined my post-undergrad job and recommendation letter opportunities but I have to continue until my internship is complete in September. The rest of the department (except the head) thinks the incident was basically harassment, but I don't want to kick up a fuss since I don't have a strong case or evidence, especially since some of the fault is mine. Mostly, I'm just concerned that I screwed myself out of a good situation and ruined further permanent job prospects in that same institution. also, I'm humiliated that I basically sobbed all over the office for several hours.

132,"he is saying that i am intending to operate a ponzi scheme and that i am intending to violate sec rules, his intent is to ruin my reputation.

prior to my visiting an attorney, it is my intent to educate myself about what my options are first.

the core of my issue is that i am a trading system developer, and this man has done what many do, they ask me to share with them my software, and when i refuse to share my software with them, they blacklist me and then slander me, and they kick me out of forums.

#edit: i was not actually expecting mr senwell to show up here in this forum and to speak on his behalf, but he did... no worries...

i do want to say that he is accusing me of operating a ponzi operation, this means that he is accusing me of being a thief, he is accusing me of doing what bernie madoff did and got 150 years prison for it...

to accuse a trader of operating a ponzi scheme is probably the most severe accusation that can made against a trader..

this accusation has no foundation, it is a fabricated lie, mr senwell is entirely making up this ponzi stuff about me... i never ever said one word that would ever cause me to be confused with someone that operates a ponzi scheme... this is the worst thing that can be said about a trader.

he has also accused me of trying to extort a bribe out of him, again this is entirely a fabricated lie...

when i spoke to mr senwell on the phone for two hours and twenty two minutes, i described to him about how i would like to form a team and that my rough draft plan is that my team would call on lawyers to look for investment capital, and he assured me that you need a series 3 or series 7 license, something like that, to solicit funds for a forex trading fund... my response to this was that the first thing that i really need is some basic operating capital and a bit of capital for some hardware in order that i can fully automate this thing... perhaps he is right that there are licensing requirements to solicit funds for a forex trading group, but i dont think that i need a license to ask for some basic operating capital to get this thing up to the starting gate.

i never once even hinted that if he didnt give me money that i would do anything to cause any harm or discomfort to him..

he later moved in for the kill during our conversation and he described to me that he has been talking to a goldman sachs man about my project, but that this goldman sachs guy would want to see my code first..

his entire purpose was to make me believe that he was my friend and that he was watching my back and that he was setting up deals that would bring me success, while his real goal was to put his dirty hands onto my code, after which i would surely never hear from him again.

and so when i came into another subreddit a coupld of days after our phone call, he posted after me something about ""WHO UNSHADOWBANNED THE TROLL""?

hint: the reason that he calls me a troll is because i refused to share my code with him, lol..

#mr senwell has falsely accused me of operating a ponzi scheme.

#mr senwell has falsely accused me of attempting to extort money from him.

the purpose of this thread is to get a little bit of prelim legwork done, prior to my taking this to an attorney, but my current needs regarding this project is to find some operating capital and a bit of capital to purchase some new hardware.

137,"I got into a car accident last night and I'm trying to figure out who's at fault. I filed a claim with my insurance company and with the other driver's insurance company. At the time of the accident, I felt the other driver was at fault, but I understand that most insurance companies will try to prove that the other driver is at fault. Here are the facts:

-I was heading northbound on a street that was a 4-lane, one-way street.

-I was in the 2nd lane from the left.

-We were at a right light.

-When the light turned green, I accelerated at a safe pace.

-A truck to my right quickly accelerated, changed lanes with no blinker and available space, and crossed from the 3rd lane into the 2nd resulting in his left rear colliding with my front passenger.

It seemed like she missed her turn and was trying to go left onto another street when we were all going straight on the one-way street.

Who was at fault? Any tips on working through this with the insurance companies?

I've been married for a year, and moved to New England with my then fiancé two years ago. We moved up here because I was starting a double masters program in Mental Health Counseling, and a divinity degree (to be a pastor of a church). Our families do not live remotely close to us. We're from the mid-west and the south.



Since moving, particularly the last year, my wife has been struggling with depression BAD. She's got 0 close friends, and cries almost every night all night when she gets home from work, and frequently says she hates her life and can't live here. (She works at a big bank in a major city with a good job, just with a long commute--about an hour and 20 minutes one way). She begs me to move; she's determined that this place is awful and she cannot be happy living here. It's extremely hard to see her so miserable every day. She's told me she's at the point where she cannot commit to giving me 3 months to go through counseling and psychiatry because it feels like she's dying, every day. In the past, I haven't had much success motivating her to go through with therapy/finding a closer job/psychiatry/developing a support network outside of myself.

Because of the demands of supporting her everyday, I'm essentially stuck between being a good husband or a good student. She's obviously my priority. I'm pretty driven and able to keep up with my classes, but it's killing her.  We're almost to the point where we need to move away from here as soon as possible in order to be closer to family. It's just becoming too much for me to try and support her, taking care of everything around the house, and do these degrees. 

I need advice on how to support us after this. My undergraduate degree was communication studies as a perfect stepping stone to counseling (social psych) and a vocation of pastoring (public speaking/rhetoric side of it). If we move, I will essentially be throwing away the past two years that I've been working for, and won't be able to continue as a professional in the mental health field. I guess I'm just lost as how to even begin switching career paths at this point, because moving will close the doors I'm currently walking through (scholarships and I would have to start my degree programs over. most graduate psych programs don't accept transferable credits from other programs).

Sex isn't everything to me, but I really don't want to be a virgin my whole life. And I don't know if she'd be happy if I did it with someone else. She says she's going to try to overcome it, because she had a traumatic experience, but what do I do if she can't? I don't want to lose her but I have to consider my own wants.",08Jul2017,2
185,"I live in a three story apartment. I live on the second floor. The person below me has been complaining about my dog making too much noise when he runs. My dog weighs 10 pounds and he doesn't actually run around that often, he's lazy and only plays for a few minutes at a time. 
Well last night my neighbor below me reported me to our apartment cop and they reported it to the office. I don't think we're being noisey. The person above me also has a dog and I hear them sometimes but it doesn't bother me bc I realize that the person above me will sometimes generate noise. 
My first idea is that the neighbor below me is being a little sensitive. And we live in an older building so the floor squeaks

Is there anything I can do to fight this? I don't want my dog (or myself) to be kicked out bc the person below me if being hypersensitive.
Any advice helps thank you

186,"Well to start this off... its technically not work but at the same time it is. At the moment im attending a military school. This military school has a summer camp every year, and people who come to school here are chosen to be instructors for the summer camp as a job. Essentially they are like Drill Instructors. This military school is based on the USMC. So as you can probably tell I was chosen to be a cadet instructor from now on known as CI. Me and about 8 other people were chosen to be CI's for our company. Because this is a military oriented camp, we are expected to yell at them and be harsh. Basically like boot camp for the marine corps, but on a lesser scale. Now here is where the problem comes in, I do my job, supervising the campers and make sure they're safe and having fun, occasionally raising my voice and yelling when I have to, especially when they are disobeying certain orders. But the other CI's have a different perspective on how to treat them, they are usually constafntly yelling at them and from what I see, making the campers hate this place more and more. Now I understand that USMC boot camp has DI's and they are meant to yell and get you prepared for whats out there, but this isnt boot camp, it is a summer camp that has many activities that campers are MEANT to enjoy. And if I havent mentioned it already, im 15, and other CI's range from 14-17. Because im not yelling all the time, and allow the campers from my viewpoint have fun, they are always criticizing me, saying I dont do anything, and basically bullying me. And to add on to that, we have a set timeframe from where we work at. As follows: We all wake up at 6AM, do Physical Training (Pushups, stretches, run, etc) and then we start with activities ranging from paintball, swimming to doing the obstacle course. And basically, we have 3-5 CI's working in the morning from 8AM-2PM, and then switch off, where morning people take a break for the DI, and afternoon people start working. Well, for some reason according to them because ""I dont do shit"" I have to do extra work in the afternoon which I usually dont have a problem doing, but its just starting to get annoying and I dont know how to deal with this situation where they are always bullying me (including physical contact) and criticizing me all the time. Please help.",08Jul2017,1
187,"Male 21.

I Googled this issue, and I can't seem to find anything on it, so I was hoping someone on here might have had the same experience or may just have some advice for me.

As a preface, I'm a pretty confident guy, with no real issues talking to women. I can go out to a bar and have plenty of fun talking to strangers or otherwise socializing, also when conversations get sexually charged, and I can't remember I've felt uncomfortable in those situations since I was 17 or so. I've thought about it a lot, and I really don't think a lack of confidence is the issue, especially after 5 beers. If it is, it would have to be a very subconscious thing going on. 

Anyway, I would say I usually have a pretty healthy, normal sex drive. When I'm alone I can definitely have days where I think ""oh man, I could use some sex."" But that sex drive disappears completely when I'm out on the town. I talk to a girl, and though I'm completely comfortable in that situation, I just end up extremely bored. I've given up on some really sweet women over the past years, simply because, in the situation, I'd much rather just be at home with a book and a cup of tea. The next morning I wake up and regret it vehemently. I think to myself: ""what the fuck were you thinking, /u/ThrowMeAway743273? Why on earth did you just up and leave like that?"" And for the rest of the day, my thoughts keep coming back to the sex I might have had.

I hope I don't sound braggadocios with me leaving women I might have had a chance with and all; it's absolutely not the intention to brag. This is a real issue, that I feel has gotten worse over the years, to the point now where I haven't had sex in a really long time. I've even begun to wonder if it might harm my love life in the long run, because I never really get to know anyone. I just talk to them for 10 minutes, get bored, and either go back to my friends or go home. Am I doing something wrong or am I just weird?",08Jul2017,3
188,"I met my SO in college. We got together soon after and moved to another state. We were happy there, but struggling financially. After awhile, my parents began to assist us financially, and we were doing better but I couldn't rely on them forever so I stopped accepting as much help. After awhile, they made us an offer: They said they'd break our lease (which was a huge fee) and let us move back to my hometown with them. They promised us 2 things:

1. They wouldn't charge us rent
2. They wouldn't make any attempt to treat us like children or control our lives. We were free to do as we please, as long as we helped out around the house. (We're in our early 20s and have lived on our own for the last few years)

They didn't go back on their first promise (though, they ask for help with bills that have gone up because of us, which is reasonable and I don't mind) however, the second promise they have just thrown away. 

We are now micromanaged by them. Everything we do is scrutinized and if we do anything they don't approve of, it leads to house-wide arguments and screaming at us. My relationship with my SO is strained harder than it ever was when we were just barely scraping by.

I'm just sick of living here with my parents. I've tried to save as much money as I can, as I'm working full time, but I don't think I can stay here much longer. I'm in the deepest depression I think I've ever been in, and this place is not good for my SO. 

Ideally, I want to move to another state. I was living a couple of states away when we were scraping by, and I was incredibly happy. 

My issue is that I have no idea how to go about leaving. I have a job here that isn't transferable. I have too many bills/loan repayments to take any time off to figure this out, so my time is already limited. The amount of money I'm making is enough to save just a tiny bit every time, but at this rate we'll be here another year or two. (We've been here only 5 months, and I already feel this way.) I just don't know how to leave. Speaking to my parents leads to more yelling. I don't really have any friends here that can help me with this either.

Note: Neither me nor my SO finished our degrees due to financial issues so finding a job in our respective fields is off the table until we're able to afford to do so. My SO has been looking into going to the community college in my hometown, but that'd be another thing keeping us here. My goal is to get us both away from here as soon as I possibly can...

Has anyone else ever been in this situation? Can anyone offer me advice? I just feel lost.",08Jul2017,2
190,Last night I had the worst experience of my life. I had smoked a small bowl from a bong which I hate using. I wasn't really feeling it but I didn't do anymore except a few hits of a joint. Later in the night I ran into some people I knew a bit and they had some weed. I took two bong hits and pretty much everyone else did the same. Next thing I knew I was on the ground and had hit my head. I was hallucinating and having a panic attack because I thought I was dying. I felt like it was never going to end and that I was trapped in my personal hell. I made my friend call me an ambulance because I was so paranoid. I get a minor concussion but otherwise fine. Feeling so fucking embarrassed and wanted to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar with greening out like that.,08Jul2017,1

196,"How can you keep going with life, when you know that thousands upon thousands are suffering? That people are dying from horrible diseases, enduring wars, terrorism etc.

To top it all off, if there isn't murder happening somewhere, there's rape, torture all going on in the world. 

How do you keep going with all the horrors going on?

I know some people might roll their eyes at this post, but I was reading a thread, about the creepiest things on the internet that you can still see - most of it was the torture of both humans and animals. 

It just brought me out of my 'bubble' - if you know what I mean. Like waking up from a sleep, in a way.

201,"Hi. So I had a rocky 6 dates with this guy, suffice it to say it ended poorly, stooping to the point I cut 2 of his tires and knifed ft long deep cut in his vehicle because he blocked me after I verbally attacked him thru text cuz he was trying to back out of seeing me that weekend. I went off on him and texted ""I love you so much despite the fact you're an ugly worthless fucker and your ex didn't want your weak dick, lol you are so full of yourself and delusional"" among other things and he said ""blocking you now"" He was apparently never that into me in my eyes and played me. 


Well he made his FB friends(we were never added cuz I don't have FB)  private after that event. I'm not sure if it was the event or that some of his friends there told him I was contacting them to tell him he had STDs he was spreading(could it have been the tire incident alone? I'm hopeful) I'm just very sorry for doing all this. I don't manage anger well. I'm turn very ratchet when someone deeply hurts me or someone I care about. 

But his FB still shows an event he's attending. It's a music festival in his city that's 2 hours away from my city. It's not really obscure but it's certainly not a big, well known fest and I don't think it seems like the kind of music I like. But I do like that music and I'll have fun there I think. There will be thousands of people I think like 5000. So the chances are not solid I'll see him.  I told him when we met I've been to festival in his city (but it's a really big festival) she could go to that one next week but it's like 10s of thousands and much bigger. 


Is it okay to go? Will he see me and what will be his thoughts. I really wanna go. Just grab someone and have him see me because I look super beautiful now  with my  new hair. It's been over a month since the tire incident/our fall out. Please I really wanna go? ",08Jul2017,0
202,"There is someone where I work at that I really want to become friends with. 

I generally know how to maintain a conversation but the thing is:

 - we only work 1 time a week at the same time (we don't finish at the same time either + our jobs aren't really connected and we   barely have a chance to speak to each other. We can mainly just see each other).

I am trying to find a way to start a conversation but there is basically no time and place for it. Am I doing something wrong? / Is there something I could do better? / What can I do to make something happen? At this pace I feel like it is gonna take years and we both might not even have the same job in that time (it is a part time job).

206,"So, I am 23 years old guy and started working in Boxboro, Mass. I have been studying in Texas at Texas A&amp;M and I am here for my coop till Dec 2017. I live in Lowell, MA and commute through carpool daily. Though it seems cheap, its uncomfortable and I dont have any control over my schedule. I have been here for just a month, and kind of feel lonely here. I thought to join gym or seek some sports but literally, even the smallest convenience store is like 1.5 miles away, forget gym and other things. This place is quite populated and everyone has a car. I am not able to decide what to do. Shall I buy a car? I have to go back to Texas in January for a semester and dont want to spend much, so is it still recommended? I earn good and have no saving yet as most of the money has gone in setting things up here.
I have a good time in the office but once I reach home I cant find anything to do. This place looks very dull. What do I do? I have no friends here. Most of the people in my office are over 30 and have a family. I want to do so many things but everything spirals down to lack of mode of transport. Is spending 2000 or so on a car recommended? Is there any other way to get out of my dilemma? I may already be looking confused to y'all but nevermind. Thanks for suggestions!",08Jul2017,1
