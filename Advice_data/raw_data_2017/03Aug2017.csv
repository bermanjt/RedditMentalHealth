0,"I'm pretty embarrassed to even be talking about this, but I need input. I've tried asking close friends about this, but the topic is awkward. 

In a couple of months, I'm going to see an old friend of mine from college. The last time they saw me, I was very skinny. Now, due to health issues I still have no control over, I have gained a large amount of weight. 

While I've talked to my friend consistently over these years, we haven't actually seen each other in 10 years. Now I'm about to show up, looking like a totally different person. Do I say anything? Do I warn them? I don't see anyone from my past because I'm so ashamed of how I look, but I have to go to this event. I feel ridiculous asking about this. Any input would be wonderful.  

Thanks for taking the time. ",03Aug2017,51
2,"This is not a guy who is just kind of racist, he is openly racist. I've heard him say tons of terrible stuff. Some examples ""Don't get me wrong, black people are good for some things, like if you need someone to steal you some cheap furniture, but I wouldn't want them near my family."" ""There's one black guy in this neighborhood who won the lottery, I don't know why they haven't lynched him yet."" When one Korean family moved into his neighborhood he complained about how it was ""getting diverse as fuck out here."" You get the picture. 

He also owns 104 guns. Literally 104. He constantly talks about protecting his house, etc, in a way that sounds like he fetishes the idea of shooting someone. 

Is there anything I can do? Is there a process by which I can give a bad reference or something? This is a person who 100% should never be given cop's power. ",03Aug2017,0
3,"I'm worried about being a manipulative person and I want to know how to stop.

I started a group chat with a few other people around three weeks ago and I've done nothing but second-guess everything I say and I'm starting to think maybe I ought to really not have started it. I told them when I asked them if they wanted to join that they didn't have to since they aren't for everyone, but I'm still worried they felt some kind of obligation because I asked. I've been trying to talk to them about their interests and not mine but sometimes I end up derailing it into something that happened to me anyway. I'm worried that if they want to stop being there they'll stay anyway and feel trapped. I don't know how to tell them they can leave any time without sounding mean (a lot of them are really anxious and would take it like I'm telling them to leave), or like I'm manipulating them into staying by saying they can leave.

In the past if I've ever felt like I'm making someone uncomfortable to leave, I've just blocked them without a word. I know that's really awful but I don't know what else to do. I can't *ask* them if they feel trapped, that's definitely manipulative. And feeling like I make someone feel like they can't leave even if they want to is too horrible to keep up with, so I just blocked them. I apologized to them later because it really wasn't their fault, but I also told them that it would be best if we didn't start talking again, because I don't want to feel like I'm manipulating them into starting a relationship with me again. Especially if I was right the first time. 
Sometimes I block people without saying anything because I find out they associate with other people who I know do nasty things, and I don't want to be around anyone who allows that. I should probably try to figure out if they know about it, but I'm afraid that if I tell them or ask them about it it's like I'm telling them who they're ""allowed"" to be around. So I just block them without saying anything most of the time. But sometimes I don't and ask why they're around people who do those things...and then block them. Which really is not good.

Sometimes in the past I've left groups or people for petty reasons, but it was really because of another reason. Like, I had an argument with my grandfather once and stopped speaking to him but the reason I didn't want to speak with him was because he was racist. But instead of saying so, I just used the argument as the reason. Once I left a different group chat over something I knew was a misunderstanding but I wanted to leave because the things they said sometimes mightily creeped me out. But instead of saying so I used the misunderstanding to leave. That's manipulative and dishonest. It's a bad habit. It probably left them puzzled. Unfortunately, both times they ended up convincing me to come back and both times the issue came out eventually - explosively. I called him out for being a racist and we had a big fight over it, and the other group finally made me sure the creepy things they were saying were indeed creepy (they were *very* creepy) and I called them out on that too. 

The second situation was worse, because the things they were saying were so bad that they made me suicidal, and what's worse, I told them so. And I told other people. That was wrong, even if what they were doing was wrong. It was true, but me telling them so was a direct attempt to try to make them see how wrong the thing was and how it could affect people and to lash out at them for doing it. And if you can do it for a good reason you can do it for a bad one. 

I come from people who are manipulative and dishonest and steal from each other constantly. I was raised by that in both nature and nurture, but I don't want to be like them. I left them a long time ago for that reason. But I'm worried I can't. I don't have any positive influences in my life and I don't even have anyone who'd tell me I'm doing something wrong, how am I supposed to be better than them? Is it possible to get out of that cycle?

I just end up second-guessing everything I say or do and I'm getting paranoid about it. And I've definitely done manipulative things, there's no question. How can I stop doing them but at the same time know when I'm *not* being manipulative?",03Aug2017,2

12,"So I'm going to be a college freshman, and at orientation I signed up for Spanish 3011, or Advanced Spanish. At my high school, I took Spanish 1003 and 1004 through CIS courses (at the same college) and passed with high marks (A- and B+, respectively.) 

Now I'm looking through the college's site, and it reccomends 2002 as the course after the ones I took in high school. However, talking over with my resident counselor and orientation guide, based on my placement test and grades, 3011 is in fact the right starting place.

Took a 200 question vocab quizlet online for Span 2002 and got maybe 80/200.

14,"So I've been with this small (around 25 employees) company for two years now.  About one month ago my girlfriend and I decided to buy one-way tickets to New Zealand and live there for a year.  Our flight will be at the end end of this month so I will be putting in the two-week notice at the end of next week.

Here's where the hesitation comes in.  My boss is very unpredictable.  We've had three people within the last year put in their two-week notice, then my boss flips out and tells them to leave on the spot.

It has really taken a toll on our relationship and its come down to us being distant and arguing constantly. I want my baby girl to get better but I feel like I'm hindering her healing by constantly being involved in her life. 

Should I give her space to grow and heal or should I stay by her side? I just really need an outside opinion or even just someone to talk to. It's affecting my life in almost every aspect to the point where I can't function at work or around my family. ",03Aug2017,3
16,"I'm approaching my senior year of High School. All three of my years i've been a pretty quiet guy, keeping to myself a lot of the times. By no means am I socially awkward, or have no friends. I have a decent amount of friends, but i'm never really invited to do anything with anyone. I don't do sports or do clubs through the school, so it's hard to get close with people that way. Nothing I do is particularly interesting that would make me approachable by others. I play the guitar, drums, and bass guitar, but no one's really interested in things like that so I just keep it to myself. It just kind of bums me out to think about how boring my last three years of high school have been. I want to change that for my last year. How can I? ",03Aug2017,2
17,"I'm using a throwaway, for obvious reasons. 

So, I'm a 19 year old university dropout with no prospects in life who has had the misfortune of living with my grandmother for the past 4 months. Since my parents wouldn't let me move back in with them after I left the dorms, they made me stay with Nana, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. I am basically her caretaker, and I wish I wasn't because she's a giant bitch. 

I have no job at the moment, because I only applied to one store that I worked for during the holiday season because they said that they were hiring permanent associates for back to school *and* they had specifically approached me about working there again. School starts in eight days in my state. Something's telling me I'm not getting the job. Plus, with community college classes coming up, I probably won't have time to work at all. 

I do get a (small) allowance from my mom for doing what I do, but due to the events of this year (i.e, one of the family cars flipping and being totaled in a hit an run, and all the therapy for the family's numerous mental health issues, most notably mine), we're running very tight on money, and she can no longer freely provide the money.

Nana is very well off. She's in a position where she could easily be assisting us financially, but she's too inconsiderate of the people around her to even do anything. And I know what you're thinking, ""She has Alzheimer's, give her a break,"" or ""You should have more compassion for your family,"" but the thing is, she was a total cunt before she started losing her mind. She was *very* abusive to my mother as a child, which in turn led to my mother abusing me, which led to my serious mental health problems. I guess you could say I have some unresolved grievances. Plus she's always been about mind games. I can't tell how much of her dementia is authentic and how much is feigned by her to play dumb. She's also been very cheap and would never spare a dime for any of her kids or grandchildren without being prompted by someone else. 

One day, she's supposed to move back in with my mother and my family and I'm supposed to come with her. Due to troubles finding a contractor who is willing to add on to my family's house, that day is a mystery. 

My mom promised me that she would reimburse me for all the torment I face because of Nana. (For example, her banging on my door trying to get me to leave and threatening to call the police on me if I don't leave, even though I actually can't due to the orders of every single one of her doctors. It takes a toll.) Something like 1,000 dollars a month. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. 

Only problem is, she won't give me any of the money until we've moved in to her house. That's a way of preventing me from leaving Nana's place by myself and forcing my mom to hire a caretaker to live with her. 

So, I'm broke with no chance of employment, and no money to be coming anytime soon. What's a person to do?

I took a picture of her credit card and used the information to buy some items for myself (really frivolous things, too) last night. I don't really feel guilty about it, because in my eyes, she deserves it, and it's not even that bad. I only spent like 175 dollars, when compared with the enormous fortune she has, is nothing. 

However, it all came to a halt. I was trying to order UberEATS today when Uber wouldn't accept the card. I'm fearing the worst, that the card company classified my purchases as uncharacteristic, because she *never* makes online purchases. 

I'm really scared because my mother had already warned me not to do this, and my dumb ass went and did it anyway, and worst case scenario, I'm going to have to pay for it, which I don't exactly have the means to do. 

Before you think about calling me a terrible person for what I did, I advise you to keep your judgments to yourself. I know what I did was wrong, and I fear even telling my friends in fear of them thinking I hit a new low. 

So, any advice?",03Aug2017,0
18,"Hi, I am trying to regain my families trust before I finish school and move out.

In the past I have:

Stolen money, and alcohol. Lied about where I was, (was out with friends). Smoked for two years, admitted to them I smoked, and quit cold turkey, (haven't smoked since). Lied to them on many occasions.

I got counselling a few months ago, and worked on my impulsive tendencies. I've been practicing slowing down, and deciding moment to moment if what I am doing is going to put me on the path to being who I want to be.

It's been a few months since I've done anything like this, and things have been better and better for our family. However, my parents clearly don't trust me still. I understand why and don't blame them, and I feel guilty still about what I've done.

I've been asking about staying with a friend who lives an hour away, for a couple weeks during the summer. This is a good kid who doesn't do any drugs or drink. I genuinely just want to be with a good friend, and get out of the town I live in for a little while. My girlfriend lives there, and I also want to see her, but she won't be in town for more than a few days during the time I am there.

My parents think I'm trying to get outta there sight for a while and get up to no good. They think that I want to hangout with my friend because I will have more freedom. This is true to an extent, he lives near the city, and we could go into town and do fun things. I don't plan on doing anything bad. And I also don't plan on seeing my girlfriend very much as she will be gone.

I've told them this and they aren't very convinced.

I just want my family to trust me. I know that takes time, but I feel like I am always a pain to them. Not sure what to do, or how to rebuild this. They really just don't trust me at all. (I know why they don't, and I am more than sorry about it. I just want them to trust me).

Thanks.",03Aug2017,1
19,"I'll start off by saying I'm not sure how long this will be but I apologize if its excessive, I'm pretty worked up emotionally but would really appreciate any advice you all have for me. 

Background- I'm in my second year of college, I lost a couple scholarships this last year and because of that I needed to take out a loan to make up for the deficit.

Well I have been looking for someone to cosign that very loan for a while. The problem is that as far as I can tell my family are almost all unable to help me. Parents both have bad credit and aren't able to cosign, one grandparent refuses (which I totally respect), and I'm not left with many options after that. I'll be talking to my other grandparents within the next 24 hours to ask if they are willing to cosign for me but if that doesn't go through then realistically I'm screwed. I will have enough in a savings account to afford tuition for this semester but not rent/bills/food as well an I can't very well attend college while homeless and starving.

I'm currently working 2 jobs and will continue to do so during the school year, my monthly expenses total around 500$ to keep me alive. I can't give a good estimation of monthly earnings because I don't know what my hours will be or what my base pay for a job that I will start soon will be. I've started considering taking second semester off as a break (If I can manage to stick around that long) to give me a chance to save up some money for the next fall semester but that is the LAST thing I want to do because my education means so much to me.

What I'm here to ask you is if anyone has some advice for me moving forward. I know to try and talk to my financial aid office and have done so already. But in reality tuition money is due in just under 2 weeks and I'm thinking it will be very unlikely they can do anything to help me at this point. If you have any suggestions about who to talk to, how to make some extra money on the side, or what to do in general I thank you for them. ",03Aug2017,1

I'm trying to order a few new things and the revision payment thing keeps popping up.  I keep checking my card and it says I have the amount I *just* put it on it a few hours ago, so I don't understand.  I talked to a customer service rep and they said to contact my bank.

27,"I spend so much time organizing my life and writing everything down. I have lots of stuff planned for 2018 already and spend almost a half hour a day writing things down in my calendar of every single thing I should do, maybe do, remember, consider, think about and reorganizing it all and adding reminders. I spend maybe 4 hours a week doing this.

On top of this, I write down every piece of valuable information I get or almost anything new that I learn. My hands are always covered with notes, my phone and my ipod are always full of memos, I have papers in my pockets every day with interesting stuff I encountered etc.

Then I organize all of the stuff I find interesting like an interesting video, wikipedia page or news article into bookmarks on my computer into folders with many layers of sub folders.

On the one hand it's good because I never forget anything, I never miss an event, I never can't remember some certain detail because I have it all written down.

29,"I took a driving test around 10:30 am here in California today and it started off fine. I was nervous, so I did make mistakes that the examiner marked down which I understand why. However, through the test the examiner was vocally sighing and exhaling loudly, and also whispering things about what was happening, like little expressions oh my god or what? 

1 scenario was a vehicle coming to almost a complete stop to turn and she said what is this car doing? And asked me to turn into the RIGHT lane while pointing to the LEFT lane. I was extremely confused, she raised her voice and said go over there! There was also a double yellow line which I couldn't cross to pass the vehicle in front of me but she insisted I do it because I feel like she was just annoyed already. So I turned into the left lane like she said. 

For lane switching I turned on my blinker, looked at mirror and behind for the blind spot and switched lanes, and then turned off blinker every single time, but she managed to mark that I did not do that. 

I know there are things I can improve on, and I had 1 actual situation I didn't do correctly ( turning right with bike lanes ), but a lot of what I was marked on was either the examiner not paying attention? or her raising her voice and causing me to be even more tense, or other vehicles caused me to be in a bad or confusing situation ( me having to come to a complete stop, waiting a second before continuing, while the car who got there second went first as I started going because they did a rolling stop ).

33,"So a while ago, a guy (let's call him Joe) started messaging me on Facebook. He was asking me questions about my workplace. This is normal because I work for a museum. 

I answered his questions and he sent me a friend request. I thought there was no harm in accepting it. The guy  has a wife and has kids. Seemed to be genuinely interested in local history. 

Things were ok at first. Occasionally he'd tell me about historical buildings in our city he likes and ask about what exhibits we have coming up. Totally ok and appropriate. 

Then things started to get a little weird. He starred commenting on all my profile pictures. Things like your pretty, your beautiful, I like your smile. That made me a little uncomfortable. I never been comfortable with men other than the man I'm with telling me I'm pretty, or beautiful. I'm 28 and I'm married. I just ignored it and didn't respond to his comments since I was uncomfortable with it. I thought he'd stop or move on to something else. 

So now he leaves weird comments on random things I post. Things that don't relate to the posts like ""we should talk sometime"" ""I'd really like to sit down with you"". Once I responded that we do talk on Facebook and got ""you know I mean something else"". 

I didn't know if I'd ever seen Joe before. His profile picture is a picture of a dog and he has no pictures of himself on his profile. I had no idea whether he visited the museum I worked at regularly, once in a while or at all. I honestly didn't know if I'd ever met him in person. 

So last week Joe shows up at the museum. I happened to be out at the front desk helping our receptionist. Joe walks in just beaming ear to ear. I welcomed him to the museum like I do with every visitor and the first thing he says is ""are you Kaylee?"" I'm the museum's manager so it's not uncommon for people to come in and ask for me by name. I said yes and asked of I could help him with something. He moves towards me fast. I'm not sure what he's doing but it looks like he's going to try to hug me. I stepped back and stuck out my hand to give him a hand shake. He looks disappointed  I still don't know who he is.  

Finally he says ""I'm Joe! It's so nice see you in person! I was thinking about you and decided to come over on my lunch break. Oh, and I wanted to see the new exhibit too.""  While he's saying this he's looking at probably every other part of me but my face. He full on looked me up and down. I was extremely uncomfortable. The guy is old enough to be my dad. He had short grayish hair and kind of a stocky build. He was wearing a shirt with the logo of a local production factory. He works there, it's two blocks away from the museum. Crap. Plus this place is also known for hiring a lot of people with questionable backgrounds so it made me feel even more wary of him. 

I very quickly said he should go have a look at our exhibit since he's in a time crunch and I hope he enjoys it, I have to get back to work and it was really nice to be able to put a face to his name. 

I walked back to my office as fast as I could without looking I was literally running away. 

I pulled up the security cameras so I would know where he was and how to avoid him if I had to come out of my office. 

He we left about 20 minutes later. I was so relieved. But, he private messaged me just a few minutes later. 

""Wow you are so beautiful. It was nice to really see you.  I'll be back soon."" 

This kind of made my skin crawl. But I wasn't sure if I was just being overly paranoid or not and I want people to feel welcome at the museum so I feel like I have to be careful how I respond. 

So I said ""thank you for stopping by, I hope you really enjoyed our World War I exhibit. There is a lot little known history there. Have a great day. It was nice to meet you."" 

I felt that was a pretty professional but not too personal response. 

So after this throughout the rest of the week he starts making more weird comments on things I post on Facebook.  

Yesterday I shared a news article from a city a good friend of mine lives in. There was a streaker on the main street where all the shops and restaurants are. I tagged her in it and asked if she saw that. 

Joe leaves a strange comment. ""I'll tell you if you tell me."" What in the he'll does that mean? I didn't respond. I'm not sure I really want to know. 

So then today he starts sending me more messages. He asks if he can give me his work email. I have no idea why. Then I think maybe I was supposed to send him some information about our museum? So I say yeah, was I supposed to send you something, I apologize if I was. I seem to have forgotten"" 

He sends me his work email and says ""you can send me something if you want to. But not from work."" 

I am extremely creeped out now. But he hasn't said anything blatantly perverted but I feel like it's implied. He knows where I work, what our hours are and so he knows when I close up for the day.

I think I taught myself to not feel about relationships, and the whole subject brings about a numbness to it. Although I do agree based on reasoning that relationships brings lots of benefits, I just have no first hand experience of what it is like so I cannot fully grasp it beyond just verbally stating them. I pictured myself being a father, having a beautiful wife and a beautiful family who are completely connected by ""genuine love"", but I'm unsure if I am even convinced of all that because I don't seem to go after it very desperately. Usually when I am actually truly convinced of anything, I would act on it with great intentions, but for relationships, I definitely don't show it.   
 
So what am I actually convinced of? Orgasm feels good. I am definitely living with an addiction to my hand and porn. I won't deny it and there was a very tough period when I completely tried to quit masturbation and porn during grade school, but the urge overwhelmed me so I completely gave up. I hid my hobbies from my parents and later on just mom because they divorced. After then, seizing to have a father and barely a mother because she is busy and barely there provided the perfect combination for me to indulge. Now, after a very long time of this frequent activity, it no longer feels as good, and the lack of human touch chronically, I believe, isn't good for me. So I guess it is only normal that I go for the the easiest thing that is available: buying them.  
 
About 6 months ago, I wouldn't have even bat an eye at them, but now they're all of my attention as I travel along in the city. All the letters of their fonts jump out and their colors accentuated. SPA, Massage, health and wellness, and I think those are it for the words that matter if you're new to all this. Their actual brand names will probably mean something later on if you're experienced. I think I'm already starting to remember names since visiting some of them. No, I have not paid and exchanged for their services yet. I went to a lot of them to scout. My other personalities: cheapness, frugality, or attention to economic value whatever you want to call it, overrode my dick for now. I guess it is like having parents around. When they're watching, I have much greater control, except now ""parents"" are just other people: the masseuse who reluctantly listed her price for her services only to be annoyed or even angered at fact that I left right away. This happened numerous of times, and I felt and still feel a tiny bit bad about it all, but I also found it humorous that I may have broken some hearts now but most likely not.  
 
My cheapness has led me into many forms and websites full of people ""reviewing"" their experiences, and most of them seem mediocre and are full of complaints save for some great praises. I've even tried to inquire about where to go, but the data is so scant that subjective experiences are in such a wide range that you might as roll damn dice and see where it takes you. But then I'll still think about the prices in terms of other things that I buy. How much is this service worth to me and how much grocery can I get with it? Why don't I just save myself from all these and upgrade my computer? A new pair of quality shoes? Yeah, my mind is ridiculous.

Aside from my cheapness, there is also a great fear. What the fuck would happen if I catch something? I did my entire Bsc in human bio and specialized in microbiology at a community college so I should know this shit! But why the fuck do all those women lack so much symptoms? Are they truly careful or are they just being vectors? From their years of experience the incubation should be long over. Or the moment the symptoms appear they just get fired? Or are they just hiding so god damn well behind their makeups and alluring clothing? A pair of pantyhose can definitely hide some disgusting rashes with their dim red lighting and other bullshit. Would that really hot chick, whom I annoyed, still look so god damn fuckable if I just imagine all the dicks that she handled with whatever parts of her body? Or have I completely desensitized myself from all the damn porn that I've watched such that I've even developed a very slight turn on for a woman who can handle all those? Hey I'll just fuck them with a condom, no kissing, cum into their mouths if they bare back job it. I can't catch anything from their mouth right? Again, I should know this shit but I suspect yes. So condom for all activities? Should I buy my own or do they provide it? do I trust them to provide it? I can't even ask over the phone because they're afraid of cops even though I think it might be legal in Canada. Yeah, they don't like questions at all and I am full of them. I've learned that much. 
 
See all those fears? There are way more, and listing them won't get my point any more across. However, even with all that, I still think it is inevitable that I'll wind up there one way or another. Part of me even imagined myself too afraid to get serviced that I'll just wind up talking to them. Asking them what got them into the business, how long have they been doing it, were they afraid at first, then focusing on their personalities and what their aspirations or values are. You know, the stuff that they may be even less comfortable with than their job. Maybe I'm just trying to find a good friend to talk to. 

Now I'm tired and sleepy. Writing has always been exhausting for me, but I hope my effort in trying to reach out can provide some meaningful feedback to my question: should I go for it or resist and continue to attempt for a relationship? If I go for it, would I become hooked to it and be financially ruined? or use it as a tie over for some much needed human contact? Thanks for reading.",03Aug2017,1

40,"A bit of back story: I'm a relatively new hire, just started working four or so months back. At first, it was just me and two other workers in our little section. No actual supervisor. A month later, we got a supervisor as well as one another new employee. All women, me the only man. Everyone is older than me, except the supervisor, who is three years older. 

After the awkward initial period wears off, her and I start clicking a bit (not romantically). Or, at least, I thought we did. We had similar personalities, were both fairly critical, and loved sarcasm. There was a lot of ribbing between us, but I don't think either of us really meant it.

Today though, at the end of the shift, we were just talking and I corrected her on something, which got the conversation off on a tangent related to that. She said, ""Why are you always like this?"" to which I replied, jokingly, that I liked to keep her on her feet. That was when she seemed to take it a step further and said, I was right, because I was always causing her extra difficulties for being such a screw up. She started to leave then and was red in the face and said she wished she could just pay me to ""shut up all day"". I'm not used to conflict and wasn't picking up the cues until after the fact, but I said, ""You'll have to pay me extra on top of what I get then."" I was preoccupied with something else by this point and missed what she said next, but I told her I'd take her comment up with the review board when they stop by next week, then gave a short laugh to show I wasn't serious. That was when I finished what I was working on and looked up, when she said I'd be the one out of a job if that happened. Then she stormed out.

I turned around and looked at my coworker after all that and her eyes were just wide. I asked her if any of that was a joke and she said she was pretty sure the supervisor was serious.

Have I just been misunderstanding this entire time? All the jokes and jabs, were they actually intended and taken as serious? I should also mention that I've never once joked about her actual job or workload. 

I guess I'm mainly wondering what I should do from here on out. I intend to apologize either way tomorrow, if for nothing less than to clear the air. I know I can be a bit too critical and sardonic, but I never intend harm from it.

On top of that, she has no boundaries and is constantly asking me to help with her wedding while I'm trying to work. For instance, shortly after she got engaged, she asked me to take a ""quick"" artsy picture of her ring for Instagram, which she posted along with the wedding hashtags she asked me to create (now her official wedding hashtags - I got zero credit, BTW). She invited me to help her shop for bridesmaid gifts during one of our lunch breaks and I ended up being trapped at the mall for two hours because she was my ride and wouldn't stop shopping for bridal trinkets for herself. She also asked me to do a small calligraphy project for her bridesmaids because my ""handwriting was better"" than hers. At first I humored her to keep the peace, but I quickly realized I had made a horrible mistake.

 I'm a high school senior, and my school has a program that lets you earn credits for having a job. Me, wanting to jump on the opportunity, quickly applies to a bunch of jobs so I can qualify. I hear back from a pizza place within hours and we set up an appointment for an interview. Fast forward, I get the job and I started my training today.

So it's me and a few other guys in the kitchen, and they're teaching me how to make the pies and whatnot. Everything's going smoothly, (apart from the already gross ""precautions"" they take keeping the ingredients clean fresh) but right before we clock out, the manager comes back and tells us to do something. The other guys look like they've done this a million times. They take out all of the little containers that hold the toppings, and they have little stickers with the 'use by' date stuck on them. My co-workers start scratching them off and putting on new ones with a later date on them. They then put the same old ingredients back on the shelf, ready to be used again tomorrow.

57,"I am 21, in school, and work two jobs. I'm terrible with money and have minimal savings (all my own fault, and I am working on it). I rely on my parents for tuition, rent, my phone bill, and insurance.

Our relationship isn't bad, but it's not good. They pressure me a lot and basically since I was a kid it's always felt like they value my academics more than they value me (which my psychiatrist and they themselves have said is not true, but their actions speak otherwise..) I've typically always been a good student, but last fall I ended up withdrawing due to how bad my depression became.

Things were better in the spring, but this summer I overloaded myself and now I'm failing two of my classes. It won't impact my GPA much (3.5 down to a 3.3) and I'm still well on my way to graduate (I was supposed to graduate this past spring, a year early, but due to withdrawing and becoming a part time student, extended my studies to take the whole 4 years). I just got off the phone with them and the conversation reduced me to tears.

I have one week left of my classes this summer (two 400-level online classes) and I am failing. They scolded me pretty harshly and told me that I'd better pass, and then pulled the ""we don't get money off of trees"" card.

I feel incredibly guilty, stressed, unsupported, unloved...etc. Logically, I know failing is NOT the worst thing in the world. My friends and coworkers have all assured me that hey, it happens sometimes. I was hopeful my parents would support me because I have consistently pulled A's and B's and maybe they'd understand what with me working so much, my mental state, and moving. 

After this phone call, I just feel like maybe it would be better if I cut them out. Not completely, but enough that they can't hold my financial dependence over my head. Am I being too emotional and overreacting? I was planning on getting myself into a better place financially before I told them not to worry about paying for me anymore, but now I just feel like they add so much additional stress and if I didn't have to worry about wasting their money or feel like I'm beholden to them, I wouldn't have to worry about these kinds of a things. I guess I just need second, third, fourth opinions in order to get the courage and actually do it. And then the second question would be how to afford it/budgeting tips?

60,"I work as a sales rep. So I am alone all day long. My boss is the sales manager for my area. He has 18 reps he is in charge of basically.

He literally does nothing. He forwards 2 or 3 emails from corporate and VPs over to us each day. Never adds any information or his insight on it. These emails also are the same emails that we were already sent by corporate and VPs 2 or 3 days earlier that week.

He doesnt know anything about our sales numbers and budgets etc when people ask questions. I can read people very well especially when they are BSing and he clearly is making something up that sounds legit but really means nothing. I had to figure out there was an error in the reporting myself because he was unable to comprehend what I was trying to tell him. We have several weak links that arent bad employees but they jsut dont have the training and experience some of the other people have. It is his direct responsibility to grow these guys/girls and help them develop into their roles and careers. He is no where to be found... doesn't offer any real help to them he just says things that honestly sound like they come from a Manager for Dummies book. Generic. Vague. Not useful.

Didnt see my boss or hear from  my boss at all that day....actually hadnt seen or heard from him for two weeks prior to that also.

As far as I know no one called him out.. at least not publicly about that.  No one knows where he really was...

Can I contact his boss? Is this frowned upon? How should I do it? What should I say? Anonymously? Phone call? Email?

62,"Hopefully some of you will be able to see the solution to this a lot clearer than I can, but this question is a real doozy for me and there's a lot of context I need to cover before you can really understand why. There is a LOT to follow so I hope it doesn't get too confusing.

So I guess I'll start from the beginning. My mom was 28 and single when I was born, working part-time as a nurse and making very little money. Growing up I was given very little information on who my biological father was and why he was not in my life from the start. All I know is that my mom raised me with the help of my grandmother until she was able to move the two of us into an apartment.

We lived in that little apartment until I was about 3 years old when she began seriously dating a man whom she had known her whole life as they grew up in the same town. We ended up moving in with him and his two kids (from his first marriage), finally becoming one big happy family when they married a year later. My mom always referred to him as her ""hero"" and for as long as I can remember I have called him my Dad (any references to the name Dad in this post are NOT referring to my biological father). 

Skip ahead a couple of years and my mom and dad announced a pregnancy. About halfway through, it was discovered that my little brother had been affected by a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia (the most common kind). He was born when I was 6 and his condition made the first years of his life (and my parents' lives) very very difficult. All of that said, he turned out to be the most amazing little soul and we all became very protective of him. It brought us closer as a family and our childhoods were as content as could be. I had even gotten to the point where I had completely forgotten that my Dad wasn't my biological father.

Fast forward about 7 more years when it all took a turn for the worse and my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer. She died when I was 15 and my little brother was 8. My older step-siblings (who I always considered full siblings) were much older and out of the house, so I was left with just my Dad and my little brother. By this point, my Dad and I had a very strange relationship that was dictated by grief, teenage hormones, and a strong lack of communication. For this reason I formed an inseparable bond with my little brother where I felt the need to guard him with my life. I took on a bit of a maternal role for him but we also became best friends. 

About a month after my mom's passing, I found an email in my inbox from a name I had never heard before. When I opened it, I was faced with a letter from a man who claimed to be an artist, who wrote with his left hand just like I did, and who (you guessed it) just so happened to be my biological father. I freaked the f* out. I felt like he was taking advantage of me at this extremely vulnerable time in my life, using my mother's death as a way to gain access to me... access that had clearly been restricted when she was alive (for reasons I still don't know). I was terrified that he would try to take me away from my Dad and brother so I deleted the email and never contacted him back. I suppressed all emotions and thoughts about the matter so deep into the back of my mind that I nearly forgot he existed once again.

It wasn't until I turned 17 when I had a serious boyfriend that the conversation came up again. He had asked me something about my family history and I felt safe talking about my mysterious genetics with him. I said the name from the email for the first time since the incident two years prior and my boyfriend took a deep interest. He did some research and discovered that my biological father worked full-time as a painter in a town nearby, he even found images of his face. This was the first time in my life I ever found any real interest in the idea of meeting this man, as I was preparing to go to college to study art myself and it was the first time I felt any kind of connection to him. Regardless, it seemed more of a fantasy than something I would do at any point in the near future so I put it in the back of my mind again. 

My freshman year in college my biological father contacted me again. He somehow managed to find me on facebook and began messaging me here and there. I never responded as my life was finally seeming to head in a direction that I felt content and safe with and I didn't want to disrupt that. He did manage to prod my curiosity however, and I discovered via his Facebook page that he was married with two young children. He seemed pretty normal but the idea of having siblings I never met overwhelmed me even more. I still felt disturbed that I didn't really know why he wasn't in my life, but I left it alone and decided that I would try to meet him eventually.

Around this time I finally asked my grandmother for some more information. She told me very little except for that he did not show up the day I was born. I still find it very hard to believe that this is the only reason he was blocked from having even the most minimal contact with me for the first 15 years of my life. In addition, I recently discovered that he had gotten my contact information for the first email from my alcoholic uncle with whom I have an extremely bad relationship with (no contact for the past 8 years). They met in AA and I feel that my uncle gave him my information to spite me. He Hated me and he hated my mom and I know for a fact that he does not love me and would never do a gesture like this out of kindness for me.

All of this and more has led me to put off meeting him over and over again, though I have messaged him back once or twice over the past year, very minimally. He sends me updates on his children and his work and has been respectful of my lack of engagement. I guess I feel like I'm at a bit of a crossroads with the situation now. I recently graduated college and will be moving to a big city far away to pursue my career at the end of the month. He's been messaging me much more frequently, lightly prodding me to see if I might want to meet him. I feel like if I don't meet him now I might never, but I also still feel very disturbed by all of the known and unknown facts. I'm also apprehensive at the though of betraying my dad who I've recently grown much closer with. Not to mention, he has supported my entire college experience and all of my creative endeavors. If it were not for him I would not be half as functioning as I am today and I owe him my life... I feel so guilty at the though of going and meeting another ""dad"" who hasn't done anything for me to support me. I also know that my little brother would feel very hurt to know that I was off meeting with some other family, spending time with a little brother that's not him. The thought of that absolutely breaks my heart. I really have no interest in meeting the kids/wife yet, it just seems like way too much, but I'm wondering if it would be worth it to just rip the bandaid off and meet this guy. It's also important to mention that I have a strong history of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression and I'm nervous that meeting him before such a big move in my life would be too disruptive- what if it triggers some horrifying underlying emotions that I have suppressed all this time? I really don't know how I'm going to react and that scares me too. I'm worried that if I wait too long he will either die or stop trying and I know I would regret not meeting him eventually. I know this isn't a common situation for people to go through but gosh any thoughts or advice would be so greatly appreciated at this point. I feel very alone and absolutely overwhelmed.

64,"[Insert obligatory mobile formatting phrase here]

So I finished my first year of college last year. It was great! I didn't make lots of friends, but I have close relationships with the ones I have.

This summer I went on a study abroad trip with some of them. It was fantastic and I became a lot closer to them through it. Two of my friends were dating each other at the time.

We finish the study abroad. A month goes by and the couple ends up breaking up. I'm friends with both of them so I tried to keep in contact with both of them separately. Recently, one of them asked me to get together to see Dunkirk. I said sure. He drove over to me, we went and got burgers, walked around a park to kill time, and saw the movie together. My parents thought it was a date until I explained that it wasn't and told them what movie we were seeing. Not exactly first date stuff :D

I thought my friend understood it wasn't a date. We both had the same situation with our parents and laughed it off. I thought this until we saw the movie. As most of you know, it's a pretty intense movie. I'm an emotional person so I was visibly tense throughout the whole thing. My friend kept whispering to me to ask if I was OK, stuff like that. Towards the end of the movie, I sort of sat with my legs up on the chair, like a criss cross position. My leg happened to touch his hand, not a big deal. After this he deliberately held onto my leg. I was too scared and confused to move. Afterwards he started stroking his finger on my arm, but I gently pulled away from that.

We didn't talk about that during the drive home. The next morning he texts me and says he had a nice time, I said I did as well (I really did). Then like a half hour ago, he sends a message saying 'your leg was warm last night'. I don't know what he meant by it and I don't know what to say.

For clarification, I don't want to date him. I'm not into him like that and he just broke up with his girlfriend a month ago. I don't want to be a rebound!

Any advice is appreciated! I know this was long but I felt that context was needed.",03Aug2017,1

76,"When they are drunk, they can be very aggressive, rude, and even sometimes violent. When I try to leave they keep me from doing so. They yell at me for little things and it really bothers me. They say things that really hurt my feelings and call me names when I somehow piss them off. Sometimes my feelings feel so hurt by them to the point where I break down and when I end up doing so, they do nothing to comfort me. One night when I started crying because of them, they mocked me and said things like ""you need friends!"", ""we need to get you medicine!"", ""you're such a pussy!"", ""you're a nag!"", and my favorite...""suck it up buttercup!"". It stresses me out so much and I just need help trying to deal with it.

  I got scammed out of 250$ on craigslist. I have all records of communication and the guys address, name and all receipts. I paid him through USPS money order and the only thing I don't have is a screen shot of the original post. 

  I plan on sending him a formal letter in a day or two asking him for the money in one payment or a payment plan of at most 2 or 3 payments so when I take him to court I have all my bases covered. He basically commited fraud and I'm pretty sure it will hold up in court. 

  What do I have to loose here if the guy doesn't show up? He also lives in CA but in the Northern part and I live in L.A. If he doesn't show he will be in contempt of court and will have an arrest warrant at that point I presume. But I don't want to be on the shit end of the stick again.

This guy I met in my university program, he was interested in me from the start of the year.

I didn't care so much if they did, I just kinda got thrown off by the lie..

Anyway, I still would see him from time to time but I was very inconsistent, I took a very long time to respond to his messages (tbh I take a long time responding to everyone) and I would occasionally hang out with him or study with him, I guess I enjoyed his company but I never really took anything serious 

I've only kissed him once and cuddled with him a couple times in the beginning, we've never done anything else 

I text him from time to time and ask how he is and see him but not very often as I'm busy

I assumed he stood where I stood, just hanging out nothing serious kind of thing, but recently I had turned legal age in Canada and I asked him to come dancing with my best friend and I 

He came clubbing with us, we danced cutely (not dirty dancing) just fun dancing, I got quite drunk, we smoked weed at his house afterwards and then I headed home, I thanked him for coming out over text, and I barely answered his messages afterwards because I had my friends from out of town visiting and I barely ever touch my phone when I'm with people

My uncle has always been a drinker and a gambler and often pawns things to get out of sticky situatuons. Well my dad loaned him money on several occasions, and took the guitars as collateral. He then loaned him more and more money, and told my uncle he could get the guitars back when he repaid the debt. Well after dad got sick, he told me to be sure my uncle didn't get these guitars and that they were to go to me in the event of his death. There was no will stating this, but my uncle also has no bill of sale or proof these guitars were his. No amount of money will buy these from me as my dad played them for several years (most of my life) and they are special to me. We had the funeral yesterday and my uncle called my brother today asking if he could have his guitars back.

Well so a couple of months ago I ask the girl I had a cursh on to my version of a prom. She was in my year until she did ty ( it's a year u can choose to take in my school I know there are schools who make it mandatory it's for the people who like school and what to spend more time there). She was in my class for the three years before and I would have talked to every day I had a thing for her since second year but she never knew it because I was acting cool and got drunk and was ask who I I had thing for and instead of telling the truth I lied and said that I liked her best friend.

105,"Okay sorry if this post is lengthy or doesn't make sense, I haven't really posted on Reddit that much before.

14M so keep in mind I'm quite young. I've always been feminine since I was younger and I've always been picked on for it, obviously getting called gay and shit. So as I grew up I knew I was gay and never really put myself down for being so. All of my friends were primarily girls, I've always just naturally fit in with groups of girls. 

I suppose I thought I was gay, because I grew very strong romantic/sexual(?) feelings for one girl out of my many friends that were girls. I'm still confused how I grew feelings like that but it happened. It turned out she liked me too and she was very happy when I confessed my feelings. Things moved fast. I had never felt that way about someone before, so obviously being with her made me very confused about my sexuality. Since I was now with a girl I became very anxious about any discussion regarding my sexuality in fear of her finding it unattractive. But these were all anxieties built up in my head, she is very understanding, calm and so fucking sweet.

I began to be obsessed with acting and being straight and anything that could make anyone question my sexuality I would immediately shut down. Because of my intense anxiety about this I would worry about the smallest things such as music, interests, clothing etc. Which I know is wrong.

I began to just think that I am bi but not tell anyone. I think I denied that part of myself out of fear. Fear of being judged, fear of her finding me too feminine and leaving me. I tried my best to change myself and still had people question me being gay. Most people would tell me it's just because of my voice and I hang out with mostly girls. I don't want to hang out with mostly girls, it's because I'm used to it and I've been around girls all my life I almost don't know how to act with guys. I do have some guy friends but always keep a distance due to me not being exposed to masculinity my whole life. This all made me extremely insecure and want to be a different person. 

I assume I might be bi, but sometimes I feel like I'm gay and time to time straight. I can sometimes not even maintain an erection when having sex with her but I'm young I guess and I like the idea of having sex with women, it could have to do with my insecurity. I just wish I could be with women without feeling insecure.

I do like the look of men and I would be in a relationship with one, but something about being with a woman turns me on and draws me to them.

Maybe I'm just bi but more attracted to girls, or maybe I'm just gay and extremely in denial and have an anxiety disorder. I don't know but I feel like I need to hear other people's opinions and get help. I also didn't know what category to post this in so I hope this is okay.",03Aug2017,1

116,"Disclaimer: This will be long so bear with me here. 

When I was in high school someone really close to me passed away with cancer. This incident made a huge impact on my life and I started to struggle with all the emotions I had built up inside of me. My parents do not believe much in grief counseling, and I didn't know that such service even exists for students. I was on the edge of failing high school, but something in me motivated me to try my hardest so I can graduate. I took community college courses, adult school courses, extra classes after school to make up for the units I had lost due to bunking school and just strolling through random streets doing nothing. After High school, I attended the local community college and worked at night as a security guard. I barely got 3-4 hours of sleep everyday, but I was able to transfer to a university after 2 years in community college with 3 Associate degrees. While in college I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life so I decided to pursue economics because it was the only thing that made sense to me. At university I struggled a lot and barely passed my courses with Cs and Bs, but somehow managed to graduate with a B.S degree in Applied Economics. After graduating I was able to find contract work with a big food and beverage company through an agency. However, after about 8 months, the company decided to only keep contractors for a year, which freaked me out. I started to look for new opportunities and got an interview with a big oil company (another contract position). Now the pay was good, but the company was really far away from where I live, and the office staff wasn't the best. I was miserable with the commute and the people who always disrespected me because I was just a contractor and not an employee of the company. After about a month I decided to look for another job and got lucky enough to land an interview with a small wine company which is located really close to my current residence. I started working for this wine company, the staff was great, the pay was decent. It was another contract position, but they said they will hire me after the probation period. While I was there, I was given lots of projects to work on and I worked extremely hard to finish those projects well before their due dates (sometimes even without getting paid for the extra hours). After about two months when I completed one of the biggest projects, my boss called me into her office and gave me my two weeks of notice. Her reasoning was that my excel skills aren't that great even though I completed the project in excel. Another supervisor said they are bringing in someone else from within the company to take my position. So I am still not sure to this day why exactly I was fired. With a deep sigh and positive attitude I accepted my fate and left that company two weeks later. However, I felt like they have taken advantage of me and only hired me to complete the project that no one in the company wanted to  take into their hands. After that I decided not to apply anywhere for awhile and started looking into CPA licensing. I went back to community college, got another Associate degree in Accounting and now I am eligible to take the exam. It has been a year since I was fired from my job. I passively looked for work, but didn't have much luck. Now I am going to take my first CPA exam, and hopefully pass. But looking back at my most recent position in the wine company, my self-confidence really took a hit. I tried my best, yet it was not enough for them to keep me. I have been running on my savings accounts and sleeping on my parents couch. I am not sure how and where life will take me, but sometimes I wonder if I made the wrong choice by leaving the oil company which later led to me being fired from the next company. I try not to dwell in the past, but I feel like one of the reasons most companies now are hesitant to hire me is because I have short duration for the companies I worked for in the past. Should I take the short-time work experience out? I am hoping to take all the CPA exams by end of this year, but I was hoping to land a job while doing so, because the exams are quite expensive. At the moment I feel really lost and worthless because I haven't been able to achieve much after graduating. I really appreciate any input/advice you may have for me. Thank you.",03Aug2017,3

Is there anything that can help me break this bad habit. Also, I tend to drift off or fall asleep when a teacher is talking for a period of time.

129,"I'm in Australia, currently receiving benefits from the government (Centrelink) whilst I'm studying full-time at university. At the start of the year I got awarded a scholarship, which counts as income/assets and so has to be declared to Centrelink. I can receive up to about $7,500 in scholarships before it starts affecting my payments.

So this scholarship is for $10,000pa, but it's paid in two instalments of $5,000. At the start of last semester I took in all of my documents, including the official documentation that states what the scholarship is worth and proof of the payment. But the person putting it in got confused somewhere and declared it as $5,000pa instead of what it should have been: $10,000pa or $5,000 per semester.

I went in today to check how much was declared last time since I can't access that information myself, and if it were declared on a per semester basis then I need to declare again (since I just got paid the second lot of $5,000). Well, since it was declared as $5,000pa instead of $10,000pa, they have been technically overpaying me for the last 6 months. Now I apparently owe them $6,000 even though my payments are only reduced by $10 a week with the correct declared amount. 

I don't have $6,000 laying around, and they want it paid in full within 21 days. How am I supposed to handle this? I can't even afford the weekly payments they want if I put every single cent towards it. This wasn't even my fault, I submitted all of the required documents and more, and when I verbally checked that it was correctly entered the first time around, they told me it was. There was absolutely no way for me to check it myself. ",03Aug2017,6
131,"Hey guys. I'm not sure what to do with my life. I figured I can throw you guys some fundamentals of my life and maybe you can help? Iunno.

- I'm 22 years old, almost 23, and a guy.
- I'm ""really smart."" I'm not here to get an ego massage about that and I don't want to end up on r/iamverysmart, so I'm not going to go through every accolade I've received and or every pat on the back I got. I do, however, want to give give you guys some sort of an idea of what I'm talking about, so I'll tell you that when I started standardized testing in 6th grade, my math scores were greater than the 99th percentile of graduating high school seniors by a margin equivalent to the gap between the 99th and the 15th percentile of graduating high school seniors. Other subjects had similar, if less impressive margins and the disparity increased as I aged. (I was not informed of this until 11th grade, which is probably a good thing, because it would've made me more of an egotistical bastard than I already am. Teacher was convinced I was Will Hunting, forced the class to watch the movie for my benefit, fucking embarassing. :\)
- I have two semesters of F's in college from literally never going to class and getting kicked out, but I entered school with junior status from college credits acquired in high school, mostly A's, a few B's.
- I haven't had a job aside for roughly three years, aside from random food service jobs I've picked up out of boredom. I was fortunate enough to be able to apply myself in such a way to make enough money that, invested wisely, has allowed me to live a relatively luxurious life without a job. I've got enough to last me another couple years barring any massive unforseen expenses.
- Aside from English, I've got a decent handle (NOT fluent) on Russian and Spanish. I've read most of Borges later period (read:simpler) stuff in his native tongue and am slowly working through the Watch series in Russian.

I haven't really done much in the past year at all. The only real productive thing I've done is wrote a ton of poetry, music and almost 300 pages of a still unfinished book and built some cool gizmos. An awful lot of friends of mine (including one of my three best friends) have died this past year and still more continue to die. (man across the street from my childhood home shot himself a little over a week ago and another friend died last saturday.) I initially wrote this period off as covalesence, given what had happened and that I had kicked a rather ridiculous opiate habit last summer, which at its height had me consuming 60mg/day of fentanyl just to stay out of withdrawal, but now I just feel like I'm spinning my tires in a rut. I stay as intellectually engaged in life as I did in high school, but the difference is the stuff I'm doing now would at best help with competency at a career, not with actually acquiring the career in question.

I worked myself up to line cook in a fancy restaraunt, which I enjoyed a lot, but my Dad, friends and family members gave me a lot of shit about wasting my talents. I do feel like I would enjoy academia; I felt right at home as working on a topology paper as a research assistant during high school. I went to University for quantitative economics but it was hard to quash the feeling that undergraduate studies were ridiculously remedial. It's probably because I was going to a backwater university in the backwater town in grew up in, but with my GPA now I doubt I'd be able to find someplace better. I don't labour under the illusion that I'm somehow as qualified as someone with a degree, but classes move at such a plodding pace that I end up bored out of my gourd.

I feel like University is the most logical step, but not necessarily one I need. All I want is an intellectually fulfilling career that makes me enough money that I afford not to have to beg, borrow and steal just to barely scrape by like my family had to when I was growing up. I don't really care what field it's in as long as I can have that.

132,"I'm 27 from the west coast in a long distance relationship with someone from the east coast. We've known each other over 2 years and have spent a lot of time together in person. He is more than willing to relocate to live with me so we can carry on with our lives together.


I would LOVE for him to move here and live with him but if he relocates to my city it brings up a fairly large problem for me. I live in a house with my mom who is just over 60 and single, shes okay but not in the best health which is why I wouldn't move across the country. The issue i'm struggling with is if I were to move out in the next few months she would basically be pushed to sell her house and move. This current house is far too large for even 2 people and would be way too much work for her on her own because of yard work and the bigger jobs around the house which I take care of cause her health doesn't allow her to anymore. Our family is pretty small and my only sibling lives close but is basically useless so I have no other support with my mom. I've had it really good at home and have a good relationship with my mom so I haven't really considered moving out until now.


This is really stressing me out and my boyfriend isn't happy since I explained this to him which is understandable because it brings up the issue of CAN THIS WORK... He's made it clear he wouldn't want to ""mooch"" off my mom living in the same house even in a private suite paying rent. So I feel like my only 2 options are 1) Putting a load of stress on my mom and changing her life quickly (selling house, repurchasing, moving) or 2) Dumping the person I love the most so I don't waste his time... I obviously hate both of those options.


He has money and hes from a big family who are close so he doesn't have the same issues I'm having.

I was excited until the first red flag: no official training, all my information came from me figuring it out or me asking the one person who will actually help me. 

The second red flag is that I ask the manager to clock me on but he says 'Wait ten or fifteen minutes' I though 'fine I don't mind as long as I'm paid' so I go in yesterday and get the usual ten or fifteen minutes but forty-five minutes later I'm not clocked in. Just to be sure I asked one of the managers if I'm getting paid for the time I haven't clocked on, he says 'No, I didn't ask you to start'.

I will be the main line of  communication between all the agents around the world and back here to the mother company. Since I'm almost fresh out of university that won't be until a year or so.

146,"Back on Saturday July 29th I was involved in a hit & run accident where the other driver hit us and proceeded to flee the scene. 


I had my fiance follow him long enough for me to grab the license plate number while I called 911. The operator instructed us to either return to the scene of the accident or the sheriffs station, it did not matter which one. Since the sheriffs station was closer we went there as we did not know the extent of the damage to our car.


The deputy there told us we were basically completely screwed and there was nothing he could do for us at all. He refused to file a crash report, instructed us to not talk to our insurance *at all*.


When I gave him the license plate number, I mistakenly told him CVL instead of CBL which caused the tag to come back blank. He said this was entirely a civil matter and the police cant help us. Sometime today I was online searching for variations of the tag, and by changing the V to a B it brought back a result of a 2013 Ford ecoline e150 van (The exact car that hit us) so I doubt that's a coincidence. 


We just got back from the sheriffs station now and have a crash report which we are supposed to fax to our insurance when we make a claim. However on our insurance we declined coverage for collision - does this mean even if we were not at fault? I don't know if we should even mention the accident to our insurance because I do not want them upping our insurance rate for something we were 100% not at fault for. Our insurance is through USAA if that makes any difference.

I need some advice. Back in 2014 I was fired from my job for gross misconduct. I was going through a really rough time and taking drugs pretty regularly and ended up overdosing at work and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Of course, HR weren’t impressed and told me they were going to put me through a tribunal, or I could quit. So I quit. The whole terrifying experience was a huge wake up call for me and I have since pulled myself back from the abyss and am living a totally healthy normal life now with a new job, the only job I have had since the incident. My current employer does not know the circumstances for my leaving my previous job.
My problem is now someone from my old company has introduced themselves to me today and I cannot tell from speaking to him if he remembers me or not but he does know I used to work at the same company (I stupidly said that I did ffs). My dismissal was pretty spectacular, so I can’t imagine he wouldn’t know me if we were working at the same company during the same time period and if he knows anyone he can totally figure it out by asking literally anyone who used to work there. My question is, now he works where I work and might know what happened to me, is there anything he could do or say that would put my current job in jeopardy? What should I do about this?  I am beyond worried at this point because I have moved on from my issues in my (not so distant) past and am genuinely a different person but this shadow is hanging over me and I don’t know where to turn. I feel like going to HR to talk about it might be silly as he might not even know about what happened. What should I do reddit?

I'm worried though. I accepted the offer last week, and this week a few annoying things happened. 

1. Dropped my smartphone and broke it, and I can't afford a new one just yet. Gonna get an old flip phone tomorrow to last me a bit.

2. My social security card got lost a few weeks ago, and I've neglected to apply for my replacement. My replacement won't be here in time for my first day. They require me to have it so I can sign up for benefits on my first day.

3. I have one more class to go in college, and while I alluded to that class in an interview, I'm not sure that the interviewer quite understood. It's during the work day, but I'm gong to meet with an advisor tomorrow and do my best to switch and sign up as in the night class.

I'm doing my best to rectify all these things, but if it doesn't go well, can they fire me before I start? I already told my old jobs that I'm leaving, so I would've screwed. I emailed the hiring manager to see what's up, but she hasn't responded and it's been over a day.

I was recently referred to a job in a different department by a friend for the upcoming fall semester (part time), and although this job would be at more or less the same level, it sounds like it would be more enjoyable than what I'm doing currently. However, I was just informed that I'm being extended in my current job into the fall semester.


I have an interview offer, but I'm not sure I should accept. I would have to tell my supervisor what I'm doing (I actually have another coworker who's interviewing there too so my boss would know what was up if I had to leave work that day, and that coworker told her already because he's not being extended so he doesn't have the same dilemma as me). I've already indicated that I would like to stay on for the fall, but I haven't signed a contract yet. I feel like if I indicated I was interviewing for another job she may hesitate to actually give me a new contract, so the worst case scenario here is that I end up with no job for the fall, and potentially leave this job on somewhat bad terms, meaning the loss of a future reference.

I agreed to having my partners brother and cat move in with the rules be the cat has to remain in the room while he is at work and is not allowed to roam the house at night my brother in law must keep the cat in the room at night while everyone is sleeping. My partner informed me we would sit down and discussed all of this once he moved it but we have not and today I found hundreds of pieces of cat hair on my work desk which I had to not only clean myself but it caused me to have an allergy attack. I’m not sure what to do because my brother in law as just moved in and I already want the cat out I can't deal with cat hair everywhere and having to clean it. It is wrong if I let him know the cat has to remain in his room while he is working and at night? Please help me I’m becoming very distressed over this!!!!

181,"I'm a 14 year old male. Though I'm still young I feel unproductive because I don't have a passion. The only thing I've ever wanted to spend all my time doing is playing video games. While they're great I'm so far quite successfully quitting because it negatively affected my anxiety, social life, and grades. Now however I have a lot of free time and I feel very motivated to work on something and really get good at it.

The catch is that I don't know what to do. The problem is not that I don't want to do anything it's that I *want to do everything*. All my friends just have their thing. They like dance, or lacrosse, or they have a band. Some just spend all their time on school. Either way they have ONE thing to focus on.

I have a therapist for my anxiety and she asked me to list my goals. I said I want to lose weight, teach myself Korean, teach myself the piano, exercise bi-daily,  and have straight A's. These are fantastic goals however how could I possibly do them all at once and succeed. The only one I got anything done in was Korean and even that was mediocre. 안녕하세요!

She told me that I need to just focus on one passion and make it habit. Then I can add on other small things to improve my happiness and health.

I'm looking for a passion, it doesn't have to be a hobby. For example, if musicals were my passion my hobby wouldn't have to be doing musicals (though I love doing musicals), I could also watch and study musicals and into playwriting. It's a wholesome passion. 

How do I find a passion and do you have any suggestions?

What I think might be a possibility now: Mythology, Piano, cooking, theatre, reading, 

I've tried; 
Most sports (not one I enjoyed)Crocheting, coding, video games, duck tape art, sketching, digital art, cards, dominoes, yoyos, piano, violin, viola, bass, singing, acting, theatre, cooking, opera, interior design, baking, mathematics, science, reading.

In the past I tried talking to the thug like guys and always ended up getting hurt and played, way back then it was suggested I was going to the wrong kinds of guys, the ones that every women wants and as a result none want a relationship, just wanted to play games and use me.

I tried to turn that around by talking to regular guys, ones that women tend to overlook and the end result was the same.

The lamest excuse I ever got was the guy telling me I couldn't come over because his brother's dogs were guard dogs and would wake up everyone if I came over......then he just ended up ghosting.

A problem with me was people always manipulating me, telling me my problems were all my own problems but then the guys would stand me up, or make me wait two and three months for a hangout and then couldn't even respond to a simple text message, but it was my problem, it didn't matter when we hung out as long as we did eventually, or me at 23 was too young to understand I don't always get what I want and they were extremely busy right now and it would all change soon.

193,"Quick backstory, I'm planning on attending university next year. I'm also planning on moving out and getting an apartment with my girlfriend. It's something we've always talked about and something we both really want to do. Living on campus is very expensive, and honest-to-goodness not something we want to do, also we wouldn't be living together on campus which is another big reason why we aren't. 

The university we're going to requires freshmen and sophomores to live on campus UNLESS they live within 40 miles with their parents. I do not plan on changing up my life plans and my strategy to not rack up more debt than I need to just so that my university can milk every penny out of me possible. 

My question is this: if I choose to get an apartment with my girlfriend instead of living on campus or with my parents, can my university find out? I'm sure I could get my parents to sign whatever paper saying I'm staying with them, but am I missing anything? The apartment I'm looking at is 10-15 minutes away from campus and so much more convenient. Any advice you guys could give me is appreciated, thank you in advance.",03Aug2017,1
194,"For a lot of my life I suffered severe depression and anxiety due to both traumatic incidents and an overall stressful living environment. I was constantly thinking about killing myself, and never happy. 

When I turned seventeen I acknowledged that I was very good at making people laugh (not trying to toot my own horn), I began taking some of the worst moments of my life and turning them into elaborate stories with elements of humor from self reflection added in. Though some of them were harder to tell then others, it helped me overcome a lot of turmoil inside me, and most importantly it made people extremely happy when they were around me. 

Years later, I've turned my sense of humor into sort of my definying trait. I'm rarely bothered by anything in my life. From the death of loved ones, relationship problems, to really any sort of quarrel in my life, I learned to turn them into jokes in my mind (sometimes verbally) and laugh with the world. 

I was talking to my wonderful girlfriend the other day, and she asked me if I was truly happy with my life, or if I had been surpressing my real feelings by acting humorsly towards them. She didn't mean anything insulting by it, but at first I was slightly offended, before I began to think if maybe she was on to something. 

To clairify I am very content with how my life has gone since I began acting this way. I am no longer depressed, and have somewhat boosted my confidence and lowered my aniexty, but perhaps there is a deeper issue I've never fully considered. 

TL;DR: is it okay to use humor as a coping mechanism? (sometimes it is self inflicted humor) or should I persue other avenues?",03Aug2017,11

But she messaged me saying im back.. and so we kept going on for 3 days when one night it was quiet not much going on in her room tip wise we were having this great convo she PM me saying do you just wanna talk on skype?  so we added each other and talked all night the sun was coming up  we kept hanging out.. on skype  we had a virtual date... i streamed a old cartoon movie she loves.. I heard her say in a low voice god I love you for doing this ... and thats when we started being very firty she told me her life story about her dad being a biker drug dealer being in jail and then she mention ""her roomate "" steve  who was also locked up. I should add too Stacy had cancer so she has health issues so somtimes she will be MIA...  few weeks into this intense thing that was going on with us she said she was going on a prison visit never said who I didn't ask... She came back and things were so much different she was .. just different we didnt talk anymore  she wouldn't really text back but would for a while then stop... I thought well this is over...

204,"I currently work for a children's store. I don't have kids, was never around them and I'm really awkward around them. I don't hate kids or anything I just don't really understand them. I also consider myself very good at sales but I've had parents get pissed at me when they're shopping in clearance and I show their kids a full price outfit at the front of their store worth about $50 that their kid now really wants. Growing up in a poor family, it just feels wrong. 

Anyways, I'm in a full time leadership position making 12.75 an hour. I've worked for 3 different other retail companies and in different states so I realize that a district manager is supposed to be firm. However the district manager here is just extremely rude. Just one example, our store manager is going back to college and our DM tried to talk her out of it by asking ""if it's even worth it at this point"" because our store manager is 30 years old. She also tried to force the rest of our management team who doesnt have kids to sign up for the store credit card and said we must not be very invested in the company when we declined.

That being said another huge issue is that I have a hard time getting to work on time. I have a very old car and it's constantly having different problems. This time my brake lines rusted out. They gave me a final warning for being late with a grace period of 5 minutes. 

Now I have another offer at a phone company, but as a full time associate making 10 an hour with raises and commission. Im still unsure if this will come close to my current pay and I'm already struggling to pay the bills. Yes I realize they won't want me late either but I have been doing a lot better about being on time and I have been leaving a lot earlier. I just want a clean slate.

I want to put my 2 weeks in at my current job and start working at the cell phone company because I've already closed 2 clothing stores in the past year. Our mall is closing down pretty fast even though they keep reassuring me we won't close. I dont see cell phone stores really closing down soon so I feel it's a safer bet and there's always room for advancement in the future.

The last problem I'm having is if I put my 2 weeks in today or tomorrow which is when I need it done by to not piss off the new company, I would be leaving 2 or 3 days after the store manager is leaving. that would leave 2 part time key holders and one of them is supposed to be leaving end of September and our DM hasn't started looking for the SM yet. I was originally mentioned by the current store manager but I doubt that's still an option with all of my write ups for being late. Even if I was promoted out of desperation I would still be on my second to last warning and with winter coming and having an old car I can't necessarily promise being on time. Also the last few places I've worked did not give out any punishment for being late at all so that's what I'm used to. I know being late is annoying but it's a hard habit to break.

Should I put my 2 weeks in and start working for the cell phone store?",03Aug2017,3
206,"I don't want to be a 'snitch'. However my brother is doing some questionable things and I'm wondering if telling my loving mother would be more of a service or disservice to him. If I told he would probably stop trusting me and likely beat me up, and not talk to me for a while. 

My brother is a normal teenager. Goes to parties maybe drinks a little. He made a promise to my mom he wouldn't smoke weed. He told me he had been though at parties despite him promising her he wouldn't and bragging to me about how much he never lies to my mom or goes behind her back. 

What's honestly more concerning though is my brother is paying his friend (who is Asian, how quaint) to do his mandatory homework online. You must do 4 hours a week. If he gets caught, no way he'll be accepted into the college he's trying to get into. I tell him he should just do it but he says no, 'and if you tell mom I'll kick your ass'.

I've struggled with Math and Science even though they can be VERY easy.

So now, the main point. I took an exam called the TEAS Exam. It allows me into a college LPN program upon passing. I passed it with good grades, but my 4th quarter junior grades in high school weren't at program standards.

So in September I go back to school, but I wont be in the program. I can't take the classes (which required me going to the school whereas it takes place in the middle of the school day.

Even if I retook this exam in Senior year (I'm calling to find out if that is possible soon) I would have to take the classes, in the next year, when i should be free from school.

Then there is the alternative as well, becoming a literature major. The issue is, how would it be payed for? The whole reason I was put into this LPN program was because my parents didn't want to pay for college (we are struggling).

Is there a school for literature whereas I could take some sort of exam? Or make an essay of sorts? It sounds naive, but that is the very nature of my being right now, naive.

217,"Basically, here's what's going on: I invited five friends to stay at my place this weekend and they all came (yay). Unfortunately, one of those friends is sort of a party animal and chose to invite a few strangers into my home without consulting me first. First she asked if her friend could come over to my place to drop off his bag. Then two of her friends showed up, instead of the promised one. Then after a while she asked if ANOTHER friend could come and drop off his bag. I was very sceptic the first time (but i still said yes, because she pressured me), so when she asked me again, I did not want to say yes. But... her friends were already at the front door. So, I bowed down to pressure and said yes once again. It didn't end there, though. Those friends of her (four of them altogether) stayed in my house for about 20 minutes each time they visited :( After a while, they left and MY FRIENDS WENT WITH THEM. I thought the whole point of inviting friends over (or going to a friend's house) was to spend time with that certain friend, not some strangers. Anyway, when my friends finally came back (they were gone for over an hour!), they brought alcohol and asked if they could once again store it in my house. At that point, I was like 'NO'. But since I'm such a shy person and don't like confrontation, then I tried to express that very politely. Thankfully, they inderstood my message and decided to go drinking in the park lol. But they took my friends with them!!!! And now i'm all alone in my own home where I was so looking forward to spending a nice weekend with my ""friends"". What I wanna know is, am I just overreacting? Should I have gone with them even though I don't drink and they didn't even invite me? Should I have invited myself??? Am I just being paranoid or is what my friend did to me rude? Please reply, I'm bored and alone :/

UPDATE: More than five hours later, here's an update on the story: that same party friend brought those some weird ass strangers back to my house. The third time. I know, I know... I should've known better than to let them back in, but I had just arrived back to my house after taking a walk (to calm my nerves) and she was there with the strangers, again! I HATE confrontation and she's the type of person who starts a fight really easily, so I decided to let them in one final time (oh, how stupid I was...). Right as we entered my house, one of the strangers asked if he could take a SHOWER IN MY HOUSE. Now, I may be shy when it comes to saying no to things like staying in my house (crazy, ikr!), but this time he had crossed the line. I told him a firm 'NO' twice! Can you guess what he did...? He took a shower anyway. I only found out once he had left, though, so I couldn't confront him (not that I would've had the guts to do it anyway). And i'm almost certain that he used the whole toilet paper roll in my bathroom to dry himself off. At least, that's what I hope he used because I swear to cheetos if he used MY TOWEL, i'm gonna throw all of their stuff outside (it's raining). Those strangers also brought ANOTHER bag of their luggage (or whatever it is) to my house and left it there. They also left an empty bottle of vodka on my kitchen counter. So, this time, I'm looking for advice on a plan... how do I get rid of them in a way that leaves the 'party animal' to be the bad one and myself to be the good one in this whole situation? I would dearly appreciate every suggestion you have!!!! :) thanks for all the advice so far!",03Aug2017,3

Science interests me much more than business and I can see myself enjoying a job in science. However, the problem is I have no scientific background. I took one biology class in 5 years of college.

220,"Hi reddit,

I got a new job a few months ago at a small company that's locally based. Me being hired was meant to replace someone who had decided to leave the job that I currently have. This person trained me, and then left. 

The person who I replaced was very well liked. So much so apparently, that my boss doesn't really listen to me and will email her [at her new job] and have her do tasks that I could easily do (and much quicker). In fact I would sometimes do these exact same tasks, and he would ignore what I had done and ask the person I replaced to do it, who is working at another company.

Today I found out that they're going to give the person I replaced a company laptop so she can ""work from home."" She's supposed to work ""only a couple hours a week"" but honestly its disruptive because she does more than what I had initially thought she would, and then doesn't cc me on anything so I don't know it's already done.

I'm meant to have her job but it seems like my boss doesn't give a fuck about me and would rather jump through hoops to have his old employee do the job, basically because she spoiled him bringing him coffees and donuts and shit.

So, what should I do? Let him walk all over me? Start sucking up? 

Am I overreacting?

After what has been almost a year, my aunt who was left with power of attorney has done nothing to settle the issue by carrying out my grandmothers will. After pleading with my aunt she agreed to sign over power of attorney so i can sell the house. Of the three remaining children who are entitled to a piece of what the house sells for one does not want the house to be sold. This being the case she has gone to the property broken the locks on the house and her daughter moved in to claim the house for her own. A week before power of attorney was signed over to me i went to the house with a officer and requested that she leave. The officers told me there was nothing that i could do unless i had power over the decisions to be made in selling the house. I was told to leave and escorted off premises. Now that i have power of attorney and spoken to a lawyer. I have been told that i would need to give two weeks notice of eviction and bring along the proper paper work. I have the deed, will, and Power of attorney over all decisions made from this point forward. I dont know what my next steps should be? I Live in Texas and am 21 years old and not well versed on these issues. My main concern is that they destroy the house in the time they have to evict. The main reasoned iam worried about it is because they are known to pour quick cement down the drains and ruin the utilities before they move out.

My mother sleepwalks and my step father works nights so when we moved out of their home, (my gf  lived with me and my parents for 2 years after she moved to our town, and we paid my parents $400 a month rent.) he made an arrangement with us that he would pay us $30.00 a month to allow her to stay with us when he works so that he can keep working the night shift. This money comes in handy but we both have decent jobs and don't really need it. We agreed to let her stay because we wanted to help out and he makes better money working nights.

229,"Hi I'm 21 and I'm dealing with some motivational issues that I have a hard time understanding. I think I burn out easily, and while it's okay to move from hobby to hobby. I'm afraid it may impact my career in the future if I burn out so easily, especially if I continue on to work in healthcare.

I'm not an exceptionally fast learner, but I always follow this pattern of getting into something I'm interested in. Become extremely motivated to get better, work hard to become good enough to be considered proficient, then burn out, lose motivation, and give up. Be it video games, instruments, school, chess, tennis, stock trading etc. etc. 

My suspicion:

I was always praised by others, especially by my parents as smart. But I knew from a young age I wasn't smarter than anyone. I think part of that is why I am so introspective and critical of myself. When I burn out, I suddenly think to myself that this not worth the effort. This type of thinking burns me out of hobbies and gets to me almost invariably. Even things like school and jobs which are worth the effort. Whenever my hardwork pays off with high marks, I get complacent and study less and receive a fitting lower grade.

237,"Where to begin? First of all, like I said, I accepted this job when I know I shouldn't have. I have eplipsey and I'm not supposed to work overnights. And this job is two 12 hour over night shifts. At first the idea was that I would do the 2 days of training (during the day) to get an idea of what the job was like. But I learned that if I quit I'll leave them short handed (I feel very guilty over the smallest thing--But maybe I should feel guilty about this)


Second, I finished the two days of training and I feel like things aren't going to end well if I show up for my next shift

The second day of training was better then the first because I obviously had a better idea of what I was doing. However, my supervisor was near me the whole time to help me out with any questions I had. But the next time I'm supposed to go to work I'm going to be on my own. What complicates things-- worries me even more-- was that the next room was being renovated and it was basically right next to a construction site the whole time-- the workers where going to town with their jack hammers and banging on a wall with a sledge hammer (at least thats what it sounded like) at first it was okay but after a while I could barley think and I know I didnt learn as much as I should have because it was hard to concentrate. I'm basically afraid something significant is going to happen and I'm not going to know what to do since I'll be alone.

Should I just rip off the band aid and tell them I'm sorry its not going to work out knowing I'll leave them short handed? If I tell them today it may give them a little time to figure things out for this weekend.

Btw, the construction is supposed to last for two months so it seems pointless to ask them for more days of training. And I dont know if they'll do it since its paid training",03Aug2017,1

So everything is fine right now but I just don't know what I should do next.

There's no careers or hobbies (within reason) that I particularly want to get into, there's really nothing much I want to do at all. I'm happy right where I am and with what I'm doing.

I'm finding it difficult to live with the burden of being inexperienced at an advanced age. It's extremely hard hanging on to the regret of my adolescence and early 20s. I've wasted my youth and it's hard to come to terms with. 
I'm fighting to salvage my 20s, and I'm frightened I'll waste it too..

A little background: I moved around a lot as a teenager..
my grandfather died in front of me. I was depressed for a long time. I also went through cancer diagnosis and treatment (wasn't serious), which was another blow. I've always been belittled and picked on for being shy around women.
I'm bitter and resentful that I've never been able to dispel this.
Still feel like a loser to this day. Most people would laugh at me being a virgin at this age, but I had no rhythm in my life, at times I was too tired to date. They don't know about the trauma and hard events I've gone through.

I don't know what to do to move forward. I'm on several apps and get many matches, yet very few responses. I'm great at making conversation and new friends, but struggle initiating with women I find interesting/attractive.
I don't know how to move forward and beat my demons. It`s hard having confidence as a virgin, but I`ve had a history of being hit on, flirted with and complimented.. yet I`ve failed to capitalize due to anxiety.

I feel like giving up at times, but other times I feel like I'm still young, in my prime and ready to get the intimacy I crave.
I'm not sure how to get casual sex, and I'm scared about commitment to be honest. I don't like the idea of a LTR at this stage of my life. It's sad my life has been marred my depression, low self worth and a major illness, but I think I have the inner strength to move on.

What do I do? I can't rely on apps it seems.. any pointers on how to hit the ground running in school? I'm a part of a co-op living arrangement where there's a lot of international students.

253,"Backstory: I was in a car accident recently and got a call from this guy that's a physical therapist that works directly with a doctor to evaluate my injuries. Here's the thing though, I find my physical therapist to be VERY unprofessional and I don't believe I can complain to anyone about it. 

I've spoken to a small handful of people I know in person regarding him and I've heard people tell me that they think he's interested in me in the physical sense. He hasn't touched me inappropriately or at all for that matter unless it's to hold my feet down while I'm doing sit-ups.

What makes me uncomfortable is how easy it is for him to tell me too much about his personal life. I know how many women he's slept with and his personal thoughts on religion as well as the woman he's supposedly in love with. 

At first glance, this guy is not even remotely attractive (in my opinion) no is he my type, but he's told me about how all the guys I've ever come across are all sleazy and they're all after one thing and they're all liars. 

However, he also preaches on his religion and states that anyone in a relationship (even if split in a marriage) that is is wrong to speak with members of the opposite sex. Yet, when the girl he's ""so in love with"" broke up with him once, he ""had faith"" that God will bring her back to him. Meanwhile, the guy that I'm into is just a liar because he's got a girl he's living with (even though I'm not dating anyone). He would put down every guy that showed an interest in me, yet the woman he's in love with is absolutely perfect- she would never do anything to him (other than break-up). I think he's delusional. 

On top of this, he encouraged me to date before I was ever officially divorced, yet thinks that it's wrong to do so otherwise. He even encouraged me to date online - which it's not for me as I've done it before, but at the same time... I'm not in a rush to start dating. 

Now that this physical therapist of mine has been broken up for a month, he admits that he's not officially divorced yet either. I don't like him at all, I find him as a huge turn off even on a friend stand-point and feel he likes to argue a lot with my personal feelings on religion and what not. Oh and he's a self-proclaimed ""womanizer"" where he says he knows how to talk to women and women just like talking to him. I'm like, ""really??? you could've fooled me."" I find him to be terribly egotistical, self-centered, etc.

Not to mention, he's wasting my time talking about all this rather than focusing on getting me better. I'd speak to a manager, but this would mean trying to communicate with the doctor he works with who's super busy working at different locations.

There are constanly meetings that affect my work a day I am never invited or debriefed afterwards.

But recently things have got so much worse. My supervisor is being SO RUDE. He didn't use the be this bad but for the last 6weeks he talks to me like dirt. It's really getting to me now.

I was very open about my drug use so this is just what I assume people think. The drug use played a part with my suicide attempt but it was not the major reason I did it. 

For some reason I really don't like that people think it was because of drugs. The months prior to the attempt I had cut back drastically and was very proud of myself. 

I'm returning back this semester and It's inevitable that I will run into people I know and i don't know what to tell them. If I say something like ""personal reasons"" they will think ""drugs"" and I'm not okay with that. 

I kind of want to just tell them it was a suicide attempt so they know it was a serious issue. I am much better now. I'm sober and I've accepted the direction my life is going so I don't think I'd mind talking about it.

267,"To start with, in 2014 pretty much everything in my life fell apart after college. I was without a job for a few months and my then roommate spotted me the cash. I took a lot of things on faith at the time, because I was horribly depressed and he was fronting the bills. I paid what I could, but I knew there was some money I was going to end up owing. 

Fast forward to August of 2015. I had finally started to get my shit together when I landed a decent office job. I star paying the roommate back on top of the regular bills and such. 

Fast forward to this year. The first time I took an honest look at the account, and realized that he was still charging me for several thousand dollars that didn't make any sense. I'm bad with money but I take it on faith. I start to plan to move out for other reasons, and during the entire process of me doing so I tell him I will pay whatever it is that I owe him but he's really being an ass about it. Daily harassment through text message of what I owe and me moving out isn't fair to him, etc. But always polite and courteous to my face. 

My mother was an auditor for several years. I send her the spreadsheets of what roommate says I owe. She goes over it, says I actually overpaid by $800. We meet up and explain this to him in person.

For background, first this is on a sort of throwaway account, ignore my handle lol.

I began Midwestern, and ended up West Coast, where I just moved this past month.

Now, in general, I've never had a lot friends. The first parts of my childhood and life consisted of a few neighborhood friends (all younger than me) that I'd play silly games with along with my little brother, and as far as school went, I had 1 good friend for many years until I moved after 5th grade. The former was something  that would obviously come and go, and the latter... well, this kid I got to know through video games, but throughout the years I realized that was the only substance to the friendship. So much so that when I liked Nintendo and superhero shit and he liked run of the mill MMO's (LoL, WoW, etc), it crumbled away like nothing. It was pretty stupid and almost a bit sad because our families became good friends too, but after I moved for the first time West Coast, I didn't feel to bad about it.

Next, I spent a year at a new public school for 6th grade (my school system up to 5th grade was Monastery, which I thank for its invaluable education at a young age :). That year was a little different than any other, but nonetheless I went through the motions of adjustment, and I ended up with 2 new friends. One of them was a nice, shy Asian kid who, like me, loved video games. We hung out during school and sometimes after, but his parents were strict and i believe they wanted all his time to be for studying, so that was whatever. Now the 2nd friend is the one who I'd see 4 years later-- a really nice girl, athletic and into Hockey. We'd see each other at school from time to time, having friendly general conversations, but I always hesitated to become better friends for 2 reasons: 1.) whenever we spoke, she'd always invite me to this mass gatherings of friends who always went out to theatres, theme parks, etc, and she never wanted to hang out with any other group smaller than 20. Being ridden with anxiety, and knowing these kids were more athletic and such like her, I'd always make excuses so as to 'polite fully decline', and this leads to my next reason-- 2.) I didn't get the concept at that age that you could have friends with different interests as you. Yes, I'm the sorta smart, sorta unathletic sorta dude who's into video games, so at the thought of not relating whatsoever (and freaking out in social situations), I could do none better than, well, nothing.

My third move took me back to the Mid-west, where I then spent 4 years at a private country day school... perhaps the worst 4 years of my life so far. Essentially, this school had a bunch of rich, prep school kids, but away from that usual stereotype, everyone was just... off. Socially off. And I don't mean in the 'yikes that guys weird' off sorta way. I mean, the people at that school had warped ideas of socializing in general. In combination with a huge amount of underground sorts of drama with rumor spreading and shit talking, essentially everyone found their reputation in the gutter at some point or another. So I made this group of friends over the years who was the 'different, quirky' group of our school-- small and quiet, but funny nonetheless. Seems fine, no? Until you realize all of those friends were to shit... essentially, their weird sense of socializing gave way to these constant inner fights between individuals or different groups within the original one, and in the end everyone just felt like shit. There's so much more to it that I can't even describe, but it essentially made me want to fucking dieeeee. And it taught me the one thing I know of having friends today-- it's a lot easier just not having any.

So fast forward to today. Just moved back out to the West Coast, going to the high school I would've gone if I continued where I was 4 years ago. Throughout the summer, leading up to this, I got in contact with the one girl I'd met, and after talking a bunch over the phone, once I arrived here, we met up irl at a cafe near both of us. My one thought I had throughout was... I better not fuck up. Now I know everyone would think this when making a first impression, but with me it's a little different. 

As far as my character goes, I guess I've always been a little weird. In the sort of way that in the midst of conversation, I might say something a little out there that's relevant but doesn't quite make sense? The sort of thing people shake their heads to, go 'ok...' and continue on with life. Being self aware as well though, I've monitored some of the stuff I said without thinking that people thought was 'weird' (and this was more during my 4 years at the country day school), and sometimes it seemed pretty regular but something others made a huge deal about? Idk. 

Anywho, I thus mentally prepared myself, making sure I didn't say anything that would give bad impression, and I never really did! I talked about what I'd done for the summer and at my old school with academics, and she, for the most part, explained all I'd want to know about the new school I'd be attending. We met up twice at a cafe two days in a row, and went on our merry ways, until i was looking back on our conversation...

Now here's a dumb little thing too-- around 7th/8th grade, I somehow came to the conclusion that I may be gay. In short I never 'looked' to either boys or girls my age up until then, and it had only been boys. Well, today, I've essentially... curbed it? While I've always still had attractions to other guys, I hate the stereotypes and lifestyles surrounding being gay, and especially the reality that many queer people only obsess over that detail of themselves (I.e. ""OMG I'm sooooo gay, in random conversation), that I'm trying to internally strongly reconsider any real pinpointing my sexuality. Nonetheless, I don't want people knowing any shit about this, and ESPECIALLY any new people I meet at school... but what did I have to go fucking do, mid conversation with this nice, *Christian* girl?

1.) tell her how I had one isolated friend from my country day school who was weird, flamboyant and probably gay (he was into video games!!). Also attention seeking and mostly known as an asshole due to an obsession with getting good grades.
2.) after telling her this, asking me ""(OP), are YOU flamboyant? Hm?"" I rolled my eyes to this in response
3.) while telling me who I'd be friends with based on what extra curriculurs I'd be taking, tell her I did Musicals, and have her proceed to tell me ""ohhh yikes... the musical kids are mostly these gay kids... but I swear they're nice! They're just gay... a lot of them.""
4) after telling me this, asking me ""(OP), are you gay?"" I responded with a ""yeah, NO,"" and she followed with ""yeah I'm not a lesbian either hahaha""

So... she must have some probable suspicion that I'm gay. Fuck me. More or less because I just want to meet a group of new, normal friends, something this girl WAS! And she knows this group that I used to have classes with, but I'm afraid I've already fucked up. I don't want her to think of me so differently, but now that I feel like she does, idk what to do...

Do I try and continue the friendship, ignoring any assumption that I might be gay?

Do I just let the friendship go?

Or something else? Wtf do I do man...

**TL:DR, I moved a bunch until from Midwest to West Coast, met up with a nice girl who I knew before, gave her the probable impression that I'm gay and idk how to fix it**

I have the feeling that if I get any response, it'll be something along the lines of 'op you're overthinking it' or 'op get a fucking spine'... in which case whatever. I honestly feel like having no friends is actually easier anyway, I just thought I'd try :/",03Aug2017,2
271,"So this girl I've been talking/dating for awhile. She's the most amazing/craziest girl I have ever met, but awhile back she ended things. It was all civil and we ended on good terms but it ruined me. Her reasoning was that she just didn't want to commit to anything serious just yet (given that we started talking after she ended a horrible relationship that last 3 years) Its been about a month and a half since she cut things off and I'm trying to move on but a part of me still loves her and recently she has been trying to hit me up.

275,"About three years ago, I decided to tell my parents that I was agnostic. This made them very angry since they had raised me to be muslim. They had threatened to throw me out of the house. This was also the time where I had been accepted to a college, so my dad told me if I decided to stay this way, he wouldn't pay for my college. So to keep my stability, I decided to start lying to them and live what you would call a double life. When I got to college, I didn't really know what to expect, but I soon realized that was very different to the two guys I had to dorm with. While they were going out to parties, I was just sitting in the dorms doing my homework. I tried to be cool with them, but the one attempt I made I completely made a fool of myself. You see, because I was raised as a muslim, we're taught to stay a distance from girls, meaning we don't really know how to interact with them. Before classes started, the school took the freshman on a trip to target to get anything they may need. When we got there, there was a very big line forming because the store wasn't open yet. So one of my roommates began talking to this group of girls, we ended up hanging out the whole time. On the way back to school, each one of us sat with one girl on the bus. So I decided to have some small conversation with the girl. I talked about Netflix , some of my favorite shows. I remember her mentioning not seeing a show I talked about, then I said for some reason, we should watch that together some time, hah netflix and chill. At that moment, I didn't realize what I truly said till the night was over. I continued to hang out with them and my roommates until both of my roommates couldn't make it. Then some truth came out via my roommate, the girls were only willing to hang out with me because of my roommates. They thought of me as super awkward and really weird. This crushed me because I really thought I could make some friends. With me not making any friends and having to hide my true self at home, I began thinking about suicide. Although I got it through my mind that this was crazy and I wasn't even a month in and I'm already losing myself. So I decided to go the lounge, I was just doing my homework while these two girls were conversating. They ended up talking to me for no reason, I ended up getting there names, met the rest of the group and was eventually invited to one of their birthday parties.  At this party, I found out everyone who was attending was christian and part of a christian community. I decided to initially join it to make more friends, but found myself starting to fall in love with it. It wasn't just about friends. The experiences I had at church, as a person and at camp/conferences truly got to me,I even stood for Jesus at one time, but there is one thing, I never really sat down and read the bible, maybe verses from church and school church, but nothing else. This wasn't because I wanted to, but with school getting in the way, I never really found or made the time. And when I was home, I obviously couldn't do it either because my parents would literally kill me. So here I am again unsure with things as I was three years ago, i don't really know if I want to make this move because at the same time I feel like I haven't given it a true chance or known anything. One thing that makes me want to go away is homosexuality laws, I am not gay myself, but my sister is and even a couple friends of mine in the club have claimed to bisexual. I just don't know if I can get over a religion, especially be part of it if it decides to hate on people just because of who they are. I've made some great friends here and definitely had great experiences, but should I really be religious if I'm picking and choosing what I want to believe as a christian? Because if I am then I shouldn't be following religion in the first place. ",03Aug2017,1
276,"I have two best friends and we are all very close to one another. We try to plan outings that all three of us can make it to, but that's not always possible. The problem is, one of those two friends (I will call her Mary) gets upset if me and our other friend hang out without her if she can't make it (due to work or plans with other friends). This doesn't make sense to me because Mary is fine hanging out with just one of us when the other can't make it, but if she isn't present she feels betrayed and gets seriously upset with us. She is highly sensitive so she is touchy even discussing this.

Mind you, we are all adults so I feel childish to even be involved in such petty drama. I've never had this issue with my other friends before, but I also don't want to throw away a valuable friendship because of something so small.

278,"I'm 20 years old and think I've probably ruined my life before it starts.
I made the (now, I believe stupid) decision to go to a private, out of state university that averages a little over $50,000 a year. The majority of my class mates have either gotten stellar scholarships, or have parents who can afford to pay their tuition in cash. I'm in neither of these boats.
My parents work their asses off to give me everything, but we have always struggled with money as a family. They somehow made it work for me to attend my dream school. I have always been an optimistic person, but I think the truth has finally began to set in... when I graduate I believe I am going to be facing nearly 150k-200k in debt. I am not sure exactly how much my parents have paid out-of-pocket for my education (they have always been very vague about it), but I know it isn't much. Fuck. Me.
I'm majoring in something I love -- journalism -- but quite frankly that is not a profession that pays all that well. I have considered going into the broadcasting side of it, which pays slightly more, but I still am not going to be making anything near what I would need to maintain the lifestyle I want and not be completely crippled by student debt. I'm about to be a junior in college, so it is way too late to change my major. I feel like I'm trapped.
The only logical way I'm going to be able to live my life not constantly worried about my debts is pursing a different field...which is pretty much too late to do now. Or marry someone rich af. Neither dependable options. I wasn't really sure if I wanted kids or not, but now I'm thinking I definitely can't have them because I can't afford them. I don't want to be barely scraping by and have to support a child...that isn't fair to them. They wouldn't deserve that. And what guy is going to want to marry a woman who doesn't want kids :(
I've thought of transferring back home to our local university...which pains me so much to think about. I hate the farming community my family lives in from the depths of my soul and do not fit in/would not be able to have a career in the field I desired there.

283,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons and I won't be saying the name yet just in case this interferes with the investigation.  I'm sitting in the hospital with him, it's been three days since he got here and I'm now focused. This is beyond vengeance or anger, this is to stop this from happening again, to the voiceless.


**Background**: My brother is autistic, deeper in the scale. He's non verbal. He can understand you but he only has a few words he can respond with, like ""fine"" and ""yes"". It's mostly reliant on eyes and body language which you can pick up after some time with him. I am his drug monitor.  Without family, sitting in that courtroom and hearing the dosages being approved, my brother would be a zombie for the rest of his life.  He's been at his home for roughly 8 years. Mostly without incident. About 9 months ago I got a report saying there was an altercation, I called and they downplayed. I believed them, since for the last 7 years, other than not buying him anything he needed ( cheap), I had no complaints. For a low income household, it was nice and he was happy. 


They told me they were investigating internally through letters. Talked to the staff, everyone told me he was alright. He seemed depressed ( this is all hindsight which breaks my heart). The case was closed earlier this year.


**Present:** Monday get a call from my mom about my brother, saying she was with him at a nearby hospital. She doesn't speak english well. Arrive and doctors explain the situation to me. He had to have a procedure to stop the bleeding. He cries at random times of the day. Doesn't let anyone touch his groin region, Slumps down and overeats.  At first I was in denial, then furious, then extremely sad. This is my best friend. Worst yet he couldn't say what he really felt and I didn't pay attention. After a day of self loathing I decided to take action. This obviously was happening and probably has happened to others. I want to end this. 

**Finally:** we are still in the hospital. Social workers are coming and going, luckily the hospital is in the city I live in so my mom and I take shifts. Unfortunately he can't come live with me, I have roommates who are strangers. My mom is on disability and low income. Furthermore, he's a creature of habit, his day programs are gone and he can never return to that house.  Looks like there is  an investigation but the policeman they handed this off to seems to be a newish  patrolman.

**What do I do?**: what do i do to move forward? I don't have a lot of money, should I be calling a lawyer now? I want everyone responsible to pay for the cover-up but first I got to stabilize his life. 


**TL;DR:**. Brother was assaulted, assisted living home was negligent and possibly covered it up, now in the hospital with no life or network for him right now.

291,"**Background** 
I work at a local entertainment venue, which seems to be run on nepotism and favouritism. There are two main culprits who benefit from this favouritism, and get away quite often without working, and slacking off a lot.

**The issue** 
The two culprits, whom I'll refer to as such were slacking off during a busy period instead of cleaning. An employee who I will call ""S"" moaned at them to get on with it, and to help out. The culprits responded to this by complaining to management for the second time regarding S. He was promptly brought into the office to discuss the matter, and I believe was issued a warning of some description. The complaint was supposedly that he ""Acts like management to staff and in front of customers"" (which I have not witnessed)

**My involvement** 
I overheard a few conversations regarding this. The culprits, it seem, have a personal vendetta against S and have been lying or exaggerating the things which S has done. They've insulted him, such as calling him a ""Fat Slag"" and expressed desires to have him fired. During a cleaning session I also heard Culprit 1 on the phone to an unknown person, ~~asking them to file a false complaint against S~~ Implying that if they also complained about S, then they could ""finally get him fired,"" with the pure intention to have him fired at some stage.

Fast forward to today, and I was informed as idle chat that the Culprits often sit on the Tills known as ""Box"" which also has a live feed of the CCTV cameras. They've taken pictures of this screen with their mobile phones to prove that S is using his phone during shift. (S works at an area which has few customers due to being the only staff with the appropriate license, and is therefore permitted to do so providing it doesn't interfere with any work duties)

I took S aside and informed him of what I heard. I made sure he knew that I didn't *know* any of this, and I had only *heard* it. I also stressed how little I knew, and that I was only telling him so he could watch his back just in case, and that I'm on hand if shit kicks off.

**Result/Next step** 
Unfortunately, whether the right or wrong thing to do, S decided to approach management straight away, and I've been asked to go into work tomorrow (on my day off) to provide a written statement. I'm quite a new employee (Several weeks, not yet a whole month), and I don't want any fallouts from this to affect my job there. I'll be leaving very soon for a new job anyway, but this is at least a month away. Should the Culprit(s) find out about my involvement with this, or suffer themselves, I don't wish to be implicated/be targeted myself. S is also likely to be leaving for a new job, however this would be several months later.

Can anyone tell me, given the above scenario if there's any structure I should follow given how little I know, whilst still supporting S?

edited to add: S feels that the company need him. He's the only staff with the particular license as mentioned above, and that offers him *some* job security. That being said, there's only a certain amount the boss will take, and eventually S sees himself being fired if false complaints were to continue/go ahead",03Aug2017,3

Alyssa got hurt because her internet friend decided to leave her because he couldn't trust her anymore. She then distanced herself from everyone else & lost alot of friends, irl & on the internet. I didn't let her cut me off though. This is all happened 9 months ago & she had no more friends. 

8 months ago, I introduced her to Dan, who I love. Alyssa knew I loved Dan in a romantic way. They started talking online for 2 months then she began videochatting with him, which she never did with me. 5 months ago, she started talking to him about her issues & shared secrets. She never talks to me about her issues & Dan hates telling me his secrets. 

Yesterday, they started dating. I told her that dating him is going to cost our friendship but she still did it. I started ignoring her & Dan got mad at me & said that if I don't fix things, he's going to end our friendship & I got mad & told him I loved him & now he's ignoring me cause I am causing trouble between Alyssa & Dan.

301,"I don't know why. I have friends, a girlfriend, a PS4 so I have things to do. But I'm getting frustrated at sitting in my room doing the same things everyday. I want to go out and do things, but what is there to do? Nothing. I'm endlessly bored which eventually leads to me feeling depressed.",03Aug2017,6
304,"My wife and I are from a fairly rural part of the country, and almost all of both our family members still live in the same state we grew up in. A few years ago, we moved to a (still pretty rural) coastal region after I got a job opportunity at an emerging company. I had increased job responsibilities and quite a bit more pay. We're not talking six-figures, but going from lower-middle class to middle-middle class.

Not long after we moved, she was pregnant with our son, who will now be three in a few days. We later got married in the small town we have lived in the entire time since moving. (Budget wedding with just a few of our coworkers present - no family).

We live in a fairly nice part of the country, own a nice (enough for us) house, and both our jobs allowed us enough expendable income to do about anything we wanted. 

The only problem was that the company I worked for was hell. It was a cooperation between a massive European company and a few Americans who spotted a growing niche and were able to get in at the ground floor. The company exploded in growth, but since its inception has been unbelievably mismanaged. Though I was a lower-level salaried person, it pained me to see how poorly they treated their hourly employees. I could tell you stories you wouldn't even believe. Nepotism was rampant. Many people in upper management were grossly under qualified to do their jobs, and the gut feeling everyone had going to work each day was that the place would be boarded up when they got there. The company makes a ton of money despite how badly it is run, not because of it. Turnover was massive.

Due largely to this crushingly stress, I believe, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression that is still being treated. I swear I was more than once on the verge of a legitimate nervous breakdown, and I spent a lot of time in Afghanistan without being nearly as stressed.

I tried for a couple years to get a comparable job in the vicinity, but my qualifications are too specific to appeal to most employers and this employer was the only like one within driving range. 

Over the course of a handful of years, I went from stressed to bitter to apathetic. After a discussion with my wife, we decided to throw caution to the wind. We're not even 30 yet, we decided, there's no way we should have to deal with this. So I put in my notice and quit two weeks later.

We plan to move to the town I was born in. Both my divorced parents still live there, and hers live just a couple hours away. I have a ton of great childhood memories there and it's an excellent place to raise a family, whereas my current location is smack dab in the middle of the heroin epidemic. I found a semi-related job in an unrelated industry and I have no doubt my wife (who is much more charismatic than me) will find something, too. However, my new job will pay about 60% of what the old one does.

A guy I work with plans to buy our house, but he is extremely unreliable at work and has gotten in a lot of trouble outside. It's under contract, but I'm still not optimistic. If it falls through, I won't be able to continue paying for it for long and it will almost undoubtedly be foreclosed on. I have other debt that is completely proportionate to my old salary, but will be very tough to keep paying on 60% of that. I am pretty frugal and keep up on everything I owe, but I think I would default on a bunch of this if the house sale falls through. To rationalize this to myself, I keep telling myself I'm still young and it will all come out fine in the wash.

On top of this, as shitty as my job was, this is where my son was born, took his first steps, where we were married, etc.

I guess my question is: Did I fuck up royally because I couldn't stick it out at a job I came to loathe, or is the whole ""follow your heart"" thing appropriate when it has the potential to sandbag your credit score and savings in a way that won't be fixed for a long time?",03Aug2017,1
305,"So far, it's been horrible. I'm bored af, my girlfriend is away for a month, I want to go abroad but can't afford to and am stuck in England with horrible weather and nothing to do...",03Aug2017,1
306,"I held a steady job with a landscaping company for about 10 years after high school. I had planned to finish college at some point but some personal or family issue always came up that required my immediate attention. (I also have issues with motivation. Many things in my life are the result of continuous fuck ups on my part.) Before I knew it that steady job was terminated. My boss never even gave me a reason why.

In the couple of years since then I've held series of jobs, but nothing I could stick with long term. Let's just say that I've moved many shipping boxes and cleaned quite a few toilets. I've had to move out of my apartment, moved in with some friends, some friends have moved away... There just hasn't been any stability for a while. There were some months were I wasn't sure if it would be the last one with a roof over my head.

So basically, I'm 30 years old, I have a high school education, crippling social anxiety, my savings are exhausted, my car is barely roadworthy (and likely won't be for much longer), so transportation is kind of an issue. I need a solid goal to focus on, so I've always had trouble making long term plans (this includes saving money, which I admit I'm terrible at, among many other things). What can someone in my position do to start turning things around?",03Aug2017,4
307,"TL;DR dropped out of collegedue to shit grades, alcoholism, mild depression (made great friends and had a great time socially), and have been on track to enlist in the army. Medical paperwork complications have delayed it for a literal eternity and seeing all my friends get excited for the new year has me wondering if I made the right choice. 

I spent the past year at a big party school in the SEC, had a great time, met lots of great people/girls etc. But that was about it. I couldn't for the life of me get interested into the classes I was taking, and found myself (usually during intense drunkenness) with a deep feeling of self loathing and depression.

Came home, parents saw the grades and (as they should've been) were extremely dumbfounded and angry. As I had lied to them saying everything was fine, despite missing class, blowing off studying, and showing the beginning signs of alcoholism. They sat me down and I came clean about everything above. They asked me what I thought the problem was and I told them that I was angry that I was not doing anything of substance. I was drinking and partying but I wasn't doing anything I could look back on with pride.

My whole reason for going to college was so I could get an officer commission in the US army. I wanted to enlist straight out of HS, but my parents made me a deal, go to college for a year and get a feel for it.... and here we are a year later. Eventually we decide that I am going to enlist, but due to medical paperwork complications, it seems the process could take several more months (I started the process in mid-may). I'm stuck in my hometown about 400 miles away from my college life, working in a gas station full time. Compared to college my summer has absolutely sucked. 

Now the time for college move-ins is about to start and I see all my friends getting excited for the year. Now that I'm seeing all the fun I'll be missing (in tandem with a shitty job and medical paperwork taking a literal eternity), i'm wondering if I made the right move, or this is just necessary beginning of the rest of my life.

308,"So I'm young(23) and I was laid off from a 36K salaried job. I have 6 years experience I my industry but I don't genuinely enjoy it.

I'm looking at this lay off as a chance to change the direction I take my life. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, it's an opportunity. 

I'm just having a tough time finding positions that are entry level or without a college degree. I really want to do something with kids or animals but can't find a position that doesn't require a bachelors degree.

Any advice for a young guy looking for a career change?",03Aug2017,1
309,"I've been expecting to receive an envelope or two containing Pokémon cards I've traded with some people online. Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Anyways, I haven't got them in the mail and he hasn't received it back. I've been told there is a lost mail designation? But how do I go about finding it? Please help. Thanks, everyone

EDIT: I'm in the US as well as the sender. No tracking  numbers on envelope.

EDIT 2: I forgot to give them the specific apartment number and I had them wrote my Username as the recipient rather than my name name.",03Aug2017,1
