2,"I'm currently taking a college course, and the class involves a lot of solo projects and presentations. The problem is, after every presentation, the teacher will give me huge praise on how great it was, then grade me a measly 70%. 

I asked my teacher why I was graded so low, and the reason involved her saying ""no sources"". I told her I DID have sources, I even wrote what my sources were in the draft that I turned in. She admitted to not even reading my draft, and then said she didn't ""hear me"" cite my sources, when I literally read my sources out loud while showing them in my power point.

TLDR; Teacher graded my presentation poorly after admitting she didn't actually read/hear me cite my sources when I verbally and visually showed them. Grade is low in the class through her own negligence.

3,"We're in a new community, and all the neighbors are new.  Everyone is very friendly.  One of the neighbors is too needy for me.  I want to live in my home without unexpected visitors, who are bored.  I've made up many excuses why now/tomorrow isn't a good time.  I don't need a new best friend.  I'm fine being friends and having occasional playdates, but I draw the line at multiple times per week.  When my kids play, that's *my* time to do stuff... I do not want to entertain uninvited guests or their children.  How can I politely get my point across... that they should only come over when invited?

7,I just graduated high school and suddenly find myself with a shit ton of free time. I have a part time job but only get a few hours a week. In the past I'd play video games and hang out with friends but I've lost a lot of my motivation to play games recently and it's hard to schedule stuff with friends who all also work weird hours. So any advice on what to do on a budget? ,22Jun2017,3
8,I know it may sound silly but I have this weird feeling about it. The teachers and my parents have always praised me for being a good student and all my friends and others in my grade see me as the guy who does amazing in every course and will win an award. I've gotten a specific subject award every year so far but I don't think I'll get any for graduation. This year my friend and another girl has beaten me in all the courses by no greater than a percent... I don't know why but I feel ashamed in myself and feel that the teachers and my parents at graduation will be to some degree disappointed in me and I'm having a hard time getting these thoughts out of my mind. Any advice? I also feel like others in my grade will be surprised and be looking at me when they see I didn't win a subject award. Again I know it may sound stupid but I'm having a hard time shaking it off and I don't know why. ,22Jun2017,1

10,"Hi I have 0 close friends, I'm awkward, not good looking, I'm 25 and I have a full time job. I have practically no social confidence and I think people find me standoffish simply because I don't know how to act in social situations. I also have lazy eye and I'm often self conscious about that when I'm talking to people. I'm a big gamer and not having many close friends was never a real issue for me, I would just lose myself in games and find people to talk to online. But these days I find myself getting really lonely and wanting to put myself out there but i fundamentally lack the social skills and confidence to make any impact on people. I thought I'd ask for some advice here, I know it's a long shot for things to change for me anytime soon but any advice will help a ton. Thanks",22Jun2017,1
11,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about a year now. His ex is well, way better than me. In every aspect.

She is prettier than me in looks (not that far off but still), has a nicer face/skin/body.
She is super successful, going to law school
She's super expensive and classy and well spoken. Elegant and happy.

Then theres me with shit grades (computer science). I'm girly but also tomboyish, I cuss and play video games and listen to ""hood music"". I am messy and have no life achievements. 

I just feel like a fucking loser compared to her. I feel like the downgrade. I have put myself in competition with her. I can't help but stalk her life on a day to day basis. I just want to be happy with myself and my life. I just feel I will never be as good as her. How do I get over this?",22Jun2017,1
13,"Here is my story. When  I first started out college, I ended up having a low GPA after my first couple years because I partied too much. I realized I needed to do some soul searching, so I took time off. When I decided to go back to school, I had to take community college classes because I needed to bring my grades back up to get back into my school. I ended up getting a 4.0 and earned my spot back into my original university. My current GPA there is 2.21, and my goal was to graduate with at least a 3.00 because I might want to get my masters or show my employers I did not do too awful. I did a future GPA calculator to see what GPA I would have to get each remaining semester, and the results said error because I would have to get a 4.87 GPA, which is impossible. I am really upset that I won't be able to achieve my goal, and I am worried that I will lose out on jobs because of my low GPA.  I would like to know if GPA is a big factor in receiving a job. Will I still be able to get an internship in college will my low GPA? Is it still possible to get into grad school if I decided to go?  The advice I would like from anyone is what other ways can I make up for having a low GPA and impress an employer. If someone could help me out I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!",22Jun2017,1
14,"So I was waiting for a bus with my friend in LA, and some cute girl walked towards me. She said ""hello."" Okay, she probably said it to someone else, I reason. As she walked by, she said ""goodbye."" Me being me, I said, ""buh-bye,"" and turned back to face my friend. 

My friend, who is facing towards the mystery woman, told me she blew me a kiss, so I turn around again. The girl says, ""you checking me out??"" Also being me, I say ""hell yeah I am."" She yelled something that sounded like ""you're an asshole,"" so I felt skeevy, I wasn't even checking her out, maybe she wasn't talking to me after all, and I face my friend again. 

My friend informed me that she didn't yell ""you're an asshole,"" but actually ""yeah? Let's go."" Why why why do I keep on missing chances at things? It probably wouldn't have led anywhere, but I wanted to know... This is not the first time I shied away from beauty.  Whyyyyy? :(",22Jun2017,1
15,"My company's HR Department had 3 people this time last year. The last HR person (she was in charge of everything) just left a week ago.

1. i'm over analyzing and in reality eventually things will go back to normal

16,Hey everyone. In need of some Reddit advice. So in December I decided to spend some time travelling/living in Australia and Indonesia. I originally bought travel medical insurance for 6 months as I didn't know how long I was planning on staying for.  The other day I realised my travel medical insurance ran out and I'm planning on staying for a while longer. When trying to extend it or get a new policy the company I was with said they are unable to issue me a policy as I am already out of Canada and my policy had expired. Most of the other reputable companies wont issue me a policy due to the same circumstances. My only options as of now are to fly home for a weekend to get medical insurance which will cost me roughly $2000 and 40 hours of travelling which is pretty brutal or to go with a sketchy company like Nomads which has horrible reviews online. Has anyone gone through this before and have any advice for what I should do? ,22Jun2017,3
17,"So there are a few events that took place in my life where I still haven't forgiven myself. The biggest one is my experience with Lacrosse. So, to be as quick as I can (I tend to ramble):

I wanted to do something to make me active and get some more friends. I had played almost all the typical sports in America under the sun except hockey and lacrosse. I didn't care much for hockey for whatever reason. But lacrosse seemed interesting.

Despite my experiences of hating every sport that I've ever played I had tunnel vision and impulsively signed up for lacrosse. This cost my mom a good few hundred in gear and net broke 1000 with the fees. 

I went to the first three practices. Within this time I made a fool of myself. I was the only new kid and everyone there were already friends. I was terrible and doing drills against much more experienced players caused my anxiety (I have generalized anxiety disorder) to really kick in.

I could hear the kids talking about me in whispers to each other when we lined up for drills. Kids would also mess with me by throwing balls in rather complex ways when we did passing drills which made me look like a fool.

I anyway broke out in stress tears after the third practice in the car when my mom picked me up. I just felt so weak and miserable and made the decision to quit. My mother supported me (for the sake of supporting me as she could see it was affecting my anxiety and mental well being, I don't think she agreed with the decision).

It was so embarrassing to quit so early. I made the decision that I could struggle through things like kids at school, or hardships in my life that come with the path of succeeding in the things that matter to me. I concluded that I didn't think lacrosse was worth struggling for. It was very embarrassing obviously regardless.

Now, every time I hear someone talking about persevering, or not giving up, or anything like that, I get haunted by regrets about lacrosse. Sometimes I feel so guilty and ashamed. We're selling the lacrosse gear and my mom's getting a refund on the fees, but I still can't forgive myself.

The advice I would like is, how do I do so?",22Jun2017,1
21,"Yeah, this is a serious question. I'm the only person I know, in the entire world, that hates ""Minions"". And now, Despicable Me 3 is getting ready to hit...or maybe it has already hit, and I can't help but feel a sense of dread as I understand a new wave of Minions will be unleashed. I literally hate them. I cringe everytime I see them. It doesn't matter, I can go to the mall, wal-mart, whatever. T-shirts, hats, kids shoes, toys, posters, etc etc...   I can't be the only person in the world that wishes Minions were never created...   why...why are they so popular?",22Jun2017,2
22,"We always go on the same trip, I skipped last year and also got out of going to work too (told them I went). But this year, I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to skip the same ole' go to the beach, look at the water, stand in the sand, don't spend anything because we spent everything to get here attitude from everyone else (I'm a shopaholic and in a position to do so most of the time, but no one else is able to or wants to.)

I'd also like the break from work, but if I stay, I'm going to work for a week, if I go I'm sitting in a hotel room for a week with shitty wifi and people complaining that I never go down to the water (I like to stay out of the sun for skincare reasons).

I'm not saying all of this as a complaint, the vacation is free for me, if I don't go, the couch is free for someone else. I don't mean to sound like I'm ungrateful for the free trip, but I really don't know how to tell someone we should go somewhere else without sounding like an asshole. The beach just bores me and the shopping is all beach-related (surf shops and cheap sunglasses stores).

What should I do?",22Jun2017,1
24,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I need some help. I'm from Latin America, so apologies if my English is not perfect. My younger brother (now 31) has been unable/unwilling to get a job for years now. He spends most of the day (or at least I am told) , reclused behind closed doors in his room surfing the web.
Here is a little background. We come from a middle class family that always had connections and opportunities to mix with an upper class because of my father's connections and us being good students. We were hardly poor, but we didn't have the luxuries of things like international traveling or expensive things, except for the occasional videogame every Christmas (geez..all of this sounds so entitled when you write it). Basically, it always felt like most of our friends had it always better than us.
My father, while very well intentioned and intelligent, is very disorganized, a little idealistic, and had a lot of projects that never quite translated into success. It hurts me to say this but he never really inspired us much, as hard as he tried to. We grew up with that doomed millennial mindset of following our dreams. That we were “special”. We both went to a really good college, but with the exact same flawed mindset: to get a degree that would be better than the average joe's so we could get a good job , raise a family, and finally be well off... but of course that didn't turn quite as we expected. I finished my degree but pivoted and got a master’s in a more creative path ( which I am very thankful for). But he had it harder. It took him a very long time to finish school ( maybe 6 years instead of the average 4). To this date, even though he finished his course requirements , he has not processed the document that proves that he is a college graduate (that in itself is a very long story). He has had jobs in his field, but cannot stand them and never lasts. My parents have done everything to help him (paying for special courses, introducing him to people who would give him a job, etc.) , but will not kick him out of the house he lives in (he lives in an out of state property owned my mom and her siblings where these siblings also live; my brother and them hate each other’s guts by the way) .
He has a passion for music but he is not a musician himself. At some point he wanted to be a concert/event producer to follow this passion but he never seems to take the first step to actually do it (he is hardly a type A who wants to get things done). He says he wants to go to grad school in Europe for a special graduate program that focuses on this music side of things, but he doesn’t take the step of actually graduating for college. He has been living off of some money he had saved, but it is not much and I’m sure he will run out of it soon (and if not soon, at some point and then what?). I doubt he would be able to pay for grad school even if he took the necessary steps to do it.
Bottom line: I think ( I want to say I know) he is depressed and unwilling to get out of his comfort zone. Here is the stuff that throws me off though. He is not a slab ( he is pretty tidy actually), even though he has gained a lot of weight in the last few years, he has been very disciplined and happy about getting healthier. On the weekends he goes out , a lot, to sports events, concerts, drinking. People who hang out with him find him lovely. He used to have girlfriends but not anymore.
And then Monday comes, and he gets back into the same old routine.
I’ve tried to suggest to go to therapy, but neither my parents nor I can convince him to do it. I’m trying to get my parents to kick him out, but I don’t think they have the heart to do it ( even when I’ve already presented the case that this type of love is hurting him more than helping and that tougher love is needed) . Anytime my parents try to talk to him about his lack of motivation he gets very defensive, and he can be very rude and full of rage. Whenever I try he does open a bit, but in the end he never changes his habits.
TL:DR Brother is likely depressed, won’t get a job, won’t seek counseling, won’t follow his passions even if he says he is going to, lives in a (uncomfortable) comfort zone. This has been going on for years. How do I help him? I really want to.",22Jun2017,1
25,"My husband and I have an amazing relationship. We have a gorgeous daughter and more love than I'd ever hoped to find. We literally only have one problem, his mother. 
My husband is one of 4 kids. He's the youngest and the only child from both parents. His mother is also his oldest sister's mother. She is a ""good christian woman"". She is nice to pretty much everyone. She's has known for several years prior to our relationship that he was in love with me. They'd always been relatively close as far as their relationship went. Then apparently there was me..
Our relationship didn't have the best beginning. I was newly divorced and I come up pregnant very early. To begin with, she and I got along great. Then shortly after she found out I was pregnant, her attitude started changing a little. She would make hateful comments when there was no one else around. I overheard her more than once talking with his oldest sister about me saying things that were very untrue and hurtful. I never said anything because I had no business to. The private comments went on for several months. Even when I was in the hospital to have my daughter I heard her on the phone with his sister saying very hurtful things that should have never been said by anyone. Fast forward to a few months after my daughter's birth, my husband started a new job where he is gone during the week and only home on weekends. Now she constantly whines that he doesn't call or text her at least 3-4 times per week and he doesn't go over there every weekend when he's home. He's been at this job now for a little over 8 months and she's been doing this the whole time. She'll call me during the week and ask if I've spoke with him and fuss because he hasn't called her. She is constantly posting baby pictures of him and pictures of him as a child on social media, talking about her ""baby"", and making her profile picture a picture of her and him as a small child. She annoys him to the point that he doesn't hardly want to speak to her. His father is not in the best health and my husband can't even visit him or even call him without her manipulating the entire conversation. If I take my daughter to visit my MIL takes her immediately as if she doesn't want my FIL to even hold her unless he specifically asks to hold her. And if anything is said to her about the way she acts she starts crying and acting like either she doesn't know what you're talking about or she didn't ""mean it that way"". Every single time. What's even worse is she doesn't act near as crazy when my husband is there and she'll let my FIL spend time with my child. My husband's grandmother and 2 of his sisters even say that it's as if his mother has an unusual obsession with him. One of his sisters has told me that they all knew whoever he ended up with would go through hell but didn't realize it would be this bad. I don't want to be mean but I don't know how to handle it. It's to the point with her that if you listened to her talk about him and didn't know he was her son, you'd think they had a completely different relationship (putting it nicely). What do I do?",22Jun2017,2
26,"Edit: 9 years on and off. With a job and switching majors. 
I have been going to college/university for over 9 years. I just graduated with my Bachelors. 

My cumulative GPA is 3.3 and this is because of my community college courses. I have a lot of courses that i got Cs in. These courses are not in my major either. 

I understand that general ed courses are required but some of the courses are from when i switched majors and i want them to not count when calculating my GPA. I would have been magna cum laude when i graduated if it hadnt been for a few of those course.

30,"So, I've never been to a psych, but have decided to see one because i believe it should be helpful. I'm don't DESPERATELY need them, i can function normally without, but my anxiety and depression has made my life very lifeless to simplify it. My Q's are:

1)Do you typically need a referral or can you just call any and make an appointment?

2)Do they prescribe in first session? Or is the first session basically therapy? Do psychiatrists double as therapists as well?

3) If I were to see a psych in my hometown for the summer and gets meds prescribed from him, could i continue the treatment with a different psych in my university to pick up where he left off? Like transfer dosages and adjust as needed, or would you suggest just waiting until i go back to uni and start the process there?

31,"This is going to be a bit of a mess and I apologize.  

So every time I speak to my mother, she asks me if there's been any forward movement in my life, if I've gotten any closer to getting my life together.  And every time I have to tell her I haven't.  No progress has been made since the last time we talked because I just don't know how to ""get my life together"".  

I live in a very small town (population ~1000) in America.  I'm married to a woman that works at a really good job and makes decent money for a ""straight out of college"" job.  I have a job myself that makes shit ($9.50/hr at 70 hrs/fortnight) but it's an okay job, I'm really good at it, and I'm fighting tooth and nail for a promotion.  I thought I was doing okay in my life, but apparently not since so many people (including friends, multiple family members, and even sometimes my wife) ask me when I'm going to ""get my life together"".  

So I need some advice.  How the hell do I get my life together?  I can't go to college/trade school cause I simply can't afford it, there really aren't any options available in my area, and truthfully I'm a bad student cause I'm dumb as heck.  I don't really know what to do to ""get my life together"".  I feel like I'm stuck in a massive rut and I have absolutely no idea of how to even begin getting out.

Can anybody explain to me how to ""get my life together""?  I need some advice on how to ""get my life together"".  Maybe if anybody has some advice on how to go back to college at an affordable rate, or how to get promoted, or just how to be better.  How do I ""get my life together""?",22Jun2017,1
33,"I have a lovely girlfriend. We've been together for 2 years now and are deeply in love. She is everything to me. 

In February, I made a huge mistake. I was on a business related trip to another city. I met a girl there, we talked for a bit. She was mildly attractive, nothing like my girlfriend though. I don't know what got into me, or why I did this. This girl asked me to come over to her place that night - to ""watch a movie"". I had never recieved a request like that from a stranger before, so I was initially excited. But I didn't want to cheat. I told her I had a girlfriend and she said that was fine and that nothing would happen. I had the moral dilemma of my life at that point. I had no idea what to do. Me being an idiot, decided to go ahead and chill with her. 

We got to her place, put a movie on Netflix and just watched for a bit. She started getting handsy, just through my jeans. She took my hand and placed it on her breast, again through her clothes. I was sexually excited but morally mortified. I kind of sat there and let it go on for a bit. She proceeded to try to reach her hand into my pants, at which point I told her to stop. She told me she wanted sex, I said no. I ordered an Uber and went back to my place. 

That night was rough as hell. I talked to myself all night and told myself two things: ""nothing happened"", and ""this is a lesson"". I took it as a lesson to never, ever cheat from that day on. And nothing has happened since. I even look at other girls way less now because of that experience. For the most part, I forgot about it for several months. 

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. Our relationship continues to flourish, and our love becomes stronger and stronger. Marriage is on the table, and it's something we talk about a lot. The memory of me almost cheating keeps coming back to me, for some reason. And it's really depressing me. I don't want to lose my girlfriend. I can't lose her. But the more I fall in love with her the worse I feel about that experience. I worry that these guilty feelings could worsten, and I worry that it could cause problems in our future marriage. Lately I have been thinking about how I should tell her what happened. 

In the past she has told me that cheating would end our relationship. I just don't know what to do, and I don't know what or how to tell her. I just feel like it would be the right thing to do. I guess my questions are, should I tell her or not? After all, despite coming close to cheating, nothing really happened. And if I do decide to tell her, how should I tell her? I'm afraid that the guilt I feel will not go away, instead it will transform into jealousy and anger on her part. 

It's a mistake I don't know if I can live with forever. And it's a mistake I don't know if she can live with. So telling her could definitely mean ruining our future. I just don't know what to do or who to talk to.",22Jun2017,2

38,"Hi Everyone, 
   Please bare with me, this is a lengthy. I am recently divorced,  and practically new to the whole new dating scene. It's been 6.5 years!!

Anyways, I met my crush like 8 years ago. It was an instant crush. At the time I was with my ex boyfriend. I remember the first time scenario with him...his father was my dentist...and I was leaving the 'cubical,' area and my crush he is a dentist as well. I remember he stood in the hallway down from me and stared at me and smiled and said hi. I replied back to him. Nothing ever came about it except some flirtation...googly eyes. We always did that towards each other...every visit. 

I ended up getting married a few years later and have a daughter. I am now divorced, but he always played in the back of my mind. There was always some sort of connection. I am not one of those fall in love instantly kind of girls. 

The first time I was back in the office was this past March 2017, it's been 3 years. When I walked in the receptionist made a big deal about me going in. Then the dental hygienist came out and was like ""so you're back from NC,?"" and I said ""Yes."" she then replied ""for good?"" and I said ""yeah I am."" Then my crush came out and he was like ""hey I have seen you in a while, how have you been?"" and I said ""I have been good."" We smelled talked for a while. Then he got called in to see a patient. I was at the dentist for my mom. When my mom was finally called back, it was just my daughter and I out in the waiting room. You know when someone is staring at you, you get that funny feeling. Well when I looked up there was my crush looking at me and then he would smile at me. And it felt like I was 21 again the ""google,"" eyes came back between us. He kept getting called back and forth. At one point I was sitting down on my phone and he leans in towards the little window that doctors offices have in their waiting rooms...and he was like ""how old is your daughter?"" and I told him. Then he asked me various questions. Towards the end of my moms visit, someone Sophia and I ended up on the other side of the door. My crush was asking me where I was going to send my daughter to preschool and where his sister is sending his nephew...and he even went and gave her a Hello Kitty tooth brush. She loves that tooth brush btw. 

I saw him about two weeks ago at Subway, we smiled at each other, but something felt off. I couldn't put a finger on it...he seemed different. Unfortunately, I found out his dad...who is my dentist just passed away. 

Just the other day, my brother went to the dentist and saw my crush. And they were talking and my crush asked my brother ""how is your sister doing?"" My brother replied she is doing really good. He then asked ""is she enjoying her summer?"" My brother replied yeah she is. Then he asked about my daughter. I believe my brother said something like ""I am glad she is doing well."" 

I am so out of the dating game that I feel so dumb. What are your thoughts..think he's interest..?

39,"There's more.  I have high-functioning autism, ADHD, the works.  Formally diagnosed.

I almost always have intense anxiety and paranoia.  Living on my own, in this small studio apartment, makes it worse.  It makes me get stuck in my head.

I frequent social media because it's the only connection I have to my friends and the outside world.  Problem is, I've lost most (if not all) of my friends, as my depression and social withdrawal has intensified in the last few years.

Furthermore, I told one of my best friends (a female, I'm male) that I had strong feelings for her.  It was true, and in a way I don't regret doing it because at least I can live authentically, but as you can imagine it put an end to the friendship.  So that feels the same as going through a breakup (I've done both so I know the feeling).

Shit is intense.  Trump is president, climate change, perpetually-sensationalized and fear-mongering news, etc.  I could really use any advice for how to maintain my sanity in this new place and get out of my own head.  I'm not naturally one to have a sense of structure.

42,"So I'm I'm in 11th grade I go to a school that is very small ( maybe 50 people at any time it's a 1 on 1 school) a lot of the people who go there already have friends(or they are not my age) from other schools and don't wanna hang. I dealt with depression in middle school so missed out on the opportunity to build friendships when I was young. I'm pretty happy in life now but I feel lonely I see other people posting on social media seems like there always out with people doing whatever. I don't think I'm socially awkward or anything I just feel like I lack opportunities to make new friends mainly because of the size of my school and that it feels like everyone else already has freinds and plans and they don't have any interest in hanging with me. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever felt the same way and if so how they fixed it, made friends, or just changed something to feel less lonely? ",22Jun2017,4
43,"I'm going to go ahead and be really long-winded here because it might show off my problem better. I seem to only be able to communicate in walls of text. I can't cut things down, not because I'm using frivolous words, but because I digress far too much. My writing lacks focus, and thus, often seems like ranting. I'm speaking about one thing to the next, and they're all loosely tied in together, but as a whole it doesn't work to communicate what I really want to. People get lost or tied up on one little thing I said and it derails the whole conversation.

Part of the problem, is that I write how I would talk. And my speaking style works wonderfully for many kinds of in person conversation. I can rail off about many things and in many ways, and so conversations flow beautifully. We'll digress into something new and it never has to end. I really enjoy talking. I could talk forever really, but I give pauses to jump in or I wait for people to respond, or I can even read facial expressions or body language for when to move on or shut up. There is no room for that in writing or in online communication.  

I lack focus in many areas, and it leads me to believe I might be ADHD. As a kid I never got diagnosed because I'm too self-conscious to act out, and I was naturally really good at schoolwork and tests. So there never seemed to be a problem, except for how I might have noticed it. And I did. The papers I write, they always seemed to have great introductions and conclusions, because there I know what I'm trying to do, and I'm really setting the stage for what the rest of the paper is or was supposed to be. My bodies were always a mess, full of deviations, asides, and pulling directly away from the point I was trying to make. This never seemed to come up in teacher's comments because other kids usually struggled about way more obvious things. Also the spin I can do with introductions and conclusions is something special. So I only really started noticing it when I'm making walls of text to talk to people online, or when it came to more scrutinized papers in college. When I go back to try and clear these things up, my problems are hard to find. Everything does fit in together, frayed even so, I just provide way too much information and muddy the waters. 

So how do I get this focus in my writing? I've been meditating among other things to try and gain it in my life as whole, but my writing style is something that might need more specific attention. Tips? Tricks? Thoughts? Organization strategies even?

TL;DR: I lack concision. I think it's because I lack focus. Ideas?",22Jun2017,2
44,"So. Once upon a time I dated a not-so-nice person who (shocker) had equally not-so-nice friends. They were cruel and judgmental, and I was extremely naive about the entire thing (thinking my positivity could shield me from the hurt their actions caused, thinking he would stand up for me, thinking any of it would change). Throughout all of this, I eventually met one of his friends (a former roommate) who was nothing like his other friends that we saw more often. In fact, he became somewhat of a protector when the group would get together. He would take me aside and try to make me laugh with a cheesy joke. He would build up my dreams after they openly belittled my career. He would see me - wounds and all - and do everything to be there for me. 

One example: The ex and I attended a friendsgiving thing and it was business as usual. I was beneath everyone and they let me know it - while my ex played coy to each awkward interaction and eventually deserted me. Ever the optimist, like always, I did my best to introduce myself and still have a good time. I worked in a completely different field and didn't attend college with anyone there, so I didn't know a single person. Enter: this friend. He immediately pulls me aside, gives me a big hug, walks me to the couch and starts a conversation. Later that night after talking for hours, I see that he's completely intoxicated and I (as DD) offer to give him a ride as we're leaving. I was already driving a car full of other people, so it wasn't a big deal. Months earlier, when I knew I was going to have to sell my car, I drew a heart in the top left corner on the driver's side to kind of 'mark' it. Yes, I'm aware that I'm a dork. It was pretty cold at the time, so it was always faintly there when I'd turn the heat on. No one ever noticed, not even my bf at the time. As we're getting into the car and I turn the heat on, he sees it, saying: ""Aww. Hey, did you draw that up there? Is that a heart? That's so sweet."" Then proceeds to give me a big smile and maybe even flirt a little? I just assumed he was drunk, because anyways, I was in a relationship and that was inappropriate to me. Even though it was adorable, I didn't react/think anything of it because I was dating his friend (!) Total blinders up. 

Fast-forward to now. I am no longer dating the person that introduced us. In fact, it's been over a year since we broke up. I have really enjoyed being single (for the first time in four years), and I have no plans of dating anytime soon while I finish grad school.

But. I really want to reach out to this person and just tell him how much his kindness meant to me. He was a wonderful person when I was dating an absolute monster, and I don't think I could have gotten through those tough times without him. At the same time, I realize how totally random that might seem and since we haven't talked in a long time, I've wondered how that would come across. 

Any advice/thoughts?

TL;DR: I met a gentleman and total sweetheart through an awful ex and after waiting a long time, I want to reach out to him. At the very least, just to tell him how much his kindness meant to me and to thank him for everything he did. Should I bother, or is that just a terrible idea/off limits?

46,"This is a real story and real advice would be greatly appreciated.

 So my boyfriend and I were both virgins and we slept together just about 3 months ago durring late March. It was really hard to get inside as I have never put anything in ( my vagina). We tried out a few different positions to see if it would help out and let him enter. One of those positions was girl on top. His penis was hard and erect, he tried to put it in and have me sit on it but it didn't go in and he didn't want to hurt his penis either so we stopped.

   Well, fast forward a little later, even though we didn't hear any type of sound or ""break"" his penis is semi bent to one side and there was a spot on it with a small bruise. We didn't think too much of it and it didn't hurt him either. We let the bruise heal and by the next day it was pretty much entirely gone. When he's flaccid his penis is still bent and when he's hard it's not that noticeable. He says that he feels his erections aren't as hard as they used to get. I don't think he feels any pain from it. Anyhow, If you guys can leave some advice on how to possibly fix the issue, or if you've had something like that happen to you, what did you do and how is your penis now.

  Whenever you're dealing with your lady parts or manhood it's always concerning as you only have one for a lifetime, I just want to see if there's any good news out there. thanks in advance:)  sincerely, a concerned Girlfriend.",22Jun2017,2

48,"I have completed two years of community college and I am planning to transfer to a large university in a couple of months. However as time is nearing, I feel like I may have made a huge mistake in what I am doing. Let me give some context to the post. I am a 21 year old guy who for a long time has struggled with stagnation, my identity and the lack of motivation. It started around the time after I graduated middle school. I slowly went from the happy cheery guy who was friendly and social to a social recluse who did nothing but go to school just to go home. As time went on, I just ended up being tired and bored of everything. It was a grind to go to school, to work. The only thing that I wanted to do was surf the internet and play video games but even now, I have grown tired of one of the last few things to pass time.

Anyway to bring it back around, I made the decision to go to a public university that I found interesting instead of the original choice I made which is much closer because I felt the reason why I feel this way is because I have become too complacent/ familiar with my current life. I've read about how it took people being completely pushed out of their comfort zone before they finally adjusted and became productive people. Of course there is an academic aspect and extracurricular aspect to the choice as well. I originally felt set in my choice but now I am not so sure because my family have brought up many valid criticisms of my idea.

For one, I do not have a car so that limits travel for quite a while. I was working to get a car before I leave but it looks like it won't happen so it's probably public transportation and walking for me. The second issue is that I lack the skills needed to take care of a place on my own. I don't know how to cook, I don't know how to wash my clothes correctly, I don't know anything about repairing broken things in an house/apartment,etc. Originally I thought that it would be fine since I'd be in a dorm with a roommate and I'd rely on a meal plan or something like that however I apparently missed the deadline for housing and now I am stuck frantically having to find a place to stay while attending college.

Despite all this, I still cling to the hope that everything will just work out and I will be able to attend this school, I went to orientation recently and I loved the school/experience. I also can't keep living how I am anymore. I want to feel happy once again and I want to start living again. I feel like going away to experience the world on my own and find people who are similar to me in personality/thinking as well as meeting contrasting thoughts/personalities. I simply want to become a different person than I am today and I cannot change without going.

I haven't explained this to anyone but I don't think my family will really understand as they are dead set on keeping me with them so I don't do anything like excessive partying/drinking/drugs (I have thought about experimenting in college but I wouldn't go overboard). Anyway I would like some constructive criticism and some nice advice on this. Thanks for reading and I look forward to the responses. ",22Jun2017,2

52,"First, yes, I've been going out of my way to separate everything. Everything we have is separated, phone bills, food, laundry, linen, everything. I'm getting internet but I'll bite that cost by myself because she won't be allowed on it. Nothing is really shared anymore. But sometimes we buy or get similar things. 

Example 1: Dollar General has these food containers with clip on purple tops.  When we first moved in I brought 2 of these. She later brought a bunch more herself. After the Great Divide (the event in which I removed all of my dishes from the cabinet into my room) she says that her amount of containers and tops don't match up so they HAVE to be in my room. I only have 1 of my original containers and the top to that. She's not satisfied with this but decided to drop it. Next time, I brought containers of different colors (but sadly not with the clips) and wrote my name on them.  That ended that at least.

Example 2: A housing company paid for our dishes and furniture and some linen. We each got a set of dishes, linen, cups, pots and pans, and utensils. Included in this is a set of white towel set of 9. Today she accused me of taking her white washcloths out of the cabinets and that I used 6-7 of them. Even combined, we don't have that many fucking washcloths.

 I have all of my set in my room. There's like 4 towels, 2 washcloths, and 3 hand towels. A set of 9 like the package dictates. I don't know where hers went but I sure as shit don't have them??????? She said she saw me take them from her cabinet from her room but that's not even possible. From where her bed is in the room there is no human way she could have saw me unless her eyes were 5 feet long and curved around corners. Even then, there's all kind of things in the cabinets. Even washcloths that a mutual friend gave us both as a house warming gift separate from the towel package and belongs to both of us. That's probably what she saw with her weird curved eyes. 

Anyway, this is a recurring theme with her. ""If it's not in my room or the bathroom, then she must have them in her room. Mystery solved."" How do I curb this habit? It annoys me the whole day and it's like I don't even want to go back at night because an argument could break out.

Edit:I went back as late as I possibly could and a fight still broke out. Yep. Terrific.",22Jun2017,2

61,"I'm a 25 year old female and recently I've been doing a lot of introspection. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now and it has had it's ups and downs. We've broken up twice due to some infidelity (first on his part then on mine) but we are attempting to work through it. We have a 14 year age gap which genuinely hasn't had that much of an impact on ""us"" but I'm starting to wonder if it will or already is.

He's 16 going on 17 years sober and I'm not. I have never felt like I have had a problem with drinking but I'm starting to feel it. We used to live together but due to our last breakup I moved out and we haven't moved back in together yet. We have plans to do so once his lease is up at the end of August. I don't do very well home alone, so when I am home alone I drink to keep my nerves down and to pass the time. Whenever I stay over at his place I don't drink obviously and I don't feel like I notice a difference. 

He's out of town right now but even before he left I felt like I might be developing a sort of dependency on alcohol to sleep or feel ""normal"". I also have a pretty big block in my head about ""asking for help"". I don't want to seem like I'm crying for attention by telling those around me that I feel like I have a problem. 

But I feel like right now I do. The last time we broke up it really did a number on me. He played a bit of a game and it really shook me up. I felt very vulnerable and betrayed with how he went about telling me how he knew that I had cheated on him several years prior and that did a number on my trust and respect for him. Since then I've been trying to rebuild that trust just as he has because obviously I betrayed his trust when I cheated on him. We have come a long way and I am happy about that. 

The night after he left I went to some coworkers house for a get together. I don't normally go out because I work a lot and split my time between helping my sister with her kids and spending time with him. So him leaving was an admitted opportunity for me to be in my 20's again. I didn't tell him about it because I just genuinely didn't think he would care. I got pretty hammered and slept in their conversion van (a van that you can live in) because it was just more convenient. When he called the next day I explained that I stayed in the van at their house but he seemed odd about it. Since then he's been distant and I can tell that something is bothering him. I finally pushed it out of him that he felt uncomfortable with my excuse about the van. I apologized that I had gotten so drunk and that I had stayed there but he told me he didn't know I had been drinking. I was so hungover the next day I neglected to tell him that THAT was why I had stayed in the van. Honestly I wouldn't have lied about that because he has told me that he doesn't mind me drinking. I apologized for not telling him because that obviously seems like I'm trying to hide something. 

I don't think he believes me and I'm starting to lose it. I'm having panic attacks and drinking constantly because I can't get it out of my head that he thinks I'm lying and he's going to break up with me in a shitty, demeaning, condescending way again and I can't get out of that mindset. Over the course of tonight I've come up with plans to just let it all go and accept that I'm over reacting, write him a long letter (which I'm apparently writing to you) breaking it off because I don't want this to be my life, or just breaking up with him because I can't do it again. I can't lose him again.

If this is what is normal to feel in this situation then that is fine and I can get through it. But I don't feel normal. And I don't feel like my coping strategies are normal and I'm worried about it. I feel like I'm losing it. I feel like I am a person that when shit hits the fan I am good at prioritizing the most important and logical thing and working from that. Right now I can't seem to have differentiate between logic and emotion which is causing even more panic. 

Do I sound like a crazy person that needs therapy/rehab? Or am I overreacting to normal relationship drama?",22Jun2017,2

Hello!

I have a 6 month old and am planning to move us out of state. Besides moving for more affordable opportunities, I want to raise my child in a better environment. I was raised by a single mother of 4 with a narcissistic borderline personality. My mother and siblings are extremely toxic people and I dont want my baby to be raised around them for much longer (we currently live with my mom and one sibling because I cannot afford to live on my own).

Unfortunately, it will take about 8 months to a year before we can leave so that I can save enough money (moving out of state is not cheap).

By the time we leave my child will be nearing two years old.

My question is, will my baby remember my family at that age? From what I read online, toddlers develop a pretty strong sense of memory by ages 2-3.

Any advice would be very helpful. Also, any one else experience something similar, and how'd it turn out for you? Thanks!",22Jun2017,1

A little while ago my sister had her highschool graduation party and she invited plenty of her friends. Now this isn't the first time she's had a party but it's the first time someone took notice that I never stay and hang out so they dared me to so I did. Now I'm 20 so I didn't feel too out of place in a party filled with 18 year olds and I ended up having a pretty good time and I made a point to try to talk to everyone at least once. 

when the party started dying down there was one person I hadn't talked to yet so I talked to her and we ended up having allot in common, so much so that we literally talked the night away (my sister's closest friends stay over night during these parties) and she had plenty of opportunities to just leave hell I even said ""it's getting pretty late we should both get some sleep"" and she wanted to stay up and continue talking. 

Before she left I asked for her contact info so she gave me her email address. At first I thought that was weird but then I remembered she mentioned how she doesn't use social media and likes sending letters to her friends etc. and the next day we pretty much continued the conversation where we left off and we even decided to go hiking on Monday. 

Now there are things that bother me about this situation. She's one of my sister's closest friends and that alone just feels a bit weird to me. I mean you don't shit where you easy you know what I mean?Then again, my sister dated one of my friends a few months ago so it's fair game? She's already 18 so I'm good legally. Then while everyone was going home I over heard that she has a boyfriend but she hadn't mentioned him once to me so I don't know if that's a good or bad thing and maybe I'm just looking into all this too much. 

I know there's plenty of fish in the sea and all that but she's really smart so much so that when I started talking about the cosmos, human evolution, and psychology she didn't miss a beat and we had a real back and forth. Usually people's eyes gloss over and it's obvious they're not even listening anymore. It's hard when the things you're passionate about make people feel like they're in a classroom again. 

Why am I here posting at the ungodly hour of 3 in the morning? The more I think about the situation the more I know I'll set myself up for disappointment and for the first time I can't think logically about something. This is literally starting to keep me awake and I need sleep so I'm hoping someone can set my head straight. 



                                      TL;DR

I'm falling for my sister's best friend, we had an amazing multi subject conversation for at least 9 hours straight, I'm a little weirded out she's my sister's friend, my sister dated one of my friends awhile back so it's ok?? She's 18 I'm 20 so everything's on the up and up, she has a boyfriend but she never told me she did so is that good or bad?  We will be going hiking this Monday",22Jun2017,4
97,"21/M here. What is an effective strategy to stop myself browsing and seeing escorts on Backpage? 

I did this in earlier this year as a one-off curiosity and it just multiplied, getting to the point where I was fucking one escort a week in April through May. I have seen total for 14 escorts now, 12 of them for vaginal sex.

I have been paying bare minimum for these escorts, which hasn't been a huge financial blow to me. But now I want to stop and start making friends with benefits and girlfriends with sexier women whom I can fuck on a regular basis. I am already approaching women during the day time, getting numbers and the occasional date (and doing likewise with Tinder and Bumble - I have a date with an 18 year old redhead this weekend). The problem is that I feel less needy if I am getting regular sex and recently I have been using escorts as a crutch for that. The sex isn't so bad but it is neither great. 

I have seen two escorts as of this month. One of them with huge GG tits whom I titfucked for the second time. I have started developing an obsession with her, due to her being the only escort around with a substantial bust for titfucking. Fortunately I won't be seeing her again as she is leaving town permanently. Another was fairly average, but not so bad looking blonde Polynesian, who was the first women I have had vaginal sex with in a month. 

Today I scurried around town looking for the cheapest escorts I could find on Backpage and I ended up walking away as soon as they answered the door (they were private addresses). All of them were trashy looking, aged Asians and I have consciously decided I won't be seeing any Asian escorts ever again. I only fucked up with the above blonde.",22Jun2017,1

99,"I just wrapped up my junior year of high school. It has gone by much faster than I anticipated, and I have yet to make a so-called ""best friend,"" even though I have befriended the vast majority of my high school. I'm from a pretty small town (population is approximately 12,000), so my choice of friends has always been somewhat limited. I'm fairly ""well-liked"" (I think) in my school, but have always been a bit awkward. I have come out of my shell a GREAT deal over the course of the past three years, however. I say all of this to say, I am extremely nervous about making friends at my future university. I never got the hang of it while in my home town, and with senior year finally here, I'm terrified I'll graduate college without a single friend. I would appreciate any advice on making friends at a university. 

A few things that are important to know about me:

1) I am involved in zero extracurriculars. Being that my school is relatively small, we have a very small selection of sports and activities to choose from. We also have zero clubs. Our only sports/extracurriculars are football, baseball, soccer, tennis, track, cheerleading, and band. Since none of these interest me, I have never been involved in them. This makes me worry that I won't be able to connect with anyone once I move off to a university. Will this present a problem, and if so, how could I deal with it?
2) I have never drank alcohol and I have never smoked. I don't plan drinking or smoking in the future either. I'm aware that both play a huge role in college life, but will this decision make it difficult for me to make friends? I do NOT have a problem being around drinking or smoking. I have just chosen not to do either, as they do not appeal to me.
3) Since I plan on attending medical school, my studies will play a significant role in my life while at university. As a result of this, I doubt I will be partying a great deal. Will this decision make it even more difficult to make friends?

I want to fully experience university, and I want to make as many life-long friends as possible. I've always been an introvert, but I'm working on becoming a more sociable person. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated on this topic. Thank you! ",22Jun2017,1

102,"So a bit of a back story. This girl, we'll call her Kailey, and I grew up as childhood friends but went to different high schools and never really hung out after that, then she went off to college (she finished and moved back here). We're friends enough that we talk on facebook every once in a while, but not good enough friends that it makes sense for me to straight up ask her to hang out. So now you're kind of caught up haha.

Now here's the current situation: She messaged me on fb the other day (not something she's ever done first) and we've been kind of going back and forth more than we ever have. I'm a musician and I've been trying to make myself *start* playing around town and gig. I was supposed to open up for someone this weekend and I invited Kailey to come watch me play, and she said yes. Well the person I was going to open up for is a real winner and told me I couldn't play the gig. So I haven't told Kailey about this yet, but I still want some kind of idea of what to say or do to get her to casually hang out. So any ideas?",22Jun2017,2
103,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost half a year and I'm just getting tired of her being mentioned quite often and being in the same group as us. 

They were together for about three years, lived together for a few months, had the same friend group. They've been split up for almost 2 years now, but had initially tried to remain as friends after they broke up (but after her doing some really shitty things, haven't been for 18ish months). She also stopped being a part of the friendship group because she pulled a few stunts on others.

Since we've been together I've been included in their group when we go out but over the past couple of months she's back on the scene and was readily accepted back. I coexist with her in the same group despite not interacting with her. When we were introduced she was quite nasty to me in front of the group but I stood my ground and shrugged it off. She was then incredibly rude to my boyfriend and tried to say shitty things about our relationship but I shut her down. I'm not into the drama. I told my boyfriend that I didn't want her to be a part of my life or any aspect of our relationship and he assured me she wouldn't be. 

My issue is, is that she always seems to be mentioned or bought up by my boyfriend to and around me despite him knowing that she makes me feel uncomfortable. It happens pretty much every time I see him - he does talk about his friends and people he knows often - such as last night, driving home he randomly mentions **""wow, I just realised - *ex gf* has a really annoying voice. Don't ask me why I just thought of that, haha!""** or I'll say how I hope his mother likes me, and he'll respond with something about how his mum hated his ex but likes me, or I'll quickly do my makeup and he'll exclaim how his ex always took so long doing hers. It's just a constant comparison or small things will remind him of her and he feels the need to voice them. 

The other half of the issue is that now with her rejoining group whenever we go out she is constantly out when we are and I feel uncomfortable being around people I actively dislike. I feel like I shouldn't hang around with them anymore but I really like the other people and want to fit in, but I don't want to be in the position to have another confrontation with her or make either of us (or others in the group) feel uncomfortable. Part of me wants to stop going out with them because I'm so sick of her being bought up all the time but then I also feel like I shouldn't have to stop hanging out just because of one person. 

Am I being unreasonable and overly sensitive? Should I swallow my pride and stop hanging out with the group or should I just try to do things as I normally would if she simply weren't there? 

tldr : bf constantly mentions/compares me to his ex, ex is back in the friendship group that I'm now a part of (she wasn't there when I joined) and I can't seem to have a night out without being irritated about her being there. ",22Jun2017,1
104,"Hey guys and gals! I'm turning to the great people of Reddit to ask your advice on how I could catch a fire hydrant-opening criminal. He or she has opened the same hydrant about 25-50 yards from my apartment FIVE times in the last couple of weeks. The local police came over tonight (its 2 a.m. and asked if I could keep an eye out and maybe help them find the criminal. 

How would you do it? I was thinking night cameras or something. It's a small town, so I'm sure the person who's yard the fire hydrant is in wouldn't mind letting me install something. Proximity sensors? A box of donuts and a bear trap?

105,"The most recent example would be a situation with my flatmate Sebastian. He is former sports student, he works out 3-4 times a week and takes great care of his body; His life philosophy is having as much as possible before dying. He has a different girl every week and he also takes MDMA from time to time. 

His habit is to give MDMA to people he takes with him in the club, without them asking for it. He waits until they are drunk, then he gives them the pill saying ""take this, it's fun"". This happened two times now, every time with a girl who was significantly younger than him. So of course the girls would go crazy, and he would take zero responsibility for it, sometimes complaining about their behavior later. They also get crazy about him, kiss him etc.; 

Every time I witness something like that (and I know the girl) I feel really sick to the stomach and it really bothers me the days after. I don't really know why. Maybe it's the fact that this guy take huge advantage of those girls, and the girls seem to like it. Maybe it's also jealousness (even though I had my fair share of sex this year and have a girlfriend). And the realization that the kind of guy whom's actions I despise is getting all the attention he wants.

107,"Hi folks so to cut the long story short, (just to point out im single mid 20s and male) I have a lot of close friends who are girls and I get a horrible jealous reaction to them doing anything with guys. Whether it's making out hooking up or a new relationship as soon as I'm exposed I get an almost physical wave of jealousy anger and disappointment.

I hate reacting this way and it doesn't seem to matter whether i have a romantic interest in them or not. 

Essentially what I'm asking is has anyone here experienced this and how did you deal with it of you did. My only idea at the moment is to stop being friends with girls which is hate to do. 

Any advice would be appreciated cheers!!

108,"My fiance (I guess ex now) and I have been dating for almost 4 years. We have broken up and gotten back together twice, both times after he started going to therapy away. He would push away his friends as well. Now this is the third time this has happened. But the thing is, we both gave each other our clothes twice. (We forgot some and that is fine.) I also gave him back the engagement ring the first day. My mom goes the second time without me to get the rest of my stuff and my ex mentions the ring. My mom said I already gave it to him. He said okay. I went through the bags he gave me back and some of his shirts were in the bag. So a week later, he messages me (After we both agreed if he needed anything from me to text my mother) so he texts me and says hey I need my sweatshirt back (oops I forgot.) and his ring. Along with 3 more items I already gave him. Why is he messaging me this when we stated he'd message my mom?

109,"Dear friends,

I'm an 21 year old Dutch student who has been unhappy for a while. I finished a bachelors degree in Information Science and are enrolled in a Master for Innovation Sciences to start this September. However, I almost know for a fact that this isn't the life I want to get into. Now I've always had a lot of doubt about anything I have done in life, so this is no different. But the feeling that this is not going to make me happy is stronger than ever. I feel like I haven't found a thing yet which I'm passionate about and that makes me sad.

Last night I finally broke down. I told my girlfriend that I'm not sure whether I want to continue what i'm doing, and i'm also not sure if I can still be with her. I came to the conclusion that I just have to do something else and figure out what I want out of life.

I know I'm crazy about Music, storytelling and other things that allow me to create/experience something which other people feel to. Now i'm looking to kind of find a way into this world and I am looking for volunteering spots at festivals/music labels/gamestudios just whatever that gives me some sort of direction on where to go from here.

This has gotten a lot longer than I anticipated. But in conclusion the main advice i'm asking for is places to start. If you are involved with anything, or know good places to start, please let me know.

I had a holiday booked from 26th July until 7th of August, I canceled that as well and hope to spend that time looking for something I enjoy.

115,"First off let me state I am not asking for anything but advice in reference to this as I am not a resident of NC, but I have a friend of mine who is, and I am at wits end trying to figure out if there is anything out there to offer any sort of assistance in this situation.
Current status: Single Mother in 30's of 2 Children both under the age of 12. She currently has a full time job working in nursing home. She works third shift so she can watch the kids during the day/evening hours. She can not seem to get ahead on rent/car/utilities/food. Mind you she lives well within her means, has a room mate and splits a below average rent,  but now that the summer months have approached and the children home every day it has snowballed into an issue. 
The problem she is running into is through State assistance she only qualifies for 200 dollars SNAP assistance, BUT earns enough income to disqualify her from EVERY other available State program. She is currently enrolled in tech school and pursuing a degree but transferring to a new school as we speak because the previous school offered no financial aid. 
I am not used to working and dealing with a situation such as this one (I was spoon fed and dressed by the military for 15 years) but is this just the way society is? A young woman in her 30's trying to better herself and the lives of her family, and just stuck in a never ending rut. If anyone has any experience or can offer me some advice on any possible way for her to get some sort of assistance either State, Federal or Non Profit. It breaks my heart to see this and the undue anxiety, stress, depression this has caused her.

117,"I will try and keep this short.

I work in the supplier quality department of a worldwide manufacturing firm, the site I am at is very secondary to the overall aims of the company and the department comes a distant second to production, delivery and cost.

my job, is totally pointless, like utterly. I had an operation in my leg and was off for 8 weeks and although my pals and colleagues missed me, my work was not done - and it made zero difference to anything. Literally.

I worked on a project for a year for our customer, only to discover that nobody, internally or externally was looking at my work, a whole year wasted.

I am constantly chased for presentations and graphs and charts that nobody ever looks at, I know this as a few have had swear words in them, first by mistake and then by design.

I have absolutely zero motivation and have identified all the issues that our management do that makes morale so low in here (I am really not alone but at least their jobs achieve something)  I have been to management with problems which they agree are valid, I have then offered solutions which again they agree are valid, but nothing changes.

I have asked for transfers, I have applied for other positions but it just doesn't work, I am trapped here.

I have a family and three kids where I make most of the cash to support so I cant leave here as there is nothing in the area that gives the same wage and benefits (life insurance, childcare credits etc), it is the only place that can keep us afloat.

I have been here 14 years, I know the place inside and out but I don't want to be a manager or that because basically they are all brown nosing incompetents and I wouldn't fit in.

my mother in law got cancer a few months back and is undergoing chemo, so me and the wife are under so much pressure its unreal, from this perspective my work is great, they allow us anything we need to help during this time and honestly, I am so lucky to have the chance to change things when many don't, this makes me feel guilty for moaning.

for these two months, I have been utterly unable to focus on my job, adding home pressures to that of work has just made it all but impossible for me to do anything and I have been sitting doing absolutely nothing the entire time - check my reddit history for proof of me doing shit here rather than actual work.

its got to the point where I actively hate coming here, the thought of spending the next 30 years wasting 40+ hours a week of my life for exactly zero purpose is soul crushing.

my home and family life, with the exception of the in-law situation, is brilliant, I couldn't be happier, but surely spending the majority of my waking hours in utter misery is not the answer to those few scant hours of happiness?

that cant be what life is meant to be!!

I haven't covered the half of it, if you want more details please ask, and I know, I really seriously know, I am a moaning fucker who is luckier than 95% of the human race, but its so empty and existence for those 40 hours, I dunno what to do.

127,"Hi. I really need some help with a lot of issues I've been having for a long time now. I don't have any friends to talk to (one of my issues) and professional therapy is expensive. Life has slowly become more boring, routine, and hopeless and I don't know how long I can do it anymore as I've fallen into a serious funk. I'm 19, male, have a job working with my dad, barely started learning how to drive this year and have no idea on what I want to do for a career, have no hobbies, friends, and am taking some online course for a subject I'm finding to be very boring, but have to do anyway just to get a degree.

 
  First off, I have no hobbies or solid concept of what I want to do with my life as a career. I didn't play sports when I was a kid or play piano or anything like normal kids probably did. I just watched cartoons, played with toys, and drew bad pictures. I was interested in working with animals, but as I got older I wasn't so sure anymore. I've always felt inferior because it seemed that so many people I see at school have something that made them special, while I didn't. They could play sports, music, draw, while I sucked at all those things. I would try something, but I can never figure out where to look or how to start. This is even harder when thinking of a career which is more serious and permanent. My mom (who has social anxiety herself) never really made us do anything (me and my sister) or encouraged us to pursue anything, never made me play sports or an instrument or anything. But at the same time I blame my own fear and anxiety for not wanting to do something or being interested in anything. I seem perfectly comfortable with just doing nothing, but I don't want to feel that way, I want to have motivation to get off my butt and find something to be passionate about, but like I said before I wouldn't know where to begin with all these options. I just want to find something I'm passionate about and find a career already because I already feel behind my peers who are in college pursuing what they love. I need a goal or purpose like that to strive and live for or else life is just empty and meaningless.

   Secondly, I have trouble making friends and currently have none. I was very shy when I was little. I've gotten better, but it's still a little hard to talk to people I don't know very well, which is almost everybody who isn’t family.  Anyway, I have had a few friends in my lifetime here and there, but as I got older it became harder to make new friends, as everyone pretty much grew up and found more mature interests while I continued to enjoy things like cartoons and kinda stayed the same. Most people at my high school liked rap music, drugs, thug life, you know the usual stuff. I was and still am afraid that if people found out what I like they wouldn't like me. I don’t like the same music everyone else likes and I hate that about myself as well. It’s a strange combination of interests of mine that I feel no one would like plus with no hobbies I’m boring, giving no reason for anyone to be friends with me. Senior year, I didn't even go to public school anymore, I took online courses that year and it's something I now regret and wished that I stayed, but I didn't think I could go through one more year eating lunch by myself and sitting alone with no one but my thoughts during free time. I am the only person that understands me and the only person I talk to which is weird. I have conversations in my head with myself to the point of saying “your mom” jokes to myself because I have no one else to say those things. I want to be normal if it means getting friends and I've recently started to think of plans to do just that. I’m thinking of dressing like a “gangsta” and rewriting my entire life and personality to fit in and hopefully make some good, popular friends and find some purpose in life, but part of me thinks I shouldn’t have to do that, but another part of me says that times are changing so I might as well change and adapt to survive. 

   I also have trouble dealing with women.  I’ve never been able to speak to a beautiful girl since puberty and no girl has ever spoken to me unless they wanted the answers to an assignment. I’ve been into girls since I was like 5 without ever really knowing why and I still don’t know why to be honest. I assume from watching TV and movies just made me think it was normal to have a romantic partner I guess, and as a result I feel like I should have one or at least have the chance to experience one. Throughout my life I see couples, their love mocking me for what I feel I could never have because I’m not handsome or attractive in any way, just hairy, ugly, and out of shape. I know I was quiet in school, but still not one girl has flirted with me out of curiosity. I know what I look like so I know most of it is my appearance. Never been complimented or called handsome and I do not have a six pack or any noticeable muscle or anything a girl would want. Yet I still dream about what it would be like to have a girlfriend almost every day. There is one girl I can’t get over from high school. She came into my algebra class mid-semester freshmen year and she was so beautiful and I really wanted to go up and talk to her, but I was scared that she wouldn’t like me and had no experience talking to girls, so I never spoke to her, another big regret I have.  Over the next two years I’ve seen her walking around school, had no classes with her, but I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I feel she represents something in my mind which is why I can’t get over her even when I don’t even know what kind of girl she is and we’ve never spoken to each other at all. A couple months ago I got curious about what my former classmates have been up to and recalled some names and searched for them not thinking I was going to even find anything, but surprisingly I found many of the people I went to class with on twitter, including this girl, which only brought back those mixed feelings of sadness, regret, and infatuation. Seeing her and everyone else hanging out with friends, going to college and having lives makes me feel lesser and a complete loser, wishing that I was there with them and under different circumstances could have been with them. I guess by changing who I am, I think I’ll not only belong somewhere, but also win the heart of a seemingly amazing girl, but why I’m so fixated on this one I do not know. I really just want someone to share my life with and to love and hug and kiss like everyone else does.

   I feel so confused, lonely, and aimless, but I usually try to put on a happy and silly demeanor in front of my family and even to myself to mask the pain, using the few things that make me happy to bring me joy. I am trying some things to change myself. Trying to work out with the little time I have and eat better. No progress yet, but that’s another thing I have to deal with. I just feel like I don’t know what to do and need help figuring out what my next move should be and how move on from all of the above problems. I’m sick of sitting around and doing nothing and hate being so lazy, but I don’t know how to get started or what exactly to do. I don’t know how much strangers from the internet can do, but you’re all I have. I’m really sorry that this was so long.

129,"**Background**: I've known a girl through a family friend since we were 13, we are 19 now. We live about 9-10 hours away by car, so we've only normally seen each other for holidays and the like. However, the past two years, we've really connected, and started making trips just to see each other.

I dated throughout high school and now college, so it's not like I don't feel like I have options. That said, more and more I find that me and this girl are growing up to be extremely compatible people. I feel like I have come to love and truly appreciate this girl for who she is as we grew up, and now it completely overshadows any other crush or infatuation I have for people on my own campus (and I have made an effort to try).

**Advice:** I'm visiting the girl this summer. I feel like I need to make some sort of move to show her I can be serious and commit, even if not right now. I don't want to ""claim"" her by going long-distance; she did not date in high school, and therefore probably doesn't have as much of that kind of world experience. I think it's entirely fair if she wants to date in college and find out what she wants. However, as of right now, she exemplifies who I want as a person as I grow and mature. I expected my family and friends to tell me I'm crazy, but they all see it too. I need a way to tell her I could commit to her if she finds I'm a good match for her too, while still giving her freedom to find out on her own.

If she feels the same, the game plan would be to wait until we are done with college to make any real moves. If not, it'll be a rough one, but we would still be life friends, and I'll at the very least have the closure to move on and find the next best person.

The part I need advice on is phrasing this in a way that shows I am serious about her while giving her space and freedom.

**TL;DR:** Don't want to go long-distance with a girl in the interest of allowing her to find out what she really wants, but I want her to know I can commit when distance is no longer an issue.

That was a bit of a read, so thank you for your time and advice.",22Jun2017,6
131,"Hey guys,

So I was at work, have just been working here for 3 weeks. Now, someone called our support desk to reach me. They said they knew about a certain colleague and a project we'd been working on together. Now, the weird part is this:

Communication had gone perfect until I had the phone in my hand. She started saying 'hello?' as if she couldn't hear me. If I'd 'hello' back she'd hear me and ask me for my cell number. I refused at first, asking her what this was about. She started saying 'hello?' again and this was a loop that happened about 4-5 times, until I hung up on her. 

She called back and explained to my colleague she wanted to talk to me about aforementioned project, so we put her through once more. She repeated the first loop again, at this point I was really curious and since she had info about our project and my colleague I thought it should be fine to check it out and gave her my number.

Now, she hasn't called me whatsoever. Is there any weird stuff she could do with my number? (excluding calling/texting/something of the sort)

Just as a precaution I decided to ask this here. I personally think I can just ignore this, but you never know.

135,"I was contacted by a recruiter for an entry level position that is somewhat within my field but not necessarily what I want to do for the long run. They seem excited to speak with me, and given the company, I'm incredibly excited as well. 

The problem is, they recently posted another position that is also entry level, but more within my field,  and the pay is significantly higher.  If I had known this job was available, I would have applied much sooner and then let the chips fall where they may. 

But now, I have an interview scheduled for next week, and I'm not sure if it's a good call to submit this new application, especially if (fingers crossed) I get an offer for the first position. If they offered me this position, but then I also got a call back for the new position, I'm not sure how I'd go about handling that.

I would make about 880 per month before taxes. This is obviously not enough to live on my own. So I planned to relocate to a friend that lives a few states over. The friend is great and everything would work out, I'm just tired of restarting my life (April 2016, July 2016, September 2016) and I would have to do it again if I move to a different state.

137,"Hi there, I come to the conclusion that the relationship I have with my father is toxic and has had a debilitating effect on my mental health. If it were not for the familial connection it's a bridge that would have been burnt long ago.

My father is essentially an emotionally abusive bully who has belittled vulnerable people including my uncle, mother and myself for as long as I can remember. We have all had to deal with anxiety and depression and mother unfortunately passed away when I was 14. 

My father is also a tremendous bigot generally with a head filled with prejudice and wilful ignorance.

He is controlling, intimidating and at the very least is a narcissist but potentially a sociopath. He has tried to armtwist me in going on holiday with him, spending more time with him and even moving in with him. I want the opposite, it wouldn't be a bad thing to have less of him in my life.

I feel I need to tell him straight what I think of where our relationship is at and basic lift the obligation I owe in this father -son dichotomy. I see little benefit in upholding the pretence that it's anything other than a parade of shame. 

I need some advice though. I have a habit of dragging things out and not getting to the point as quick as I should (You may have noticed). I want to tell him straight that I intend to reduce contact and explain why as clearly and concisely as possible. 

I'm hoping he can be brought round to see what I'm getting at after all he doesn't really like me so why is he bothering? What I want to avoid if I can is him going apeshit and coming over and giving me or people I care about grief directly. So please give me some useful words and help me out.

141,"Hello /r/advice!

I am a 23F living with three men (19M, 29M, 31M) in Brooklyn, NYC. Things are getting bad. 

For one thing, they've started imposing some serious rules on the whole apartment and are starting to demand fines when they're broken. Leave a dish in the sink for more than 60mins? That's a fine. Cough while in the kitchen common space? You're not supposed to spend time there when you're sick. That's a fine. They're even considering imposing such fines on guests - friends who come hang out!

Yesterday, 31M found a fork in the sink and 29M insisted it was my fault. It was a lie and when I said as much, 31M told me he ""knew it was me"" and kept accusing me and berating me and yelling and bellowing until I literally broke down and cried. 

This is not the first time they've broken me down like this, either, and not the sole issue at hand, just the most recent incident. It sounds silly in context, but I don't deserve to be screamed at like this for something so small. I don't feel safe at home, I don't feel welcome, I feel stressed and afraid. 

Problem is that I can break my lease (14 months, we're just wrapping up month 2) if I find an appropriate replacement, but I have no money to move my things. There's also the moral quandary of knowingly duping someone into living with these people. And if I break my lease outright and up and abandon the apartment, I lose my security deposit and still have to pay to move. 

What are my options?",22Jun2017,1
142,"My boss and I had a great working relationship and I wish him nothing but the best at the place he works for now. 

The problem was it was just the two of us running a network of about 120 users. I was more akin to help desk support, I ran the day to day things that users encountered, did the busy work and worked on the occasional project my boss would pass off to me. 

This freed up my boss to focus on the things that were out of my league like, security, database maintenance, the more advanced networking, licensing, backups etc. 

This system worked great until my Boss decided to leave. Again I completely support his decision. 

Today is my first day as essentially the IT director for this company, it might be months before they find someone to fill his position. Im stuck here solo. 

Im not sure what to do besides play it by ear and try as hard as I can. 


Anyone in a similar field have any recommendations for trainings, books or areas I should focus on? How much of a raise should I ask for? Im dreading coming into work and Im especially dreading knowing that until we get relief I wont be able to take any time off.

I feel like I need to put this job search on hold until we find out more about what is going on with my daughter and because my current employer has excellent health insurance.

146,"I am female and attracted to males. That I know. But I have little to no sexual desire at all. Rarely, I will enjoy passionate kissing and a little bit of fooling around, but when it becomes sexual, even just touching each other, I just don't want to do it. It feels like a chore and I'm plagued with guilt afterwards.
I had one 3 year 'relationship' (age 16-19) where sex was a massive issue - we tried a few times but each time I just seized up and panicked. He would touch me but I wouldn't really want him to and I would do things to help get him off out of 'duty'. It took its toll and eventually I couldn't even bear being cuddled and the relationship had to end.
I'm nearly 23 now and just starting to see someone new. I had put my experience down to being young and deep in an eating disorder. However, now I am a bit older and have reached a healthy weight (still in recovery) and my feelings haven't changed whatsoever. He has been very understanding as I told him I'm not really all that experienced and said that we can wait until I'm ready... but the thing is, I just don't want to. I've never had any interest in maturation and the idea of being naked with another person, completely letting go, engaging in sexual acts just makes me feel really uncomfortable.
Like I love the idea of being close to someone and being in a relationship with them, just not the intimacy. Like I even thought, I'd probably be happy in a relationship with someone I love, using sperm donation etc to have a family and trust him to be emotionally faithful while satisfying his sexual needs elsewhere. 
Does this make sense? I'm just confused really and wondering if it's just because I'm inexperienced and self conscious or if this is just me and I'll have to accept it...",22Jun2017,15

151,"Okay. I'm 15M with a bestfriend of the same age. Posted here before seeking help for him. Check out my post history if you want to. I don't mind. This is a just an alt account that I rarely use, and today it's going to be a throwaway. 


So around the last month of school, me and him had problems with each other. Bestfriends sometimes disagree and still be friends at the end of the day right? Well in my case I think it's a no. 


When summer finally came we're still in bad terms. We're acting as if we're strangers who apparently knew each other's names. I've told him countless times in online chat that I'm sorry and I'd like to have him as my bestfriend again. Mostly he won't reply but if he does it'll be a single-word reply. Except that one time where he told me I could wait until the start of classes, and maybe he would've cooled down by that time. 


Summer passed and I never chatted him again, he told me he'd appreciate it if I don't chat him the whole summer. 


School starts and damn I feel so awkward whenever he's around. It's like you want to approach someone, but can't. It's like you want to do the things you used to do, but you feel like it's not there anymore. 


Here's the point that I think makes this story as cohesive as possible : I usually have lonely times at night, I have a BIG soft spot for him, and that I'm still hoping that this gets fixed. And he knows these. 


Why? He is the very very first person I've connected so deeply with. He made me feel like I have a brother (I'm an only child), he made me feel wanted (aside from my parents), and everything felt better when I'm around him. Y'know, probs typical bestfriendship. 


Even though I got treated like shit I still want him. It's bullshit, I know. 


The first day of school was just him ignoring me despite my subtle hints to open a conversation. He'd walk away and hang out with his new bestfriend. However, he chatted me later that night and asked me if I wanted to become close again. 


&gt;Hey. Do you still want us to be close again? Maybe if you could make sure that you wouldn't repeat the same mistakes, I could consider that. 


So of course here I am agreeing with him. After that, he asked me what the requirements for a certain subject was. I complied. However I didn't chat anything extra because I still feel awkward. (Red flag 1)


Second day is basically a copy of the first day. Ignored. 


Third day, me and my friends decide to play a computer game together at an internet cafe after school. He tagged along. My friends went home early and we were left together. Just before he was about to finish, he was frantically searching his bag for something. He then said that he'll wait for me to finish so we can go home together. I feel nice because it's like we're getting better. 


Fast forward to the bus terminal he was searching his bag again before finally saying he had no money anymore. So I offered help and paid for him. As we parted ways later I yelled ""Goodbye!"" and he didn't respond. (red flag 2)


Fourth day, which is today, it is exactly like the second day. I tried talking to him but his responses were minimal with almost no emotion. So I stopped. Later that day he forgot to bring art materials, and guess where he went? Of course, me. He first hovered around me during lunch, before finally executing the plan. He told me he wants to borrow mine as he pats my back. Later that day he gives it back with no emotion. (red flag 3).


At this point I'm starting to notice a pattern where he tries to establish a friendly atmosphere first then going to ask me a favor. Right now I'm feeling angry but I'm still hoping for a fix. He's fucking trash but some part of me still wants everything to be fixed. I know I'm still going to give favors to him because I still think it's going to be fixed. It's bullshit. I want to get out of this loop, things have taken a toxic turn as I get abused in a non-existential friendship that only I believe in. So yeah. Help please? 


Sorry it had to be this long I also kinda needed an outlet for my emotions. 


TL; DR : I still believe in the power of friendship in a situation where this friendship is now used against me. Ex-Bestfriend sets up a friendly atmosphere with me to ask a favor, he knows I wouldn't refuse, after that it's back to nothing and he ignores me, until he needs me again. ",22Jun2017,1
152,"My family is invited to dinner to neighbours house. 1 family is visiting another family, and I'm the 23 yr old son of the visitor family. The problem is I never got along with the inviting family's man. He's around 50 and works in the same place as my father. I specifically know what's going to happen tonight, so here:

This guy and I are members of a group on Facebook, a group that people share financial stuff, ask/give advice, and share opinions, news, and financial indicators. I'm doing my MBA in Finance, so I'm pretty active in that group. This guy, who always liked messing with me for some reason, did so in the group several times. He said that I shouldn't give any financial advice, lest people will bankrupt due to my advices. (I never tell people to invest in something. My advices are usually about not listening to big shots in the group, and instead how people should make their own analysis before doing an investment. I also share news from around the world, things that might have impact.) And I managed to shut him up with some witty comment every time. 

Now I'm pretty sure he will make some remarks and try to mess with me in person in this topic. He is an ignorant fuck, he asks the big shots in the group to make analysis **for him**. The big shots I'm talking about are usually fake accounts, and several times they led people to invest in stupid companies, making them lose tons of money while they profited from it. This guy literally asslicks these scammer bastards, calling them ""valuable mentors"" and etc. This is where I'm planning to hit him from in case he messes with me, which he certainly will.

160,"Hello all. I am a student who is changing courses in October and so starting over again which is ok due to X reasons. I have a housing contract with some current flatmates for October but I have realised that I do not like them, nor do I wish to live with them. We have too many differences, they love to drink all the time and never invite me to events. They always go to neighbouring cities/towns and never ask me if I want to go. Furthermore, I am recovering from a bad bout of depression and having been great for a month, I have been feeling really subdued this week due to some of their actions. For instance, one of them asked me if I could talk with her due to something important so I didn't attend a gym session I was really excited for and it turned out to be nothing at all. Literally. She just said she was bored. I know my kindness is in one means a problem as I am too kind and softhearted but I do not want to be exploited. Also, I just don't feel like we are as solid a group as I thought and I still feel like the outsider.

163,"Me (30f) and my friend (33f) have been in each other's lives for about 8 years now. It's one of those friendships that we meet occasionally but we have a close bond. I do consider her a close enough friend but not sure where it is headed. 

She's been with this guy (28m) on and off for 6 years now. He's cheated on her while they started dating and he got married to a girl in hopes of getting US citizenship. Not to mention he's a junkie with no job prospects while she's an MBA graduate working in business development. On number of occasions she's given him money..for his fix I guess. 

Since the last year every time we made plans to hang out she would tag him along without telling me prior. I made plans for just me and her on my bday and he showed up with weed and just hung out the entire time. On another instance I invited her to my cousins wedding and she brought him along without telling me. 

He has a few issues with leaving her alone I think. Every time i call her and he's with her he just has to intervene in our conversation. 

So what really pushed me over was a few weeks ago I told her I'm dating an old friend (he's known me long enough to know I've been friends with her).  My date knows her so it wouldn't have been an awkward thing for us 3 considering the situations in the past with her bf. I was happy about us making plans and she said her guy would be up for it too. 

Come the day of our hangout she tells me her guy cancelled so you should come alone. This was after I convinced my date to come because he always found her shady. He said that some friends even though they are nice to you doesn't change the fact that they are drug addicts. And that if I was ever put in a situation with drugs she wouldn't protect me but side with her bf. Which hurts to hear but I can understand where he's coming from. I'm not into drugs or weed. Being in my 30s I'm so over that scene. 

I found it to be so insulting to just retract an invite like that just because ur bf cancelled. 

I ended up telling her I can't come because I had car issues. 

So which leads me to now where I feel I need to express how hurt I am by her actions. Should it matter at this point since her bf is a controlling druggie. And I don't see any chance of them breaking up.

174,"27F. So I dislike my birthday for the following reasons:
-reminder that I'm the loser in my family
-reminder that I haven't achieved anything
-fear that somebody says something mean to me on my birthday (this fear has lasted 12 years, yes I'm in therapy)
-during summer, barely anybody's home
-I never know what do on my birthday with another person
-I have trouble spending time with people if there's more than one (but I don't want to be alone)

So I think the biggest problem is that I never know what to do on my birthday, which causes a lot of stress for me. So I'd like your advice on building a solid action plan for birthdays, so that my birthday goes nicely, but also kind of on autopilot for future years. So far on the list, I have:

-food.

175,"Okay, so this is a bit of a long story, but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

I was home alone last night when my neighbour dropped by. I have a family member who is currently in hospital and that he's quite friendly with, so I assumed he was calling in to ask me about how they were doing. On a side note, this neighbour calls around regularly as he knows my parents. I know mainly him because of that, but personally I really only know him on a casual basis. Weather/work/how are you type conversations. We're acquaintances rather than friends I'd say.

Anyway, when he dropped by last night to begin with there was the usual chit chat - work, how was your day, etc. Then out of that blue he began dropping what I considered sexual hints and innuendos. He wanted to play a question game and to me it was clear what sort of questions he wanted to ask. He straight out asked me about boyfriends and what was the weirdest thing anyone has ever done to me. I was shocked as this was completely unexpected. I told him flat out that I was not answering the question and that I was not playing the game. He told me I could ask him anything. I refused, but when he persisted I asked him if he had any holidays planned (not the type of question he was hoping for).

I tried to steer the conversation towards neutral ground (I know I should have just told him to get the hell out there and then.) and talked about what was on the TV, etc. 

Soon after he asked me if I liked massages. I said no. He asked me if it was because I was ticklish and asked me to move next to him (he'd already moved closer to me by this point). I refused and started playing around with my phone, pretending I was texting someone. I couldn't believe what was happening. I said to him that I didn't know what was going on or what had gotten into him. He laughed and said he couldn't be this way with me when other people were around. He said something about two sides to his personality. He made comments about my figure and the clothes I was wearing and tried tickling me/touching my leg multiple times. I swatted his hand sway, moved away from him and jokingly threatened to scream/knock him out, although I was prepared to attempt do both if it came to it, etc.

I kept my tone quite casual and generally just tried to laugh off his innuendos/advances. I know I shouldn't have dealt with it like that. I was just nervous and unsure how to deal with him. I'm 5’ 3”. He's 6’ 3” and has a big power advantage over me.

He continued his sexual innuendos and asked how he could get me sitting on his knee. Again, I refused and said no. He is engaged with two children and I told him that he was being inappropriate. He just said what she didn't know couldn't hurt her.

I just wanted him to leave so badly. To cut a long story short, he did eventually leave, but not before picking me up off the sofa. He grabbed me with one arm around my waist and the other between my legs. I screamed for him to put me down and he did, but not before pinching my bum.

I feel so horrible and stupid today for not dealing with the situation better. I know up should have told him to leave, but stupidly I didn't want to be rude and kept hoping he'd get the hint, take no for an answer and leave of his own accord. I feel like such an idiot for allowing his nonsense to continue for so long, but my laughing it off was part natural reaction to a completely unexpected situation and part because I was alone and didn't know what way he'd react if I told him to get out. I had jokingly mentioned a few times that I'd scream the place down and someone would come to see what was going on. I mentioned a neighbour who had been out doing their garden all day and he just laughed and said they wouldn't come, that they had probably gone inside to relax for the evening after all their hard work. He said it jokingly, but given the situation I really didn't know what way to take anything he was saying.

To be clear I have NEVER given this guy any reason to think I'm into him. On the contrary, I've always tried to keep my distance as I'm not a fan of some aspects of his personality in general (Always talks about work and money, seems to have a tendency to bad mouth others, etc.), but last night showed a whole other side to him that I had never seen before.

I'm quite disillusioned by the whole situation. He knew I was home alone and that my family weren't due back until today (his own girlfriend is also away at the moment), so I feel like this was possibly a calculated move on his behalf. I have no idea if he's tried this kind of thing with others or if she has any idea that there's this side to his personality. Generally, he comes across as a laidback chatterbox who'd get along with anyone, but this was a side I'd never seen before.

I have no idea what he will say or do when he next sees me. I'm just so annoyed with myself for not kicking him out. As bad as I feel, I feel like it's my own fault for not dealing with the situation effectively.

I don't know what to do other than ignoring him/distancing myself as much as I can.

EDIT - I forgot to mention that he even asked if he could trust me not to tell anyone what he'd been doing. I said I wouldn't, again not sure of his reaction if I said I would given the situation.",22Jun2017,1

177,"I started a new job about a month ago, and very quickly started to notice how competitive people here are as far as taking credit for things and being in the spotlight.  This is a huge difference from my last job even though the companies are remarkably similar and in the same industry.  A couple examples, one of my teammates told me about some information our boss had been looking for, which I had happened to stumble upon earlier that week.  His reaction was to tell me to send it to him and he would send it to her.  There are many more examples of this as he is constantly wanting to be the go between for her and others, and I see no other reason than he wants to take credit.  Second example, everyone in my area is being moved down the hall because of some ongoing renovations, when I talked to my boss about this, her version of the story was that she was not happy with where our team was sitting and so she was having us moved to a place that would be a nicer environment.  I know this isn't true because everyone in my area is being moved, most of which who are not on her team, and she would have no authority to relocate.  This behavior really bugs me, it seems childish and petty and I don't want to play this game, but also don't want to be passed over by people who do.  Any advice on how to deal with this in a responsible way to try and call people out on this behavior?

179,"Me and my mum moved to a different city, leaving my dad, when I was 4. I visited him on the weekends or something like that I think, but we weren't very close. My dad said that even then I kind of sensed something wasn't right, and wasn't very 'happy', I guess, around them. The mum side of my family hates my dad. The dad side of my family isn't really fond of my mum, either, although they're more of those people who conceal their real feelings, so they try to hide that fact. (Although once when I visited my great-grandfather, the only words I remember him say, when I was introduced to him, were: ""is that the one with the bad mother?"" I was furious.) I don't think my parents have talked to each other in years.

My dad now lives in the same city as I do, with a new wife and a daughter who's 6 years old. At first when he moved here (I think I was 8) we tried the weekend-visiting thing, but I remember I didn't really like going there because I felt like I wasn't welcome, so now I only visit on big occasions like my birthday and Christmas and stuff like that. We sometimes go to the cinema with my dad. It's the only thing we do with him, really.

Holidays are the worst. I'm usually with my mum, since I live with her, but sometimes there is the question of ""where will I be?"". Making that decision is hard already, since I would like to be with both parents, and my mum and dad don't make it any easier. When I (let's say) tell my mum I want to go to my dad's place, she basically doesn't talk to me for the rest of the night, and when I tell my dad I want to be with my mum side of the family he flips out and starts asking if it was my idea or if someone's pushing me to go there. Just a few months ago there was this occasion where it was my mum's brother's and dad's mother's birthday at the same time, and my dad kept insulting my uncle for basically existing and me for wanting to go to his birthday. It's ridiculus. I ended up going to my uncle's birthday as promised and paid a visit to my grandmother later, which turned out to be better anyways since we got to talk one-on-one.

(You can skip this bit it's just to demonstrate that my mum is a dick about the whole situation, too) 18th June is my birthday, so on 20th I went to my dad's house to celebrate. Everything was fun, I spent time with my sister and everything. It was great. My dad's mother made an album for me, with my baby pictures. On the front page, there is this really old black-and-white picture of my mum and my dad, in leather jackets and stuff, on a bus or subway I think. The point is they look really great. I was absolutely in love with this photo so I thought that maybe it wouldn't be so bad to show it to my mum. Ooooooh what a terrible mistake that was. She didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. I ended up going out and crying in the park for an hour, complaining to my friend in facebook.

That one's kinda on me. Should've known better. But the thing is, it's almost always like this. I can't talk about anything remotely related to my dad without her giving me the fucking silent treatment, or being passive-agressive.

How do you deal with parents that basically despise each other? What the hell should I do on holidays? It's seriously tearing me apart, and it has been since I was old enough to realize that something was wrong.

take care :&gt;

Anyways, yesterday the same thing happened while i was on the phone with my bff. Again, i didn't think much of it until he called me back and said ""who was that talking?"" which my response was ""what are you talking about?? my phone just froze."" 

He went on to explain that after he had lost contact with my line he heard the voice of a (Russian?) man. He said he had heard a man with a Russian accent asking him who he was. My bff was confused and thought i was playing a joke on him, which was absolutely not the case.

Long story short, someone accidentally invited a person, who leaked a *very* personal secret about me, to my party.

I would love nothing more than to tell this person that they can't come, but I've tolerated her to the point she has no idea I don't like her and I feel that it might hurt her feelings a lot.

On top of that, nobody invited knows that I don't like her, and she's been friends with them longer than me.

I would just change the date of the party without telling her, but I invited her boyfriend (we're friends) and, with who I've invited, she'd find out. 

Also, I have a history of not delivering on parties, unfortunately, and she's complain to someone if she thought I'd cancelled another one, and so I'd have to tell the truth in that scenario, which would hurt her feelings.

I really don't want her to come. It's only a small party, so I'll be forced to interact with her and **HAVE HER IN MY HOUSE**, and she's not the type of person I want to be associated with anyway.

194,"Hi Reddit, first of all thank you if you take the time to read my post. Okay so what happened was that yesterday me and my bf got into an argument the kids were not I front of us when we did. (My 1 year old and I care for my sisters kids.) He didn't even lay a hand on me. He broke a hole into a window while I was not there because he threw a keyboard and bounced back up. Me and him have been together for 4 years and I'm happy. The baby loves him as do I. So the problem is that my sisters kid 8 year old told the cops that he slammed the car door shut on his foot which it never happened there's not even a scratch on his foot and I never even saw that happen. He did not cry at any moment or even tell me anything. So obviously the cops had to contact dcf and now I'm being investigated and was told that if I don't put a restraining order on him my child will be taken away. I was removed from the house and now on my sisters couch. My nephew also told DCF that there was an incident that he through something at his head in which he never did. I think my sister is telling him what to say. My boyfriend has never hurt a child. Since the beginning of me getting with him my sister would stop at nothing to seperate us. This time this is her way of doing it. My question is what can I do to be able to just be a family again? I want the best for my son and our family. Also if she knew that her son was ""getting"" abused why would she still drop him off at my house?! Like it doesn't make any sense. What can I do to fight this? I don't want my child taken away he is my life, I want us to be a family again, I'm seriously going to stay away from my sister after this, there's no changing this it's gone too far. Believe it or not I think that she's always hated me because when I was born 17 years after her my mom and dad (not same dad) has their things together and I grew up with everything I wanted, where she couldn't and had to use old clothes and such which I had no control over. In the past when me and my mom stayed with her (my parents were fighting.) She kicked me out even as a minor because she didn't like that I wanted to hangout with my friends.

204,"I'm not sure how to explain my situation without writing a post so long nobody will bother reading. I'll put a tl;dr at the end. I'm kind of long-winded, sorry. 

My ex-girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. We'd had a fulfilling relationship with few problems. I loved her, and she loved me. 

Shortly after we met, a close friend of mine passed away. I tried to stay afloat, but turned to drinking to keep myself distracted. While I managed to cover it up well enough to hide it from my family and girlfriend, the effect alcohol had on my academics was enormous - I went from being a straight-4.00 student to failing every class I took in a single semester. 

I was recessed from university for a year, in December of 2015. In June, my girlfriend became my ex, saying she didn't want to 'wait' for me - she had already graduated, was earning $70,000 per year, and enrolled in a high-quality MBA program (I'll be passive aggressive and note I did much of her coursework for her). 

Her biggest complaints were not that I'd screwed up, but that I was graduating a couple years late and wasn't earning money. 

That's understandable, I think, but it's led me to develop the worst inferiority complex about my income and current status. 

I'm 23 now and I'll probably graduate closer to 25. My breakup was long enough ago I want to start meeting other people, but I feel 'unworthy' because I work a menial part-time job and am 'too old' to still be in college. That, compounded with a lifetime of feeling ugly (I've never had problems dating as an adult- my first ex was beautiful, and my second flattered me about my appearance - but I was bullied a lot growing up for being a 'nerd'), has made me feel like there's no use looking for anyone. 

I feel like I'm an interesting guy. I've traveled to dozens of countries, have my own little business, and lived alone overseas for a couple years. Heck, I even ride a motorcycle.

I've done some stuff I think is cool, and I used to be proud and confident about it all. 

Now I feel like it all takes a backseat - my stories, my sense of humor - to how little money I currently earn, how I'm graduating late, and how I have a small stomach and mediocre musculature. 

I feel ashamed every time I put on my uniform for work or go have to go outside wearing it.

When I went out to get lunch today, for instance, I noticed a girl looking at me. Maybe she was checking me out, or maybe she recognized me from someone, or maybe she was just lost in thought - but all I could do was think, ""She probably thinks I'm a fucking loser for wearing a delivery uniform."" 

How can I stop thinkig like this? 

I'm talking to a girl right now who's very ambitious and very smart, and who seems to like me. But I don't even feel like I deserve the interest from her, because I've fucked up so much and could be doing so much more than I currently am. I know I'll get things back on track, but I don't want to wait another year and a half before I graduate to try meeting someone. 

tl;dr - fucked up at school because of friend's death, drank a lot, got recessed for a year. Girlfriend broke up with me because I was graduating late and not making any money. Now, a year later, I still feel terrible about myself because I'm poor, am 23, and don't have a degree. Even though I'm back on track to graduate in a year and a half, I feel undateable.",22Jun2017,1
206,"I did poorly in high school, barely graduated and did so a semester late.  After that I did poorly in JC for a few years - I chock a lot of this up to depression and the fact that I did not want to be there, just went because it felt like it was something I was supposed to do.  Parents were getting tired of me, and I was pretty fed up with the situation myself so I joined the Navy.  Served for 5 years, was pretty good at it, got some awards, decided I didn't want to spend my life submarining and finished out honorably.  I moved back to California and have been essentially operating at a loss since (my rent, bills, and car insurance make up about 70% of my income and I've maintained a modest but not joyless lifestyle).  I still do have some savings and a small fortune in inheritance money on the way.

I have a fair amount of college credits, about 50.  I also have a lot of D's and F's and Fw's on my academic transcript.  I went back for one semester and got 2 B's and a D.  The D was my fault as any bad grade is, however that class was atypical and not the kind I would ever take again - that experience aside, I believe that I'm now mature enough to perform academically. 

So, I would like to use my GI bill to go to school but would prefer not to go to a typical JC with a bunch of teenagers.  My poor academic record is a serious threat because my understanding is if I use that funding and have a low GPA, that I'll lose it and have to pay back the money.  I am a bit hesitant to try online-only universities because I've heard negative things about them and because I'm an internet addict, I worry that I'll be easily distracted and/or make slow or inconsistent progress.  I will say that go at your own pace style courses are appealing as I have periods of very high and very low motivation.

I am willing to move, I'm already planning to because the cost of living in CA seems too high to make sense to me financially.  Would even consider going overseas but would require English coursework, my Spanish is pretty good but not good enough.

My primary interest is in writing, I believe I have a talent for it.  I think the optimal situation would be to live somewhere with relatively low cost of living where I could also do an internship simultaneously for some sort of publication-preferably in tech or left wing political (you can take the liberal out of CA but...) sectors.  This is a significant change for me as most of my work experience has been technical in nature although I've also done political organising.

I guess I'm just looking for what's out there, I'm hoping there are some more appealing options for second/third chancers like myself than what I've seen.

Edit: I'm also very concerned about what to do about my transcript, I don't want to lose my GI bill but starting entirely from scratch seems wasteful.",22Jun2017,1

211,"     My mother was murdered when I was 2 years old and I'm not sure exactly how it works but my brother and I were payed out 6 figure sums from an insurance company. Since my brother was 18 at the time, he received all of his share money. I, like I mentioned earlier, was only two years old so the insurance company held the money for the next 16 years. 
     When I turned 18, my father and I went to close out the account and withdraw the money which by this time had compounded to half a million dollars. When we got there though we were informed that a relative of my mother had signed off on a a document that said that the money would be split up and paid to me monthly for the rest of my life in the sum of $1,500. My father worked to get this undone because she was not my legal guardian at that time or any other point of my life, my father has always been my father. Unfortunately he kept hitting dead ends.
     I'm currently in college so I started to take the payments and paid 2/3rds towards my tuition. Unfortunately it's not enough. I have loans to pay off, the tuition, and other bills. Also that money could be invested in rental properties or stocks and would make everything much easier.
      I called the insurance company and they said that I could fax them a letter explaining that the the relative was not my legal guardian but that since I started taking out payments my chances were close to none. I had to take the payments though or else there was no way I could keep up with my tuition. Any and every suggestion, recommendation, tip, hint, piece or advice would be so very helpful. I have two months to get my tuition straightened out before the school year starts. Thanks in advice Reddit community.
     TL;DR - A relative signed off on an annuity policy that says I can not receive the full sum and can only receive monthly payments even though she was not my legal guardian.  The insurance company says I have no chance to overturn the decision because I already started taking payments to help pay my tuition. I'm looking for any help. I'd really like to solve this in two months so I can pay off my college debt before the next school year. ",22Jun2017,1

First, a user chooses a vacation spot that they would like to go to. Prices for tickets, hotels etc can all be viewed within the app. There will also be a forum in which users can seek travel related advice. Once everything has been decided, the user sets the destination as a goal for their group.

Next, a savings plan is created for each individual member of the group. A direct withdrawal will be set up so that $x will be put into a savings account periodically so that enough money is saved by the goal end date. Progress is tracked and can be viewed by other group members. Individuals can also post to social media to ask their family and friends to contribute to their goal.

Milestones will be set up throughout the savings journey, and reaching these milestones will earn users rewards such as air miles, which can be applied to their trip.

Once the group has reached its goal, the vacation can be purchased through the app.

Ever since I got back to the States, I have been working with immigrant populations, teaching them English and work readiness. Now I have been at a government job for 4 months, in a sterile office setting where I'm not gaining any traction with any tasks or people. It just seems like my role and responsibilities have fallen by the wayside, and I'm not that motivated to do anything about it.
All my friends are paired off and don't really hang out with me that much. I live in a huge, cosmopolitan city with no end of things to do. My apartment is great, but kind of far from my friends. I love it, though, because it's big and well-furnished. I have lived in it for 8 years. Sometimes I tell myself that my staying there is a reaction to having had a really itinerant first-half of life.

Last year, at around this time, I had a manic episode and was asked to leave work at my previous job until I could provide a doctor's note to show that I'm working on it. The episode was a culmination of drinking, soft drug-use (just 420), and loneliness. I'm lonely in the sense that my friends are getting further from me; I don't really crave a girlfriend... just a hook-up. I've been prescribed medication (Remeron, Zyprexa, and Prozac), and have made it a point to exercise, drink less, and 420 less, too. Things have gotten better.

I hope I'm in the right subreddit for this. I'm a Caucasian guy from Germany and I've been single for about 1,5 years after a 10 year relationship. I use various dating apps pretty successfully if you can call it that, but I haven't found the right person for another serious relationship yet.

Here is the thing. I vastly prefer Asian girls(ex-gf was Asian too), especially Japanese and Korean, over any other ethnicity. And I'm not only talking about sex here. Ideally I want to be with and possibly marry a Japanese or Korean girl and spend my life with her. It's just the whole package of looks, character, voice, etc. that is most attractive to me. Obviously every individual person is different, but there are clear tendencies in my opinion. I know from personal experience that a lot of Asian girls prefer white guys too but they are very shy about it and are afraid they might not find them attractive etc.

What I'm looking for is way to find an Asian girlfriend other than just talking to every attractive Asian girl I meet on the street.

The reason why I'm even thinking about this is that Asians are a pretty small minority in my country, not to mention Japanese or Korean people specifically. It's hard enough to find the right girl as it is, try finding her in ~1% of the population.

How do i go about this all? ",22Jun2017,1
272,"Very, very long story short: My mom has suffered from severe depression for the last 7 years. Two years ago she went to Europe to visit family and ended up collapsing. She was in a coma for 3 weeks. Thankfully, she woke up, but suffered severe nerve damage. She is in a 24 hour care facility in Europe and unable to walk. We (her immediate family) live in the US. We want to bring her back to the US so she can receive care here. We are also hopeful that being around family may help her recover a little bit more.

My questions: 
1. How do we even begin the process of getting her over here? Are there certain airlines that will accommodate disabled persons more than others? 

2. Would one of her family members have to fly with her or can the airlines provide a care-giver for the flight/layovers/etc?

3. If and when we get her back over here, are there programs we can enroll her in to help pay for her care? We are more than happy to contribute to her care, but she will need to be in a 24 hour care center and I am sure that can be very expensive.

4. Does anyone have any experience with this type of situation and can give any knowledge or advice? 

We miss her terribly and I know she wants be home. She is still able to communicate with us and she has been very vocal about wanting to come back--just a matter of getting this done. 

Thank you Reddit...I am hopeful I came to the right place for some much needed help. &lt;3",22Jun2017,1
273,"I know this sort of thing gets posted a lot on this sub, so I'm sorry. I've got my prom on Saturday, and it's for an all boys and an all girls school- I go to the former school. I really want to talk to new girls who I don't know (which is like 95% of them) to make some new friends or maybe more than that...

But, since I haven't had any experience with talking to girls I'm pretty shy and end up saying stupid things. And also they all go around together and I feel outnumbered but if I talk to them with my male friends I don't end up talking at all. I'm also worried that they'll be mean. Like if I say hi they'll say go away or just act rude which will make me feel really upset (I know, I'm stupid right). So if this happens my confidence will be damaged for the night. 

So what's a good way to introduce yourself? What are some good conversation topics? Do you know any tricks for stopping being anxious and gaining confidence at crucial moments? And how to not be so upset if I encounter harsh or misunderstanding people? Any other general advice on any issues mentioned is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much, all of you on r/advice have been great to me many times before.",22Jun2017,1

At night she will sit on the steps, and everyone can hear it. I guess my question is where can we take her? My mom said no to the humane society I said I'd take her I can not stand the dog what so ever. She lays in the cat litter and just makes a giant mess that my brother (owner of the dog) does not clean up so it falls on to me.. Is there any alternatives rather than the humane society?

288,"To put it simple I was feeling stuck at work, like I was walking a circle that never ended. So I quit my job. The plant said I could come back whenever I felt like I was ready to return and that a ""depressed worker is never a good thing"". So it's not like I'll be looking for work when I get out my funk.

Now I'm also not hurting for money in any sense of the word. I have $300,000 in a savings account and in my personal bank account I have $123,000. 

I've been working and saving since I was 14. The longest stint I wasn't at a job was about a month and that was training for a job.

I decided that I needed a break for my own mental health. So I took one. And now my wife is pissed. She has already said ""If you don't go back to work before July 1st I will be leaving you and taking the kids"".

Now she was raised in a family where her father was always working until he hit retirement age, even though he didn't need to. So she thinks that a man should ""always be working"". While she has never worked a day in her life. She has a degree in accounting she has never even put to use.

She said ""I don't want your money so don't worry about losing that in the divorce I just don't want to be married to a lazy good for nothing""

A ""lazy good for nothing"". I am 36, I've been working since I was 14. That's 22 years. I've saved my money so I could do an early retirement. I pulled myself out of bad situation after bad situation because I grew up in a ghetto.

Yet I'm a lazy good for nothing because I wanted a break from working for a month.

Honestly I wouldn't be at all surprised if this was already in the works. She had been distance lately and I saw her looking at single bedroom apartments online the other day.

I just, I don't know what to do. Mentally I'm shot between the constant working, this, one of my kids getting ready to leave for college and the other buying and selling drugs... mentally I have nothing left.

I'm tempted to tell her to go but at the same time, she's the only person I've ever loved and been with... my mind is telling me ""let her go"" and my heart is saying ""Don't let her go"".

Anyone got any advice at all on this?

We moved to Charlotte in December from NY and needed a cosigner for our apartment due to income requirements so we filled out all the paperwork with my mom as the cosigner. When we got here they said it was invalid because she is retired so we gave them my step dad's information and they allowed us to move in. Then they said they needed more information in order to approve him so he called and left multiple messages, but no one ever returned his call. Long story short, they never went through with approving him. We recently purchased a house (closing in September) and we saw the apartment has a $2,000 buy out to break the lease. My question is- would our contract be considered invalid since all parties have not signed the contract? Do we have a shot at getting around paying the $2,000?",22Jun2017,1

292,"I moved out for college about a decade ago and have been living across the state ever since. A couple years ago, she had what turned out to be a false cancer scare, or maybe an unconfirmed sighting of it, or maybe it went away and came back (no idea, and the doctors won't say for sure.) Anyway, it's pretty certain now that she has esophageal cancer. We're waiting on results to show if it's spread and how severe it is. Treatment is totally up in the air. Initially, two years ago, the doctor said that if it's cancer, it appeared to be localized and could be surgically removed. Now she may need a combination of treatments (especially if it's spread) and from what I'm reading, the prognosis doesn't look very encouraging.

I love my mom so much but we're both extremely poor. She sleeps on a couch in the living room of a house she shares with her brother. Otherwise I would just set myself up in an apartment with my savings or relocate to a secure new job there, but I just don't have that. It'll be a huge life change and risk for me to move. I'm fully prepared to do it, especially if results come back that are not good.

My main question is, should I just do this now? Should I not wait? Should I move there immediately and spend as much time there as I can? Will I regret waiting? To anybody who has ever gone through this and lost a loved one, first of all, I'm so sorry. Second, is there something you know I should be doing differently right now? I call her every day. My SO and I visited her recently and plan to do so again soon, and regularly, until we potentially move there. I just can't shake the thought of her sitting alone in her house with cancer afraid and feeling like I'm out having fun and not thinking of her. (My dad died about a decade ago but she lives in the same town as all her siblings and her parents.)

I don't want her to suffer alone but I'm neck-deep in debt and bills that I can't afford and moving will be a huge process. Not that I'm not prepared to do it, I just don't want to jump the gun and make her feel guilty or anything like that. Not that she should, but she's that kind of person. But I secretly fear that she's hoping I'll move there right away and wondering why I'm not doing it. I guess part of me is afraid of leaving behind everything I've known for so long and that doing so will really cement how real this is.

On a related note: Anyone else have experience or a relative with esophageal cancer? We have no idea if it's spread or not or how serious it is, but she definitely has symptoms (trouble swallowing, keeping food down, also serious acid/ulcer issues, and she's reported lately that she feels tired all the time.) Should I be ready for the worst or is there any hope at all?",22Jun2017,3
293,"TL;DR: Is there such thing as too old to start out as a hair stylist?? Did I miss my chance? Is the price of starting out going to pay off in the end??
I'm 28/F, I took cos in highschool (forever ago) and worked at a salon as a receptionist/ helper for a while but I took a completely different career path more suited to my passion of cars. I became a mechanic. Well, I've been enjoying this less and less and feel like I would be happier as a hair stylist.
Is it too late for me to go to school and start over? Do you have any advice? What if I don't even have the hand skills to do it anymore? I'm really good at doing my own hair and I get mine coloured every 6 weeks, I feel like it's something I could do.

295,"I've noticed (as well as my friends) that, other than taking things too seriously, I have a bad relationship with stress and ""doing work"". Ever since I started high school,
 (probably even before then) I would have to do something productive every day. I just thought that was normal. I always felt guilty for taking breaks whatsoever. And if I did take breaks, it would have to be progressive enough to overcome the guilt (reading a book, progressing in the main story of a video game, etc.).

 Now, this has worked somewhat. When summer hits, however, it doesn't. And now it's the summer after high school and I don't know how to deal. I've been trying to continue to learn how to drive, find a job and get my finances in order to continue onto college. I even planned to figure myself out religiously, to do more game design, to learn music theory and to finally make a workout plan. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I don't feel satisfied when I finish my daily to-do list and I begin to feel like human scum when I go to YouTube, read, or play games. Poetry and game design aren't helping either.

I don't know. I guess I just wanted to ask how the general subreddit deals with this issue.

BTW: I decided not to mention depression because I'm not diagnosed but I know I need professional help. I hope to get some during college.

The owner hired me knowing that I was more or less just looking for experience hence the low pay.

I would not like to see my marketing degree go to waste but have had a difficult time finding any entry level marketing positions to help me before I obtain my degree.

299,"I'm coming up to six years out from graduating university with a Drama degree. In that time, for various reasons, I've not been able to find any work or useful career experience in that field - like a lot of graduates I've struggled to move beyond retail/customer service roles.

I've spent years unemployed (living in a rural area with a family dealing with lots of financial problems) and amenities and jobs in general have been scarce - prospects for a drama industry job are nil.

I've managed to land myself a very low level job in an office and have worked it for a year. I want out. The job has zero prospects for development/promotion/expansion. I am stagnating.

I'm now at a point in my life where I can't afford to retrain or move to an area with ""better"" prospects for landing a job in that industry, I have a partner and I am unable to place the financial burden of our life solely on his shoulders.

 So I've had to make do with trying to build a career with what little experience I have. However, I'm always tripped up in interviews by being asked why with my degree I'm trying to land a job in admin/customer service/whathaveyou.

I'm often asked if I would ""jump ship"" if a degree-related opportunity arises. I've given every (to my mind) conceivable answer to this question from the spectrum of yes to no. How am I supposed to convince employers that I've not wasted my time or that I'm merely trying to settle. Not helped by the fact that deep down I know I have and am.

How do I respond to these questions? How am I supposed to sell myself when truthfully I'm only applying for these jobs due to years of mismanaging my life.
