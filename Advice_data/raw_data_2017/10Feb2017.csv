3,"Hello. I'm a mentally challenged person (aspergers/psychosis/etc.), and I seek advice for putting together a proposition to fund raise a small amount of money of around 10 bitcoins.

Here is my situation - I'm disabled and programming software has basically been all that I have done career wise. Apart from some volunteering i do, my current full time en-devour is to create a computer game that I have needed to create for some time, because in around 2000 my favorite computer game of all time (edit: game is Uplink) was released, and ever since I've wanted to produce a game of equal measure and I'm confident that I can with determination as for many years I have been designing a predecessor.

I have been hard at work coding a prototype with which I aim to use to finish a minimal viable product. My aim is to release the computer game for free download costing nothing to play, and to make open source when version one is completed. To then continue to work on the product as an open source project.

I have added multi monitor support, and am using the opengl graphics library framework (GLFW). There are a few issues with multimonitor support that are still being corrected by the GLFW project, and in the mean time I still have alot of coding to do myself, however I have come to the point where I feel the need to ask a professional to assist me with some coding, by offering payment for his time.

I also feel that because I only have my laptop and television to test multi monitor with, I could really do with a new desktop computer and multi monitor setup (for rotations and multiple disconnection debugging etc.).

I realise that to receive one must first give, as life is very much about give and take, however, I am finding it difficult to keep a development copy of my program that isnt ""polished"" as there are bugs that I'm working on and things that I'm constantly tweaking. I'm not trying to make excuses, but I don't feel ready to provide anything more than a couple of screen shots at present (once I've made a few changes).

The questions I have are:
Should I just continue coding until I have something more solid before trying to create awareness?
What is ideal for me to give before I seek donations / investment?

Writing this I now feel a little silly because clearly I have more work to do, which is why I'd really like to get in some help/ obtain a multimonitor setup as it is an integral advancement to old feature requests for the game that I am attempting to supersede, but I'm reluctant to go open source straight away as I don't have much experience with open source projects and I intend to release the source code for free later down the line anyway once it is truly heading in the direction I'm satisfied with.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope that I can learn what is best to do in this situation without sounding like too much of a novice and I wish you all a nice day. Thank you",10Feb2017,2
4,"I am a very all or nothing kind of person. It's always been black or white with me and not a real room for gray. Now as many of us I enjoy going on different sites, but I'm going out of my mind trying to keep up with all the content! This has been going on for years now!

To summarize what I try to do daily

- Read all articles on Kotaku
- Read all articles on Gizmodo
- Watch about 50+ YouTube video's (daily)
- Browse through 3 of my favourite subreddits viewing every single post
- Read my Twitter constantly which gives me about 200+ notifications a day (I have them turned on for certain people)
- Watch Late Night shows from the previous day (like Colbert and Conan)

All this while playing random games and catching up on my favourite TV-shows is completely impossible.

My bookmarks of things to read and watch is completely filled, I have about 2000+ emails in my inbox to go though (all YouTube 'new video' notifications)

Can somebody please help me make sense of it all? Am I doing to much? Scrap something? Easier way to do something? I really need some advice or at least perspective. Thanks!",10Feb2017,2
7,"Hey reddit, sorry this is a somewhat obscure problem but it's one that has been bothering me for a while.

Art school has always been a dream of mine for awhile but I never thought I would be able to go as I was lacking the funds however two years ago I was awarded a full ride to the art school I'm currently attending.  College life however has been less than ideal. All of my teachers are abstract painters- which I wouldn't have a problem with if they didn't try to force it on me. They have told me multiple times that I need to loosen up as and artist and have been forcing me to finger paint this entire semester. This wouldn't be a problem if they allowed me to make my own art in the side/ did not let my artistic preference impact my grade but this is exactly what has been happening. I am not allowed to keep personal work in my studio and I have been told multiple times that I have to learn how to create/appreciate abstractions if I want to graduate, What should I do? If I loose my scholarship I will not be able to afford to continue my education. How do I make these people like me? 

TL;DR 
  
All my teachers are abstract painters who dislike my realism/use of traditional methods and figuration. They keep threatening to fail me even though I have been making abstract art specifically for them. ",10Feb2017,1

11,"Hey guys, please help me if you can! I am a 15 year old girl and I have known this twin brothers since I was 3 yrs old. I often travel with them but I was never that close to them. One of the twin brothers (also 15) is on my the same class as me in almost all subjects and he have become very close friends. He is very funny and friendly with everyone. He often starts conversations with me during the lessons and on messenger. We only got closer however this past week, when we got back to school after the holidays. He has asked me if I am currently seeing someone and if I fancy someone and says that if I want he could try helping me with someone I fancy.
I dont quite know the difference between being flirty and being friendly because most of the time I think guys are being friendly but they are being flirty (maybe it is because they think I am easy) I would guess he is being flirty but after he says he would be glad to help me with the people I fancy I dont quite know.
I am always myself when I am with him and both of us are very good joke tellers so we always have a lot of fun together. I think I am falling for him, but I not sure yet. Anyways... I am veryyy confused about how he feels. I dont know if he is becomings friends with me because we've know each other for a pretty long time but were never that close, because we have lots of things in common and have very good humor, because he wants to make new friendships to start the year, because he fancies me or because he wants to make out with me because I am considered hot and he doesn't make out with someone in a while.

17,"Hey, Reddit. This is my first time ever to post on this site. From the title, I guess you guys can figure out what I'll be talking about. To get to the point, I'm in my second semester  attending community college as a Fine Arts major and I'll be 19 in just a few days and have come to the realization that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and that I'm too much of an idiot to get to where I want in life. Heck, I even had a difficult time figuring how to post this! I've always wanted to pursue a career in art since I was small but now, I think I'm too stupid to even make that happen. Plus, my art isn't even nice enough to be able to post online for others to see. I also don't think that I'll ever be smart enough to get into a Cal State to continue my education even though I desperately want to, along with the fact that I have no idea how I'll ever pay for it. On top of that, I'm very incompetent and very self-conscious about myself. To prove my point, I can't even COUNT CHANGE properly. I'm ugly, don't know how to do makeup and I'm not witty. I know nothing about financing. I have no job experience whatsoever. I have only one friend(bless her heart) because I'm an awkward turtle who can't socialize for my life, even though I really wish I could connect better with other people and honestly, I think she's only been my best friend for so long out of pity. I used to self-harm in high school but stopped. I'm starting to believe that I should've just killed myself while I had the chance.  I'm starting to think that I'll never be able to offer anything to the world because I'm an idiot who knows absolutely nothing. I'm always feeling so apologetic to my parents because they came into this country and worked so hard their entire lives in order to have their only child get an education and make something out of herself, but look where I am now. I just wish that I could contribute to society more and not be such a waste of air. Sorry if this is too long and rambly, but I just needed someone to talk to about this for once and thought that just maybe, the internet would be willing to listen. If this idiot read as carefully as she thinks she did, then I hope this post doesn't get deleted. Thanks and hope everyone else had a better day than me at least.",10Feb2017,2

24,"First off, let me start off by saying that I appreciate any attempts at giving me advice whatsoever, but if you simply respond with ""go see a doctor"" or ""talk to your parents"" you are giving me counter-productive advice. I have a lot of mental health problems that I eventually planning on addressing with a psychiatrist-this included, so I would appreciate short term solutions or just an outside perspective on my situation. My parents are also used to their daily routine that they have been doing for almost 20 years straight and are not willing to change at all. They are quite old and both turn 60 this year (I was born when they were 40). I am still in high school and nearly completely financially dependent on my parents, so moving out is not an option. I am also an only child and my parents love me to death (sometimes too much to the point where it is restrictive) and they have no interest in kicking me out. Informing me that my parents are legally able to kick me out will not help.

I have struggled with misophonia since I was a child. Just the sound of my family members eating would drive me crazy when I was a kid. It went away as I got older, but it came back when I was about 16. During this time, I was being verbally abused daily (not by my family) and developed severe anxiety and depersonalization. I developed extreme anger problems as a result of this stress and everything around me began to aggravate me. I guess during this period my misophonia arose. I ate almost all of my meals inside my room because I just could not stand being around my parents eating (I am an only child. Misophonio was just one of many symptoms that arose during that time period, but that is for another time.

Recently about 20 minutes ago I tried as hard as I could to just sit next to my (60 year old) dad while he ate a sandwich but I just couldn't. My dad is an extremely loud eater, even from an outside perspective. He takes a long, slow bite into food and inhales deeply as he eats and it just drove me insane. I made a bit of progress and sat for about 7 minutes until I had to retreat to the comfort of my bedroom and start beating the shit out of my bed. I have no idea why but it just infuriates me.

Another visual stimuli that just pisses me off is my parents drinking milk. Ever since I was a child my parents have pretty much worshiped milk, they drink it multiple times daily and just have never shut up about it since as long as I can remember. It pisses off for some reason and I can't get over it. Maybe hearing my parents constantly boast about how great milk is multiple times per day every single day has just gotten to me. Every single time I see my parents drinking milk I just get really pissed off and I cannot control it.

I have sat down and attempted to civally and diplomatically discuss this with them. I have grown up with diagnosed ADHD, OCD and Asberger's and they basically just said I need to ""deal with me"" (not word for word but this is basically what they meant). I'm not asking for them to change their lifestyle in any way, I just was trying to express why we rarely eat as a family. Please don't see me as a snobby teenager that still lives with my parents; I don't like this and I wish I could just sit down with my parents and eat a meal. 

Basically, how can I control this? What techniques can I use to try to hold out as long as possible without having to retreat and eat by myself?

*TL;DR I have misophonia and get pissed off whenever I hear the sound of my parents eating and cannot eat a meal with them. I also get pissed off whenever I see them drinking milk (I know this is strange) and it is getting out of control*

Thank you guys so much! Please do not bully or judge me for this, I am trying my best and wish I never had this problem in the first place.

25,"I'm 15 and I'm a sophomore in high school, I've been on and off with a girl for about a year now and it's getting pretty stressful. She's always been the person to end our relationships because ""she lost interest"", but she always comes back in about a month or less. We recently broke up and once again she's back, I love her and I would like to get back with her and we were planning on it but then today she lost interest. She lost interest before we even got back together, She's just always changing her mind and it's really stressful on me. I don't know if we should go our separate ways or not. But lately I've been talking to a different girl and we can relate sooo much more. She's like my dream girl, there's only one problem. She has a boyfriend. We're really good friends now and we even consider each other best friends. Her and I both have bad anxiety so we've bonded a bunch over it. And she knows I've liked her in the past and she's openly admitted that she liked me for a while too. So the constant pull between both girls is driving me crazy, one has a boyfriend and the other can't seem to make up their mind.

26,"I have never really gotten along with my family. They werent abusive to me or anything, and they have always meant well, but I have valued my independence and loath being tied to family members. It was a big reason why I moved out of my house to go on my own when I was around 23. I moved in with my gf (now fiancee) and am living states away. 

Fast forward to current times. My mother happened to randomly pick the state I reside in to move to. I feel like there is some sort of attempt at rekindling our relationship when I want nothing to do with her. I have my own life, am busy with school and work everyday. The thought of reverting back to family duties or activities is a horrid idea. 

I plan to leave my state when I graduate with my degree, and my mother if fully aware of that, but I feel like in the short term I really don't want to see her, but I know its going to be hard if she moved across the U.S and is living in the same city with me. 

I don't want to sound like a bad person, but I just really don't want her in my life anymore. I was so happy to get away from home, and now I have possible reoccurring pressures on me to associate with my mother.

Any advice to handle this without hurting her feelings? ",10Feb2017,7
27,"I have been enrolled in public school since I started it. My first year of high school is almost over and it was pure hell. Currently I have mid C's in my classes. I recently discovered this charter school which one of my pasts friends attends. I talk to them over Skype and my friend says it was the best decision he has ever made. One of my other friends who goes to the other public school in my area said attending public school teaches life lessons and things. My friend on Skype seems like the best friend one can know. My public school friend seems rather toxic and makes many innuendos. I developed my public school's toxicness over the years and long for the life my non-toxic friend has. I have taken a tour of the school and done some sample work to see how the daily work goes. I really love the school, the people, the class size and the way the content is taught.

28,"Two weeks ago my aunt was found unconscious in her apartment and she was in a coma until two days ago. She's in hospice care now with almost no chance of recovery. We're not sure if it will be hours or weeks but it's all taking a heavy toll on me mentally. I get text message updates from family members every few hours since she is on the other side of the country. 

My dilemma is whether or not to drive 6 hours away tomorrow to go to a planned bachelorette party for my college roommate. Mentally I'm very fragile right now because I have chronic depression and the situation with my aunt has been a big trigger for me. I can't decide if I should stay home and practice self care. Or go to the party as planned for my friend. Is it acceptable for me to bow out of this or am I being too emotional and I should just go? Please help me sort this out. ",10Feb2017,1
29,"I'm in grade 11. My best friend that I hang out with and really love right now is in grade 12 and she will be graduating within a few months, but I'll still be stuck here for another year after she leaves. Before I met her, I was always alone at school for a long time. Before this, I was in a close friendship with someone I'd known for years who gradually turned extremely manipulative, so I lost that friendship. I think that really disrupted me emotionally for a while, I lost all interest in friends until I started talking to the friend I have now. 

  My main issue is that I don't know I'll make friends after my best friend graduates. It's already hard enough for me to do that with anxiety, but I'm also worried that I won't be able to connect with anyone. This sounds weird, but I look around at the other students in my grade and I just don't feel that I like anyone. I know it's not fair to say that without getting to know the people first, but I mean that they're already hanging out with their own friend group or something. I really don't like that because it's like everyone already has drama with someone else and it's such a trap of fake friendship but it's EVERYWHERE. I can't stand it. 

  As far as I can remember, I've always wanted only 1 or 2 close friendships at a time. I don't enjoy a large social circle, that makes me feel more alone than actually being alone. I feel like there is no one else who is so ""intense"" about things like this as I am, I just want a genuine platonic bond with someone so that we can both trust each other and have deep conversations. I don't understand why everything seems so centred around drama or grades or clothes/makeup and other things I have 0 interest in hearing or talking about. If there are people my age who also feel like this, where are they? 

  I know lots of people say that I should join a school club if I want to meet people with similar interests, but there really are no clubs that I'm interested in at school. Outside of school, I do have religious meetings weekly, but there are almost no people my age and the 2 girls that are also teenagers are almost never there and they are very superficial. I don't want those kinds of friends. I also know that people of different age groups can be great friends, but in my situation, they don't really understand where my mind's at with school and ""growing up"" or whatever this is and I doubt that they believe I'll really want a close friendship with them. 

 I'm also wondering if high school friendships are even worth looking for at this point, since I may be able to take about half of my remaining courses online anyways. If I do that, I could also volunteer at places that I'm actually interested in career-wise. Maybe doing something I'm passionate about in university will help? Right now, I feel like no one on earth cares about the things I care about. 

  Thanks in advance for any advice :)",10Feb2017,2

39,"I could sit here for ten hours and write an explanation, but I'll briefly explain.

I took care of this kid, who is now 19, for over five total years of his life. His dad isn't in the picture and his mother is a serious addict to the point to where she cannot take care of herself or others. He dropped out of high school because she couldn't provide an address or transportation, and since then has been under my wing. Here are some minor details about his personality before what I believe to be a psychotic break:

&gt;mildly autistic, functionally conversational -- although has trouble in larger social situations and often has serious signs of social anxiety

&gt;sudden mood swings (which I mostly contributed to hormones because they had never been serious before) from happy to sad, or sad to angry.

&gt;honest almost to the point to where it is detrimental.

&gt;has an incredible amount of empathy, couldn't hurt another human being unless in a situation where he felt he /had/ to protect himself

&gt;has always been a little slow, but is understanding of his nature and genuinely tries to help explain himself and his actions the best he can



He's one of my best friends in the whole world. When I had to move states, I couldn't leave him behind. I took him with me, along with my partner, and have been trying to teach him more and more about responsibility. He lived with us for just over a year and we had a few hiccups like any parenting style really has with rebellion and responsibility, but he kept his first job for over a year and even saved up over a thousand dollars. He tried to get better and imo exceeded my expectations of trying to be fiscally more responsible and also the idea of trying to go out more and meet new people. 

Then the big move out happened, and he wanted his own place. We warned him it could cause a lot of stress, tried to explain about the real world, etc. He was sure he was willing to try and we weren't in a position to tell him no. He got his own place and hasn't been living in my house for four months, but still comes by to hang out, smoke, eat, etc. He left his savings money at our house after being worried he would spend it all at once and kept to the rule.

But then something horrible happened. And I don't really... know exactly what. All I know is my friend isn't AT ALL the person I have known him to be for the half-decade we spent living together. All I know is that it involved a girl, who I will call Sally for all intents and purposes.

He met Sally at a public place that had live music. He spent the evening talking to her and eventually asked to hang out another time. She agreed. He came by a few days later more ecstatic than I had ever seen him -- evening already saying he was in love with this girl. He has had relationships before, ones that even lasted several years, and he's always treated ladies well. He has a history of being mildly obsessive -- but only in the puppy love way we are all familiar with -- and never took a breakup well (taking a couple months to go out and meet new people, beating himself up about relationship mistakes) but ultimately always moved on.

The situation now, is scary. As in, actually scary. One night my friend came over, almost 4am, telling me he had a need to explain some things he had needed to unload off of his chest. Everything, and I mean everything, made no sense. He was saying words, and the words even formed a sentence with structure, but nothing about what he said actually formed a complete idea. Every time me and my room mate tried to ask him to describe things differently so we could understand his main idea, he would respond only with anger to the point to where he was screaming and lashing out, or leaving the house in a storm of angst complete with door slams. I was worried he was on drugs (not that I have anything against most recreational use) that he couldn't handle, and decided to try to talk to him in a day or two. So I did.

And when I did talk to him, things were... scary. He made it very clear to me that he is full-on paranoid and delusional and his situation has only progressively gotten worse since then. 

&gt;Sally hasn't spoken to him, or seen him in almost two months. She has cried, run from him, expressed fear, disinterest and worry of being physically assaulted.

&gt;He still thinks they are a couple and in love

&gt;He has explained that he believes there is an association of people around town he has never seen who are leaving him ""small signs"" and ""clues"" that are ""supposed to get us to meet again"" or ""get us back together"" (which is strange already because he already refers to her as a couple)

&gt;He is convinced that any song he relates to is /literally/ written about him and goes into a paranoid state because of it, even if it defies logic like the song coming out before he was born, etc.

&gt;My friend has lost his job and has since been lying ( SO unlike him), stealing (to the point to where he clearly wants to be caught, like leaving his things in place of where the original items were), and spent all of his savings money on things that were completely trivial

&gt;Every day his sentences are becoming more and more detached from anything he says previously

&gt;He seems to be more and more comfortable explaining his thoughts through obvious references, quotes, cliche, turns of phrases; like he purposely wants to be vague and confusing

&gt;He is beginning to sound more and more hostile, in general has more negative speech towards other people, and has said words like ""go on a killing spree"" and  ""targeting campuses"" (because he knows Sally lives near campus) 


The worst part is that he's not /listening/. He was so aware that he needed guidance and advice because of him naturally being a little slower, and was always excited to be taught new things that helped him learn or explain himself better. Whenever he was confused about anything, he always asked questions so he could understand them better. Now, when I try to tell him to move on from that girl, He gets offensive and pushing violent.

I, myself, am not in the best mental health. I would hate to call someone (especially in the Bible Belt) to try and give him involuntary treatment, knowing what that probably meant. I don't want to commit him. I don't want to call the police. I cannot get him back to his home state, where there is better health coverage and options for him. I just want him to get better and be okay, but every day he is refusing more and more help and becoming more and more attached to his delusions.

I have talked to his mother, the only other person who I thought to contact, and after speaking to him on the phone she agrees he could be dangerous, but she isn't doing better and isn't in a position to help either.

It got to the point where I deleted my FB bc I got sick of my mom always bringing up whatever I posted or commented on or worse, my mom's friends who followed me would talk to her about them.
     Anyways, I'm thinking about joining the social media game again and joining Twitter, maybe Instagram as well. A friend told me that a good way to get a lot of followers was to not have ""Protect My Tweets"" on as it limits your tweets to where only your followers can see them. I wanna see how much followers I can get so I don't want that on, but I just remembered that my mom has a Twitter as well. 
     I made a dummy Twitter just to test it out. I found out she would show up in my ""people to follow"" tab or whatever probably due to her being in my contacts and vice versa, leading me to think that she'd be able to view my tweets.
     Is there a way for me to hide her from viewing my tweets and/or blocking her without following her and without having ""Protect My Tweets"" on? I don't want to be talked to each time for speaking my mind or sharing my interests online like back when I used Facebook.",10Feb2017,4
42,"I'm a 27 year old female, I've been to Uni twice and left before the end of the first years. I'm in debt twice over for student loans and grants, I'm also trying to pay off an overpayment from a grant (else I'll be taken to court). My highest qualification is an Access to HE Diploma but I've also spent 6 months in China teaching English (most incredible 6 months of my life). Almost all of my jobs have been in retail (mostly sales assistant or supervisor).

I feel like a failure, I'm coming up for thirty and work as a sales assistant (or equivalent to). I feel a dead weight in my chest when dwell on the fact that I have gotten nowhere since leaving school.
I live at home with my mother and family. They're sarcastic, rather bright, hugely funny, warm, loving and loyal. I'm incredibly lucky to have them as family, when everything got too much they were there for me. 

A year and a half ago my boyfriend of 10 years split up with me, contrary to whatever I tell anyone else, I know in my heart of hearts that I'm not over it. He wasn't in the wrong to leave, I had lied to him for 5 years, I lied saying that I hadn't slept with another man when we were on a break. I'm so ashamed of what I did, I won't make excuses because it was wrong. He had told me years earlier that if I ever slept with another man he couldn't stay with me, even if we weren't together at the time. In my head I was dead certain that he would find out and leave me... And he did.

Since the split I feel like a totally different person. On the plus side I was overweight and now I'm not. Yes! But only because I've  got some crazy fixation on my weight, at the moment my weight feels like the only aspect of my life I can control. I purposely don't eat when I'm hungry, I get so hungry sometimes I feel sick. Other times I breakdown and eat until I feel sick. 

I've also lost my facade of confidence, before the split I could bullcrap my way through most situations (as long as they don't involve angry shouting strangers), but now I hate people being angry at me. It's bloody awful caring what people think of you, even if I wasn't genuinely confident I didn't particularly care if people viewed me negatively (personality/attitude). Sometimes I have spurts of confidence, a few guys give me their number, or try to chat me up at work. Sweet, roll with it. Yeah I'd like to get to know you. -- Two days later I can think of absolutely nothing to  say to these people. Why would they bother talking to me anyway, am I part of some prank or are they desperate or- and the thoughts cycle around my head, each second more noxious and vile. How do I stop it? What can I do to change my own opinion of myself. 

I've set myself goals:
- Work and clear off debt
- Save enough money to go back to China (roughly need about £3,000 - flights, insurance, Visa, storage fee for stuff left behind, living costs for first 2 months at least)
- Lose more weight, wear a bikini at the beach for the first time. 

I feel very foolish writing those, but I'm trying to be honest.

How do you cope with failing and not hating yourself for it? How do you pull yourself back together? I'm struggling so hard, I want and want to live and laugh and have joy around me. It gets progressively difficult everyday to talk to people, my family included, to laugh, to not be insanely jealous of everyone else. I know many people will have worse situations but it's their carefree faces, voices and attitudes that I envy. They don't sound like they're a serious argument away from contemplating suicide. They sound like they have control I've their own emotions, thoughts and lives. There must be tricks to it or a way of thinking, something that keeps them from despising themselves when situations go awry.

44,"Hey Reddit, 

So in order for my situation to make sense I need to quickly sum up my first two years of high school. 9th and 10th grade I went to this arts school, which was really brutal. I became depressed and stopped caring about academics, arts, or anything else. My only hope for high school was to scrape my way through and then avoid school for the rest of my life. Then, halfway through 10th grade (last year), I switched to online school. I liked it a lot better, and I felt like I could do the expected amount of work and possibly go on to community college, or something. 

Now, a year later, I have motivation which I've never had before. I've become so interested in my classes that I don't just want to do the required work and do it well, I want to seek information from all forms and from all sources possible. I'm enrolled in two community college classes (English 1 and Cultural Anthropology) and two high school courses (Algebra II and Physics). The problem is that I am now realizing how much it would mean to me to be able to go to a prestigious school, such as MIT, Berkeley, or Harvard. 

I feel so late to the game. I only have one more year to add on advanced courses, take on extra curriculars (I've been involved in very little to this extent) and prove my abilities. Less time than that if you consider that my applications are in 9 months. I'm extremely interested in robotics and computer programming (both things that I haven't even touched before, because I thought it would be impossible), but it feels really hard to join a team where people have been doing robotics for years. Especially because it's halfway through robotics season already. It would be very difficult to start a team in my school, especially without anyone to teach it. 

So for the first time I have all this energy, motivation, drive, and I feel like it can't be used in ways that will increase my college acceptance chances. What kinds of things could I do currently that would look good to colleges? Basically, what is the best use of the next year and a half in order to make up for two years missed? ",10Feb2017,1

There was a time in high school where all I ever dreamed of was becoming a comedian actor. I hated school, but I wasn't terrible at it. But my focus was to become an actor. Ever since coming to college, I've been confused on what to do. In fact, inseatd of ""finding myself"" I've lost myself in this new environment. I no longer pursue theatrical hobbies nor is my mind filled with dreams of being up on the big stage. But neither is my mind focused on doing anything else. I mean sometimes I think it would be cool to be a psychiatrist or a human rights lawyer But I'm not apt for that. As i've mentioned, I was pretty average academically in high school, but in college I'm an overachiever. I got my first 4.0 last semester. While I am smart because I work hard. I'm not smart enough to be a lawyer, psychologist, etc. I want to be a comedian, but my passion to initiate the steps to get to that dream seems dead. I feel like I'd be a good counselor.

53,"Alright I'm a senior in high school, I recently broke up with my ex gf of about 9 months because it didn't feel right and I knew we were going to separate colleges. The breakup wasn't too bad yet she still had feelings for me. We continued talking for a while after the breakup as friends with the occasional hook up. Shortly after we stopped talking, just about a week after we stopped talking a close  friend of mine who I basically went through high school with made out with her at a party.  So the next day he talks to me and let's me know what happened.

So now I'm pretty disappointed in him cause I feel like i can't trust one of my closest friends anymore. Anyways we talk and I let him know that it wasn't cool and he apologizes and tells me he knows he fucked up and that he considers me one of his best friends and that he won't do it again. So I forgive him and we start to get close again, then about three weeks later some mutual friends let me know  that he hooked up with her again at a party and now they're talking. I know she's trying to get back at me for breaking up with me. At this point I'm just pissed he broke 'brocode' again after he said that he had my back and wouldn't do it again, yet he is going behind my back to talk to her.

So I am currently staying in a one-room college dorm with a roommate that games almost 24-7 and this is starting to become a problem for me.

61,"Hello. Obviously this is a throw away account. I used to be engaged to a man, we were together for 6 years and then I discovered he cheated on me. I discovered when I went to the gyn (lady doctor) with discomfort and felt sick, and she pretty much diagnosed it immediately. Had a test done, a week later it came back positive. Confronted fiance. He never said yes, no , or sorry. He cried and told me how his life was totally ruined, and then when I was at work he threw all of my stuff on the lawn and told my friends and family (who they all adored him) that I cheated on him and confessed I had herpes. Later on after I tried to kill myself because everyone knew, no one, not even my own family would give me the time of day.  I was homeless. My depression and failure to come in to work after an attempted suicide cost me my job. I suffered so many mental and emotional disorders I had to be drugged up the entire time. It was hell. I still get teary-eyed when I look back at that. 
It was not so much the fact that I had a virus for life, it was the fact that my life as I knew it was over and everyone I thought I could depend on had abandoned me because they thought I cheated on my ""wonderful fiance"" and pretty much deserved to die.

&amp;nbsp;

Well, bitches. Looks like I'm alive. So fuck anyone who reads this that I used to know. I have a good life, I am super educated with my three degrees (because I threw myself head first in to college taking two full time programs at two universities at a time because I had nothing else after all you fucks ditched me) and I am about to be accepted in to a phd program. I am about to get married. I work at a great well known company. I provide for myself fully because all I had was myself. I fucking survived everything you people said and every hateful text message or threatening call. I ate your shit for years, but I'm still here. I have everything I wanted, but I survived. If this story sounds familiar to you, go fuck yourself and fuck everything you were.

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, on to the point. An online friend casually mentioned to me that this ex was thinking about getting married. Then it hit me that there is someone out there who just might be about to go through everything I went through and hit rock bottom...and I would not mention that on anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

So I sent her a long facebook message telling her I didn't want anything from her, I don't want her man, I don't want any drama, I told her when he gave me the virus, what year, when, how I found out, I told her that I was never going to talk to her again and I intended to block her after the message was sent. I told her she could do whatever she wants, think what she wants, say what she wants--tell everyone, fuckit, I don't care if she thinks I'm some jealous hoe ex that came crawling out from under a rock just to fuck with her, but if she does anything at all what so ever, at least go get tested. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then I blocked her before she had the chance to respond. I know fully that she has no idea. But God. If someone said that to me and gave me the chance to handle the situation before the ex attempted to destroy my life, I would have given anything to have enough warning to protect myself. I just needed to save someone from what I went through, maybe some twisted sense of closure...and yes I did get it, I just felt like I could finally let all the rage from that time go and truly move on with my life after feeling like I rescued someone. 

&amp;nbsp;

The next day my online friend told me her relationship status was now single.

63,"My friend, who is bisexual, has become extremely close to me as of recently. We're both the same age in high school, and though we don't actually have any classes together, we always make time to see each as much as possible, and whenever possible. Though we just met not too long ago, our friendship has been very touchy feely from the get-go. 

99% of the time, we hold hands when walking together, sit next to each other, and he'll often bite, kiss, etc my neck, as well as other things. Much of my class is under the impression that we are in fact dating, though we both say that we are not. 

One of my other friends jokes that we are basically in a relationship, since we do everything a normal boyfriend and girlfriend would do, such as put a lot of time and thought into purchasing nice gifts for each other. We are each other's Valentine's Day dates. I tend to desire a lot of attention from my close friends, and he has no issue catering to this need. 

We have never straight up actually kissed each other before, although to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if it did eventually happen. 

I do not necessarily have an issue with what we have at the moment, as my other close friends have not expressed any concern with it, and while said friend is bisexual, he really prefers guys. However, I sincerely value this friendship and don't want to do anything that would jeopardize it. I'm aware that our friendship is not exactly conventional. 

I don't have any intention to date him at this time. I genuinely enjoy spending time with him, and while I don't mind the hand holding, etc that we do, I did not initiate it. As most teens do, we made a pact to marry each other if we're single at 35, but it's highly doubtful that will actually happen.

She was 13 and her life was pretty bad IRL(verbally abusive &amp; alchoholic parents, living poor-ish and self-concious). We had a lot in common - we both liked music, we both were insecure about our looks, we liked the same tv shows and video games, and we both we seeking friendship. She and I were initially friends and then BFF's and then, well, girlfriends. I listened to her vent, gave her advice, and she did the same for me. It wasn't sexual. Hell no. We didn't do roleplay or anything suggestive. Basically we just hung on out IMVU and talked. This relationship lasted for maybe 3, 4 months?

96,"Hey all, I had a legal question. I spent last week in this hospital with the flu and encephalitis. My question is, on Tuesday (1/31/17) I went to a emergency room health clinic for feeling sick, they diagnosed me with mild bronchitis. They sent me home and told me to take Tylenol and ibuprofen. I followed that instruction and around 1 am I awoke shaking uncontrollably, staring at walls and was speaking nonsense (according to my wife) around 4 I got worse, more shaking and knew even less of what was happening to me. She finally called an ambulance who loaded me in and drove me to the hospital. 
Once, I arrived I was diagnosed with the flu and encephalitis. Was told a few days later I had these things and that I never had bronchitis from the get-go and that the emergency room health clinic should have been able to determine I at least had the flu. I have the paperwork from both places and one says bronchitis, the other encephalitis and flu. Is it possible to sue and win under this pain and suffering of the doctor from the clinic? If they had done their job right at the clinic I may have been able to not of had to be sedated and kept on tubes for 3 days to stay alive, they would have treated symptoms earlier. No, they refused to test at the clinic, they made assumptions that could have led to my death and left my kids father-less and my wife a widow. 
Can I sue for this and who should I call? I live in Colorado. (Two previous attorneys claim I can't since I didn't die)
Any advice here would be appreciated, thanks. ",10Feb2017,1
98,"Hello everyone!


I've been struggling with a stressful situation since December, and have been on sick leave with depression since the 31st because of it. I feel like I don't know how to proceed, so I wanted some outside advice. 


In December my dad was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and given a few months to live. 


In December, I was also told that the company I work for will cease operations and we would all get fired. At first, I was actually super happy because I hate my job, but now it's almost the middle of February and we still don't know when the company will close. In addition, apparently there are talks of selling the company, which means that according to the law it's illegal to fire us, because the company that buys the business has to take the employees too. This adds uncertainty as well, because we really have no idea what will happen.


The company in question is small, so my direct boss is the boss of the whole company (the actual owners live abroad). He has no experience on managing people, so if I make even a small mistake he yells at me. Good work is never aknowledged. The whole time I have worked there, I haven't had a real vacation. I've always been required to keep my laptop with me so I can work, even while sick or on a vacation abroad. This is the first time I have been left alone during a sick leave.


Except for this Monday when my boss suddenly called me in the evening and I paniced so bad I just started shaking and wanted to puke. I was afraid he was going to demand I come to work. (Happily he didn't)


At some point, I just started to wish I'd get hit by a car so I didn't have to go there anymore. My sick leave is almost over, and I can feel my anxiety growing. I really want to quit, but there's a problem with that. If I quit, there's a 3 month penalty period when I can't collect unemployment. My fiance says he doesn't care about that as long as I'm happier than now.


I feel really anxious and scared about going back to work, but also selfish for wanting to quit instead of toughing it out.


Any help and opinions are appreciated at this point!

I opened this account just to seek help so you'll know how helpless I am. so here goes my story. I was always an introvert and was also awkward around girls. generally I don't like company of them. when I was 16 I fell in love with a girl from my school. she was 13. many of you may say that was not love. nobody understands what love is at that age. I was very shy to talk to her but sonehow manages to talk to her. she didn't seem interested. but I didn't give up. I will not bother with little details, but after some time I proposed her and she accepted. as she was very young she lost interest in me after 3 months and broke up with me. but I was as madly in love as a human can be. I was lost.  she moved on. after 1 year she started to date a guy from her class. but I didn't lose hope. I waited with patience. after two years I left that school and got admitted in an engineering university. I lost touch with her quickly. fast forward a year and I found her in facebook. I again expressed my love for her. she didn't seem to care. after some days she decided to block me to make me forget her. as we lived far from each other facebook was our only connection and she didn't have a personal phone then. I was blocked for 2years and heaven knows I didn't lose hope. I waited in silence. 15 days ago she unblocked me and I knocked her again. she called me names for bothering her again but still talked to me. I again expressed my love for her and again refused but not so furiously. she agreed to meet with me. we met a few times in last few weeks. face to face she is nice to me but a real jerk online. she has rapid moodswings and gets angry with little things. during our last meeting she indirectly said she likes me but classified it as infatuation. but when I talk to her online she starts quarrel over little things. and we're growing apart again. I came so close after waiting 6 years and I don't want to lose her again. what can I do to make her understand me,my love for her. she always says I don't understand her. I tried to understand her needs but failed miserably. she is the only girl in my life so I have little experience regarding relationships or love. so fellow humans, what can I do to make her understand me? help this poor soul and sorry for bad english.

114,"This may be a bit long, I don't know the exact word to describe my situation but I'll do my best.

Basically, say there are 3 groups of level, for example it's tennis skill, if I'm not in the best group, I would feel uncomfortable.

Yesterday, I went to my usual tennis club at college, I usually play with the best players and I do keep up/win against them. So I do believe I belonged there. However, due to me being a jackass, I had a small injury on my foot, it doesn't affect my physical performance but my dad who's a doctor told me to play safer and just be gentle on my foot. 

So I told the tennis coach that I had an injury, it does not prevent me from playing but I needed to play less boldly. So he put me in the beginner group. At first I didn't care, until I realize the beginners really sucked. I was playing against a guy, he hit every ball in the net, couldn't return a top spin, so I had to play wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy less aggresively, despite not running around too much. I mean I thought they could at least play in a consistent way, but no, it's actually worse they play totally randomly and most of my time was spent picking up balls because they would either hit the net or out. 

I wanted to spice things up because I was bored as hell, so I would come up to net, I usually try to hit as hard as I can before doing that but against the beginner I did the easiest ball possible. Needless to say he hit the net every single time, so I had to run back to the far end of the court to reposition myself. Afterwards I asked the other players in the beginners group if they wanted to play double and keep score, to make it more fun. Well despite me playing as passively as possible, still hitting the net and out.

I was kind of upset, so I looked around and when I saw my usual group playing, they were topspin, backspin, net play etc. they had fun, they shook hands. And I was there, with those beginners, bored as hell. And I felt the same discomfort I always had since I was born... being in the inferior group. I wanted to go back to my usual group, but I didn't felt like risking my foot over it, and the intermediate group was full. 

Do you guys think I have an inferiority complex? I mean, I always tried my best to be around those who are skillful, I always wanted to go to the top, and always felt uncomfortable being in a inferior group. The reason I'm not depressed or have any issue with life on a daily basis is because I kept my promises, being where I wish to be. I enjoy being in the presence of people who are as skilled as me and knowing there's not many people above us. 

Now I am not being arrogant or whatever, I just felt like being honest with you is the best way to find anwers to my question. I may praise a little bit myself, but I usually keep that to myself, and on the internet haha

117,"So I recently got hired by a restaurant to pull in some extra cash on top of my current full-time job. The last step for me to get officially on the schedule &amp; start working was for the restaurant manager to call my job references to speak on my behalf &amp; my experience.

 Greg, My current full time manager was fine with me getting a second job and said I could use him as a reference for them to call &amp; told him ahead of time to expect a phone call. Well they did call Greg, however, wasn't until i received a random text from my former college fraternity brother Greg, did I come to realize that I accidentally put his number instead of my current manager's number by mistake as both names are next to each other in my phone book of my cell.... and they called the wrong Greg who was totally unprepared for the call. Good guy Greg played it off cool and gave them generic positive answers when explaining about me &amp; my work ethic, and said they didn't second guess him when he seemed confused on what/who they were calling about, but I'm sure it probably seemed a little odd &amp; unorthodox.  As i called them an hour before to see if they checked in my references, they said they're were just about to, and that I should hear back from them later that day. 

Well that was Wednesday, and it is now Friday, and they haven't reached back out to me OR call any of my other references which were the CORRECT people, and I'm worried that they think I was giving them BS references... 

It's a restaurant gig so it's not super important because there are hundreds where I live, but the hours &amp; location worked perfect with my schedule and I was looking forward to working there...

 Soo should i give them a call today and ask for an update as I haven't heard back from them, ORRR should I call and explain what how I'm dumb and made a mistake?

I love her to death, but she's got awful habits in public that irk me to no end. She's an attractive girl, and she's absolutely hilarious, but she does certain things that I think are considered... well. Not classy.

For example, when we're out in public, she'll burp loudly. She doesn't say excuse me, and doesn't think it's gross. I, on the other hand, think that it's kind of bizarre. Then the other night, we went out to dinner. In the middle of dinner, she slid her foot out of her sandal, crossed one leg over the other and started scratching it. I stared at her and asked her to please not to do that at the dinner table, and she goes, 'It's only the top!' And so I said, Use your other foot. Then she proceeded to reach out and pretend like she was going to touch me, then without washing her hands, she proceeded to pick up her food. 

I know she takes care of herself hygenically, but she doesn't seem to care what she looks like in public, either. 

I want to try and bring it up, but I don't want to sound like I'm insulting her. But unfortunately for me, if this kind of behavior doesn't stop, it's a deal-breaker. How should I go about this, Reddit?

129,"Hi. I'm 14, but I won't tell my name. I'm dealing with semi-depression right now. There is so much I need to tell someone, but I have found no one to ask. I have these kinds of discussions with my parents, but I don't want to talk to them about these topics anywhere.

Now before I begin, I want to say that I haven't given up yet. Also, I know I'm a teenager. I know I'm supposed to have mood swings, and I'm going through a pretty hectic mental time, as are most teenagers. If you finish reading this, I'll be grateful and thank you for taking your time to. 

I was born in the States, but I'm Indian. I weigh 90 kilos. Most of it is water and bone. I would say that about 20-25 kilos is unnecessary fat. That is just an assumption. I'm 5 ft 11 in, which explains part of my weight, but not all. And the worst part is that I have man boobs. I have man boobs because my dad did for a long time. So I'm telling you all this because my depression deals with social problems. By social problems, I mean friends and relationships and social status in school.

I need to introduce something now that you have an idea about what my depression deals with. I overthink and analyze everything in this world unintentionally. And when I mean everything, I mean everything. To the point where I planned this essay-like post before even typing it in 2 minutes. It actually drives me insane. Recently, I've been working on trying to let go, but it is very hard for me to do so.

So how does social problems and overthinking/analysis come together? For eight years I was in one school. The first 5 were fine. I wasn't a teenager, and I always had friend groups. But come sixth grade, life became a mess. I never had an actual friend group. I always told everyone everything, like my personal things, such as my crushes. I always wanted to be part of the 
'popular' kids (even though we make them 'popular', I know, but please just stick with it). And so in my last year in this school, I finally had two friend groups. But then I switched school recently for high school, and I made a big mistake. See, I thought that this was a fresh start, which it was, but from a dating perspective. I've never dated, and I believed that I would try and 'get in with the popular kids' in this new school. In addition, when I moved to this school, I analyzed every group of friends/people, and decided whether or not it was worth joining them based on how it would affect my social status. Turns out that nothing fit my 'criteria', and to be honest, I don't know what my 'criteria' was. One group was too hard to fit into because all the boys had muscles and were hella sporty. Another was way too smart. One was all Asians (not being Racist here, nothing wrong with Asians. Hell, I'm technically Asian because India is in Asia. Read on and I'll explain more about this Asian group). And so on. So the first 6 months of school, I was basically a loner. And then I felt so bad because now everyone else thought I was a loner when my goal was to be this chill, smooth guy who was smart, somewhat fit, and someone who, for a lack of a better phrase, would get in with girls. 

All right, so you've read all that stuff on friend groups, lets go a bit deeper into this. There's one groups full of non-Asian people. I live in Asia, and my school is (country) American School. So naturally there are Americans. These guys are the dudes who gym everyday, play three or four sports, and have abs at the age of 15. And it's not just boys, it's girls too because all the sporty, 'hot' girls like all the sporty, 'hot' boys. So I really wanted to be part of this group. And that decision was made 95% because of hot girls. It never worked out, so I moved on. 

The next group were the Asians. In my school, there are lot of Koreans, and then Chinese and Japanese and etc. So when I began to analyze this group, I went, ""Oh my god, there are even 'higher status' people here, and it's gonna be so hard to get in with girls here because their all smarter than me"". So yeah, I left that group because I was a complete misfit.

So I became a loner, who sat alone, watched YouTube videos, and looked like an idiot. My headphones became my shield, my device to escape from the world. I love music and headphones and technology, but that's off topic. I didn't join any clubs, service clubs, or sports except for volleyball.

At this point, you might be raging so hard and thinking to yourself, ""Well, all this analyzing has made him a loner. He should just be himself!"".

Many, many people have told me to be myself. But I don't know who I am. I don't what being yourself is. Being myself, what I believe, is having a higher social status, to perform music, to publicly speak, and to most importantly, have a girlfriend. Before I talk about the girlfriend, I want to quickly tell you what I've improved.

So I've made more friends, stopped watching YouTube videos during breaks, and started talking with people more. I've joined a music-performing club, the ultimate frisbee club, and a Global Service Club. And I'm really trying to be positive. But then there are girls.

Obviously by now, you can tell I'm a boy. And my brain has gone for a toss, because wow do girls have such an influence on me. It's come to a point where I need a girlfriend. Not want, but need. I need someone who I can share these problems with it. Someone who understands. Someone who I can hug, kiss, care about. Someone who I can sit next to and watch the stars or watch a sunset, holding hands, leaning on each other. All these things I want/need so badly. A quick side point, but I don't go out with friends often, maybe once every 1 and a half months or so. I feel like nobody really cares that much about me. I've never asked a girl out, except once through email in sixth grade, I don't know if that counts. And the reason why I've never asked a girl out, is because every time I have a crush/infatuation on someone, I tell a friend, and then he/she spreads it like wild fire. Then the girl I like pretends like I don't exist. Yay! (that was sarcasm). That problem happened in my old school. If there's one thing I've learnt about social status and girls from those 8 years it's that. Anyways, long story short, I want a girlfriend. Period. And one who accepts me for who I am.

And then there's the factor that I can't lose weight. It's actually the second hardest thing after getting girls. I've tried diets, briefly. I'm vegetarian, so I tried to reduce sugar and fat intake, obviously, and eat even more greens etc. My workouts consist of a 20 to 30 minute run outside, running approximately 2.75 to 4 KM based on how long I run and my pace. You can figure the pace out if you care. But right now I'm going through a growth spurt where I get hungry every 1 hour, and by hungry I mean an entire meal hungry. I take food from home, always have, my mom is one of the best cooks alive. Her food is super healthy, but the problem with snacks is besides a fruit and nuts, dates, and figs, theres nothing she can give me to fill me up besides carbs. Right now, my breakfast is two eggs and a smoothie that's got anything from yoghurt, to fruits, to chia seeds, to honey, to peanut butter, to almonds. Yeah it's a pretty healthy and filling smoothie. My breakfast is that big mostly because I eat breakfast at 6:30 AM and my next possible time to eat food is 9:55 AM. Anyways, that's my whole workout/fat problem(s).

So I'm extremely grateful If you've come this far. I've reflected a lot over writing this, and I've come back to a better sense of mind. If you have any help, anything at all, I would be extremely grateful. Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you below!

133,"I have a 2003 Silverado that I purchased new and paid off long ago. It's been a great truck, very reliable. Over this past weekend someone busted the driver's side door lock (easy to do on these trucks) and stole my shitty $50 CD player. Oh well. I've only got liability insurance so I didn't bother making a claim or filing a police report. I've just been driving around listening to podcasts with my phone's speaker.

Well, this morning I get in my truck and see someone (same person?) has now removed the plastic covering around the steering column in a failed attempt at stealing my truck. I originally thought they'd broken the ignition as my key didn't seem to want to go in but I've since been able to work it in, so it's drivable.

My question is: should I even bother attempting to fix the door lock/handle, dash/CD player, and the ignition only to have some asshat do this again? If I were to get rid of the truck I wouldn't buy something new, maybe a $3-4K used vehicle which I know is much more than I'd spend on repairs, but at least I'd have the piece-of-mind knowing that whatever I spend fixing my truck isn't for nothing should they decide to watch some youtube video on vehicle theft and come back with a better education.

TL;DR: truck was nearly stolen - spend the money on repairs or get rid of it and get another vehicle?",10Feb2017,1
134,"I'm not sure where to put this. I have anxiety disorder especially related to health phobias, but I think I also have a bit of social anxiety. I'm an introvert, but not cripplingly so. I live with 2 roommates, but one of their boyfriends is almost always here. Roommate K is a best friend, my age (20s) as is her boyfriend A. Roommate L is K's mother (60s). We also have a dog.

My room is on the top floor in the dead center of the house (of course) and I have good ears/light sleeper a I hear EVERYTHING in the house. So annoying. My room leads out into the kitchen and hallway. Anyway L spends a lot of time cooking or excersizing in the kitchen. K and A live in the basement. All of them are pretty outgoing and extroverted though. They love to talk, and do it loudly. It's just who they are. When one's up, they just don't know how to be quiet and so I'm up. I don't complain about it because I feel lucky enough to be here I guess, even though I pay rent, and I am not good at confrontation, especially because L is a parent and I've always needed to be seen as a good person by parent figures. So anyway. I don't go out much. I don't have a car. My boyfriend takes us to college but we don't go out elsewhere much. I'm often just in my room. 

But here's the problem; if I hear L cooking in the kitchen, then I can't go cook. So I have to eat pretzels or granola bars in my room instead of real food. Then she does her excersizing so she's still in there and I'm still stuck. For hours. If I have to pee, I hold it or I peek out to make sure she's not facing me and sneak to the bathroom. And then when I want to leave the bathroom, I hesitate again. I usually wait until she naps or goes to sleep and then I come out and cook. Even then I move quickly and quietly because I don't want her to get up and talk to me. This is an every day thing and it takes a toll on my stomach and bladder.

The reasons I'm ""afraid"" of being seen/talked to are this:

1) L is almost deaf so I have to repeat myself alot. Annoying.
2) I don't always know what to talk about. When we do talk though we can talk for hours. I enjoy it. Just when I feel in the mood too, you know?
3) DOG. Their stupid dog literally barks at anyone entering a different room every time. It's so so so annoying. Her bark is high and panicky and excited. Like if I walk into the kitchen and L is there, dog barks at me to protect L I guess. But the thing is WE'VE ALL LIVED HERE FOR YEARS. And she lives and protects all of us. She just protects who ever is in the room, grin whoever walks into the room. And coming into the house is just the worst when it comes to her barking. If I leave my room and L is in the kitchen (75 percent of the time she is), dog barks at me. And then I have to quiet the dog, at the same time greet L (she's been offended if we don't greet her) and then L can't hear me because of her hearing and because of dog, and it's a big process. I just wanted to pee or grab a go gurt, God damnit. 
4) they love talking about everything. I don't. I am directed to hear their louds conversations because no matter where they are in the house I can hear them (unless it's just K and A downstairs alone. If L is there they all get loud she she can hear them). Their conversations about weather or politics or stupid shit we all know about bothers me so much (A really bothers me tbh). 

And I feel bad that this bothers me so much, I feel stupid for feeling stuck in my room just because L is out there... I don't know what to do. Talking to them about it... Is a no. This is L's house and she even told my boyfriend not to pick me up for class before 7am because the dog will bark and L wants quiet when she does her excersizing. She is a very kind person but when it comes to her possessions and rituals she is stern (which I get.) It's her house, she's letting me be here (though again I pay rent and mostly eat only my own food...) It's a good deal. When L is gone, yeah K and A can be loud, or if ones talking to me for a long time about something I don't care about it can be annoying, but my real anxiety (?) Issue is with L. 

tl;dr (60yr) roommate is always in kitchen right outside my room, dog barks if I leave room, roommates all loud, talkative, I often feel stuck in my room 90% of time, annoyed and bad effects on stomach/bladder. What do",10Feb2017,1

138,"My parents set me up in a supported living unit a couple of years ago after deterioration of family relationships and I don't know what they told them but I was refused my antidepressants, threatened with homelessness on the day where staff would give me leaflets about being homeless and would just laugh as I cried and begged them. The manager would tell me that suicide was an option and how to do it. My tenancy was at risk for a long time as they just tried to get rid of me and my parents wouldn't believe me when I told them what was happening. Probably because they were behind it too. They even agreed with them to record my phone calls which I'm not sure is legal. 

I had many arguments with staff and they eventually kept finding anyway to get me out. They came up to me one day and said that I was being evicted and that I was being put in a psych ward since they had a 'duty of care' to house me somewhere. I was told I could leave the ward if I had permission from my parents to go home but they refused. I was trying to get my a levels. The level of grief and sheer hopelessness was agonising. Still, I worked and got my a levels despite being a complete emotional mess and I was eventually housed in another supported living unit in the same town, which was literally minutes away from my parents. 

I had the option to go through clearing but I stupidly decided to take another gap year to get a good uni place. The new place was a shithole, the staff didn't even really check on what I did, and would say I 'looked homeless' and things like that. I eventually just couldn't take it and took a very serious overdose that almost killed me. That happened over and over for the rest of the year until I went to uni and because I felt driven so insane from the pressures of the situation, I developed a dependence on Valium. 

Unfortunately, after going to uni, I couldn't even finish the term because I was really going through crisis. I would withdraw from Valium if I tried to stop and I completely could not function to get out of bed. 

I've still got that uni place but I've interrupted and now I'm back in the supported living system, and the same things are starting to happen again. My next door neighbour is a heroin addict and also tries many other drugs due to a brain injury. I don't feel safe here at all and I'm afraid of falling into that scene and then my life is over. I am too terrified to move a lot of the time and am sobbing uncontrollably a lot of the time. I have no idea where to go, what to do and I feel permanently damaged.

I have the place at uni for September but what till then? I don't trust support or anyone really and they often make me feel afraid anyway. I've got to get out, away from the influence of my parents but they just seem to torment me everywhere. I just wish the family was normal and I beg them to let me back but they won't. I have no idea what to do. ",10Feb2017,4

I'm in my late twenties. Two years ago, I went through a big depression, started smoking weed and developed schizophrenia/psychosis. Lost friends, girlfriend and my two jobs (programming). Due to my horrible state of mind back then, I did some things which are now haunting me and am very ashamed of. Here are some of the things I've done (just so you get a picture): I cried in the streets on a few occasions. I thought I was talking to Jesus, went naked through the streets until the cops arrested me. Thought I was the messiah, etc. I eventually got hospitalized and am no longer sick. Got lucky and found a good paying job but that's very stressful on a daily basis. My job causes me a lot of anxiety.

Here's the problem: one of the symptoms I'm left with is exhaustion no matter how much I sleep. Due to this I am forced to take the bus. In the past I loved helping people and being a good person. Now, I'm very fearful/suspicious of them because not once, but twice on the bus I saw them pointing at me and talking at me (more than likely they saw one of my antics...).

I can't stand to have people talking behind my back and I am absolutely terrified that word will get back to my colleagues. I still live with my parents since I'm too exhausted and stressed/anxious to live on my own. This means that moving to a different city/country is out of the question. Also, I can't take my life because that will destroy my family and I've already put them to a lot with me being a failure of a son.

153,"I work at a very small company (under 20 people) that has been around for 18 years.

I've been in an entry-level marketing position for about 9 months and my boss (the CEO) and I do not get along, I feel like he might be an abusive employer, and I think it is making me emotionally ill.

When I first started the job I was given a big project: Create animated videos that demonstrate the solutions we sell. My boss has no clue what video-making entails so that's just a disclaimer.

So I'm not an animator but I do have a film/video editing background, and I told my boss from the beginning that I'm not an animator. After his pressure to figure it out, I said I could try to make an animated video but it would take me 1 month's time because there was a huge learning curve and video editing is just a time-consuming task in general.

He was okay with my time frame quote and I began the project. After a week had passed my boss was pressuring me to get it done faster and my constant reply to his comments was, ""You know its only been 1 week.. I thought we had agreed upon a 1 month time frame?"" or ""It's been 2 weeks.. I'm still working on it with the agreed upon goal of 1 month in mind.""

In the end I did in fact create a pretty decent animated video that looks very professional, on a SUPER LOW (like $200) budget and within the 1 month time frame.

My boss was glad it was done but acted surprised that it took so long, which left me confused and feeling underappreciated...and this was my first task as a new employee.

I could go on and on with examples of this trend happening over the consecutive months leading up to now, with other projects and tasks, and now I'm in a place where I find it hard to have a conversation with him about anything - new tasks, tasks in the works, future tasks, time off, employee reviews, you name it.

I now feel very uncomfortable around him for these reasons:

- his constant pressure
- unreasonable time frames and expectations for tasks to be completed
- huge workload
- not enough staff to handle the workload (I have suggested hiring a paid intern and he is acting slow on this process, although agrees with the idea)

FASTFORWARD TO THIS WEEK:

He told my other supervisor that I am rude because I don't say hello to him in the morning. A big reason for this is because anytime I enter his office he makes me feel uncomfortable for the above reasons.

So as instructed by my other supervisor (who I get along with really well) I went to into my boss' office to clear the air on Monday. It didn't go well. My boss was upset that I brought it up, but I was instructed to do so.

In order to not address the greater issue of me being uncomfortable with him (because I'm not sure if it's appropriate to do so) I said, ""Hey I heard that you thought I was being rude but it was nothing personal at all, I was just trying to not interrupt your phone conversations that you are often on, if not always having, when I walk in at 8:30am"". Then he shook his head and said, ""I'm not always on the phone when you come in"" which I replied with, ""I apologize but today when I got in you were on the phone and I just didnt want to disturb you"". He said, ""I don't want to talk about this right now"" and I left his office...

So I'm just sitting here like WTF ?! I do so much for this guy and I feel like he hates me but he wont have any conversations about my performance when I ask to talk about it (for review purposes, etc). I think he has an ADD issue or is hyperactive and can't focus, therefore he gives all these crazy tasks and is always asking if something is finished.

I'm wondering if it is just me or is my boss abusive ?

I just don't know what to do. I want to find another job but this job has left me feeling like I suck and can't perform and also like I'm a bad employee, which I know I'm not. I work a lot of overtime and produce more than expected.

Anyone have any advice ?

Should I set up a meeting to really just talk everything out and clear the air or do you guys think that would be more destructive than anything? Other people in the office are telling me to clear the air but I'm nervous.

156,"tl;dr roommate is smoking lots of weed and it's getting inside my room which I am not ok with but landlord is away for vacation, do I still tell the landlord about this or wait until he comes back / suck it up until the lease ends?

So I have a new roommate that came in during January and our lease ends at the end of April. 

After he came in, I noticed he started smoking weed and it was fine initially as it was something he does on occasion and the smell didn't get out of his room much. 


However, as of lately, he has been smoking them everyday and it's getting around the house alot through the vents and whenever I leave my mroom (I would have to pass by his door), I would smell it and it's giving me nausea. 

There is also this weird smell that I cannot describe but it smells pretty bad and wet in his room. I know he has a big aquarium in his room but I don't know if the wet smell is coming from the aquarium or not but at this time the smell is getting out of hand as I can smell the weed and whatnot in my room with the door closed 

I want to him to stop using weed but lets be honest, no one is going to stop using because their roommate asked them to. I also don't dare to confront him about it because there have been times where he completely lost it and was yelling and throwing things in his room and it was really really loud so if he was asking for attention, he got it. 

I wanted to let my landlord know about this issue and get him to talk to that roommate but I feel as if I didn't do my part and immediately want to talk to someone in power about the issue. 

The apartment I live in was advertised to be smoke free and I already had to speak to my landlord about this issue in the summer and my landlord was helpful but now my landlord is on vacation and won't be back until some time so I dont know if I should bother him and tell him about this issue because I don't think he will be able to do anything besides warning the other roommate to not do it again.

165,"I have a dilemma with my work/school schedule. I'm a Teacher's Assistant at my local college and I have high-functioning Autism. However, this semester the options I have as a TA are dried out. In the past if I worked late hours, it would usually be two days of the week (not four).

My supervisor has proposed all late night hours to me for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This year I have three classes back-to-back but only on Mondays and Wednesdays. So, this year I wanted to work on only Tuesdays and Thursdays because I have no classes on those days.

This is what my schedule would look like for both school and work if I took late night hours four days of the week:

Mondays &amp; Wednesdays:

Business Class 1 11:00 AM - 12:25 Pm
Business Class 2 12:30 PM - 1:55 PM
Business Class 3 2:30 PM - 3:55 PM  
Work 5:45 PM - 8:15 PM

Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays:

Work 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM

The dilemma I face here is if I take only take two days with the hours my supervisor has proposed to me, I get a $150 cut in my paycheck. Instead of getting paid $300+ I will get only $150 and I only get paid once a month. A $150 paycheck is equivalent to 20 hours of work and $300+ is the equivalent 40 hours of work.

Please keep in mind that I have high-functioning Autism which is a disability. (I am also a part-time student.) My Mom also brought to my attention that if I overwork myself and get overwhelmed that I can get migraine headaches. I suffered them occasionally last year due to working late but, I was only working late two days of the week. Last year I was also able to get all 40 hours in on only Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays and I only had two business classes to deal with in the mornings. 

But the story has changed. This is what I would be having to do for a four-month long semester if I took all 40 hours of work. Mondays &amp; Wednesdays I would be dealing with 3 businesses classes in the morning and then I would work 3 hours starting at 5:45 PM until 8:15 PM. On Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays I would work 3 hours again, starting at 6:00 PM until 8:30 PM. If my classes were more spread out then maybe this schedule would work better, but they are not. 

Should I only take 20 hours of work to better accommodate me so I can focus on my homework and classes? Because if I overwork myself and I get overwhelmed I may have a very difficult time focusing. I might also have headaches and I probably end up going to bed late which will make matters even worse. What do you think? My supervisor needs to finalize the work schedule by tomorrow so I don't have time to wait, I need to make a decision today.

Update: I have also made a decision after writing this post, finding out the facts, that I am going to do all 48 hours plus school. I figure if I get a headache I can take some aspirin or advil. However, your input is still appreciated because I am more so seeking advice now on how to handle this schedule now. Because this schedule will be challenging for me this year.",10Feb2017,1

First year of high school (2016-2017), I've met people who I thought are gonna be good friends but soon enough later, one of them started picking on me in class and teachers would act as if they don't see, the same person was manipulating me into doing bad things and it feels as if this person is draining my energy out and is destroying me from the inside. Soon enough I've opened my eyes and realized how cruel and bad people can be, and I started hating them. Now it's just lonely, everyone is annoying because they complain, are loud, and whine all the time, like I swear, if whining was a job, they'd be bill gates rich level. I love learning, studying and doing my homework at school, but people there are a big pain. I only have one friend I can trust but not to the fullest. I feel as if my paranoia is high, I am becoming less creative everyday and starting to not be funny anymore and none of that is good. 
I think my life is so dull/boring, but I'm still fighting each day to finish school with good grades to become what will get me money and then use the income to become something I really want that I will be happy with. Basically, I am not having fun/enjoying the ride...",10Feb2017,1

My SO is trying to help her parents rebuild their credit. Their credit is around 540-560 right now and it was worse before but I believe after paying some things off it went back up to around where it is now. They've never had a credit card, but now after doing a little better they would like to get one so that they can build their credit up for the future if they want to get a house or car. The thing is they only qualify for those secured credit cards where you pay a certain amount in case something happens. 

My SO has great credit and has been building it up for years. She has 2 credit cards with high credit limits and always pays things off in time. She can add authorized users to her credit cards and she is wondering if she adds them as an authorized user, will that increase their credit score as well? 

She understands that all unpaid credit goes to her, but she trust them to pay it. She would just like to know if they were added would it help build their credit and would it negatively affect her credit unless there is unpaid credit on the card?  ",10Feb2017,2
169,"I go to an online school and im in 11th grade. Im a guy, if that needs mentioning. So basically i was in my one class and the way it works is the teachers just talk about the lesson for each day and theres a thing where you can type to answer and ask questions to the teacher or other students. Blah blah blah, not important.

One student said something i agreed with, so i said that i agree with her. Later on after the class, she messages me through the school site's messaging system. Basically asks me if i was the one from before, i said yeah, then she eventually asks ""if i have a girlfriend and if not would i like to be friends with her?"" 

I figured why not, said ""sure give me your number and we can text."" After this, she says that she doesnt have a phone, and that she wants my mom's phone number for her parents to have (its pretty clear shes pretty sheltered and has strict parents  - opposite of me). I didnt really know what to say to this so i ignored it hoping she'd stop. I feel so bad but i know that if she's the type of person whos 16/17 that doesn't have a cell phone and has to have my mom's phone number to just be friends, that i probably wouldnt enjoy her company anyway (as blunt as that sounds) and i get uncomfortable meeting new people. I'd rather let it go and just forget it happened than drag my mom into this too, ya know? I got one very great friend Ive known a while and im happy with that.

A day goes by and she messages me again twice, first asking if i got the message and next sending me a powerpoint on who she is and why she could make a good friend (i swear to god this person is the exact opposite of me). I feel that pit in my stomache because i really want nothing to do with her but i cant help but feeling im being a huge douchebag. On one hand, my rational part of me says ""all you did was agree with her in class once, shes being weird"" but there's also the me that thinks ""shes being so nice, even if i dont want to be her friend, how can i go through with telling this poor, sheltered girl 'no i dont want to be your friend?'"" I know who I am, and i really dont think i the kind of person who can be so blunt with someone i dont know at all (im a quiet, reserved pussy is what im getting at).

Im at a bit of a conundrum. Im thinking of lying and telling her that i asked my mom and she said we cant be friends and that we should just stay classmates and not to message me again (pretend im even more sheltered than she is), or maybe just ignoring her hoping she'll never message me again or bring anything up in a class we share. Any advice? Id rather someone tell me on how to end the situation in my favor than telling me to just do what she asked cause I know I wouldnt enjoy it.",10Feb2017,1
170,"I don't remember exactly but I think it's almost a year since he was born.

My ex was very abusive, gaslighted me badly and cheated. She was the first girl I had ever been with and I was too naive to even know she was abusing me. I thought it was normal and I tried my hardest to make things work.

We broke up mutually on good terms I ""wasn't the guy for her"" and I was just relieved to be free. I never mentioned how she had been treating me as I still liked her and she lead me on further saying we ""might get back together"" and continued trying to sleep with me whilst becoming more abusive.

When I discovered she had been cheating I confronted her and she didn't even care enough to cover it up or apolgise, instead she gaslighted me further saying we were never together and she could do what she wanted.

After finally coming to my senses and doubting my own sanity several times I sent her a message saying how horrible of a person she actually is, eventually this lead to her saying she was pregnant. The date she gave was when we were together and we didn't use protection(she said she was on the pill).

She told me ""it's not yours, if it was I would get an abortion"". After explaining that she doesn't get to decide she threatened to call the police, when I told her to do it she threatened to have me killed instead.

I met her after the boy was born, she ignored what had happened and told me I was ""over thinking things"" when I brang it up(her usual gaslighting technique). I eventually ended up blocking her on everything as her complete lack of empathy terrifies me.

There's a lot more detail to it but it was all very confusing for me trying to take everything in for the first time and dealing with the constant lies.

**tl;dr: Can I travel on the passport I've linked?  (bullet points below)**

So I am a UK national (who's half Japanese) with only a Japanese passport (It's a long story, but for now that's just the way it has to be). 
I'm traveling to Prague next Tuesday morning from London. After a very stressful incident today that I won't go into, I have noticed some damage to the firm/cardboard, non-flexible page in the middle of the passport (see: http://imgur.com/a/3fkJd).

I've rang the Japanese embassy and they've told me to come in first thing Monday morning, so they can scan it and see whether the chip works.

**I have two questions that I'd really appreciate some advice with:**

* Even if the chip doesn't work, don't passport officers have other methods of processing passports? Will the fact that they can clearly see I'm European/English and carrying my birth certificate if necessary, be in my favour at all? What is the frank but slightly optimistic likely hood that I will be able to travel on this?

* Is there a chance that, on Monday morning upon scanning my passport and finding that the chip doesn't work, that the Japanese embassy will be legally required to 'cancel' or 'revoke' my current passport for travel and force me to renew it on the spot, thus taking away the possibility for me to 'try it anyway' with my damaged passport.

I'm generally a calm guy but I'm really panicking with this, would appreciate some frank but slightly hopeful advice, thanks!

I had a job offer for a nanny position, which was filled by the time I responded to it. He told me he did have a position open for a personal assistant, though. However, I'm weary for a number of reasons:

1. The job is part time (12 hrs/wk) and pays VERY well--too well. It seems too good to be true. 
2. He is supposedly in Canada on business and will not be able to meet me face to face immediately. 
3. He deleted his care.com account after messaging me and told me to email him personally, which I did. Hopefully that wasn't a mistake. 
4. He felt the need to tell me he's a pastor (in my opinion, it could be a way to make someone seem more trustworthy than they are)
5. The job requirements would be to run errands for him and to **have mail &amp; packages sent either to my address or a post office near me.** I would then give them to him when he would be available to pick them up. He says this is because he is out of town a lot. This is my biggest concern. Is that even legal?

182,"This is probably going to be a long post. So I am a MSc student in Math and this is my first term. I gave my first exam (oral exam) for one of the course and I failed it. The prof (with whom I wanted to work under him for my thesis) said that I am too slow. Other students could explain the topics in a minute where I took 15 with few of the things wrong. 

The question asked made me realize that I do not know Real analysis that well when it comes to the basics and foundation part of math. It is really making me think if I should really pursue the degree further given that brushing up with the basics would take me a year and get to the level of other masters students. This would require some mentoring but finding a mentor who could give me time is hard to find. If I drop out then obviously I have to find a job and doing this would be really embarrassing for me. Parents and other relatives are going to question me when I go back to my country. 

I have another oral exam on 16th and I am guessing the result would be the same. I did alright in my BSc and was really excited when I got accepted for my MSc thinking that it is a new phase of life and I'll give my best shot at this but things didn't work out as I had planned. With failing this course, even if I continue my degree, I would not get my thesis topic from this prof because who would supervise a brainlet, right? I just lost my potential adviser as well as my research interest. 

If things continue like this, I might be chucked out of the degree so rather wasting time and money, I need to decide something. I always thought that nothing is impossible but as the time is passing by, this statement is turning out to be false. I just can't waste my parents money and do something which I am not good at. 

At this point of time, I have lost all hope, sitting depressed on my bed typing this with no idea what is stored in my future. The only thing I can foresee is that I'll become NEET again, be a burden on my parents until I get a job or maybe join my family business, help my parents out in their work. I mean it is a big let down in my life as I didn't expect this to happen and don't know how to cope up with this failure.

My supervisor has proposed all late night hours to me for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. (I have taken these hours because there was nothing else available.) This year I have three classes back-to-back but only on Mondays and Wednesdays. So, this year I wanted to work on only Tuesdays and Thursdays because I have no classes on those days.

This is what my schedule looks like for both school and work this semester:

Mondays &amp; Wednesdays:

Business Class 1 11:00 AM - 12:25 PM 
Business Class 2 12:30 PM - 1:55 PM 
Business Class 3 2:30 PM - 3:55 PM
Work 5:45 PM - 8:15 PM

Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays:

Work 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM

Please keep in mind that I have high-functioning Autism which is a disability. (I am also a part-time student.) My Mom also brought to my attention that if I overwork myself and get overwhelmed that I can get migraine headaches. I suffered them occasionally last year due to working late but, I was only working late two days of the week. Last year I was also able to get all 40 hours in on only Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays and I only had two business classes to deal with in the mornings. But the story has changed, I am dealing with one more business classes in the morning than last year. Additionally, I am working all four days of the school week this year.
In the years past my schedule was more spaced and spread out to better accommodate me. Because I will be overworking myself and I may get overwhelmed, I may have a very difficult time focusing. I might also have headaches and I probably end up going to bed late which will make matters even worse. (I realized for the headaches, I can get relief from them by taking aspirin or advil.)

Ok here goes.

So a couple of months back in october I started college with a person I met before a couple times (sort of similar friend circle but not really) but never had much to do with aside from those two to three times I met her. But since we started college together, we have basically been together a lot. We sat next to each other every day of class (had to take the first classes together) and did all sorts of shit together, basically being huge weirdos to each other.

The inevitable happened and  I developed a massive crush on her. Nothing happened that would make me think she had a crush on me too (we partied a bit together but she never really 'made a move' on me leading to me not really trying anything),I just hoped she did since we always had a blast when we were together.

Anyway I finally told her how I felt little over a month ago and she was very distressed, basically crying and saying that she saw me as her best friend and she felt sorry that she couldn't give me what I wanted but still wanted to remain friends.
 I told her that she didn't need to be sorry and that I still wanted to be friends with her, however in the coming weeks I noticed that I can't see her in a non-romantic way so I broke off contact (we're on break now, plus we don't have classes together anymore next semester, so I figured it'd be a good time to do so).

The problem now is that I still miss her horribly. I've deleted her number and snapchat and unfollowed her on facebook, but I still think and dream about her all the time and basically I'm a sad fuck right now.

Years go by and everything is hunky dory, then fast forward to today, they need pretty serious relationship advice and I'm the only impartial person they can speak to about the situation.

Am I doing the right thing helping and keeping everything completely under wraps even though I'm technically not as impartial as they think?

I'm just unsure what I should do and say to my parents and what I should do with my life. Sorry about formatting pr anything- mobile and first time post. Also I don't want to do anything against my sister because my family would be pretty broken if I did that and I guess I feel enough to not do that. I've just gone no contact so I'm not really looking for what to do with my sister, but anything is appreciated! Sorry if anything isn't explained very well and I'll try to answer the questions if you need info I guess",10Feb2017,1

The sister I guess told the mother and older sister, and the older sister (my wife's friend) told my wife who told me.

215,"I live in an apartment, and a few months ago a single parent and teenage kid moved in below me. There have been no noise issues the entire time I've lived here (2+ years), but this week, the teen downstairs has started playing extremely loud music for hours at a time. It usually happens right when school lets out, for at least 2 hours (not early in the morning or late in the evening).

Today, however, the music started around noon, and it's still happening 3 hours later, leading me to believe that the teen is skipping school (or they're just sick, I suppose).

I know it's the teen playing the music, and I'm assuming that the parent doesn't know about it given the time of day it's usually happening (after school gets but before 9-5 jobs are over). I've overheard a few of their arguments, and the teen seems to be going through a very angsty phase.

I know it would be better to talk to them before complaining to my management about the noise, but I don't want to go complain directly to the angsty child, and I don't want to go straight to the parent and end up in the middle of a family argument, especially if it inadvertently reveals that the kid is skipping school. 

Any advice on how to get them to cut the noise down? Do you think it would be best to try to catch the parent to discuss the issue with them, or should I just go straight to my apartment management?

217,"I'm 6'1 and (was) ~160lbs 
     I've always been a rather skinny guy in middle and high school, not otherwise healthy. My weight stabilized around 160lbs through most of highschool, but I've always wanted to gain more weight, be it either muscle or fat, I didn't really care, I just wanted to weigh more so that id look healthy. The thing is, the process of eating food exhausts me and I would rather not take place in it. I love food, and it tastes great for the most part, but I can only usually scrounge down a few bites, and then I have this almost gag like reflex that makes eating any more too troubling. 
    Since I started my first year of college last August, I've lost about 10lbs since the last time I weighed myself, and probably more in the month since then. I was excited to gain the ""freshmen 15"" but I find myself eating less than I ever have, and just saying I'll eat more food the next day in the dining Commons to make up for it, but that usually never happens.

Then I asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work. I went in to my advisor and she asked me about getting to work etc, I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was on her computer, so I apologised she then said 'it's alright' (but sounded annoyed) I explained my manager questioned me about it. and said I understand.

233,"Hello,

I am 12 Yrs old in 6th grade, and I just fired up a 3D printer project. It is currently my second trimester, and when I started it the first trimester, there were no issues. But when second trimester came around, a kid named Trevor started taking interest in the things I like, such as computers, 3D design, and things of the sort. At first I thought he seemed like a O.K kid, because it is EXTREMELY rare to find someone that has the same interest as me in the grade level I am in. I talked with him and he said he knew about most of the things that I said, and we were happy and comfortable with each other for a while.

But that's where it took a turn.

Now, I first want to say, I am in no way bullying this kid. He is nice, just has some social issues.

One time in the gym during our break, he told me he was partially autistic, and that was relatively obvious, consider the way he acted and some of the things he said didn't really make sense.

In the 3D printer club, we host it during 4th hour art class, and I will take random people over to the computer lab every day to design 3D objects. Usually 2-4 people at a time. Each person can come over a maximum of three times. And this is when Trevor had taken a turn for the worst.

I have a list of people in the class, and then what I do is every time they are in the lab, they put a check next to their name once. Once they have three, they cannot come over anymore.

Trevor decided it would be a good idea to not put his check on each day, and by the middle of the trimester, we figured out he had gone over to the lab a minimum of 25 times. In the 3D printer club, students are still fully 100% responsible for their NORMAL art projects, but my art teacher and I were looking through some of the stuff, and found out he had not completed about 70% of his assignments...

Ever since we stopped letting him back in the lab, he started following me around ALL day long. During first hour I have math, but not with him, and he will sit outside the door at the end of it, then second hour I have with him. There is a girl in my second hour I kind of like, and I try to sometimes get some alone time near her, but he cant take the hint and talks about random crap like minecraft and cringey things of the sort. (I hate minecraft, one of the cringiest things ever made in my opinion) My crush kind of makes this weird look on her face and it really ticks me off that he is interfering in my personal life like this. Then after second hour he goes to the opposite side of the school for his third hour, and I get some peace. Then after third hour I have lunch. I try to show up early to lunch to sit near MY friends, but he kind of adapted his schedule to mine... He comes to my table EVERY day, even though all my friends think he is just as annoying as I do. After lunch we have a ""recess"" in the gym, and I try to listen to music, or talk with my other friends that are normal, and he just sits there and follows me around ALLLLLL recess. And it gets creepier. He will come up the me and slightly rub onto my shoulder and whisper ""Hey carter, can I come to the computer lab...?""! I think he is trying to be almost SEDUCTIVE in the way his tone is, like it's going to make me want to take him more, but it honestly just comes off as creepy and gay. Then we go to the fourth hour, and the days when I DON'T take people to the computer lab, he just calls me from his seat the whole time and gets almost nothing done. I don't have any other hours with him after that, but it's just so CREEPY. I want to get rid of him without being mean, and to add to that, I just realized that he isn't even smart with computers at all. He just pretends to be. I'll ask him if he knows what a certain thing is and he just kind of stutters and changes the subject. He also grabs me randomly and flails me around like I'm his puppet. (I'm kind of scrawny but come on, that's too far...)

To be frank with you guys I just want him out of my life. He's annoying, creepy, weird, and just an oddball overall and all my friends agree.

Thank you for reading my prolonged stupid article.

Carter

234,"I figure I should preface this, I live in California for context.

So, I got hung up in a bit of bureaucratic red tape today. I am now set to receive my AST (business administration), but missed a deadline so I will basically be stuck in limbo for a semester while I wait for state to allow me to transfer in next spring as opposed to in the fall. I have no more classes I can take at the city level, and there appears to be no way for me to seek instruction from my transferring institution until spring at minimum. Setting all that aside I rely on student loans to pay my bills, and so without being in school for a semester I have to work to make ends meet.

Here is the catch: In order to transfer in the fall, I had to take 5 courses this semester (then I went and missed the transfer deadline) So my hands are relatively tied in terms of my free time, as most of it is spent on campus, and the bit that isn't is spent at doing work. The thing is, I really can't afford not to have a job right as I transition out of City college. 

So my tentative plan of action is to start the job hunt in May after which I only really have 2 weeks of instruction and a week of finals. This just doesn't really sit well with me. I feel like I'm letting a lot ride on my ability to find work in that timeframe. My absolute financial burnout period is July, after which my financial and and money will be more or less spent on bills, because I was planning on being in school come August. 

So here's where I come in seeking advice. Are there any jobs out there I could feasibly apply for sooner that have a high degree of flexibility for someone with an AST in business administration? I wouldn't even mind manual labor or anything, but I figure I'd put my education to work if possible. I think government work of some kind would kind of fall in line with this, or something like substitute teaching (though not that specifically, I'm not qualified) Any input in this regard would be helpful Thanks much for your input.",10Feb2017,2

241,"I really hope someone takes the time to read this. It's long but I really need some advice.

So here's my story: At the age of 21 I was using drugs occasionally and drinking excessively and began to feel like I was giving up on life. The first place I looked for help was my family doctor who prescribed Effexor (venlafaxine) to help me cope with my feelings.

A couple of days after I started taking Effexor, I had my first panic attack. I got my mom to drive me to the hospital where I was admitted and put under the care of a psychiatrist that I'll call Dr. D. Dr. D spoke to me for about 10 minutes and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on a combination of psychiatric medications which made me feel even worse. Problem is I thought I was just feeling worse because I was getting worse, never considered that it could be the meds. So next time I met with Dr. D I said I felt worse. He gave me more/different meds.
This pattern continued for over a year and I was in absolute hell the whole time. In and out of hospitals, freaking out the whole time. The answer was always more meds. This doctor put me on just about every common antipsychotic, several anxiolotics, SSRIs, hypnotics, I was even on clozapine towards the end, something that left another phychiatrist, whom I only saw once after an ER visit out of town, with a look of shock on his face. He couldn't believe I was on that drug after meeting me.

After about two years of this I had a moment of clarity and decided to get off the meds. I weened myself off and when I was finally off them I felt ALIVE. It was amazing. I lost all the weight (100 lbs) that I gained while on the meds in a year and I felt amazing. I got a job, eventually a girlfriend, and I have been a healthy, productive young man ever since I got off the meds. I'm 100% confident that I do not have any psychiatric illness.

Now I want to apply for the military and I'm certain that this diagnosis is going to result in immediate disqualification. Is there any way that I can get this diagnosis revised?

I'd also like to note that after I got off the meds I discovered that Dr. D has a reputation for misdiagnosis and gross over-prescribing of medications.

Currently 26yo, healthy, clean and sober. It has been about 2 years since I took prescriptions meds and a year since I used any recreational drugs. (5 years since any drugs other than marijuana). Living in Canada.",10Feb2017,1

I've taken on a position with a new company and as a result I am frankly very broke right now so trying new activities that cost ANYTHING is not an option. I am already heavily involved in volunteer work and my job serves the community as well. I've lead an advanced life as far as most things go.

250,"Hi, I made a post a few months ago, but I deleted it because I got a little Reddit famous. 

Anyway, here is the small recap. I have an awful roommate and a good one. The awful one has a cat that is constantly damaging things that we(me and the other roommate own). He also acts really awfully when confronted about these things. For example, screaming and cursing at us. 

The situation hasn't changed much, but he has watched his cat more ever since the other roommate said he would have the landlord kick it out. 

Well the current issue of the day is now about him hogging the living room. Essentially he stays in the living room all the time. He doesn't leave it. All his gaming systems are in there. He says it is because he doesn't have an Ethernet cord in his room so he can't play overwatch. 

Well this has understandably become a problem because he never leaves and never wants to share the space. So if we want to do something in there he has to want to as well. In order to stop drama from erupting I bought him a power line adapter. It basically let's you have a wired connection from anywhere in the room. It is awesome. 

Well jokes on me he still doesn't use it. The problem has recently come to a boiling point with me because he stays up late playing. He won't turn the sound off because he needs to hear and he has commentary for everything he does. I got angry and screamed at him and I admittedly got close to hitting him. I even considered changing the Wi-Fi password but that wouldn't help. 

At this point I am going crazy. I don't get enough sleep because of it and he never seems to sleep.
