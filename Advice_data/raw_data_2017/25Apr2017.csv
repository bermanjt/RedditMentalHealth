0,"So long story, I'm just gonna bullet point it

• Browsing Craigslist
• Got bored
• Setup a fake persona using fake photos to pretend I'm someone I am not
• Got a lot of replies
• Got one person in particular
• After a week the guy wanted me to message his personal E-mail
• Checked the e-mail out and it links to his FB
• Poor security settings
• Find his Wife's account

Needless to say I have a lot of incriminating information. The question is do I tell the Mrs. of his infidelity or not? ",25Apr2017,0
1,"So I have a shared PayPal with my sister and BIL due to the fact we all ran a business together. Recently, my pay card got lost and I had to request a new one which takes 7-10 days. 

I have weird cravings to buy random stuff. Well yesterday I randomly decided to start collecting narcotic drug swag. So using the company PayPal, I bought an Opana clock and an Adderall pen. I planned on replacing the money when I got my debit card. 

Anyways, they no longer want to do the business with me. I really regret it, because I lost trust over something so stupid. My life is ruined because I lost two business partners and also upset my Bill.  I didn't NEED to do that. I just got the hankering. I could have waited until my debit card came in the mail, but was worried it would be sold out by then. 

I'm not an addict in the slightest. Maybe an alcoholic pothead, but certainly not an pill addict. They are now probably going to think I'm hooked on Adderall and Opana, which I'm not. I've done Adderall a few times. But I have yet to do Opana. 


Stupid mistake, and long term consequences. Why did I have to ruin trust by purchasing drug swag, why can't I ruin trust with actual drugs like a normal person? 

That being said, I have no one to work with. I'm worried my life is over. I even tried manipulation techniques on them and it didn't work. I don't want my life to be over, but it is. I need to fix my life, but for some reason guilt tripping and blame shifting didn't work. ",25Apr2017,1
2,"Ok, so basically I fucked up when I chose my degree, I went for chemistry cause it seemed like it was what I had to go for, Im stupid I know.

I always loved programming and recently I finally accepted that I dont like chemistry, the thing is, I want to study a programming course (its like a 2 year degree that focuses on programming) and my parents wont let me drop out with the pretext of ""knowledge is never bad... blablabla"".

I know that is a chiché, parents dont letting me out of college pursuing other things, but I consider my parents to be really intelligent people and its bugging me cause I think I may be doing the wrong turn and maybe I should finish chemist before doing what I really want.

So the question here is if you think I should pursue what I want dropping out of college, and if you think I should, what can I do to convince my parents to let me?

Finally just for the record, I really dont want to study chemistry and Im really passionate about programming (I've been learning C# for some time).

3,"So, I was talking to my best friend and I told her something about a girl and she told it to her, and I felt bad because I thought she would be angry (The other girl). 


But turns out she wasn't and I was angry at my best friend and I might have acted a little rude, but I never actually directly insulted her or anything like that but now she's angry. I tried talking to her and she couldn't be asked, she just went somewhere else.


Some of her closest friends were talking about how she was having problems in her house and how I should give her some space, but I feel like if I give her some space, she'll think I'm ignoring her. 


Reddit, please help. I feel devastated and I don't want to ruin this friendship.

4,"I'm feeling so disappointed and embarrassed in myself right now. Usually I drive safely, I'm not those people who drive 50 over the limit or cut every single driver off and run through red lights like I'm blind. However last week I got a ticket for failing to yield on a left turn, mind you the opposite oncoming lane is really far from the intersection and I'm closer to the perpendicular lane than the start of the opposite lane is and by that point, my stomach was rumbling. I was on the verge of doing a #2 and a cop pulls out of nowhere and gives me said ticket. 

Skip to today and I was pulling into my University's campus parking doing supposedly 40 in a 25 mph zone, I had an exam that morning and I didn't know I was going 40, usually I drive around 35 and the police there says you can only go up to 15 mph over the limit. However I did remember that I was only speeding for about 3 seconds and coming to a slow stop when turning right into the parking lot. 

Should I appeal for not guilty in both cases? I don't know if I can slip my away out of this or if the judges can let things go. I'm only 19 years old and my father already knows about the first ticket but I'm too scared to tell him about the second ticket. I'm scared that I'm gonna lose my good driver discount and my student driver discount over these stupid little mistakes. I felt so devastated during my exams I just wanted to leave halfway through.

6,"Hey, all. I wasn't quite sure where to post this, but if there's a better subreddit I'd love to know.

I'll be blunt. I'm a high school freshman who doesn't have a lot of money. However, I love to help others (I have some volunteering gigs up) and I very much want to participate in some kinda summer program or camp that doesn't cost a lot of money (or is free!).

As a result, there are a lot of programs that I would LOVE to partake in, but can't get the funds for at this point in time.

But anyway, if anyone knows of any affordable or just really cool summer programs, I'd love to hear about them. I would prefer something with science, but, hey, beggars can't be choosers.

8,"I was sitting in a group in meetup with the meetup leader and a few others. We started talking about folding underwear because it was a question that was asked in a game that we played. 

I then asked, what if you could wear underwear while it was folded? It was just a dumb question and some people laughed and one of the women said, I would like to see you do that and one of the guys was like oh hey, look out! 

Meanwhile the leader of the group just looked at me and said, ""Eww, i don't even want to think about that"", referring to me. I know that I am not all that, but she isn't either. So my question is, why are people rude to others? What can I do to say something back? I felt that she was out of line and it embarrassed me in front of others.  I mean if you don't have anything nice, just don't say anything at all.

10,"I'm not desperate but my mind is falling apart. I'm 18, never dated, no sex, no female friends.etc. Sadly I live in a society that creates this idea that being a virgin is shameful. 

In the past I've been looked down upon, mocked to an extent because at this age it's abnormal to be one. Earlier this year I began my change with r/NoFap which has gave me energy to do things such as meditation and beating one of my biggest fears: the gym.

I've changed my look, started to take care of my skin more.etc and I'm on a road to self improvement. However, the virgin thing really crushes my mind and makes me want to kill myself. I can't even push the thoughts out because I know I'll be lonely forever.

Shortly later, I'll get a chat or whatever from them, my chat I sent is still there (meaning they never saw it), I get NO notification that we've become friends, and when I try to respond I still get a message saying they need to add me back.

They confirm that they've added me, yet it does not show up and blocks me from messaging them despite them being able to message me. Is there a reason why this is happening? Or a workaround? I don't know of any so it's very frustrating. ",25Apr2017,0
14,"In short: I'm dating / hooking up with this guy who has given me cash after each time we have seen each other. Is this a way of courting me? Or should I be offended?

For a little more context: We met at a bar about 2 months ago but barely hung out for the first time 2 weeks ago. I work a lot and honestly just didn't feel like putting any effort into trying to get to know him. We had been texting almost daily and made plans a few times but I would always bail last minute. But i finally decided to go ahead and hang out. We went to dinner, had some drinks then went to my place. We hooked up, he stayed over and then we parted ways in the morning. In the AM I was heading out to meet with some family, we went to the corner store together and he bought me my lil coffee. Then when we were saying bye he pulled out a $20 and put it in my bag along with the juice he also bought me and said ""here, so that you can take a cab"". I was so thrown off!! He knew I was only walking 5 minutes so (a) I didn't have to catch a cab and (b) even if I were to catch a cab it wouldn't cost $20!! Anyway, I let that go. But then he did something similar this weekend. We hung last night, he ended up staying over again. This morning we took the train together and right before his stop he reached into his pocket, pulled out some cash and put it in my bag again. This time he said ""buy yourself some breakfast"". I was like okay he really gave me cash again. It was $30. What the fuck kind of quick Monday morning breakfast is going to cost me that much? I've never had this experience before. It's quite confusing. Does it seem like a courting technique, like is he trying to impress me? Do you think this is endearing? Is it demeaning? (He knows I have a good job and can pay my own bills, and cabs and breakfast for that matter!) I mostly think it's him trying to impress me but a part of me can't help but feel a bit patronized by it. What are folks thoughts and opinions??",25Apr2017,1
15,"Thank you in advance for taking the time to read. My ex with whom I became very close friends is now dating a poor excuse of a man.

Here is some context:

Don't think that I'm jealous, it's not that. There is history between him and I. History that I will try to describe as accurately as possible.

There is a possibility that we were friends, but even at the beginning, I had my doubts about how long this could last. He seemed too full of himself and constantly made fun of my English. After having him over once, I realized my parents didn't like him.

Near the end of my first semester in college, I was walking with him to the lockers. That is when we found an iPhone on the ground. Back then, it was the latest model. I picked it up and asked around to see if it belonged to anyone. Then, greed took over me. I put it in my pocket and left. Since he was with me, we came to an agreement that we would sell this phone and split the profits equally. A third friend was there too, but he didn't want part of it. He told us to bring it to security. Honestly, I should have listened to the more honest man. However, this is also irrelevant. By the end of the day, I had already broken into the phone and reset it to its Factory Mode. The next day, I had already sold it for 500$ cash. That's when the trouble began.

I was sitting in physics when he came to me, with fear in his eyes. “They caught us”, he said. Shortly after, security came and took us both for interrogation. On the way there I found out that what he said was only partly true. It was him and only him! They didn't know who I was or where I went. He must have panicked because he told security who I was and how they could find me. In the less legal world, that is called a rat, but that's also past the point. Then things got even worse. Since I was seen on camera picking up the phone and he appeared to be just a bystander, he let me take all of the blame. He was no bystander though. He was my accomplice that would have taken the money if we hadn't been caught. This so called friend let me shovel my way out of this mess on my own. After consulting a lawyer and speaking numerous times to security, I was lucky enough that the owner of the phone settled on dropping charges if I bought her new phone. Obviously she didn't want the same model, she forced me to buy the newest one, at a cost of 1000$. Add the lawyer consultation and the salvaged money from the phone sale and I was out 1000$. Technically the least this friend could do was to split the cost with me (especially considering I took the fall). But he didn't. He didn't offer anything. When the deal was resolved, he came back as if nothing happened. That's when my smiles stopped being genuine.

I avoided him as much as I could, but he stuck around. Fast forward a few months and my ex who was also my best friend started dating him. I was left with a choice: to tell her what I thought of him and face the consequences or to ignore my feelings. She was so happy to start seeing someone again that I made the wrong choice. I should have told her right away. Instead, I buried my rage, anger and hate deep down.

For a while, his existence in her life didn't bother me. We were spending fun times together and I often forgot he existed. Then, as her relationship got more serious, she started bringing him places more and more. At this point, if I told her– I feared that she might feel that she had to make a choice between me and him. What I feared even more was the result of that choice. Perhaps this was an unfounded fear, but it was truly crippling. It forced me to keep lying, to keep seeing him, to keep smiling. So I did, and so time went on.

During the summer, when we had a sleepover at his cottage, I made it clear to both of them that I was interested in the girl I brought. I recall all three of us agreeing that she would spend the night with me. Her boyfriend just had to bring down a mattress. He had to ruin it for me. Why wouldn't he, it's all about what kind of host he is. Just another example of how he cares only about himself and his image. He couldn't look bad, nor could he admit he too was guilty of theft a few years ago. That night, I made myself a promise that I would never spend time with him again. I wasn't going to. I didn't want to.

Fast forward a few weeks and she invited me over to her house to make dumplings. I was truly excited about that until I found out that he would be there too. I couldn't back out of this one, I found out about his presence when it was too late. My crippling fear of loss was still there, so I sucked up my emotions and displayed yet another smile. Of course, she didn't tell me he was going to be there because she thought we were friends. I don't blame her for that. I can only blame myself and my tendency to self-sabotage.

Now we hardly speak and I don't really have any other good friends. I don't know what to do. I'd like to forgive him but he'll keep backstabbing me.

All comments/ideas are appreciated. Please don't criticize my past actions, I have paid for them and learned my lesson.

20,"I feel like I'm running out of options on places to work where I live. I used to be consistently working in Retail stores like in malls and such for a good few years, but now I feel like I'm screwed and there's nothing I can do to get a job.

From 18 to 21 I worked in Retail, moving from home to an apt with a friend a city away. But around the time my Granddad passed I found myself hopping jobs pretty frequently. Eventually some family stuff happened and I moved back home so my dad wasn't living alone and I feel my work history has me in a spot where I'm kinda screwed trying to get a new job. I've been living here for over a year and had 2 jobs, the first was a month long and I was let go because my mom whom I never met suddenly showed up and it put me in a really bad spot. A few months later and I had a second job which I thought was overnight stocking, but they changed me to a day job right after training. I worked 1 day before telling them I wasn't coming back to work for them since what they changed me to wouldn't work with my schedule. That was 2 months ago and I've had 1 application since that never returned my call. But I just can't help but feel like I've screwed myself and I have no idea what to do now for work or for $. I have no schooling past HS because I couldn't afford it and the area I live in is mostly warehousing jobs, but I think Amazon blacklisted me from my time with them and no one returns my calls. I've got roughly 4k in credit card debt and horrible credit now too. I'd like to find even just a PT job so I can still use most of my time with my dad since his mom passed.

But now I feel like my only options are to enlist in the military or something because I can't go back to school and I can't find work anywhere. I don't want to enlist in the military because in my opinion I don't want to fight for the people leading the country. I'm not political at all, so I don't really like to get into politics I would just rather not enlist.

Is there anything else I can do?",25Apr2017,1

27,"The person that I have been dating [19/M] and I [20/F] have had plans to go to an event in a neighboring city for about a month now. At first they were not concrete plans, more of a, ""would you be interested in going? It sounds kind of fun"" deal but it eventually evolved into a more solidified idea. The responsibility to buy tickets would go to me, and he would pay for transportation - So essentially, we have all of the details fleshed out, and have both been looking forward to it. Me a little more than him, maybe, as I think he is more interested in the idea of exploring the city than the actual function. 

I am, however, currently in a delicate situation as far as my family/home life goes. I have opted to live with my parents while attending college, and they operate under a ""my house, my rules"" philosophy. I genuinely feel as though this is fair for the most part, I'm living there rent free with the expectation of only chipping in for bills and helping out with chores. I have it easy and am thankful for all that they're doing for me. Sometimes, however, it is at the cost of my independence. 

Sometimes is the key word here, as the majority of the time I am treated as - more or less - an equal within the household and they do not impose strict regulations upon me. I sincerely did not expect the upcoming event to be a major source of conflict for them. But I was wrong. They've made it clear that they're not comfortable with me going and that they would worry for my safety if I were to leave (it is a very large city, and the event would be taking place at night, so I can understand the concern here- if only on a superficial level). 

They have told me that I am an adult and that I can do what I want, but have said so with heavy undertones of disapproval as well. I know how this story ends, and I know that if I were to be adamant about my right to go, it would result in weeks of tensions that acclimate to explosive arguments. Not before, of course, they attempt to veto my decision- ""Our house, our rules,"" after all. It is a futile situation that will be a source of conflict no matter what. Financial and medical complications already have emotions running high within the house, I do not want to push my luck. 

So, I think the right thing to do is. . . Well, pick my battles, right? Cut my losses, and not go to the event- It isn't so bad, we can go again in the future (it happens every few months), once my parents have warmed to the situation. For now, I've looked into more local events happening this weekend, and have saved a few things that look interesting- Things that I feel like my boyfriend and I could both enjoy. So I have a back-up idea, you could say, I just don't really know how to approach him with it.

Really, how am I supposed to say, ""Hey, I know we have been talking about this thing for awhile, but what about we go do these OTHER things instead? Cool?"" Because honestly, I feel like this is kind of a shitty thing to do, and I feel really guilty already just thinking about backing out. I want to have a good time with him regardless, and I know him - he's a really great guy, and I think he would agree to it. I just don't really know how to initiate the conversation in a way that is. . . Both polite and apologetic? 

I don't want him to thing I'm just flaking out, is what I'm saying.

TL;DR: My bf and I were planning on going to an event together, but tensions with family is making that seem unlikely. I want to suggest we do something else that day, instead. What is the best way possible to do that?",25Apr2017,1

33,"Our neighbours (husband and wife) live very close next door, and have a pathway they constantly use to get straight to their back garden situated right outside my bedroom window and my flatmate's bedroom window.

We are tenants in a shitty old flat, and they hate that they have to live next to ""dirty students"" (as we have heard them call us). They have referred to us as ""drug addicts"" and ""that we leave the windows open just to annoy them"" (more nuggets overheard from their everyday conversation).

Note that the wife has been 'improving' the wall that faces their pathway by painting it and had done a shit job and the window was unable to be opened as it slides up. We had to go over to their side and fix it up. She hasn't asked our landlord or ever let us know that she was going to paint it.  

So, with all that in mind, these neighbours had a quiet drinks last night and got fairly drunk. The wife thought it would be a fantastic idea to talk loudly in the pathway right outside our windows with her friends and 'show off' her paintwork. She then proceeded to try to open my flatmate's window at around 10.30pm at night to show her friends the paintwork she had done to our side of the house. My flatmate was asleep/in bed and was so enraged by this flagrant act of disrespect that she said what she said in the title. 

The husband came over today to demand an apology and I answered the door. I told him what had happened and asked him what he would do if someone tried to enter his house at night but he refused to believe his wife had tried to open the window. We went back and forth for awhile while I tried not to laugh at him. He loves to say that he is ""really good friends with your landlord"" and ""could get us evicted"" - but that's just not true. He also pretended to be appalled by the language even though I have overheard him refer to his wife's daughter (talking to his wife no less!!!) as ""that fucking cunt bitch"". My flatmate eventually came out and apologised to him and he seemed to accept that, but also wanted her to go over and apologise to her directly.

34,"Talk to me like I'm an engineer, tell me what I can't see in my own life. Explain what I must change, or see, or realize, or think about. Or tell me this is simply how things are now, and I must go on existing.

""I am successful, but I feel empty."" I've read many books, blogs, and various other writings about that feeling, but all of them focus on a problem I don't have: someone else setting a goal for you that you yourself don't personally want or care about. I chose my career and work field, I do not regret my choice. I am not ashamed of my hobbies. I can't find any way to connect with what is written about why I 'should' feel empty with why I actually do.

I help because I care about my fellow man deeply, even though I sometimes find their choices to be...extremely self-harming.

I spent 6 months helping every weekend at various Habitat sites only to be told to stop trying to meet new people because *one* person didn't like that I was making friendly conversation. I...I cant' find the value of a thank you when months or years of consistent work is ignored to focus on a single event as a means to tell me I made a mistake at some arbitrary point in my past. My own father once told me 'there is no love in you!', which is a lie, but...if that's a shining example of what parental love is in my world, no wonder I feel like I'm in the dark, right?

But I have everything I wanted at age 15. I have a career that keeps me indoors and safe. I have job opportunities such that no employer or location will ever hold power or control over me. I very nearly have enough money to retire if I wanted. I...I've done incredible things, and I want to feel like I've done well, but nobody cares. I point to all I've accomplished and nobody cares. And that's what I want. I want someone to care. That's the wife I can't find. The one that cares.

The really frustrating thing is I don't even want to die. I spent 12 years being a suicidal person. I conquered that around 5 years ago. Not a single cell of my body wants to die anymore, and it's frustrating because I got so used to using those feelings to motivate me, or to drive me, and now there is just...nothing. Victory, it seems, has defeated me.

""Why can't you care about your own victories?"" Some form of hard wiring done to me as a child. I have no point of origin or ...I don't know where it came from or how it got there. But I can't. I have a fundamental need for external validation. Without that validation I assume that I'm either:

* Working on the wrong things
* Doing something people hate
* Failed to achieve the correct victory conditions.

I mean...you hear so much about people wanting stable relationships where they feel safe. I don't hit or throw things when I get mad. We will never run out of money unless you waste it on material goods. I can cook food that won't win any Micheline stars, but it will keep us at a medically healthy weight and fully nourished. ...but no one cares? Why not? I don't understand. Is this no longer desirable? Is this so utterly basic that everyone is assumed to do all these things? If that's the case, why do I know so many couples where one spouse straight up cannot do several of these things and married specifically to fill that void? NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY GODDAMN SENSE!

And that's why I can't self-validate. It turns into a mental black hole where nothing makes sense. In programming terms it is like defining a recursive function whose start and end states are that recursive function.

There is something very low level, very fundamental, that I can't see, or don't understand, or can't wrap my head around. I need to find and fix this so I can stop being unhappy and reintegrate into society where I have a group of friends who provide the normal quantities of external validation. From one engineer to another, tell me what I can't see.",25Apr2017,2

37,"TLDR at bottom

So, i went to visit my folks and my car began overheating about an hour away from their place. Managed to get the car there safely. 
My poor dad tried to fix it but nothing worked. 
Mom has a solution to get me back upstate to my home and job, so they lend me their car while they keep mine and take it to a shop.

My dad called today, saying a gasket blew, need to replace water pump, and timing belt and it's gonna cost $2600 - which is a little over half than my car's value. 

The car also has a lein, a Clear Title Loan with $1500 left (I am paid ahead and don't have to make a payment until next year)

Credit has been hit a lot late last year and early this year, so my Credit is about 630


Should I just take the repairs? I called around even to my trusted mechanic and he said that the price they are quoting me is actually lower than what he would charge. (Also the engine has been taken apart and I have to pay for that anyway)

Should I tow the car up here and just rough it and pay off the rest of the clear title lein and then sell the thing to a junk shop. Hopefully I'll get something back so I can get something for a down payment on another car?

Or am I really over thinking this and there is an a solution that I'm just too stressed to think about? 

Thanks in advance!!!!!

TLDR: Car is in shop 500 miles away from my home, costly repairs that are a little more than half of car's worth, should pay for repairs? Should I try and get it up here? What do????

59,"I will try to make it brief and easy to understand, even tho It's a tangled web.

My current college promotion was scheduled to graduate in the middle of 2018. Through pressure, bribery and false advertising, Our representants convinced the majority of the school council that it is a good idea to cut out 66% of the content and reduce the duration of each academic period (They are 6) From 12 weeks to 5 with the aim of ending this year, 2017, no matter how poorly prepared and mediocre we are. For them, the goal is to graduate fast without anything else in consideration.

Most teachers do not agree with the decision. But because of the order of the council, they abide.

Students have also been bought with false advertising, and mainly, nourishing mediocrity, under the promise that what is not learned can be learned later. It is a Health Sciences (Medicine) career, where an error after being graduated, in front of a patient, will be paid dearly, there is no excuse to say ""I did not learn that in time"".

67,"A bit of background information is that I'm a current freshman in college and like many others, having a tough time transitioning from high school to college. This is my 3rd quarter of college so far and decided that I want to major in psychology. Acceptance into my school's psychology department requires you to take 3 psychology courses with an average acceptance rate of a 3.2 GPA within those 3 courses. I took the first course last quarter and got a 2.9 which I thought was okay, I would just have to step up my game a little for the next two to make up for it.

Currently taking the 2nd course which has 4 midterms with the lowest grade dropped (total of 30%, 10% for each midterm). Took the first midterm a few weeks ago, fell flat with a 60%, then thought it would also be okay that I can just have my 1 midterm drop on that one. Just took my 2nd midterm today and just tumbled down a flight of stairs on this one with a 46%.

This means that even if the 2nd midterm is the lowest I'll ever get, I already lost 4% from my overall grade just from the first midterm. If I want at least a 3.3 in this course to slightly bring up my average, I can only lose a total of 8% for the rest of my assignments, midterms, and the final.

After this realization, I'm completely demolished. I still do want to major in psychology but I just don't know how to succeed in college and I'm not insanely motivated in school. (Don't get me wrong, I am interested in psychology but this course is very distantly related to psychology compared to a regular intro-class).

The advice I'm seeking is...

* How do I transition from high school academics to college?

* How/where do I find motivation to focus and do well in college?

* How do I pick myself up from a rough fall? (Probably the most important one I need advice on because after that midterm I have no idea what to do)",25Apr2017,3

71,"Let me start by saying that yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, this story is long. I wrote this on my phone so you might find it very difficult to read. Plus I was tired and angry, but any help is MUCH appreciated.

So basically there is this girl, LEts call her Sophie  who's Been super close friends with me for about 14 years now. We are currently both in high school still, so you can see how long we've been friends for. We were friends all through public school and have been close friends during that time. Our families are close as well. Close to the point where we have been on vacation with each other's families multiple times to other countries. Throughout our friendship, we have been through the ""maybe we should just stay friends phase"" bit multiple times. We both liked each other at one point but decided that it wasn't gonna work at the time. Everything was great until high school comes along. The first year of high school she gets a boyfriend, lets call him Cole . I like the guy, he's cool and nice and all that, really like him, I find him a lil weird but they are happy together so I'm happy. Me and the guy play games together hang out occasionally, everything's cool. Over time I start to realize that they are overprotective of each other. I guess it's a trust thing? Not sure. Sophie had multiple friendships that she cut off because the friend that sophie had originally been friends with found that Sophie had spent too much time with Cole  to do anything together. That happened both ways with Cole as well, but Sophie lost a couple best friends to this. During the next little while, I noticed it had been a while since I talked to Sophie. So I decided to ask her to lunch, yknow, catch up. I asked her and she says that she's busy etc whatever I got assignments. I'm like alright just let me know a different time. Fast forward a few days later and no time. Basically she puts off all plans I try to make with her for the next few months. The only times I get to speak to her is over text, and even then it's dry. I try my best to see her and talk but I get put down. My first impression is that she doesn't want or isn't allowed to speak to me because of Cole, which is ridiculous because I've been friends with her forever and it's high school ? So I decided to ask her about it, and considering we were going on yet another vacation on the summer break, I didn't want things to be weird. When I asked her she seemed angry that I asked? She apologized and said that she was sorry and that we would do stuff soon. Lo and behold, that never happened. (It's not like I was asking her to have sex or anything like wtf, I'm asking her to have lunch and talk. I never even see her at school anymore). Nothing really happened with her until vacation. The vacation was great but when I asked her to go on walks and just enjoy the nature she would put it off. Which I found weird until what happened on the last day. On the last day Sophie (might I add she always had a flirtatious personality ) she started getting super close to me and just overall touchy. Deep down I was just weirded out because I felt like she was ignoring me for the past few months and she has a boyfriend. We had this long talk alone about life while trying to like literally put her head on my shoulder but being the person I am tried to stay away from her in respect to Cole. After the night ended she texts me saying how much fun she had but how she made a mistake and that should never happen again. I'm like okay but I didn't really do anything . You were being the flirty one etc ( I tried not to accuse but she put me in a bad position I feel ). We talked and then went to sleep. The next few months felt literally the same as the others. We talked like twice a week over text, and literally every hang out attempt is shut down by Sophie. That brings us to recent times. A little background before I explain what happens next, she always came to me for her problems rather than Cole because apparently I ""understand "" her better than Cole and give good advice and Cole ""can't help me or make me happy with words"" when she's sad. I guess that's because I'm a realist. Anyways, she comes to me at like 2 am over text and starts going on about her psychological problems. Basically I spend 3 hours of  my night making sure she can sleep properly and stop crying. I give her all his advice and basically calm her down. I waste my sleep and go to bed at 5 am all for her. She tells me all this depression and how she doesent want to tell anyone not even Cole because he ""doesent understand"" and that she can't sleep at night and cries a lot. I risk my sleep and help her with all this, text her to make sure she's okay over the next few days. That's fine, I do everything I can to make sure she's okay.  During this I ask her why she won't hang out with me or talk to me or why she won't go to lunch with me. She tells me
That she ""doesent trust herself with guys"" and that she's afraid she will self consciously do something with them, even though I've already proven myself. I find that a bullshit excuse. She basically has told
Me that it's not you, it's me. A week later she snaps on me randomly when I'm helping her with something because I told her how I think you are supposed to do it (criticism) tellin me to shut the fuck up and how she's Fucking done and she doesent need it anymore today because she's had a bad day.

74,"So cover story: Heres is a text I sent to my boss who is essentially my side job during the winter pushing snow nightshift as a skid steer operator.

To keep the timeline short I've been working at Sherwin Williams Paint store for almost a year now. Stayed long for the sole reason I figured I might have a chance of moving up with 'promised' promotions.

I just walked in after completing my first day on with a reputable painting company as I am a painter by trade with almost 5 years of actual experience. Jobs came easy never really needed to search or send out resumes. Actually I've only ever needed one for Sherwin Williams, which is in fact the biggest joke of management structure and operation I've seen.[queue the 'lazy job' hunters]

The reason behind the text message was that I had let him know I gave my notice to quit. Earlier last month I had asked to be a part of his summer landscaping crew. But since I found a solid painting job with some super cool peeps I am now sitting in a position where i am unsure if my decision to stay with this company or to go landscaping will be the wisest. 

I plan on working all summer alongside my web creative business but really need to ensure whatever I have will fill my needs.

Anyway without further adieu here is the text message which should explain enough about where I am at. 

[TEXT MESSAGE]

Kind of had a bit of an existential crisis with my job at sherwin. Really felt out of place. I truly love doing things with my hands that requires attention to detail from painting to landscaping and visual arts and programming. 

I just love working with an active mind. I was not receiving the same brain activity working at dead end job Sherwin Williams which 'promised' immediate room for growth in a sales position but continued to push me to the side the more I wanted to learn. 

That being said I am having a bit of a hard time truly deciding. 

Working at Sherwin i felt like landscaping was going to be my 'way out' when really my way out was always sitting right in front of me the entire time.

I hope you can understand a bit where I am coming from. I really hate that I followed that thought pattern and i am even more bothered with the fact I had committed to landscaping prior to truly analyzing myself better. Leaving me to be seen as unreliable or as someone who doesn't follow through.

You treat me like family, you have saved me in some of my most important times. Weather you see it or not the day you hired me and kept me working to consistently having me as an operator. You helped me get on my feet and to know i could move and do whatever i put myself to, regardless of the BS i went through in my personal life.

I really don't want you to think I am bouncing around to the next best thing. I am really just trying to find my groove again after being at a deadbeat job for so long.

I walked in after work today and filed my notice. It felt liberating and beautiful in so many ways to tell my boss ""Here is my immediate termination notice"". After not having much control of my life i just really hope you can see this. 

Maybe you have some insight... I am only 22. But i am really trying to put myself in good healthy shoes. I yearn to be successful and great at whatever it is I want to do. Direction though is something that seems to confuse me around each corner.

I have never been good at school and have major depression and anxiety - if I forgot to take my medication I will cry for hours. I am very lucky and stuff, have an amazing family and an amazing boyfriend, although I think his family thinks he can do better. I have no job, no savings, not at university, getting fat, socially challenged - whereas my boyfriend is extremely intelligent with a high paying job and is an overall fun, great person.

I learned recently that he has a crush on me. I'm bi, so I would be fine with this, given that he is my best friend, but I already have a girlfriend. He is very adamant on saying that I'm a big reason why he hasn't attempted suicide since October (he tried to overdose). I was just talking with my girlfriend when I got messages saying ""i fucked up"" and ""my arm stings like shit because i didn’t go deep enough"" (text conversation in comments). I ended the call with my girlfriend and immediately called him. I was able to calm him down and he started saying stuff like, ""Do you know how much I love you?"" and ""I wish I could hug you and snuggle you.""

I guess perhaps thats a bad phrase to use, its not like theres a thousand or something, but they definitely are not shy. Im currently sleeping on a cot in the living room and theres roaches throughout almost all of the house, and i honestly don't know what to do.

94,"Hello. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for around 8 months now. Everything in the beginning seemed perfect. But he started to become very passive in our relationship over the time. So we talked about this and he started making some effort, which didn't last long. I feel like he doesn't care for me anymore and he doesn't find me exciting, interesting, etc. Even though we do talk a lot when we're together, sometimes all night until morning. But lately it seems like I'm a chore to him. He told me we couldn't hang out because he had work to do, yet he spent all of his day on Facebook. I don't call him out on that, I let him breathe, I give him all of the space he wants. But sometimes I feel hurt. And I feel ridiculous writing this, but I really do love and care for him. And I sense that the flame is gone and he views me as something acquired, that will always be there for him, even though he rarely pays attention. Sometimes I feel miserable. And I talk to him, but I don't even know how to form my sentences without being annoying, needy and pushing him away. So I panic. I'm confused. He says he's never loved anyone like he loves me before, yet he rarely shows it. He doesn't make me feel special and loved and this saddens me. What should I do? How do I approach him?

We broke up about a month ago and it has been getting easier but it's just been a lot of ups and downs. One moment I'm completely fine and then the next I'm a complete wreck. She was a huge part of my life. I had talked to her nearly every day since we started talking in 8th grade and now I hardly ever talk to her. 

What gets to me the most is the thought of her being with other guys where she's at for college (which is 7 hours away from me). I know I shouldn't but I look at her twitter and she tweets about going out a lot and her likes seem to be about another guy and how much she regrets me and all that. 

I feel completely worthless. She was my entire world and now she wants nothing to do with me. Nothing really initiated the breakup either. One day she just told me she didn't want to do this anymore and that was it. 

I really just don't know what to do from here. I don't understand how people get through stuff like this. I know a lot of people have it a lot worse but right now it just feels like the end of the world to me.

Now, I don't mind a cheaper ring, but even real this thing is not my style and being fake I feel it's sized a bit ridiculously and everyone on the planet will know this is knockoff jewelry. I would have preferred a simple sterling silver ring either plain or with some sort of genuine stone. Small, simple. The same price. My fiancee didn't consider my style at all when choosing his ring.  

And of course as his ring is from China it's a size 9 and should be a 6 so I can't realistically wear it without losing it. This is a logical reason to need a new ring (can a fashion material with comfort band be sized? Down 2 or 3 sizes?) but I'm very worried I'll end up with another one I hate. I actually have a sterling silver solitaire ring I've never worn that I asked to use until my engagement ring was sized but my fiancee was upset that it wasn't a gift from him. What do Reddit?

I'm a rather shy 19 y/o virgin dude and Ive never had a girlfriend. Back in school I had girls asking me out but I rejected them because I wasn't comfortable and didn't know how to deal with girls really - on top of that I get red really easily.

A couple of months ago I dropped out of my secondary school due to having bad grades and not keeping up with school work (grade 11, where I live anyway). I have a cardiac neurosis, which strongly discouraged me in pursuing that school year.. Admittedly, I never liked to study alot for my exams but it's just draining every bit of energy I have left. Ive had this issue for a few years now and I don't know what to do anymore.

This ""imaginary"" health issue hinders me from sometimes even just leaving the house, going to the gym, having a part time job and basically from all outdoor activities, or anything that's not accessible from my home/room.

I just feel so dread and demotivated. I'm 2-3 years behind in school years, which I feel impacts me IMMENSELY. I'm someone who dreams alot and envies other people. I get lost in my mind all the time. I just want to live a normal life (again). Tried seeking professional help from therapists but I think it didn't help.

I pretty much lost all of my contacts and have no friends, because I didn't keep in touch.

When I first went in I decided to go for a history major and then later on the road either keep at that and try for post-grad in history and work towards teaching in college or maybe take other classes and work towards becoming a high school teacher. It seemed like a good plan to me since I love history and social studies. Throughout high school those were my favorite classes so I figured that teaching others about a subject I enjoy would be the right career path to go down. 

But now I am not so sure. Every class I take I find to be completely uninspiring and it's to the point where I cannot find it within myself to go to class and it's a major problem since I am now basically failing out. I would like to switch my major to something more artistic and more free such as writing of some kind (either creative or maybe more of a journalism path) but my parents are totally against it and since I live with them while going to school it's made things even more difficult to switch majors. I tried living on campus my first year and things went okay for the first semester but the second semester has just been the same thing that is currently happening to me now. 

I don't know what to do or even if I could come out of this rut because I may have messed up for the last time. I feel as if switching my major without telling my parents would only make them mad because they don't see any kind of career in arts as ""profitable"" enough (they would much rather I have went into nursing school, something I never wanted to do) but making a lot of money isn't why I want to switch, obviously. I want to have a career I can enjoy and writing may be it, but even after explaining this to them they either don't see it or they remain unconvinced. 

But now, it's either I switch majors or I fail out, and I would like to stay in college but I can't find the meaningfulness of going to class if I don't enjoy what I'm studying.

This is going to cost me my graduation and I won't be able to come back to school since I'm 18 now and if I take my GED I have to wait another year and redo ALL of my classes if I go to do my GED. How the hell am I suppose to get a job when the only ones available to me require high school education (Even Mcds doesn't hire high school drop outs here). I can't do the summer course option because I'm getting kicked out of my mom's house because I don't get my child tax anymore and it's too costly to keep me without it. I need a job AS SOON AS SCHOOL IS OVER or my life is fucked over. I literally have nowhere to go and now that I can't even graduate I'm just thinking of ending it all you know? Almost my whole family has never graduated high school on time and they are all poor, I'd rather just not exist than to live lives like them. Seriously tell me if I have options because my wack job of a school has 2 teachers and 1 councilor running around like chickens with their heads cut off while trying to act like everything's okay. I know it's not okay I can see it in their faces. Can I just take the departmental this year even if I took the course last year? I completed all my assignments with an 88% if that helps somehow. 

Tdlr; not graduating because short of math credit even though I completed course. Teacher's fault.",25Apr2017,2
142,"Sometimes I'd get a rush of all these thoughts at once. Other times, they each slowly creep into my mind, reminding me of their existence.

I can summarise and identify all my thoughts yet my mind still feels troubled. If it's about my interests, I figured it's because I can't tend to all of them. Yet for other thoughts (love life, I'm turning 17 and realised I'm a mortal, my future, friendships, other people's perception of me), the ones that are more abstract and not just a to do I could tick off on a list, bothers me more.

We've been talking wedding plans for a little while, and our guest list. I don't want a huge wedding, my mom's side of the family is enormous and would more than double the number of people I actually would plan on inviting myself.

Maybe I didn't put in the effort to be close, maybe it's my fault, it honestly doesn't bother me too much. What does bother me is the idea of feeling unwelcome at my own wedding, being unable to be welcoming to family members on our day, the fact that for years now my interaction with that side of the family has been largely negative, but knowing how family drama tends to work out with that clan, they'll feel more than entitled to be there.

144,"Hello,

So, I've been looking for help online, but it seems like people are either considered happy, or they are depressed, and that there is no in between. Or, that he only way someone can be sad and feel bad about their lives and need help is if they are depressed, which doesn't seem to be the case for me.

I've read the dsm definition of depression as well as many articles about it online, and lots of things just don't seem to match up, or aren't ""enough"" for me to be qualified as depressed.

I cry about two times a week, and I often have sequences of two or three days where I feel really bad. In those moments, I feel hopeless, I have no self esteem, feel like I can't do anything or that whatever I choose to do I will end up unhappy. Mostly about the fact that I'm not organized and methodical enough to be able to pursue a hobby so I generally always give up on them to get new ones. And even when I manage to get organized, I still feel like I'm never gonna be good enough for an exterior reason (not visual enough to draw, too easily distracted to do a job that require focus, too hyperactive to do a hobby that requires sitting on a desk for a long time, ideas too disorganized and too much difficulty to express them to write, fingers too short to play an instrument, not able to play by ear, etc...) that keeps me from pursuing hobbies. My whole life so far has been to change and change what hobbies I want to pursue (and by that understand ""what I want to get a career in"") because none of them works. Other than that, I have no social skills, have a small group or friends, am not attractive etc. Which makes me feel miserable, hopeless, not good enough, be anxious about my life, be angsty  etc.

Edit: I'd just like to add that I also have some physical symptoms that could fit with depression like being really tense, having trouble focusing (I have adhd so I always had that but I feel like recently it's been so much worse), stomach cramps (which could also be explained by me being really anxious), always tired, alternating between over-eating and barely eating anything, having trouble falling asleep and not being really reactive and feeling slow

But even then, I can still listen to music and enjoy it, or play a videogame and have fun in the moment, and start an hobby with exitation and curiosity about it, and one of the biggest symptoms of depression is that you always feel bad. So what if I feel bad only about 60-70% of the time?",25Apr2017,1
145,"I'll try to keep it short. 

Basically, I took a phlebotomy course around October 2015 - Jan 2016. Aced the course, did really well. Then I got really really sick (temp was 105, I genuinely couldn't move out of bed, etc.) so had to reschedule some of my rotations for my externship. Then when I rescheduled them, my (then brand new) employer told me that I had been requesting too many days off for school within my 90 and if I requested anymore I would be considered unreliable and let go. I was 20 and new to living on my own so it came down to my ability to pay rent/survive, so I wasn't able to make the reschedules and never completed my externship and just gave up. 2k down the drain and months wasted. 

Fast forward a year, a couple months ago I emailed my instructor basically apologizing for bailing on the externship telling her that I was planning on taking the class again sometime soon. She gets back to me saying basically if I can acquire a doctors note that will cover me from October 2015 until now she would let me just take the externship again and give me my license... 

How the hell can I do this? The doctor I went to was some random clinic and not my primary because I don't have insurance. There's another clinic I go to all the time, but would they be able to excuse me like this if I explained the situation? If I spoke to a physiatrist and told them I was severely depressed (I really do have an extensive history of depression/anxiety) for a year and unable to do anything would that work? What can I do?

When I came into work last Wednesday, my coworker, who we will call A for short, was on the till. When I came back to start my shift, I saw that he was just about to serve the Man With Two Hearts, he paying for the trousers from the Tales from Retail story. As soon as A sees me, he says: ""There you go"", then dashes off upstairs, leaving me to deal with a customer who has a history of violent threats and an unstable mental state all on my own. He came back after thirty seconds or so, but then left while I was still serving the guy. In fact, he didn't just leave. He power walked out the door and left me to deal with a potentially dangerous customer. Today I learned that he later told my manager what he did, insisting that I was alright, when he had no way of knowing that. For all he knew, that guy could've threatened to kill me again, or actually hurt me. He put his own safety over mine, getting himself out of a situation he didn't want to be in and leaving me to take his place without even giving me time to argue.

For a little backstory, I did what most kids do when graduating from highschool and attended your typical college.

I was fortunate enough to land a retail job afterwards, and move up the ladder while navigating my way through adulthood on my own(with help from friends). However I'm now at the point there I'm just tired of the retail environment and wanting to get back into college. 

I've saved up enough money through the years to go back to a community college, but I feel like I won't even get accepted due to my GPA and past history.

182,"Hi,

As mentioned, I do night work at a factory close-by my parents' home, who I still live with. My job there is to maintain and control a welding machine and make sure everything is supplied. I make a decent living there, about 24.000 euro/year. Over the 2 years I've worked there, I've been able to save up 17.000 euros

I find that the job has certainly taken its tole on my quality of life, though. I tend to sleep very long between shifts, limiting my free time considerably. It's not easy for me to adapt to normal rhythm over the weekend either, which makes it hard to maintain my social life.  I'd consider the job itself unhealthy, as I constantly come in contact with certain chemicals, dust and filth. 

For these reasons, I've decided that I want to do something else.  I currently do some programming in my spare time, I've always been interested in everything computer-related. IT seems to be becoming more and more important and I think it would be a good career to pursue. 

This leads me to a few options: following a full-time student program (bachelor/master) in IT, continue to teach myself new technologies and languages while trying to keep my current job to eventually become good enough to get a job in IT. The last option would be to quit my current job and follow a local 6 to 12 months program in specific IT branch, possibly working a part time job in the process.

I'm nearly 28, and I do not enjoy life at all.  And I do feel guilty for admitting that, because apart from growing up in a dysfunctional emotionally disant family, there's really no other valid reason for me to be in the state that I am in. I never experienced any major hardships growing up. 


It's just over time as an adult, when you encounter a lot of disappointment, either in yourself or in/from other people you may call family and close friends, it really destroys your perception.


I haven't set a major goal for myself in 6 years. I don't trust myself anymore. Every single goal I have felt passionate about has failed miserably. All of my big ideas have been big failures. There's a personal project I'm supposed to be working on now, but can't even get it off the ground. Although it's a good idea, I don't know of I am the person who should be developing it.


I went to college and majored in computer science, and have my sheet of paper to show ""hey i made it"" although I nearly flunked out. But because I struggled so much in college, I can't bring myself to applying for jobs that really incorporate what I learned in college courses. Fear of fucking up and looking incompetent AND workplace anxiety is probably one of the worst career suicide concoctions one can have. My resume is peppered with short term positions, some with no relevancy to CS. The last position I had, I left after my boss questioned why he hired me at all. Joking or not, I didn't take this kindly, and on top of other issues I had with the company, that comment destroyed any ounce of motivation I had for the projects I was working on.


I was lucky enough to get hired at 2 seasonal jobs (not CS related) but my hours were cut significantly. So now I truly look and feel like an idiot, because maybe I should've put up with the BS from my last job.


Apart from employment issues, I'm a social recluse who has no friends, no record of every having a significant other, still living at home with family, barely any income, and no vehicle, not because I cant afford one but because I never learned how to drive. When I do have to interact with anyone, I always fashion up some lie about my lifestyle, career, etc because I don't want to deal with with the criticism and eventual ostracism by others.Trust me, I hear it everyday from myself; it's exahusting and I don't need the reminder in the form of a different voice. 


I have a therapist I've seen for nearly a year. Maybe therapy isn't meant for me either? My therapist is a great person and I did a lot of research to find her but perhaps I'm wasting her time. Depression is a likely result due to my experiences, but it isn't chemically induced. So medication would be all but a bandaid for me. We're doing CBT and I've been trying to follow recommendations, but...look where I still am

189,"**TLDR- Used to be very popular. Was in a lot of programs. Not in those programs anymore and not sure how to cope without friends.**

I used to be super popular. Like, I would have to leave and eat dinner alone somewhere just to get away from people. I was really involved in my church body, I was a missionary overseas, I toured in a band for a long time and did a lot of cool events for charity. I met a lot of people and had a lot of fun. Hard times, too. I was also single.

Now that I'm in my latter half of my mid-twenties I find that I really don't have a best friend anymore. I have been with my girlfriend for five months but she lives in another state (one where I used to live, we're planning on moving to the same city next year). 

It seems every time I make really good friendships with people, they move away because career, or get married, or start having children. They move on or get so busy with their life. I don't really have any quality relationships in my life except one with my partner.

My roommate has maybe slept five nights at home since 2016, he stays always with his girlfriend.

I'm just wondering, how do you cope with it? This is part of life. When you start getting older, you start losing friends. But I'm no longer religious, I don't tour in a band anymore because I chose to go back to school instead. All my classmates are like 18-20, so I don't have much in common with them as a 26 - year - old. I work full time, read a lot, workout every day, I still have my equipment and write music a lot but otherwise I don't have much going on.

I make A's. I have a dog who is awesome. But as for socially, I'm pretty lonely. Which is so bizarre because I used to be king around here. I did modeling for clothing companies. I was instagram famous (I also deleted all my social media). 

So maybe it's that I had a lot of friends through church, social media, and being in a band. And because I stopped doing those things, I stopped having those relationships?

Idk. I saw therapy for six months last year and that really helped. I went through a TRP phase in 2015-2016, met a lot of girls, contracted a temporary sti (despite using protection. awesome, trp)but trp really fucked me up. Maybe that was one of the things? I haven't done anything with trp in over a year, but I can still feel it in the back of my head.

Once I started getting involved in TRP I started losing all my friends.

Idk.

Any advice? I think I could just use a friend to talk to about this right now. I feel too embarrassed to bring it up to my girlfriend.

Basically, I just want a group of guy friends I can count on. And who initiate to do things with me, too. I feel that I've always been the person to call and ask if someone wants to do a,b, or y. I just want some guy friends who take time for me.

I have my best friend from high school, but the guy just started his teaching career, and his wife had a baby. So I get that he's got stuff going on, but yeah. Idk what to do.",25Apr2017,1
193,"Basically, my sister is an awful human being. I hate calling her my sister, but I have to acknowledge her existence if I want her kids in my life, which I do. She's a scum bag, and I cannot tolerate her, yet my mum is trying to force us to fix our relationship. Some may just be thinking ""don't all sisters go through a rocky patch?"" But let me tell you, my sister is actually an awful person. For example, she:
• has tried to turn everyone against my mum for unknown reasons
• Drives drunk with her kids with her kids in the car
• Drives high (cocaine) with her kids in the car
• Made a scene about going to our nephew's funeral because she ""didn't have anything to do"" - threatened not to come
• Turned up fucked out of her mind on cocaine
• Berated my dad because he made a speech at my 21st that he hadn't thought through, ""congratulating me"" for making it to 21 (my nephew had died a month earlier, aged 20), then forgot to mention his nephew, who had passed away 2 years earlier when talking about those he wished were here too. My sister told him his brother and oldest daughter (who'd lost her son) hate him because of it, and he was heartbroken all night 
• Scared my teenage cousin at my birthday party to the point where she felt threatened and left
• Flirted with my fiance's brother in front of his wife and kids and her fiancé and kids at my birthday party
• Told everyone her fiancé was forcing her to take cocaine, actually the other way round
• Dealt cocaine out of her house whilst her kids were upstairs
• Fucked a dealer, then made false rape claims after knowing I had been raped 
• Told my parents all she wants is her fiancé, holidays, and cocaine. No mention of her children
• Told my parents she doesn't care if social services take her kids. 

That's just all I can list off the top of my head, but there is more. 

My sister won't get help. She refuses to see people for her addictions, and hardly ever takes her medication for bipolar because she can't drink with them. 

Anyway, my sister's birthday was today, and I didn't want to wish her happy birthday. My mum has recently agreed just to brush this all under the carpet, and is trying to force me to do the same. She thinks I'm unreasonable in not wanting a relationship with my sister anymore because ""she did so much for"" me. By that, she means she used to be a great sister before drugs and alcohol became the only thing she cared about. 

Am I in the wrong? How can I convey to my mum that I have been through too much lately - my nephew was my best friend, and it's still hard to deal with his death - so I don't want to forgive and forget all the awful things my sisters has done?

196,"I used to be confident in at least my intelligence, and now I am realizing I'm probably average or a bit above average. Any success I ever had in school was either due to natural talent, or in most cases, working hard. So the best I have is drive.

Apart from intelligence, I know I'm not pretty. Average at best. I've been working out, but I realize even if I had an amazing body, who cares. My face is meh.

I'm already 27. I dropped out of my phd program, and then even when I considered re-applying elsewhere, I didn't. Instead, I turned to learning programming, and am now in an online bachelors program and planning to get my masters in computer science, but still feel like I'm such a failure because I'm not that good at programming. I try, and I'm learning, and I'm willing to put in the work, so I know I will improve. But looking at other programmers, I frankly...am subpar.
I've been at it fro about a year, so that's a lot of time, and yet now, but I feel like I'll never make it in the field.

I have one bachelors degree, a second one in the making, and that's it. All I think is, big shit. People apparently seem impressed by my degrees (first BS was in neuroscience, 2nd is now comp sci), but all I think is, I have these degrees because I study and work for them. I'm not naturally that smart...

Part of me realizes nothing matters in the grand scheme of things, but I also still want to succeed.
On top of it, I started a new job a year ago, and my manager thinks I'm underperforming. So that adds to it all. I try, but it seems like she's on my case about things, and I'm unsure why. I have discussions with her, and then I think things have settled, but then they start back up again and she points out something and says she wonders about my work ethic. And I'm there at work doing my job and trying to do a good job at my tasks. I'm slower at finishing  tasks because I'm still learning on the job, basically, and trying to do things right. But I suppose I'm not being efficient enough. 

Basically, I feel worthless and like a failure, and that I'll die having never amounted to anything.
I want a phd, I want to build things, I want to program, and I want to be an author. Oh, and I'd love to be pretty. You know, basic things in life that will make my life better.

She is always scheduled in the rougher areas, without extra help when there should be help.  Constantly calling her when she's on break to hurry up and come back, while others take extremely long breaks.  While eating on lunch break, there are some desserts in the lunchroom.  Most of her coworkers eat really fast then take a bunch of the desserts, so there will be none left.  So when she tries to take some desserts before finishing her meal, she is berated.  They tell her ""she needs to finish her food first before she can get the desserts"" and talking down to her as if she's a child.  They speak their own native language amongst themselves as well, though this isn't exactly harassment and discrimination per say, but my friend's mother isn't stupid.

She's an elderly, single mom who works damn hard everyday, doing work that would require two people, but she does it on her own.  She suffers from anxiety now and has to take medication for this.  She was reluctant to talk to HR because she didn't want to drop names on her own coworkers, EVEN THOUGH they treat her like shit.

212,"For about a good few months now I have been noticing a problem. I haven't really paid much attention to until recently as it won't go away. 
When I am sitting somewhere with nothing to do I sometimes get random rushes of a need to walk, piss or do something. I'm 17 and this only happens when I am in forced place where I have to stay still or be 'normal'. It has happened the most in a classroom where the teacher is talking to the class. But also happens in college assemblies, on plane journeys, talking to people (that aren't close friends) and places like that. 
Once, early on in the symptoms, i randomly collapsed in a lesson and felt fine afterwards. Only warning being a head rush before hand. Ever since then I have been getting a restless feeling, tensing my core up, feeling the need to burp (or be sick), feeling tired, and that rush feeling that can happen (hasn't made me faint since though). I have never had a check for anxiety or stuff like that, as i've never had this before. 
It's becoming a problem for me as I am now skipping lessons to not put myself in situations where an attack could happen. I now struggle to concentrate as i am worrying about not collapsing mid lesson again. 
I haven't told anyone this yet except some close friends. So my parents and the college don't know. I did't want to bring it up when i thought it was a one time thing. 
I just don't know what the best option is to solve this. Whether it can actually be solved at all. The worst thing that i am worried about is suddenly having one of these feelings during an exam. Something that did happen during a mock exam, but it passed after a few minutes.

217,"I am from the East and an Urban area, most of my family is there. I've been living in the rural mid-west for a year now and love the culture and made so many friends. Back home, I had a hard time growing up and have no friends back home. 

I accepted an amazing job in the west for 55k (I'm 20) and theres lots of room for advancement; theyre training me to be a store manager. The west has so much opportunity and is so free. I love the people and fit in well. 

Back home, i tried really hard to get a job there as well but the economy is so dead and id be lucky to get a part time job. My last wage in the east was 14$/hr and it was a terrible job. I applied to like 50 jobs in each part in the country and recieved tons of interest and interviews in the west but practically nothing in the east. 

I find the East to be way more beautiful and id really miss that and I hate to leave my family but even if I lived in the East, i would very likely still be 2+ hours from home. My parents support the idea of me living in the west but are saddened by it and my dad said to my sister ""He's never coming back"" and it makes me feel guilty. My sister hates the west and my other sister is indifferent about it but she has lived in the west for 5 years and is moving back east after a bad breakup. My dad thinks its redneck but doesnt hate it. and my mom fully supports me and is happy about me living a life that makes me happy. 

So what do I do? The main reason i like the west is my amazing job, people/culture, more freedom, most things are cheaper. I like the East because its beautiful and my family is there and a bit safer but i like the culture a bit less.

So is it wrong to leave my family? I feel guilty. Im not saying i want to live there forever but chances are if i live there for a while, ill end up there most of my life, maybe going back to the east for retirement.

222,"EDIT2: I fixed it. The paragraph indentation was creating ""Code boxes of text."" Sorry for the trouble.

I'm not sure what kind of subreddit to post this in, but I know I really could use advice, so I'll post it here. I could also use a bit of a place to rant.  TLDR at the bottom

I'll start by telling a little about myself. I'm a 27 year old male living in the United States. I'm currently not at work where I should be, because I simply couldn't force myself to go in. I struggle with stomach issues often which doesn't make it easy. I also fight with depression and ADD/ADHD. This makes life hard enough as it is with the day to day. Staying motivated to even want to do anything aside from sitting at my desk and playing video games is already hard enough. When I finally do manage to get myself to do something for work or even for myself I can't stay focused long enough to make progress. This is absolutely ruining my life to be honest. I struggle hard enough to get motivated and then when I fail at one of the few times I do get focused it feeds my depression even more. It's a wicked cycle.

After going homeless multiple times and working under the table jobs. I take pride in the fact that I'm not still sleeping under that overpass I spent so many nights at. And that I've come this far. I have finally gotten into a full time position at a liquor store and managed to get health insurance. Which is great because I've had the chance to see a doctor about my depression and ADD. My doctor ran me through a whole course of meds for ""Bi polar affective disorder"" (Effective/Affective?) He later decided that the depression I'm suffering from is ""justified"" because of the things I've been through. (It's really too much to get into in one post I've been struggling since I was a child just to stay afloat.) Since then we have been trying out stimulants for my ADD and focus. (I think they help with the add, but not with the motivation problems.) I make just under 10 dollars an hour at my job and I work about 40 hours a week. I was working much more about 50-60 hours a week, but it was really taking a toll on me considering my job involves lifting heavy cases all day for 8-11 hours a day. If I'm not dropping cases, I'm pushing carts and just in panic mode to help get everything done because we're severely understaffed everyday. To add on top of that I'm not the only person who calls out because to be honest our employer treats us terribly. It's not something people can do consistently for long periods of time.

Recently, I had the ""opportunity"" to prove myself in another area at my job with increased responsibility. I was quite excited about the opportunity, I have to admit. I jumped into the position with both feet and as much enthusiasm as I could muster. I worked hard every day, asked questions, and showed my interested as best as I could, while trying to do what was expected of me and more. A few weeks pass by and I have learned just about nothing about the position. I continued to ask questions and voice my interest day after day. The trend of not learning anything continues another week or so. One afternoon as I'm doing a few extra tasks as I normally do, my manager asks to speak with me. He opens with asking what was going on with me and why my ""interest and attitude"" have changed. He mentions that the person who was supposed to be teaching me the job has said I've been sitting back every day being lazy and boasting about the position. Saying things like;
""Oh this job is so easy! Oh wow it's so nice to sit back and do nothing all day! Ha, this is the life.""

None of these things are true at all. My superior blatantly lied to management about my direction and motivation. While I have to admit there is part of the job where we are told to stay seated and count. (We receive thousands of dollars in product every day of the week. Which we are responsible for counting for accuracy.) I was told directly by my District manager that I was to stay seated while we operated that part of our day to prevent inaccuracy and distraction. I did as I was told and still went out of my way to try and get other tasks accomplished every day. I tried to plead that those things simply were not true. He landed on the decision that ""He can't think of any reason they would lie to him about those things."" Eventually, the conversation ends with him telling me to stay sharp and that I needed to step my game up. I agree reluctantly and move on. At this point the damage was done.

I move on and continue every day with the tasks I was given and didn't let anyone see how upset I was. Another week maybe goes by and I wake up one morning after I had a fight with my girlfriend. I simply could not get my head in the right zone and I couldn't get myself to go in. I rationalized that if I did go in I would be really upset with no restraints on what I might say about how unfair I was being treated. I didn't want to be known for losing my cool so I decided it was in my best interest overall to just take a hit on the absence and move on. I spent the day playing video games and watching some TED and TEDX videos on motivation/success/depression. I felt guilty just about every minute of that day, but I struggled to find any good reason there would have been to go into work. I come back the next day with my emotions under control. I start where I normally do out on the floor for the first hour or so and do my job per usual. The time comes to report to my position and I do as normal. I find that instead of me being back there like normal a person (We will call them ""Astero"") is seated in my position. I look around for a second feeling pretty confused and ask if I was supposed to be there. Rudely I was told no and that I was dismissed. I went back to the floor to report to a manager to inquire about what I was supposed to do. They didn't even bother to tell me anything about my change in directions.

Now, Astero has been out of work for about 4 or 5 months from what I can remember. I enjoy this person as a coworker and I hold no hard feelings to them. I move on from the hard feelings as quickly as I can so as not to lose my cool. About a week goes by and I'm ""normal"" me again. I had to run to that area to do something for the store and I walked in on something that made me so infuriated. I've never bit my tongue so hard in my life as I finished what I needed and left. Within the week, Astero had been taught the proper way to do just about everything there is related with the job. Including serious things like ""Bill balancing, inventory adjusting, and working the position alone. (Sure enough within the month they were tasked multiple times with running it solo.) Fast forward another month. I have since been back there multiple times to find Astero doing the work while the person who was supposed to teach me is sitting back there playing games on their ipad. This is a daily occurrence for me now. Whenever I need to go back there for something it's the same thing. That person is just playing games on their ipad while the other person does the work. (Not to mention all the extra things like cleaning aren't getting done any more and the place is starting to look like hell again. Yet, there has been no notice of this behaviour and I still hold blame for something I didn't do.) 

I feel as if I was forced out of my position for some reason and I have no idea why. I made my employer aware I was looking for a career opportunity, and because of someone else I am back to pushing carts and doing hard labor with no one taking notice. I feel like if I go to my managers and tell them what happened they will just chalk it up to me being ""Hurt."" And wanting to take revenge. And if I go ahead of them to HR I feel as if I would get fired just for them to avoid the trouble it would cause everyone for doing something that's not fair....I think there might be something wrong lawfully speaking as well. I'm no lawyer though. (They have been known to do this. I live in an ""At will"" state.) So now here I am struggling even more so with severe depression because someone else was responsible for ruining my chance at a better position at my job. I can't get myself out of bed in the morning. I've missed countless days since then and now my employers are getting seriously frustrated with me. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I lost my job for calling out today. At the very least they're gonna chastise me about it something fierce. I'm struggling to care about it, honestly. I guess it's my fault I ruined my opportunity.

Sorry about the lengthy draft of that. Also, thank you if you're still reading. You've taken more of an interest in me than most of the other people I know by now. Including my employer. Moving onto the entirety of the situation.

I'm afraid I'm going to lose my job but I'm way beyond the point of no return. I might have 1200 to my name and I live with my girlfriend and her parents. If that wasn't already embarrassing enough. I have no education and no trade aside from the experience I've had working this job and a few other jobs before this. I don't drive although I am going to get my DL this next month or two. Even though I don't own or can't afford a car. My relationship with my girlfriend is suffering because of my mood. I'll have to admit I've been terrible and I'm not being as fair to her as I once was. It's a terrible thing that I don't even know how to fix. Life has me so down and out since birth that I feel like I can't function properly anymore. The worst part is I notice all the things I do that upset her and when it happens it makes me feel terrible. I'm not that kind of person. I told myself I would never be my father and here I am slowly turning into him. It's crippling, I'm sure plenty of people here can relate to this feeling. And if you do...I'm so sorry. 

I'm not sure how long she will continue to love me and help me as much as she has. She tries her best to help me do things that would be better for me and she pushes me as best as she can. I just can't do them for some reason. So here I am, on the verge of losing my job with a thousand dollars or so to my name. I'm trying to find a way to balance work and life. I feel like if I could get a decent job at home that at least pays me a fair amount. I can spend time to repair our relationship. And I would be able to study and spend time fixing this damned depression. I spend every day hating myself because I'm just wasting the only time that I have in this life to help build someone else up on their dream. Instead of building my own with people who want to invest in me. It keeps me up at night. Cutting into the four hours or so I normally sleep to begin with.

Moving onto my skills relating to the advice I'm looking for.

I have dreams sometimes. Just like everyone else does. I see myself holding onto the computer and the gaming community and building on that. Probably the only thing I have ever truly enjoyed. Computers and technology. Plus video games. I know a lot about computers, I can fix them and tune them. I would probably consider myself an enthusiast. I sit behind a multiple monitor set up on my L shaped desk as I type to ""you?"" Or reach out maybe? I built this system myself and I maintain it. I play games and learn as much as possible about whatever my sidetracked brain will focus on at that time. I'm a driven person when I'm not terribly pushed down by things out of my control. I have no desire to be like this in 5 years and I see myself doing great things not only for myself, but the community I wind up in. I have so many aspirations for myself and other people. It's just...I'm having a hard time finding that guiding light. Or that moment of clarity so many other people talk about. I feel like I've slipped so far behind that it's impossible for me to catch up. That feeling is hard enough to deal with, and when you add all of the extra work I would need to do to catch up....I just can't do it. If I do go into to work, by the time I come home I want nothing to do with anything. It makes me feel lazy. Maybe I am lazy. Do I belong back under that overpass I spent so many nights under? I'm trying my best to believe that I don't.

To close, I'm not sure exactly why I'm posting here. I should have been spending this time searching for stay at home jobs or looking for better opportunities...With my education and experience. Trying to get involved in my interests...Meanwhile not going homeless while I do it. It's a balance I'm having a hard time trying to find. 

If you know anything that would be a great resource, or if you just have a success story that you can relate with....Anything at all really. Maybe some killer advice for someone like me. I would love to hear it. I'm looking for my diamond in the rough, and it's high tide. 

Again, thank you for you time. 

TLDR;
 Can't find a way to get on track with my life without spiraling out of control. Interested in the Computer community and really admire the idea of working from my desk at home. As long as I still have a home and desk. No education, no skills, no direction of where to involve myself properly. Advice, tips, tricks, success stories that relate much appreciated.

224,"I'm 18 years old and I live at home with my mum, for the last few months she seems to find more and more things wrong with what I do. I am doing an apprenticeship so my pay isn't very good but I still pay her whatever rent she wants me to and I help out as much as I can around the house but she still seems to find problems with everything I do. I struggle talking to her about it as whenever we do talk an argument always starts. 

My sister has recently come home from university and has noticed how mum is with me as well but can't figure out why. I feel she always just expects me to do everything for her (except the cooking which she knows I'm no good at.)

She has also been comparing me to my dad a lot as well which she knows I don't like but she still continues to make the comparisons. I have never got along with my dad after he left us when I was young and since then he has done some unforgivable things which is why I don't like being compared to him.

Would like any advise on what I could do about it if anyone has any. I would appreciate it a lot.",25Apr2017,1
225,"Walking home from spending time at a family friends house, my brother and I are encouraged by this person to go out the back and enjoy the backyard.  There is a long strip of grass/trees/plants that spans the whole block and acts essentially as one giant yard for the neighborhood.

We walk back, and when we get within a couple houses of home, we notice a few little kids playing in the backyard area behind a house we'd have to walk through.  We immediately turn around and start to walk away towards the sidewalk when this asshole comes up screaming and swearing at us to 'get the fuck off my lawn you shits'. 

While I'm trying to figure out how the hell we're gonna leave, he's yelling and swearing and being aggressive towards my brother.  Somehow we communicate to this prick that we live a couple houses down and are just trying to get home.  

He immediately gets apologetic and says he's sorry, he has daughters, blah blah blah.  We're not in the mood to hear his excuses so we kinda say 'yeah whatever' and get the fuck out of there.

On the one hand, we get it.  Probably shouldn't have walked through the back areas.  On the other hand, this guy's an aggressive douche who was 1 second away from getting his ass dropped to the ground by my brother in self defense.  In high school and college he was in wrestling and martial arts, so the guy might not have been hurt too badly, but still.

230,"This post might be a bit long, but I tried to write down everything that has been bothering me and explain the history of those events.

I am 20 years old. My life has been pretty good - not the best, but better than many people I know. I have little to worry about. I have never been diagnosed with any mental conditions, but I have always showed signs of social anxiety, bdd, even mild trichotillomania. But I am able to deal with that and it's not what I am having problems with.

My dad died when I was 10. I only cried twice, that same day, then never again. I miss him a lot, but I got over it quickly. I did not have that ""sudden realization of mortality"", as I didn't think much of it for years later. I have had my mom and my brother and they have been enough.

In December last year, my friend's dad died (she is one year older than me) and that's when it started. It was as if suddenly I realized it can still happen. In real life, family members don't die when you are a child, then never again. It happens and it will happen when you are an adult. She isn't even my best friend, but it hit me harder than my own dad's death, because now I can understand it so much better.

Then I had a phase that lasted for two months, where I had delusional thoughts about being able to overcome everything -- I didn't worry about things I could not control, I never thought about death, I wrote so much and I was carefree in spite of those who worry too much. It felt like a good kind of a delirium where I could do anything I wanted. When I felt bad, I also felt like I am my own therapist who is doing a very good job.

Then in late January, my aunt had some severe pregnancy problems and it hit my family and even though I felt sad, I coudn't understand why they were acting like that, because at least she was alive. It was then that I admitted to myself that the only important thing is health. I was okay once again, but the delirium stopped. My boyfriend's grandma died too. And soon I thought I was sick. I made myself believe I had a terminal illness, and it only lasted for a few days before they convinced me I wasn't -- I didn't have such hypochondriac thoughts again, but it was enough to bring me into a state I am in now. Terribly afraid of death of people close to me.

I am trying not to think about it, but it always finds a way to my thoughts. I was writing a diary to feel better, writing ""tomorrow will be a nice day"", but then thought: How can I know it is going to be a good day? What if someone dies or gets hurt? What if there is a war? Even if not now, someone will die in several decades and it will crush me for good. If I am not doing well now, just how bad is it going to be when something actually happens? 

It is like there is too options: living in fear or living in denial - now that I know.

I want help, but I don't see how anyone is going to help me -- they cannot prevent it from happening, but only help me not think about it. 

Because of this (and extreme nostalgia for high school), I am not looking forward to anything anymore and I feel tired all the time. I still have hobbies, I am living and doing things, but the intrusive thoughts won't stop. 

I used to look forward to being 30, or 40, because I already found someone who I am (probably) going to spend my life with and the future mostly seems great ... if I omit the fact that someone might die by that time. I am terrified of phone calls. I always expect bad news now. When I say 'bye' to a family member, there will almost always be an intrusive thought of ""what if this is the last time"".

Sometimes I think I have had enough good things in my life and I'm going to have to pay somehow. For example, the fact that I found love early and it is an uncommonly healthy relationship which has lasted for so long -- and the intrusive thought I have is ""What if the balance has to be restored by someone of us dying early?"" 
It is a terrible thought. I shouldn't be like this, not at this age.

233,"So, my dad and I share the same iTunes account. This is because we didn't understand at the time that accounts were really only meant for one user. Anyway, because of this, I get text messages that are meant for my dad on my iPod. Most texts are related to his work, but some appear to be from prostitutes. I feel like I should confront him on this, but I don't want to accuse him of something that isn't true. I checked the area codes on the numbers, and they aren't anywhere close to where we live, and I frequently get spam texts on my own phone, but they are the typical ""You won $1,000!!!!

I have a fairly good idea how these spam bots got my number, and spam texts generally seem to be related to the way in which they got your number, in my experience at least.(I don't go around trying to get free money, my spam texts were caused by the person who last had my phone number) So I'm a bit concerned that he might be being unfaithful to my mother, by viewing porn and the like.

234,"Just had a conversation/fight with my boyfriend about this not 20 mins ago. Two weeks ago he got interested in a game I have on my iPad (Clash Royale if anyone is interested) and he helped me buy some expensive chests to win stronger cards and make me able to actually win battles. Then he starts playing it all the time and takes my iPad without asking me and plays it for hours.

Every morning I have the habit of looking at my iPad when I wake up to check my email and the weather and just browse some Reddit before actually getting up. The last few days he has been taking it before I wake up and I'll be wondering where the heck it went only to find him playing. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind him playing. He's just becoming addicted to it and is overly serious. He keeps trying to talk to me about battle strategies and show other players play dirty (which is dumb and not true cause you can't play dirty in this game) and I'm just like ""dude who cares? it's just a dumb game to pass the time. There's no real skill involved, it's just chance and some strategy."" 

It also really bugs me when someone takes something of mine or uses something of mine without asking. I don't care who it is, I want to be asked first. Is that wrong? 

He said he noticed I seem weird when he plays, like I don't want him to play because I'll get huffy about it when he asks to check the game or play it. I do get huffy but it's more because he is just too into the game and him being so serious about it is really annoying. So I told him that I just wish he'd ask me first to use my iPad. Then he called me cheap and that he doesn't even want to play and will never play again. He reacted like a big baby, basically. 

Every time he wants to play, I have to give up what I'm doing and give it to him, but I'm the cheap one for just wanting him to ask first? 

Anyway, am I in the wrong here? Am I too possessive of my iPad? I use my iPad all day sometimes because it's easier than using a computer and everything is on it. I watch movies, browse reddit, talk to friends, etc. on it. Maybe I'm wrong for getting fussy about him wanting to play a game on it.

My 1st cousin didn't attend our grandfather's funeral.

This grandparent nearly raised him, helped him out $ over the years (not much in recent years, other than the same $ gift he gave to all grandchildren), and was a nice person.

Please don't give me the ""it's not your business"" line- 
MY family IS my business.

It affects family when other immediate family in good health doesn't show up to pay their respects and come together during times of loss.

I'm NOT going to straight up ask cousin why he didn't attend.

I have no interest in starting a family feud. So, asking him is out.

I want to understand this cousin's reasoning as much as I can WITHOUT asking him, and yes, MY family = MY business. I'm not mad at the cousin, but am like ""wait, what"" about him not attending.

Cousin told family his kids had a flu. Yeah, they posted daily photos of Instagram of them all going to restaurants, local amusement parks, etc. the week and day of the funeral, so they clearly didn't all have a flu.

It's not financial, at least not a costly plane ticket.
Grandson (40 years old) lives in same city as his mother who was driving to the funeral, so grandson (my cousin) could have traveled free with his kids, or alone.
Grandson could have driven with his mom Friday evening (missing only part of a workday), and returned Sunday when she drove back home 7 hours drive away, so little work days missed.
Grandson has a spouse that could have stayed home to watch their 2 kids. Their kids are healthy, active, not special needs.
Grandson has no normal job; he freelance teaches kid soccer classes individually with kids part-time. 
Grandson had no boss, only part-time self-employed job, so getting off work couldn't be a huge issue here.
Grandson had no known huge fights with our grandparent.

I was thrown off by this grandson (my cousin) not attending our grandparent's funeral. Especially with the ""oh, we all have a flu"" excuse when their Instagram photos clearly show they had no flu and were out at restaurants, local museums and amusement parks, etc. all week. 

Cousin could have driven with his mom the 7 hour trip, only missing part of one business day Friday afternoon, so there were no costly plane tickets involved, and little work missed.

I'm obviously NOT going to ask my cousin his reason.

I know I can't know his exact reasons for not attending here. 

I'm not going to ask the cousin as that would just piss him off at worst, or at best likely not tell me the real reason anyway.

I want to understand POSSIBLE reasons, 
since I know random strangers here won't know his reasons.

My family IS my business, and my cousin's actions and lack of coming together as a family do affect my family. 

So, I want to understand his POSSIBLE reasons for skipping. (As in, ""it's normal to skip grandparent's funerals these days"" or ""perhaps he had a quarrel with the grandparent that wasn't resolved."" Asking my cousin is NOT an option here.

I just want to try to understand what I can from other people who have heard of a 40 year old adult grandchild not attending their grandparent's funeral.

What POSSIBLE reasons could there be here? 

Yes, I know everyone ""grieves in their own way,"" but that doesn't mean it's ok to skip a funeral just because you're sad. When someone dies, it's not about your comfort, it's about honoring that person and being there for family and paying your respects. Your family is sad too, and they need you- as you need them. 

So, the ""people grieve differently"" line doesn't cut it here as a reason not to show up for a funeral to pay your respects. 

My guess would be that 40 year old grandchild could have been mad that the past few years grandparent didn't bail him out of rental foreclosure and similar $ problems this time. Grandparent had helped pay for their college years ago, even bought them a car- but in more recent years didn't/couldn't keep throwing money their way. Grandchild (cousin) still got the same $ holiday gifts that grandparent gave to each grandchild.

For the love of all that is holy, please don't say ""it's not your business."" Clearly my family is my business, and our family noticed the cousin's absence here. His life and his choice not to attend, that's his life choice, but it affected us, and I want to try to understand his possible real reasons (he/his kids clearly didn't have a flu).

Is it common for adult grandchildren to not attend their grandparent's funeral? 

If so, what reasons would there be? Is it really normal to not attend these days? 

Is it so common to skip one's own grandparent's funeral these days that it likely wasn't a purposeful gesture/statement or sign of a lousy relationship that the grandchild had with our grandparent?

245,"Alright before I state my problem, I apologize for any irrelevant detail (if any) in the post or maybe sounding aloof. I wasn't thinking making this post. 

Anyway to make things concise as possible, I am a senior in high school who did a chemistry lab today similar to one you would do in university (in that, you would be given a paper to answer your questions, then you hand it in by the end of the period). We were allowed to use only our textbook for reference, however my partner and I finished the lab a little bit later in the period, therefore I did not have time to flip between pages to finish the lab. The problem is, the mark I would have gotten in this lab would be close to zero or a failing grade (probably over exaggerated, but I doubt it), because I literally blanked out on the lab and though hypothetically speaking, I should've been able to finish the lab because the textbook was there for reference, I did not. For the most part, I blanked out at the time, but after the lab I figured out how to do the questions. Is there any thing I might be able to do to make up for this mark? I thought of talking to my teacher privately about the lab, but I don't know what to say to him, so I resorted to you guys for help.

On a side-note, I still have up until June to bring up my mark before this lab occurred. But I thought I desperately need to do something about this mark, as it does impact my average in this course.

247,"Hello /r/advice,

I guess I have what you call a first world problem. I'm a 24 years old university student from Europe, and I secretly have a lot of money - like fuck-you-amounts of money. I have kept that a secret from everyone, including my closest friends, because I'm actually kinda terrified of it and I think that it is something that can potentially ruin even the closest friendships. Most of my friends are either students or already working, and almost all of them are of course always short on money. That's usual for our age and generation I guess, but it is definitely another reason for me to keep my wealth secret, I want to fit in.

My Girlfriend recently broke up with me and now I need a new apartment. And I'm actually tempted to upgrade a bit. I found a really nice luxury apartment in my city. It's huge, with a Jacuzzi and a shared fitness room and outdoors pool. Hell yes. 

But that would of course blow my ""cover"". I thought about making up a story about an inheritance that I'm now blowing on my last year of university or sth. like that. But either way, it would raise my living standard above that of my peers and I'm scared of that and not sure how it would work out. I have great friends, and I just can't see us turning against each other... but on the other hand I think that an asymmetric balance of wealth might lead to envy on one side or arrogance on the other one.

So what I'm trying to say... Should I keep living the slacker student bachelor lifestyle or can I treat myself to a nice luxury apartment? What should I tell my friends, how should I behave? I guess this not only concerns my living situation but also future behaviour in general. what about the first car I will buy? Vacations?

248,"I'm 21 and after a whole bunch of shit where I had a breakdown from the stress of finding no real meaning in what I had been doing with my life up to that point (i.e. community college, working a shitty part time job on the weekends, jacking off, sweating way too much in social situations, etc.) I've drastically improved my situation. I dropped out of college, but I sought professional help for my anxiety, I quit my weekend janitorial job in a meat room and started working as a part-time clerk in a PA state liquor store (So $8.50/hr -&gt; $12.12/hr) and just generally through working retail in such direct contact with customers it's been a kind of immersion therapy for my social anxiety. 

My issue is that on some level it still hurts to spend 5-6 days a week mostly working on shit I don't honestly care about. There is no fulfillment to selling Jaquins and Nikolai to people that fucking obviously need professional help for their alcoholism. 

There are obviously jobs that I would enjoy more and frankly the one I have isn't that bad all things considered, but I've kinda hit the point where I feel like I'm not going to be happy unless I at least try to chase one of those stupid dreams I had as a kid. I tried a few in school and that didn't work out, I'm not interested enough in any particular field of science to want a career in anything. I'm handicapped in math too, which didn't help, but honestly up until the breakdown I was at like 3.5 GPA so I can at least learn. I feel like what hurt me most was not really wanting what I was working toward. There was the uncertainty of what a job in a lab or a classroom would actually be like, but toward the end I didn't really want any of it. 

I think this is the least stupid dream I have left to chase, because falling on my face with this one might at least entail landing in the tech sector. Which might be miserable too, but at least there are well paying jobs. 

TLDR: My dream is to create something I'm proud of and I've loved video games. I dropped out of school like a year ago because nothing felt fulfilling and I've lost my passion for science. Working for a company like Bethesda has always been my dream and I think I have to at least try or I'm going to regret it for the rest of my life.  Even If I fail, cool, I hopefully gained some transferable skills for working in the tech sector. Just trying is better than not trying. ",25Apr2017,1

251,"My boyfriend and I are planning a 2 or 3 week trip next March/April from Denver to the Grand Canyon and Zion, all the way up to Yellowstone and Grand Teton and then back down to Denver. I've done as much research as a girl could possibly do, I have plenty of books lined up that I'll buy once we get closer and things become more serious. The schedule is pretty much made.

My issue, though, is that we would spend about $400 on campsites alone (plus $300 each for the flight to Denver, $600 for the rental car, $300 for gas, all of our campsite utilities etc). Now I realize this isn't all too expensive for a 3 week vacation, but camping is supposed to be cheap and I want a true outdoorsy experience. 

My plan is to pay for camping in Yellowstone and Grand Teton (maybe even waiting until last minute to do so- considering the time of year we'll be going, the campsites don't generally fill and if they do it isn't until later). With Zion being an extremely popular park, I would probably reserve camping for those nights as well. In Bryce Canyon and the Arches National Park, however, I've seen some really good reviews and advice on boondocking spots in the area.

Is finding a boondocking spot as easy as they make it seem? Would we be adding an unneeded stressor considering we are first time boondockers (and first time backpackers)?

Before I left he told me ""I don't know if you're bad or incapable but you need to stop putting up the good guy theater"". Now I am convinced I am the fucking worst. I steal from everyone, I stole money from my dad and his wife (my stepmom) I lied to my girlfriend by seeing a girl without telling her I had a relationship. My relationship with my sister is very toxic and now I pushed away my psychotherapist by showing up high and wasting his time. I feel it's true, I am a bad person and I'm just fucking up my life and everyone else's around me and I don't know how to stop being this person. I know I need to quit the pot, get a job and start building some sort of life for myself but I'm just a parasite, I'm pushing everyone away from me so I am truly alone and then I can kill myself, that way I cause no pain on others. I feel very sad and disgusted with myself, I'm a coward, I have no balls, I can't go to an interview without having to make up a big fat lie because I can't face anything. I don't have the guts to do anything.

Why am I doing this? Why am I really being the bad guy? My girlfriend and my sister were trying to calm me down telling me I'm not a bad guy, but then why am I doing all the bad things? I abuse pot, drive while high, I take from everyone, I hurt everyone.

Why am I doing these things? Am I trying to prove to the world I really am fucked up? I need help, I can't keep doing this, I don't want to hurt the people I love, I want to kill myself, I feel I'm genuinely bad. 

How do I revert this? I can't stop it. The lying, the cheating, the substance abuse, I don't want to be this person anymore and I freeze in the face of anything. How do you cure being a coward? How do you cure a compulsive liar?",25Apr2017,1
256,"As the title says. I made a throwaway because this post specifically focuses on work a bit.

Basically, I'm getting close to 30 and I have been stuck in retail for years and I don't know what I'm supposed to do from here. None of the retail jobs I have had promotes me and simply brings in new people, so after 10 years in retail, I'm still bottom of the basket. I don't even like retail, but it pays the bills. However, here lately my job has been doing hour cuts so it can barely do that. 

First of all, my first problem with retail is the money. I'm almost 30, earning maybe a total of 11k a year. If I wasn't housing with roommates, I would honestly be homeless like this. I can somehow make my bills meet, but it requires me to bounce back on credit so I end up in a never ending loop of paying back on it. (I never missed a payment though, so my credit is still good.)

Second, the people I work with. I hate at my job, people constantly show up late, don't do their job correctly, the managers schedules people incorrectly all the time and when I finally have enough and tell people to do their job correctly so I can do my job, I get told ""You need to be nice because I have plans for you that require people liking you."" I don't care to be liked by the people here. I want to get in and work, not do someone else's job.

Finally, the shift changes. Like said, management is always messing up the schedule and changing schedules last second because they forgot that there was something to be done that day and didn't schedule for it, or just scheduled one person. This throws a dent on me because there have been times where I have had plans. They even texted me in when I was out of town and threw it on me like it was my fault for leaving town on my day off.

I don't know what to do with myself. I always think about changing jobs, but the only other places that ever seem interested in taking me are more retail places. Am I just stuck here forever like this? I don't mind working long hours myself. If anything, my job right now proves that I prefer it because they're only scheduling me 16 hours a week. I don't know what to do with myself because trying to leave just sits me back in this same situation.",25Apr2017,7
259,"One of my close friends of the opposite sex and I hung out a few weeks ago. That day we were joking with each other and saying how we shipped each other with certain people. Then she randomly mumbled under her breath something along the lines of ""we should be shipped together"". I promptly asked her about it and she said it was nothing. Later that day, my friends were texting me so while I was telling them to stop she told me to send them a selfie of us and say that she was my bae. 

Later that night after I had gone home I skyped her and asked what she meant by me calling her bae and if she was dropping hints. She said that she wasn't and was just doing it for fun. She said that if anyone did it in the future it was a good indication that they have a crush on you.

I am confused. Do I ask again to get a clear response for the first part about being shipped or let the entire thing go? Also do you think that she is dropping hints and I am just lightly missing them? ",25Apr2017,1
260,"I copied this from a post I made on another subreddit, and am hoping you guys could help?

So like the title says, I am attending a DJ Dance but I have no clue what type of attire/outfit one would wear so I thought you can help. The only rule is that it must be appropriate for school. If you have an outfit idea but have no idea if it is considered appropriate (my school is pretty lenient, but not entirely), don't be afraid to ask! :)

Some more info about this dance is that its going to be held on the Spirit of Norfolk cruise, if anyone was wondering.",25Apr2017,1
261,"This always happen in every classes. I'm a pretty competitive person when it comes to tests or exams. I would get grades in the 90's if I wanted to. However, despite of my good grades, whenever someone gets a better grade or mark than me, I get angry at myself for ""not trying hard enough"". 

Even though my grades are perfectly fine, I can't seem to stop comparing my grades to other people. If they do better than me, I get an unsatisfied feeling thinking that I was pathetic and not committing hard enough to my studies.

How do I go about ridding these qualities? I wasn't always like this. Before entering high school, I was actually getting failing grades. But when I entered and tried my best, that's when these characteristics of mine started appearing. 

How do I stop comparing my grades to others?",25Apr2017,1

267,"I'm 14, 9th grade. So my school has a little store where you can buy snacks and sodas and stuff. Well Friday, I stole a chocolate cupcake (hostess) to see if I would get caught, and sure enough, I made it out. I know that if you're gonna steal from a little store like that to buy something too so it doesn't seem suspicious. Well yesterday, I stole a bag of cheezits and 3 cupcakes. Today I stole 2 bags of cheezits, 2 cupcakes, and a couple sodas. I feel bad, and I don't know why I am doing this. Especially when everything in there is dirt cheap, nothing costs over $2, and I have plenty of money. Please help me now and fry me later. Thanks. ",25Apr2017,1
268,"I think I broke my hand. I can't move it too much or else it will hurt and it's a little swollen. I banged my hand on the side of a table at school by accident. I told my mom but she said that it's just a tendon and that I'm over reacting. She can easily take me to a doctor since I have Medicaid and she won't pay anything, but no it's just a tendon. Please help this s#!+ hurts

269,"I was asked by a girl to go to prom with her on the condition that I 'promposed' to her. I agreed, and promposed by making her a snapchat filter which cost around $15-$20, making her a big sign, flowers, and her favorite candy. I promposed to her a couple days later to which of course she said yes.

Over this past weekend I had texted her multiple times about prom asking for details since she is the one giving me the information from the group we are going with because I am not apart of her and her friends groupchat. After not hearing from her all day Sunday, me, and both my parents had become furious over the fact that she had been completely ignoring me. I know this because she was posting about youtube videos and her trip to the movies. My father went onto our town's community facebook page asking what I should do. (waiting to hear back or just drop everything) Late Sunday night I decided to DM her on instagram about if she even still wants to go, eventually she replied saying she would still like to go.

Monday morning I see a missed call and texts from her after I got out of the shower. What did she want? She found my father's facebook post and was pissed about it. I know my dad wrote the post and by no means am I mad at him for writing it, in fact I thought there was nothing wrong at doing so. She was furious. I told her we could talk about the whole situation after school, which we did.

I met up with her at her truck to discuss everything, and she denied ignoring my texts since they weren't in the form of a question. We both apologized for the whole situation, and are still going to prom, but that's not all.

Today I met up with her back at her truck to just talk about some other details, and she didn't even have half the mind to get out of her truck or even roll down her window to talk to me. Honestly, talking to her is like talking to a brick wall; she shows no interest in conversation, bland replies, etc. How am I supposed to spend all of this Saturday with her if she's going to act like this?

So as I'm writing this post, I DO NOT want to go to prom with her for obvious reasons. I can't back out at this point because prom is on Saturday which would make me look like the shitties human being. In fact, I have other people and groups who would graciously let me go with them.

What do you think I should do?

270,"I have recently finally succeeded in having PIV with my fiancé [23M] and we only had condoms to avoid getting me pregnant. The thing is we're so scared an error occurs and I get knocked up that he even pulls out with the condom on. We do not have condoms anymore for the moment because we're kind of broke (student life) and I'm thinking about starting the pill but whenever I search about it it says ""visit a doctor before"". Is it really necessary to go see a doctor? I mean we can not afford it for the moment, and we're​ craving to have sex (PIV). All we do for the moment is oral sex.
