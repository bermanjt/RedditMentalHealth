1,"Hi Reddit! So as a background, I'm 24 years old working in Manhattan making decent pay, but I feel like I should be making more. I've also grown tired of this city as the commute sucks (1-2 hours going back and forth each time) and for so long I've dreamed of travelling the world full time or living in a much quieter and less packed city.

I also still live with my parents but I'm getting tired of my dad and brother. I've insisted to my parents that I want to move out to be closer to work, but they want me to stay at home to help pay the rent. My mom thinks it's best that I wait one more year but it feels so long for me. What's also preventing me from moving to achieve my ""ideal"" better quality of life is my boyfriend. I love him very much but he doesn't plan on moving out of his family's home until much later on and so I feel like our interests in moving are misaligned.

So I am conflicted as I grow my desperate to leave this city, but things are holding me back. What are your thoughts/advice on my situation?

2,"I just started working for a big company a few weeks ago and have been in training with a class of a bunch of other people (more than 10 less than 20). I have PTSD (counselor doesn't know when it started but it definitely got worse after I got raped last summer) and am learning how to be a person again, so I am definitely not the most social or popular person in the class. It's not my job to be social and I told the company about my disability so I don't think it would be an issue except this girl (I'll call her Claire I guess). She talks the entire class and other students have commented on the fact that she almost never shuts up. I don't want to cause any problems but I think that Claire is a pretty annoying person. She's also been bullying me pretty much since training started. The first incident was by the water cooler when Claire complimented my shoes.

Claire: I like your heels!
Me: Thanks, I've been wearing them to try and look older. 
Claire: Cool! *walks behind the water cooler out of my line of site*
Claire, to another girl: She's WEIRD! 
Then they both laughed.

Today, Claire straight up threatened me. The conversation went like this:

Claire: *making a joke to the class and going on to explain what it was about for an unnecessarily long time*

Me: We get it....

Claire, offended: Wow, I HATE UGLY PEOPLE. She'd better watch herself over our next break because I'll come up to her with 4 friends and jump her.

Our supervisor seemed a little shocked by my outburst (which I'll admit was a mistake) but he continued class as usual. Class went on for the rest of the day pretty normally but she kept making comments about how much she hates ugly people (referring to me I'm assuming, which is pretty funny coming from her, considering Claire is morbidly obese.) When I was walking back to my car that night, I saw her behind me and tried to ignore her completely even though I was kind of freaked out. She didn't say anything else to me that night but I'm scared about going in to work tomorrow.

I am wondering if I should report Claire to HR or if I should just get over it. Our supervisor told us to report bullying and insults but I'm afraid that I could lose my job as well because I am no angel (although I do my best). If you guys need to know anything else, let me know but please give me advice. What should I do?

Thank you so much in advanced.",06Oct2017,5

4,"5 years ago my child went to live with the father because I had lost work  (not fired) I was denied visitation and most communication not by court but by him. I recently learned the father sexual and domestically abused my baby. CPS and police are involved so legally it's all headed into a healthy safe direction. Child is in my custody. My question..frustration. my child has all but shut me out and I wonder if I was only contacted to get out of the bad situation. I have been nothing but supportive always encouraging and supportive of dreams and goals. I'm really hating myself right now.

5,"I miss my ex, Justin. We dated for a while but then he broke up with me. It's been around four months and he's been through one relationship and so have I. I miss him and I somehow think he misses me too. At school he had to do this game where we take a group of four or five people and join hands. Justin immediately joined my group and he grabbed my hand tightly. When I said I was dating this guy named Sabastian, he got all defensive (subtly) like : ""oh, you're dating Sabastian?"" And he looked me in the eye and stepped a little closer. That created a lump in my throat. I just broke up with Sabastian cause we are only thirteen and he wanted sex... I didn't want that at all!

Justin also teases me. When I take his hat he tells me to give it back but I say no. He then makes the excuse that I still like him and smiles. I give the hat back. Another time when I had his hat, he threatened to hug me. HUG ME. You don't just do that. I then got scared and gave him the hat.

I love my job and wish I could take transit but it’d take 2 hours on the bus. I’m hoping to move even closerrrr to work so maybe I won’t even have to drive.

9,"I (20M) suffer from very severe social anxiety, and while my depression is mostly under control right now, it have a recent past of major depressive disorder. Due to my social anxiety, I currently have no social contact outside my immediate family. I'm very close with my parents and siblings, so this isn't a problem for me.

The issue is, for a long time I've wanted to play a tabletop rpg, and about a month ago a perfect opportunity came by: my sister (23F) and her online friend group were about to start a new campaign. I was hesistant, but eventually agreed to join in.

So, we've had couple of sessions of creating characters, and the campaign is starting tomorrow, and I'm *really* freaking out. Speaking via voice chat is probably one of the most anxiety-inducing things for me, and the two short sessions both ended with me bursting out in tears the second the call ended, and then proceeding to cry for hours because of how horrible I felt. During the call itself, I go into full on panic mode: afterwards I literally cannot remember what I've said, I can barely understand what the others are saying, and my whole body trembles so much that writing on keyboard is seriously difficult for me. 

For the last two weeks or so, my mental health has been plummeting to the ground. My sleeping schedule is completely messed up because I keep worrying about the rpg, and last weekend I ended up taking some of my old meds (a *very* bad idea) in hopes of easing the anxiety, but it just made things worse. For the first time since last winter, I've had suicidal thoughts, and it's scaring me, because I don't want to end up mentally in that dark place again.

So, that brings me to my question: what the hell should I do? I have a horrible habit of not finishing what I've started, so part of me doesn't want to give in to the anxiety again, and instead try to pull through this once, especially since I might not get a chance like this for a long time again. If I give up now, I know I'm going to regret it eventually.

On the other hand, sacrificing my mental health in the hope that voice calls might eventually get easier is not probably the wisest idea. Any kind of audio recording (whether it be voice chat calls, phone calls, recording my voice, etc.) has always been a huge source of anxiety to me (likely related to my dysphoria) and I don't see that changing in any near future, considering it's been like this for the past 13+ years.

And if I do decide to pull out of the group, I feel like I should have done it way earlier and not last minute, especially since it's my sisters birthday tomorrow. I know she wouldn't mind (she also has social anxiety so she's understanding of these things) but I feel really bad about it regardless.

**tl;dr**: Should I leave my tabletop rpg group before the campaign starts tomorrow because of my anxiety, or should I try to stick with it regardless?",06Oct2017,3
10,"Hello fellow Redditors; 


I am a newly employed Parking Attendant who works overnights in the uptown area in Manhattan NYC. The pay sucks and I barely get any tips (It's Washington Heights... Cheap assholes here) so like the other employees I'm thinking about washing people's cars for extra money. 


My question is can anyone provide me a good YouTube video of someone giving instructions on how to perfectly car wash a car by hand. 


I also would like if anyone who does this can give me really good supplies (links to buy them would be helpful too) for washing the car. You know I'm interested in knowing if I should hose down the car first.with water then put wax and hose down again. Like tips and stuff I'm totally new to car washing as I never had a car all my life. In NYC I just use the subway or bus) I'm thinking of some kind of spray for interior protection of the car you know the dashboard or something, a good spray for car windows so it doesnt leave any streaks), some kind of spray for the exterior of car do it's nice and shiny and the customer will definitely know it's been washed professionally. And maybe some kind of spray for the tires. Maybe stuff I can order on Amazon would be great. 


I have access to water and a hose with a spray muzzle as well as a rigid vacuum. 


Also the other employees charge the people here $25 for regular car and $30 to $40 for SUV, Big Van, huge pick ups etc. What do you think about the prices. Should I charge the same amount or should I charge less or more or perhaps have a standard fee but have additional fees for extra work. The location is Washington Heights in Manhattan NYC. This isn't Midtown Manhattan. The price for parking isn't excessively crazy as downtown Manhattan prices so keep this in mind. 


Thank you for any tips, links, and any help at all.

22,"Hi, 
I currently work at a college as a tutor, I am a student there and was pretty good in some of my classes so my professors recommended me to work as a tutor. I work for the school in a tutoring center with about 3 other tutors where students just walk in and ask for help, free for them. I have been told that I do a really good job and very often I will have 5-10 people come specifically for me, while the other tutors only get 1-2 students per day. I am overworked, this isn't one-on-one tutoring, sometimes I will be tutoring 4, 5, or 6 people at a time. Can be very stressful. I do enjoy the attention since it shows that I do do a good job and all, so that I am happy about. I have even gotten promoted to helping a professor with three of his classes as a TA. 

So while these are all great things, there issome bad. I only make $8 an hour. Most professional tutors get 15-30$ an hour and my boss acknowledges that we are all underpaid. I would consider myself a professional, although I do not have a bachelors degree yet.  They will only work me for 20 hours a week to keep me from recieving benefits, and also anyone with more than 20 gets 3 free classes at the college, so I feel like that is somewhat disrespectful. My boss tells me how he would love to give me a pay raise and give me more hours but there is just no money. This is a publicly funded college so I have a hard time believing that. 

I really am just looking for how I can best utilize my skills, and maybe get paid more. Should I just quit and go work somewhere where I can make better money and get more hours or is there any way that I could negotiate and possibly better my situation. 

I am looking for some insight from anyone with ideas on what I could or should do. I appreciate any and all things that you could have to say. I just feel like I am being taken advantage of since I am much younger than all my superiors and have no authority to go making administrative decisions or anything like that. 

Thank you for your time

Also, I am not trying to sound like I have it hard or anything, I am very grateful to have this job because before I got this one all I ever had was manual labor. I enjoy the work that I do, I just feel that I am not making enough money for the amount that I contribute to the job that I have. ",06Oct2017,3
24,"Hi, so I am currently in a community college (20m). grades were shit so im stuck here for a while. anyways, i was just thinking on whether or not i should buy a car. i currently have a 2011 toyota camry xle but was interested in buying a used 2016 infinity q50 or 2015 benz c300 sports package. however, of course, i would not be able to afford it with the amount of hours i work. in order for me to afford the payment + insurance + gas + extra spending/saving money, i calculated i need a minimum of $1200 a month. that would mean, ill be needing to work a minimum of 4 hours everyday of the week for 3ish years (thinking of a 48 month payment with around 4.4% interest) of course, i dont NEED a new car, it is more of a want. however, knowing myself, im not sure if i can commit myself to working 28 hour weeks, juggle school, and have some free time. but, i am hopeful in the sense that maybe this experience will give me some added pressure to improve my time management, scheduling, and to mature overall. hopefully i dont go crazy and shoot myself or something. right now, i only work 12-15 hour weeks if you were wondering. what do you guys think? think i should take the 3+ year commitment or just settle for what i have right now. thank you in advanced. 

oh, and i do play quite a lot of videogames (maybe thats why my grades are always so shit) but everytime i play, in the back of my mind, i feel like shit. shit because i know i should be doing something else with my time. i dunno. buying a pc come cybermonday but yea.... i feel like maybe this will give me some motivation to do something with my time. skeptical, but hopeful. then again.... i just want a better car than a camry lol.",06Oct2017,3

32,"Context: I never go out, haven't drank in probably 1 year. Not because I don't want to just because I don't have any time. My 21st  was this summer and so was one of my other good friend's, so we had planned to go out tonight for a long time and all was good. This was sort of an event since the next time I go out/drink with my good friends from school will be a while since we just never have time.

Today at school I was on my phone and slammed my head on a beam while not looking where I was going. I know, stupid me, stupid my fault, but I'm afraid I have a brain injury. I don't have any of the symptoms of a concussion (I was in class afterwards and could type this fine and remember the event, no headaches and head does not hurt, I even was writing code for a while before I took a nap), but they say sometimes in minor injuries symptoms don't emerge for 24-48 hours. I've hit my head a number of times before and I don't think this one was explicitly hard or anything (just walking normal speed), but I never want to take risks because I'm paranoid about keeping my brain functioning. I know this might sound overly paranoid and hypochondriac (I definitely am one), but now I'm ""killing a vibe"" that me and a bunch of friends had planned for a fun night tonight.

I wasn't planning on going hard anyway (just checking out the downtown scene basically with friends and having a good time) so I need advice on which option would you do in my situation.

1. Bail on my friends, be that guy, risk not going out and having a true quality link up with all of my friends in a long time

2. Go out, if I have a brain injury risk banging my head again and getting permanent brain damage or slowing down recovery by alcohol consumption.

3. Some medium between the two where I drink slightly and am extra cautious? Do you think this is safe?

33,"Dear /r/Advicers,

My advice might be more complicated than half of the post on this sub so bare with me, I'm a 19-year-old in the Miami area with nothing but a high school diploma some college academics (currently pursuing a computer science major) and no real experience at a job. I'm writing to you because I'm lost in this world and have become disheartened and immensely frustrated. Nothing has worked out for me so far but to really understand my situation and give me advice I need to provide a solid foundation and background so here goes nothing. 
Since I was a kid I seemed to like staying inside more than being outside. I loved to dabble with electronics seeing how things worked and the bigger picture of it all. As time went by I stayed the same being bullied around my middle school years just made my love for technology and tinkering grow even more changing iPhone screens, Building computers and much more, Along with playing video games.

Then came high school my freshman year was all the same as my middle school years, my super pale complexion was usually the target of it even though I wasn't albino. My sophomore year I decided I was done being the chubby kid and lost 20 pounds over the summer, I came back looking worse than I did before white and severely malnourished still with my love for video games, electronics, along with a new found love for programming. Junior year changed everything I began lifting weights and fell in love with the process I became pretty well built and in result became friends with many people I still am friends with till this day but gaining all these friends I spent more time talking on the phone and at the gym then following my passion of programming. 
My parents never had much money and i never had the best relationship with them but they surprised me with my 1st car an ole 2000 Mustang V6, with my new friends, a car and my first girlfriend i felt grateful and i couldn't ask for more. 

This all changed very quickly i crashed that car, my relationship didn't work out but i still had friends. Fast-forward after graduation i started at a community college since my parents didn't have money for tuition anywhere else and I had no scholarship. I worked as a camp counselor for some time but that never really offered much.

Starting 2017, I felt lost hell I still do. It's been 10 months and I feel like I'm at the same place I started. I lost my financial aid when i dropped 2 of my classes because I simply got bored the material was easy and i didnt want to sit in class for 2 hours learning things i already knew. So after the semester im currently in there's no way for me to pay for college. I haven't worked since last year but I've desperately applied since the beginning of this year, getting interviews but never landing a job ( I felt like they judged appearances more than anything and I'm not the best looking dude)
Im tried my hand at drop shipping, I took out my real estate pre-license but I don't have the money to pursue the actual license. I've applied endlessly to jobs and don't really have great connections. Looked for hours on IT certifications i can get to make decent income to move out as my parents are on the verge of kicking me out. Come 2018 i feel like the only move i have left is to join the USAF.

40,"My friend and I have been friends for almost 8 years. We used to be best friends, spend several times a week together, constantly talk to each other....and now we barely speak or see one another.

Some background:

She and I were always close. She has a disease that was always in the background and was hard for her but not serious, until she took a turn for the worse 2 years back. She was basically attached to machines and in critical condition and eventually had surgery. I was by her side every step of the way, through her recovery and all.

It was at this point she started getting better. Around this time, I noticed we began hanging less and less. I figured it was due to the fact that she was still in recovery mode so I gave her space. We still talked a lot though. Fast forward to 2016. I see less and less of her. 

Both of us used to go to concerts together with our BFs but every time we would but tickets, a few weeks before the event her bf suddenly can't go because of work. Understandable, but after it has happened for the millionth time, I tell her my bf and I are selling our tickets since we wanted to go as couples. She is annoyed at me for cancelling on her but goes with other friends anyways.

Usually I invite her to almost everything and she comes out but I notice she begins declining events to hang.

She then starts making excuses that she's busy, yet I see she is going out with other friends via social media.

Fast forward to 2017. I see she goes out to a nightclub with friends despite the fact I've been asking to go with her to a club forever. I message her and ask why she didn't throw me an invite. She makes an excuse that it wasn't her thing to invite people to, but the club is an open invitation situation, there's really no reason she couldn't have invited me, plus we I'm friends with the other people in the group anyways.

From this point on, we hardly see each other. I all together stop asking her to hang out and she never hits me up. I see she's going out and about even though she tells me she is SO busy.

Finally I message her and tell her I feel like we are growing apart and I want to fix it. She makes excuses that her life has gotten busy and then says that if I want to end the friendship since I'm upset that it's my decision but she is still my friend.

This whole situation is frustrating. I don't know what to say to her anymore. She doesn't acknowledge my concern and denies that there is anything wrong. I have stopped putting the effort in but this enter scenario really hurts. I thought we were closer.

And now on the rare occasions I see her, it feels strained.

Obviously I am hurt but you can't force friendship. I have made a new best friend and I'm happy, but the pain from disconnecting from someone I used to be so close with is still hard.

Another thing I got into was Brazilian jiu-jitsu. It's fun but I'm really bad at it but I want to get better, but these last two weeks have been hell. I got sick last week, and yesterday and today I've had some weird food poisoning. I'm also trying to lift to put on muscle but that's been going alright for me, I just need the motivation to stay on track. I also work a pretty shit restaurant job that's draining but I'm unsure where else I can go for work. My goals are to move out, get a decent job, travel with my cousin, get into really good shape, get into a relationship, save up money in the long term. It's just these things seem so far away and difficult to do, I don't know how to stay on track or if I'm even going to be able to do any of this. I guess my question is how do you stay motivated, how do you stay on the right path",06Oct2017,1
51,"So in a few weeks I will out of state for a total of 8 days. I have two cats in my one bedroom apartment and for the most part, they get along/avoid each other. However, one of them does pick on the other sometimes, and a fight will ensue. When I’m home it’s not a problem. I either distract him from being a butt to his sister, or he goes in the bedroom by himself for a bit to cool down. 

Even though I have a cat sitter dropping by the apartment a few times a day, I’m slightly worried that they’d get into a decent sized fight while I’m gone that would result in a legitimate injury to my older cat ( the one who gets picked on). 

Would it be an issue if he were sequestered to the bedroom for the length of time I’ll be gone? He’ll obviously have his own bowls, litter box, and toys. And a cat sitter to play with him a bit. ",06Oct2017,1
53,"Very long here, desperate for help. There's this guy I work with, very tall, very country. We worked together for like 3 months before one day I find out he's single. My friend talks to him and tells him i think he's cute. He chats me up and we start dating a couple days later. After 4 days he texts me and says he isn't ready for a relationship, he just got out of a year and a half one a week earlier. To which I understood and sadly we broke up but he still wanted to be close and hang and maybe get back together. Two days go by and I hear this rumor from my other friend that he told this girl we never dated and that I talk to too many guys (WHICH I ONLY TALK TO HIM!!!) and I'm pissed I confront him and he says he only said that we never dated because it was just a few days and I understood but he said he never said the second part. I can't find out the truth and everyone says I should believe him and so I am. I just acted very pissed about it and stuff and kinda a bitch...

56,"As my title states, I gave up drugs (all day marijuana use, cocaine, crack, etc) in March after  experiencing a panic attack that made it impossible to use normally. I now have gotten my license, the car of my dreams (2017 Wrangler Sport), and a job that I love. So overall I'm in a good place!

I had been dating around since last year, and 5 weeks ago met a man (32) whom I am really enamored with. As of today I made a commitment to him to stop dating around, I had tried it out previously but called it off soon after because I was still unsure about being ""exclusive"". 

So far we have done everything but have sex.. Well, technically we have, but he has stopped it every time after a few strokes and says ""I really like you and respect you so I don't want to take this too fast with you"". We have discussed sex very extensively, but every time I'm actually there to do it he backs out and just ends up fingering me until I finish and then we cuddle for hours and usually end up fooling around a bit more. He is extremely busy as he works in government and teaching, plus a few volunteer jobs (partially why I'm so interested in him! I admire his work ethic) so sometimes I don't hear from him for almost an entire day. I get really nervous about this, and can't forget about it until I drink. Like, if he's fallen asleep on the couch after getting home late and I don't hear from him; I'll worry that he doesn't want to speak to me and end up having a few drinks. Once I finish the first, my mind is off of him and I can carry on normally with my night. 

I'm basically just looking for advice on two things: 

1. is ""waiting for sex because I respect and like you"" a normal thing (I had never experienced it before)? 

2. Does my drinking sound problematic? (I've only been sober one night this week, and that was because I had to drive to his house.)

TLDR; I am dating a very busy man and sometimes he can't talk at night because he's fallen asleep after working +14 hrs. I get self conscious waiting to talk to him and end up drinking (ex drug addict) so I forget about it. We haven't had sex yet because he ""respects me and really likes me so wants to wait"". Do either of these things sound negative? Or am I overthinking?",06Oct2017,1

58,"Hello. There's a lot of explaining that I will have to do so I would like to start off by thanking those who are taking the time to help me.
Background: It has only been three months since I have turned 18 and graduated from high school. I am attending community college and in two weeks I will be hitting midterms in my first official semester. I have also only recently started working via a work study and I still live at home. 
    I am in a loving relationship where we are almost hitting the two-year mark. My girlfriend is attending the same community college[she is 18] and is working full time to sustain herself (via paying a share of rent in her 7 household family of adults). I dont agree with her family's philosophy and find them to place ridiculous expectations on her to the point where I see it as being cruel.
  Her mother is the ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" type of gal and shes always telling my girlfriend that she needs to toughen up and be an adult. Granted she has two much older daughters who still live with her, and yet she doesn't apply the same judgment/expectations on them. 

The problem here is that today I get a call from my girlfriend telling me that she got home from school and everyone just all of a sudden is asking her to find a roommate because every single person is planning on moving out of the house. When you may ask?? The thing is that they aren't giving her straight answers and are toying around with the idea of leaving early January. She realistically cant live on her own and still go to school like she wants too. 

Her family is so oblivious to all the bad decisions they make and I have provided her with the counseling information needed so she can discuss this information at the college where some form of plan can be formed. 

Still living with my parents and my folks being really private (no sleepovers whatsoever) her living over here with me just isnt an option. She dosnt have any other family and she dosnt have many friends and those who are friends arent ready to move out, are in a University or cant take her in to their families home.

Its crazy how shes coming to terms with being homeless!!! 
I can't believe her mother is willing to just abandoned her child and tell her to suck it up when shes let her other daughter who is 25 stay and accumulate savings so they (because she also had her boyfriend living with her family) can move out. 
Please any help would be appreciated. ",06Oct2017,1

Firs of all, I am a brazilian guy and thanks google translate 
Reddit was helping me a lot these last past months, I found a place where the people
are more kindle and helpful than the others social media. 
I'm going to write somethings about me before I start my little( I guess) history.
I am 19 years old, Middle class, unique son, fathers divorced and I live with my mother;
I am in the 4º period of university ( (UFRJ) Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) 
coursing BCMT (Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Earth Sciences)
My hobby is play videogames on pc and workout  ( confess that I am unmotivated to keep going ) 

NOTE : The class quotes can be a little confusing because of the difference of countries

AI always slept in almost every class and just really cared in not to be a repeater,
it incredible worked until I graduate in the high school, good for me...but not good for my college, 
today I feel in my skin my bad habits of not studdy, I just can't sit in my chair and do it
, I already tried a lot of times but I don't get it , I'm a f****** lazy and don't know how to stop this laziness snowball;
Like I already said, I am in the 4º period ( 2 years ) of universit and did about 1 class... yes,you did not read it wrong, just 1 class
of 15 ( i guess ), my mind and body can't understand the gravity of don't care about my course and my future, it is like : ok, 
if I don't start to study now , i'm going to fail in this class... 2 weeks later and I didn't opened my book,I keep on my chair 
doing the same thing I do every day ( playing or watching videos ), I feel very bad and disgusting for my position in life and how I suck being #1 laziest in the world, I want to change it but I can't, it is strongest than me , all the weeks I try to change but I fail.
All weeks I just don't go for at least 1 day for University because I can't wake up before 11:00 AM, it is a Childbirth( mean something really hard and difficult in Brazil) for me to wake up early and I just felt like I lost great part of my day ( I try to sleep before 1:00 AM all days ) 
I take 2 hours to get to my college and this discourages me a lot...
So, I don't want to talk about it with my parents, they don't understand my problems,they always say : this is bullshit , you need to do this and that...bla bla bla
and I don't want to talk about it with my friends too, it's kind of shameful to tell them this
My parents will not take me to the psychologist because like I already said , they think this is bullshit of mine.
How do I start to care about my future? how do I get out of this limbo
I am in this endless comfort zone, I feel sad this entire 2 years and I just doing the same thing forever, the bad part of me says that 
it is going to be ''ok'' like 4 years ago in my high school and my logical part is screamim for help because she knows that is going to ruin my life.

66,"I just recently started university for computer science and its not what i had hoped. I originally thought that getting to university would allow me to do more of what i enjoy, (ie. computer programming) although this doesn't seem to be the case. Since starting school in September it's become clear to me that a bachelor's degree in computer science should not take 4 years. 

My program has been padded with so many electives that they make up nearly half of the workload. At first i thought this would be okay as i could just take more courses i was interested in, however i soon realized that they were all already mandatory for the program. On top of this most electives are required to be in non math or science fields, meaning I have to take all sorts of courses i'm not remotely interested in. I understand that this system will work for most people but i am having a hard time with it. I can't find electives i can take that look even remotely appealing, and i often do badly in a class if i don't find it interesting.

I am now wondering if university is really the best path for me or if there are better ways for me to learn. I want to be able to prove I know what i'm doing and a university degree is a great way to do that, but i also don't want to be stuck like i am for another 4 years. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

71,"I feel like such a failure 

It seems like all I’ve done my life is shoot myself in the foot and now it actually hurts because it’s no longer just a grade on a piece of paper on how well I know my ABC’s…it’s everything and I’ve ruined my future. 

I’ve never been a great student ever since I started school in the first place. My birthday is a day before the cut-off to be considered a year below what I am so I barely make the cut and I feel like I’ve always caught onto things slower (academically) and never really took things seriously when I should have (grades)…kind of like I just don’t do/realize things in time and then it screws me over. I did horrible in high school, had a 3.2-3.3 GPA I think, w/ a 1400 SAT (?) honestly don’t remember, didn’t get into anywhere I applied. So, I went to my community college and was pumped to do great and transfer anywhere I wanted YET here I am in my THIRD year of college with a 2.7 GPA. I haven’t even received my AA because I’m behind on classes due to a disability so I’ve had to attempt several times..I’m currently attempting again, hopefully I pull through. I have 6 C’s on my record and they just destroyed my GPA. What upsets me is that I received all of those C’s in probably the easiest courses possible..and I BARELY got them. I slacked off just enough to drop to a C and now my GPA is trash. Some of the courses are entirely irrelevant to my field because I was confused and switching majors which meant new requirements, and I pulled a C in those classes that now have absolutely no relation to what I’m doing, so now, even though I shouldn’t have done so poorly in the first place..I’m being penalized for worthless classes regardless. I know I’m smart and I know I can handle college because when I try, I do great, thats always been the case, I just really suck at committing to the work 100% which lands me in these situations. I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t want to stay at my CC..I’m tired of it, I’m tired of the city I’m in, its toxic and I just feel like I’m not in an environment that I want/need to be in, everyones just sitting around taking life as it comes with no plan, I need something new and fresh with people who have drive to succeed, or even improve..not that my success depends on those around me but its always a good thing to be surrounded by people who reflect positively on you and I’ve ruined my chances it seems. My brother is currently in University graduating in December as a mechanical engineer..my boyfriend is an extremely intelligent person who already graduated and is now attaining his PhD in Genetics along with friends who have all left to go to school and I’m still here just wasting away because I guess I hate to see myself do well. They all always tell me I’m smart and capable of so much, I just don’t do anything for myself and its true. The thought that I won’t get accepted anywhere not because I’m incapable but because I SLACKED and wasted my abilities is just heart breaking to me…so much self destruction, I’m literally my own obstacle. People have told me theres plenty of jobs out there that don’t require a degree and theres many successful people who didn’t go to college but I don’t see that being my life, I don’t want that to be my life. Good for those people, but that was their plan and it isn’t mine. I WANT to go to a University, I want to stay up late studying, I want all of that and to graduate, I feel like I need college because I don’t see a life for myself without it..I mean, I’ll graduate college no matter where I am. If I’m stuck at my CC, I’ll still finish its just that wasn’t my plan and I feel like a failure if it ends like that, where you graduate from can and does affect your future when it comes to jobs, etc. ..it would just be nice to get into an actual University and get that validation that I’m good enough. I’m not sure what I’m expecting from you guys..maybe I’m not expecting anything at all, I know nobody can fix my situation. I just wish I could be told I’m not a failure and that transferring into a new school and doing well is still possible AND IT BE TRUE. I’m just so angry with myself..If I just put in that little effort instead of slacking I would have never gotten any C’s in any of those classes and I’d probably be sitting here feeling pretty confident about getting into schools I apply to. If I’m being honest I’d love to make this my essay when applying to schools but nobody likes a sob story, even if its honest. I wish admissions to schools were able to hear all of this out and give a shit but theres plenty of people out there who did the work and deserve getting into school, those who didn’t put in the work like me don’t deserve special treatment, I get that..I guess I just wish they, and anyone else in life could see that I have potential still and not write me off because of my mistakes. I feel like my grades are who I am and now who I am appears to be pretty shitty. Anyways, I’m done ranting, just needed to get it out because I’ve been bottling it all inside my head and hating myself more and more every day that passes. 

I need advice on how to just keep going, I lose the drive sometimes because I feel like in the end I'm just going to end up somewhere I don't want to be because of my mistakes so its hard to keep motivated when I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you know?",06Oct2017,1
72,"My last roomie moved out last weekend and a new one moved in. My boyfriend has also recently moved in.

73,"I want advice as to what I should do to make my life better.

I am 18 years old and a freshman at a four year state school. I was born in a two parent household with good income and i've always been in a good situation. In High School I received a 3.1 GPA and a 23 on my ACT. I played baseball, football and basketball, i've loved sports all my life. I was recruited to play baseball here at this four year school and several others, it's a D3 so there's no scholarship money but it's still a great honor considering that they've won National Championships and such in the past. I'm 6'3, 180 pounds, I workout four days a week and I truly believe based on what my peers have told me that I am good looking.

My life seems pretty good, doesn't it?

Well it certainly isn't bad, I have a lot to be thankful for. But we all want to maximize our lives don't we? If you're given blessings why not try and make the most of them? I feel as though I'm not making the most of my life and that i'm wasting what I was given, i'm not being all that I can be.

My brother is 15, a freshman in High School. He ""has it all"" so to speak. He's my height, my weight, my speed, twice my athleticism and also better in school. He's going to be the starting quarterback for the varsity football team next year and he's also going to be on varsity for both baseball and basketball as a freshman. He's got certain things that I don't, and i'm lesser than him in that sense. I'm not jealous, I do my best to guide him and give him someone to look up to. It just sort of pains me that he's everything that I wasn't.

When I was a junior, I dated this girl who was perfect. A 10. Exactly like me in every way. Everything I had ever dreamed of and more. I lost her. I lost her because I wasn't confident enough in myself and she wanted more in a guy. Instead of accepting it, I got bitter and called her a bitch and swore revenge and all that. I didn't think she deserved good terms so I didn't give them.

Now i'm in college and the first month has been wild, but not necessarily in a good way. I've met a lot of people who've turned out to be fake friends, something I wasn't used to in High School because I had the same friends through all four years. I thought I was going to be best friends with these dudes from my floor, we played on the same intramural flag football team, went to parties and hung out like we were friends. But now they've double crossed me, because they told me yesterday that they're planning to get a house next year and since there's no five bedroom houses available, i'm going to be the odd man out. I don't know why this happened.

So now I signed a sophomore release and stuff and I have nowhere to live, I thought that these were my friends when in reality they're just guys who'll be fine without me. Not to mention, they told me I should try and link up with another dude i've been hanging out with to see if I could live with him, but this guy double crossed me as well. When I asked him to hang out tonight he didn't respond to my text, yet he was still chilling with other people. This was three days after he told me that he wanted to room with me next semester and that we're gonna be bros. I should've known not to trust him because he's double crossed people before me. But still, what the hell happened? What did I do wrong? How did I go from having friends to not having friends?

Oh, and by the way I quit baseball because I thought that these guys were going to be my social group and also because I wanted to put more focus into school. Plus I want to get a job up here by winter break so I can start working towards more financial freedom.

There's so much more to tell, and i'd like to discuss some of it with people in the comments, I just sort of feel lost right now, a little lonely. I should've known not to trust certain people. But i'm just sick of life being this way when it shouldn't. I shouldn't be a loner, I shouldn't be a loser. I should have friends and I should be happier than I am right now.",06Oct2017,1

I met her at my high school job, and now I'm in college about 5 hours away, while she lives in my home town. We've stayed friends this whole time, and mostly communicate through letter and text. I struggle with mental health (mostly depression), and she does as well, but I rely on her more than she does with me. I also have aspergers. She understands me very well, and that's one of the reasons I like her. Monday, I wasn't doing great, and reached out to her. After a while, I said fuck it, balls to the wall, I'm going to tell her everything. Here's an itemized list of what I told her.
That I loved her.
That I wanted to put her through college once I was finished and had a job, and wanted to do so regardless of whether or not she liked me.
That I couldn't get high anymore because I'd just miss her so much.
That we wanted the same things in life.
That despite neither of us being happy, we could be unhappy together.
That I understood completely if she just wanted to be friends, or even never wanted hear from me again.

She hasn't texted me back. 

So, I'm not sure what to do now. Obviously I'm giving her space, and I'm going to give it at least a month before messaging her again, unless she messages me. 
I'm not a neck beard, I'm not a nice guy. I don't feel entitled to her, I'm not stalking her, and again, if she told me to never talk to her again, I would. I want to make it clear I'm not one of those idiots.

I have other friends that I can rely on, so that's not an issue. But I really love this girl. I'm not going to waste your time with the reasons, I'm just here because I want advice. She knew I had some feelings for her, but I don't think she knew that they were so intense for me. As far as I can tell, she's annoyed/overwhelmed.

82,"She's someone I knew for over 2 years through work.. but were never together, for a lot of reasons but mostly because she wasn't single most of the time kinda on and off with someone.

Despite that, the chemistry was definitely there for more and we got along extremely well I just never pushed it though, but she had been single for a while before I left. 

I left and moved away since last year and haven't seen or talked to her since. Last time she did, she sent me a message for Christmas but I made the stupid mistake to just reply with the lowest effort, and that's basically it. Haven't talked since.

Honestly now that I look back, she's like the only person to show that she cared about me as much as she did and I feel pretty shitty just leaving. She didn't show hints, she literally said she'd like to to see me again and I did but only a few times before leaving. Literally no one in my life has shown anywhere near as much interest in me as her, and she was quite flirty the last few times I saw her.

I wanted to cut off contact (with a lot of people actually) because my life was so shitty at the time (had no job, had to move) and didn't want that to affect her life and my life is still kinda is shitty but out of nowhere, for some reason she's been on my mind a lot lately and it's bothering me. I had this dream a week ago or so that made me realize I loved the shit out of her actually, I've just been pretending that I didn't care or moved on 

I don't think it's really possible to re-contact her, especially after all this time. Not sure if this is just a rant, to get it off my mind or if there's something I can do to make it okay in my mind. 
I'm not looking for a relationship or anything, I don't even know how to start even if it was possible. It hurts that I know she had feelings too but I ignored it completely, more or less. :/ ",06Oct2017,1
83,"Hey guys. So I've befriended two neighbors of mine, who are in 5th and 6th grade. They're nice kids who started off trying to sell me things like fidget spinners (right?) and I've taken to just giving them my change instead. I got to know them and started teaching them things like chess and helping them with homework and stuff. 

As I'm getting to know them, I'm hearing some dark stuff about their family. Dad works three jobs and sees them less than an hour each day. Mom is gone cheating and is a drug addict. The kids often go a few days only eating one meal at a time. 

They're incredibly smart and very sweet. I myself am only a mid-twenty something with minimum income. But what are some things I can do to help these kids? What are some programs or opportunities I can be helping guide them to to help them grow academically, artistically, culturally, and set them up to be financially stable as they get to high school / college age? And all that as just a friendly neighbor?

Any advice more than welcome. ",06Oct2017,1
85,"I imagine monsters at night. I will get up to to go the bathroom and I will be walking by the stairs and for some reason my stupid brain decides to visualize a rabid wolf creature I saw in a meme once crawling up the stairs. I also imagine stuff jumping out at me and like slowly creeping into view in windows and stuff. This is seriously impacting my life. I'm scared to go anywhere in the dark. Even if all the lights are on in the room itself, if I look out the window and it's dark that's enough for me to imagine some horrible thing out there, whether it's a wolf creature, doll faced serial killer, murderuous clown, whatever. I don't know why I do this but it causes me a lot of distress on a nightly basis. I don't know why I do this to myself and I don't know how to stop. It used to be worse when I was younger. Once one of my friends told me a horror story about the grudge and I slept with all of my lights on in my room for about 6 months then finally I could sleep with just my bedside lamp on, which continued for a while. I get really really freaked out by this stuff. I never watch or read anything horror related unless you count getting the adds on YouTube. 

Just writing this post really freaked me out. I don't know what to do or if there is anything I can do. I feel so ridiculous and immature saying this but it really does bother me often. ",06Oct2017,1

87,"So I met this girl a couple weeks ago. We'd gone on a couple dates, which all turned out really great. We even had plans to see each other this weekend. However, about two days ago we were texting and flirting, nothing new was brought up and nothing had been said that was out of the ordinary. She told me she was getting in the shower and she'd text me after that, but never texted back. It was already pretty late so I just assumed she was tired and went to sleep. No big deal. 
The next day when I woke up I sent her a good morning snapchat. A few hours later I noticed she still hadn't opened my snap, though still nothing too unusual. I texted her around the middle of the day just saying hey, but again no response. By around 11pm she had still neither read my text nor opened my snap, so I thought I'd just give her a call but she didn't answer. I just told myself that maybe something happened to her phone and went to bed. 
So fast forward to tonight, still haven't heard from her. The snap I sent her is still unopened. Then I noticed she posted to her story, so clearly she has her phone. Which must mean she's ignoring me. 
The reason I find this so strange is because the last thing 
she said to me was ""I'll text you in a bit"". Not only that, a few days ago we were talking about how we hadn't been able to see each other for a few days since she had been so busy and she was telling me how sorry she was and that she really liked me and wanted this to work...

i decided to make a throwaway account due to being self conscious for quite sometime about this. The story is that i had braces from elementary all the way to right before high school then had a permanent retainer for my bottom teeth which lasted all the way up til last year. when  you go to the dentist twice a year a lot of plaque build up on the retainer and is very hard to get off yourself, so every trip was a bloodbath there and eventually the dentist said i needed to find a way to clean it up or my teeth are going to be in bad shape. My dad suggest just getting it removed since it beats losing teeth. I agree and a few months go by and i notice they are moving. 8 years of work and money gone. I call up my dentist and i go in and he says easy fix for 4,000, my braces originally were 5,000 for everything. I do not smile now, i try to hide my mouth as much as i can and have become depressed at the whole situation. What would be the best way to save or go about this? thank you all so much. ",06Oct2017,3

91,"(Yondr is a pouch to prevent people from using their phone, it cannot be unlocked without a large magnet)*
Some schools have been enforcing a new school rule in which students are supposed to place their phone in a pouch that is locked up until the end of the day. The pouch has a magnet which does not allow you to access your phone at all times.

My school has enforced this policy, we are not allowed to use our phone at all during school hours, this includes going off campus during lunch.
The schools ""goal"" is to reduce the amount of classroom disruptions that happen a day, as well as ""Developing Social Skills"" (Reduce social media drama etc)*

I can understand why some staff members are on board yondr, it has reduced teachers constantly having to ask students to put their phone away. But I feel like the system has more downsides than upsides.

In the beginning of the year teachers would take up to 20 Minutes making sure everybody in the classroom has their phone in the pouch, a huge waste of our first periods class time.

During our last period teachers have to start unlocking a students phone 10 minutes before class wasting even more classroom time.
It seems like a Majority of students do one of the following 
-Place a spare phone in the pouch 
-Claim they don't bring their phone to school 
-Leave their phone in their car 
-Take a pouch, but don't place a phone in it 
-Break the locking mechanism in the pouch, resulting in the pouch being able to open properly without the need of using a magnet.

Some teachers spend too much time focusing on the pouch rather than teach students, others seem to not care at all and place the pouches in a center desk.

""But Phone use has gotten down!"" are what teachers say. 

Except it hasn't. Teachers now assume that everybody has no access to their phones and as a result students don't need to hide their phones as much, if anything they are using it more since staff is no longer scanning for phones in students laps.

The entire system is a mess and all the students know it is, it waste our class time and teachers can't stop bragging about the benefits. Some teachers have even told me they hate the policy due to the process of organizing every pouch before and after school. Another teacher told me that they hate it due to phones being a integral part of the class, so they have to constantly lock and unlock a students phone.

I understand that some people may say stuff like ""Oh well you have to deal with it I didn't have a phone when growing up"". Yeah I get that, there was a time before phones but this policy is just extremely tedious and obnoxious. The only ones that Yondr are students that follow rules to begin with, students with the actual phone problems just carry a spare. 

I have heard from some people that at the end of the day only a few people unyondr (3 out of 30) students.

I asked r/legaladvice and so far I have only been told schools have the right to do this, which I can understand we don't have the right to a phone. 

Look I am all on board with teachers and admin not wanting to deal with so many students distracting themselves/wasting time on their phones during class, but this is not solving anything it waste more class time than before.

Is there anyway that I can change the policy? I feel like this should only be used on students who have a history of being disruptive on their phone, but instead it has become a school wide policy where 100's of pouches have to get reorganized constantly, a student was recently in trouble due to using a phone off campus and almost had their car towed.

The policy does not affect me/ certain classes nearly as much, I don't care about checking my phone to often in school since I don't care much about social media often. What I do care about however, is that this policy waste time and resources for something a group of the same students that have a history of being disrespectful with their phone.

I know parents don't like it, some teachers don't and students just ignore it.",06Oct2017,1
92,"Hey /r/Advice, I don't post much literally anywhere on Reddit, but I feel like I need some direction.

I'm a University student, super super busy all the time, but I try to make as much time for my friends as possible. I have plenty of friends; the issue is, 90% of them live in my hometown, and all the friends I've made on campus have been really just acquaintances at best. I've joined some clubs, and I have hopes to meet people with mutual interests there, but if it's anything like my previous interactions (which I feel they are bound to be), they'll be largely inconsequential. This makes me feel really, really alone taking my studies and being so far away from my close friends.

I have extreme trouble dating, as well. I don't think I'm a really bad looking dude, like 6-7/10 maybe, I have interests, not too quiet (even though I am a natural introvert), but I've never dated in college at all.

Now, I'm 20, so whenever I see people kicking around in relationships I can't help but feel a sense of proxy solitude. I see people going places with all of their friends, their SOs, and it's just a tough load to bear knowing I don't really have any of that.

I go home, do my homework, go to lecture, and cut loose with my friends back home on occasion; but, that's pretty much the current extent of my excitement. It's starting to really get to me.

If I could be more succinct: Is there a way to cope better with being lonely at the University level? Or any advice on dating or gaining people skills in general at this point in my life?

I don't want to say it, but I feel like giving up some days. Today was one of them, and that's why I'm here.

Thanks a bunch yall.

93,"Good day to everyone here...

I don't want to be here again but I just have to let this pain out from my chest. This will be a little long so please do take time to read, I just want someone to talk to and perhaps give me some advice as to how I will approach life:

* I have a girlfriend and we've been together for almost a year now and we are really happy. She is actually my first ever girlfriend and we got back after 6 years because I still love her and I am willing to marry her whatever happens. However, I've got this constant feeling that I am missing something in my life. This something is the feeling of trying something ""new"" as doing a one night stand with another girl. I am set that I will be marrying my girl and nothing can stop that and because of that I just want to try something at least for once.

*First, I've never had any other sexual experience beyond all my girlfriends. I've never did anything besides my ex and my girlfriend. I was even called gay by my friends and my co-workers before as I've been with them and never even touched a woman even though I don't have a girlfriend. They sometimes offered me girls and suggested on going clubs but I refused, always saying that they're not my girl. Now I feel like I'm gonna miss one experience in my life, which is obviously dumb.. so I wanna try it at least once.

*I tried omegle and met a girl there but I cut the conversation short on viber because I feel like I'm betraying my girlfriend which is actually what's happening. Fast forward a week and nothing's happening but this girl from omegle kept texting me and I said that I can't because I have a gf. I blocked her now from both viber and my contacts and everything was peaceful

*Again, fast forward after 2 weeks I reset my phone's data and right after that when it boots up I got a message coming from this girl from omegle that she saw me which get me shooked. I was 95% of the time within my home as I don't have a job yet and this got me into panic mode and replied to her as to how. She told me no clue and because I was really shocked I ended up texting her again and again.

*To cut the long story short... we again, started to flirt, I told her that I have a girlfriend and I will never ever see her and love her as much as my girlfriend but I can at least stay. I told her that if we both need to go separate ways we must understand and let the other leave and she said its fine and she understands it completely. One more thing, she has someone with him (not yet a boyfriend back then but a suitor whom she was with for a year and admitted that she loved very much) so I'm committed, she is semi-committed if thats how we call it.

*But things go sour as she becomes more and more possessive. She admits that she gets jealous with my gf as to which I replied that you should not be because we chose this. We decided to hook-up and everything was good until the next day. She started to act really, extremely, obsessive. I know she has some kind of a bipolar phase as she gets jealous most of the time but this is really weird. So I told her that we need to cut our ties.

*She eventually found my social media account and began to threaten me. It was breaking me apart as I am focused on my girlfriend and I thought I can escape it but she won't let it be. I evevntually told her to calm down and she admitted she wants to be mine and so on. I told her that we can't do that and we can be friends starting from then to which she agreed. But just two days with this ""friend"" thing and she began to utter iloveyous again and flirts with me, I told her to stop it because I want to make it up with my girlfriend which she again agreed. Everything was peaceful but last week she told me this:

IM PREGNANT

(1) She told that line to me a day before 2 weeks that we actually hooked up. Yes we are unprotected but I have quite a lot of experience with unprotected sex, In fact all my sex was unprotected. I made sure to pull it out and I have a low sperm count since I was in highschool, evident to my transparent excretion and really really almost no white, I even considered to go to the docotr but was scared if he told me that I was sterile.

(2)So I still panicked of course and told her it'll be impossible because of the points I told above. But she said she was certain. And she isn't joking. So fuck me and I decided to research abortion pills... I hope you guys understand that I'm confused and desperate at that time and told her ""I know you won't like this suggestion but have you considered cytotec?"" she said NO and I said ""I know you'll say NO thats why Its not on my priority"". At that time I was crying... so much that I considered hanging myself at that point but I managed to ask her HOW SHE KNEW SHE WAS PREGNANT

(3) She said their college nurse told her that ""you might be pregnant"" because she's experiencing nausea and gagging. However, I'm skeptic about this as she have anemia and apparently hyperacidity. This is evident when we're at the hotel, every minute she would gag and rush to the toilet.. she also gets headache from time to time when we were together at the hotel so I'm really skeptic. So I told her it might just be because of her condition

(4) Because of that... I know now that she might be actually crazy, possessive or I dont know what to call her. So I decided to block her which, of course is not a good choice. At exactly 12:03 AM today, I had just opened my girlfriend's messenger to check some stuffs I was testing with my phone and I saw a message request with screenshots of my messages. With the line ""She got my cousin pregnant and she is really depressed, Yeah, they were a thing even if you are with your boyfriend. I'm sorry girl I just want you to know""

(5) Again I panicked and managed to block the user and delete the message. But before, I got a glimpse of the girl's profile. It was a fake profile, with the same ""fictional workplace"" of the girl I apparently got pregnant. Take note that the girl from omegle also have fake accounts when I asked her about it she said ""for some private reasons"" and so on. It was weird, it should have been a call that she was crazy.

(6) I called a good friend of mine, of course crying... considering suicide... and he told me to calm down and that I need to face the consequences of my actions. And just when I was talking with him a text message got to my phone and told me ""Alan"" which is my first name. I replied I know what happened ""kate"" (the girl from omegle) I understand now lets talk. And then the texter bursted saying ""ITS HER COUSIN YOU JERK etc. etc.""

(7) I told her and texted Kate's number that I am willing to take care of the baby etc. and she said she will ask kate about it. Later this morning kate told me that she doesnt want to see me which I understand and isn't willing to get tests with me.

ALRIGHT, HERE ARE SOME FACTORS THAT DON'T ADD UP.. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY:

* Her cousin who sent me an sms told me that ""I am the only one who knows about this"" but when she pm'd my girlfriend she has SCREENSHOTS OF VIBER MESSAGES, TEXT MESSAGES coming from the phone of Kate which doesn't add up because she said ""Kate doesn't know about this"" but how can she get screenshots of Kate's phones if she doesn't know about it?

* When I told them that I am willing to take care and share the burden and told them I need some tests first, Kate doesn't want to because she said ""its useless"" whilst her cousin told me ""I will go with kate's decision"". So I can't prove if shes again making it up or its true.

*Their sms time doesn't add up. Whenever kate isn't replying, her cousin is replying... and vice-versa. They also again both used fake accounts with the same ""workplace"" etc. and also it weirds me out that the first text message coming from her so called ""cousin"" is Alan which is again, my first name. Then when I said I know what happened.. I understand etc. etc. I told her to calm down kate her next reply is ""THIS IS NOT KATE THIS IS HER COUSIN"".. Just asking someone here.. if you are really angry at me or someone because of this matter... normally you won't send a first text message of ""Alan"" but rather blatantly shout ""FUCK YOU ETC. ETC."" Right? it is weird... given her nature of threatening me... going crazy.. being possessive.. I don't know I'm skeptic about the baby. Also it has just been 3 weeks and 2 days ever since we had sex.

I AM MEETING MY GIRLFRIEND 4 hours from now to tell her everything. I KNOW I HAVE TO MAN UP AND ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES... I am sorry about this.. I am really sorry. I love her so much... I've got one mistake and I don't know what to do... I will tell her everything..

100,"Disclaimer: Very long post!!!! In August, I was hired to complete a trial for a customer service/sales role. I had 5 days to make 7 sales but was absolutely rubbish and hit the target. Even though I was only there for a week, I was meant to get paid. I signed a contract stating the hourly rate and the fact that I should be paid, so I thought everything would be fine. I worked 32 hours that week so even after I realised I wasn’t going to make the target, I still wanted stick it out to complete the full trial and get paid. However, a week after leaving I got an email saying I had given the company the wrong bank details and they were unable to pay me at that moment and would be paid two weeks later as they pay fortnightly. I gave them the correct details and waited another two weeks, yet still received nothing. So I emailed them a second time asking if I had given them the wrong details for a second time or if anything was going on. They emailed me back saying they would contact the payroll people and get back to me. About a week later I got my payslip emailed to me and assumed I would be paid the next pay day. As you probably expected, I received no pay. So today I emailed the accountant for the company who is in a different country to me (I otherwise would have called) and she said the company had tried to pay me but it had bounced back. She then asked me to look at the details and see if everything was correct. I looked and saw my bank details were not, there had been two extra zeros added on. So once again I sent the correct details in and thought that I had finally fixed everything. But the accountant sent me back an email saying that when she types my bank details in the system adds the zeros because there is a certain amount of numbers they need to add in. I have yet to reply because I am unsure on what to say/do. I’m not sure if there really is something wrong with my bank account and details or if they are just trying to avoid paying me. I find it all quite suspicious, especially after the accountant said they had tried to pay me but it bounced back but they only informed me of this once I asked. Should I talk to my bank about this? Could this maybe mean there is something wrong with my bank details? Or is the company just trying to avoid paying me? Any advise or help would be incredibly helpful and super appreciated.

102,"So this is incredibly embarrassing even to write, but I'm willing to endure the fat insults if I can find good advice. My family and I have been talking about going to our local theme park all summer, and we're finally going this Sunday. I was totally excited to go, as it's been years since I've gone. That is until now. It just occurred to me that recently I've gained a tonne of weight and I'm probably too fat to ride on a lot of the roller coasters. The theme park website states that people over a certain waist size (which I exceed) won't be able to fit in a good portion of the rides. I feel completely ashamed and depressed about just how fat I've gotten, and I obviously can't lose the weight in time.

The thought of going now just seems completely anxiety inducing, and I don't want to go anymore. I don't think I could handle getting kicked off of rides because of my size all day and having to do the walk of shame in front of hundreds of people. 

However my mom and sister have been talking about it all week, and are super excited. I know they'll be really upset if I bail now, and might end up not going if I don't. 

I just feel too ashamed to face them and tell them that I may be too fat to ride, and wouldn't be sure how I would explain if I went why I was passing on a lot of the rides after spending weeks hyping them up. 

I injured my back at the gym last week, and although I'm feeling mostly better, I've considered telling them that my back is still in too much pain to go. Or with midterms coming up, that I really need the day to study. 

I guess the only good thing to come from this is a real wakeup call to lose weight. Otherwise, I don't know what to do or how to approach my family about this. What should I do?",06Oct2017,1
105,"This happened a few days ago and I really don't know what to do. My good friend of almost 6 years left our clique's message group all of a sudden. Thinking it was an accident, I messaged him privately asking him about it. He replied with ""Yes. Please don’t add me back in or ask me why I left. Sorry."". Thinking that it was probably due to some family matters like the passing of someone close to him, I didn't question him much and wanted to give him some space.

The weird part comes now as we found out later that he has deleted every single friend he has on Facebook and everyone he knows has been removed from his social media account like instagram etc. The only people that are still friends with him is his girlfriend and her family members. He met this girlfriend of his online and they have been dating for around 2 months. I have never really met or talked to her so I don't know what her personality is like, but I doubt that there is a fight going on between them that could lead to this. He then changed the cover photo of his Facebook from our group photo to one with him and his girlfriend. 

It was from this point on that I started to doubt the theory of someone being deceased in his family. In my opinion, he isn't the type of person who would cut our friendship off just like that. Countless of wild theorys about him being threatened by his girlfriend went through our minds but it just seems too crazy. Me and my other friends have been wondering if we should make a trip to visit him or if we should just let him cool down for a while. I'm afraid that by visiting him, he might hate us even more. I don't want to lose a friend but I have already prepared myself in the event that he really wants nothing to do with us. Could use some advice and what I should do now. Thanks.

Edit: Thanks for the advice guys, we shall give him more time and see what happens.",06Oct2017,11

109,"I’m going to keep this brief as possible so I don’t overwhelm any readers. TLDR at the bottom.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for a while and love her to bits. I’m friends with her family members too. However, lately they’ve been really horrible to her to the point where I feel it is taking a toll on her emotionally. They aren’t abusive, but do bicker with her, call her names and generally undermine her self confidence. 

She’s grown a thick skin over the years to help her deal with her family, but it still hurts me to know she’s having to put up with this. She’s honestly such a kind and helpful person, who does so much around the house for her family yet gets taken for granted. Cinderella comes to mind. 

What complicates things further is that I am a family friend. I feel like I should speak out but at the same time, I’ve made mistakes with her in the past and so feel like that would be used against me if I ask them to treat her better.

What should I do?

111,"so today I gave my two weeks notice to my employer, he said that they usually just pay the person the two weeks work instead of having them come in for the next two weeks, but I (not thinking) said ""i'd be happy to work for the two weeks"" anyway now i'm not sure whether or not I should ask on monday (it's a monday to friday job, it's friday where I am) if we could go back to what he originally offered or maybe extend the notice to a month, do the two weeks work and then get the two weeks of not work.

also I feel as though there's somewhat of an internal conflict for myself.  If i work the two weeks it will leave a good impression on the boss, if I ask to revoke it then i'll still get paid and have an extra 8 hours a day I can put towards my personal goals such as fireproofing the house and so forth but don't leave as good of an impression which will affect my future employment, and if I ask for the third option I get both but it might not come out well when I ask and it might mess up a good parting with him that I otherwise would have had.

113,"Hello! I am currently looking for a new job, preferably in the same industry. The industry I work in is fairly small, and most companies know each other. The only reason I am trying to leave my current job is mainly because there is no more room for growth, no pay raise, and no benefits - as well as nepotism in the workplace. 

The company I want to apply for is located in the same town, and my current boss knows the owner of the other company fairly well because we sell product to them. I don’t even know if I would be hired there but I want to apply to see if I had the chance. The only thing stopping me is that I’m afraid that the other company will contact my current boss once he sees my application. As much as I want to change companies, I also don’t want to jeopardize my income for the time being as well as creating awkwardness with my boss. I drafted out my cover letter and wrote that I am submitting my resume in confidence in hopes at whoever is reviewing my resume will not call my current employer. But should I even try applying there or should I look into a different industry?

Thank you!",06Oct2017,1
116,"So i met a girl in school about 2 weeks ago or so. She has a relationship, but we just hit it off as friends, since she travels 2 hours from home to school and then 2 hours back again, she asked me if she could stay with me sometimes to sleep. I was like 'sure', so we hung around together, had a lot of fun etc, when we had to sleep i did ask her if it was ok to lay next to her or if she wanted me to lay on the ground, she said it was ok, i tried not touching her (only when she was asleep she kinda held me on my shoulders), but nothing else happened, she slept twice at my place and nothing happened. But yesterday, she said that when she is gonna turn 18 in a month (i just turned 21), she is gonna move out of the country, with her boyfriend and his parents and she is gonna stay there.

When she told me that, it felt like all the happiness and energy that i had was sucked out of me, im not sure if i saw her as a friend or if i started to develop feelings for her, but it really caught me off guard and hurt like fuck. I dont have a lot of friends, and definitely not like her, so knowing that she will already leave really soon really sucks and im not sure what the best way to deal with this is.

PS: Her boyfriend also knows that she slept with me since they were talking on the phone etc and he was fine with it, but again, we didn't do anything at all.

Any advice on how to deal with it?

117,"Hi, my girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half now. We've had our ups and downs but usually work through it. We argue quite a bit to be honest. We claim to be honest with each other about everything. And I can confidently say 99% of the time I am. And that 1% is something so insignificant I probably should just be honest about it and there wouldn't be a problem. However, my girlfriend has told me time after time that she doesn't have feelings for a certain ex from about 4 years ago. Tonight, I saw in her phone she told her friend that she has JUST deleted playlists dedicated to this person, and that she finally feels ""nothing"" for him. So, this piles on everything else she has lied to me about or been a hypocrite about. Like being friends with exes, it's okay for her but not me?

120,"Last weekend I had like a ""test-day"" at a cafe near where I live and I was to be paid for my time there despite that it was just a test day. In total I spent 4.5 hours there, from 10a.m to 2:30p.m and I was to earn $7.5 per hour, so in total, I was due $33.75 for this test day. However, the money was transferred to my account this morning and I was paid $22.50. 

Now, that missing $11.25 is not the end of the world, but I feel that I did a job and I was told beforehand I was gonna be paid for it so I do feel that I am owed that payment in full. However, this was just a ""test-day"" and the cafe are testing a bunch of applicants this week and I fear that if I send an email asking for the remainder, my potential boss would see me as a stingy person who is only doing this for the money and that isn't really the message I wanna send especially since at this point I'm being considered for the job and I don't actually have it. I do feel that I should say something as my guess is that my boss just did a miscalculation and probably thought that I was only there for 3 hours instead of 4.5.

121,"Hi everyone.

Lets just get right to it. I'm 17 years old, turning 18 in about a month. I am currently going through my first year of the International Baccalaureate, focusing on science and mathematics. I do boxing 6 times a week and have a match coming up next Friday. I meditate every morning for a minimum of 10 minutes, as well as meditate for approximately 10 minutes before bed. I take cold showers every day. 

Problem: I constantly fucking think. I'm not sure how to describe it better. The odd thing is that, if you asked me ""What are you thinking about right now?"" I could only answer something like ""everything""- I feel a constant sense of existential doubt about everything I do.

I do well in school. I'm in shape. I eat right. But none of it makes this fucking, fucking, fucking feeling go away. Sometimes its strong, other times its not, but its been here for years, to a larger or lesser degree. I have writings from the summer of 2016, where I describe basically the same state of mind that I have now.

I have boxed 3 boxing matches, for instance, and even then this constant feeling of... thinking, of a lack, of existential fucking dread looms in the background like an unyielding cancer.

I've looked at articles telling you to eat right, to get some exercise, to organize your stuff, to meditate. I did that. Fucking nothing.

I don't want to box, I don't want to school, I just want to grab a backpack and run far, far away.(I'm not going to. Not a smart move.)

Does anyone have any ideas as to what I could do? This... feeling? habit of overthinking? is pervasive, affecting not only my quality of life but my performance as well.

122,"TLDR: should I help my entitled, lazy, douchebag brother with one more thing before cutting him off for good?

Now this is a very long story, but I'll try to keep it reasonably simple. My younger brother and I grew up in the same rough conditions raised by a single mother. I worked hard to do something with my life and graduate, meanwhile, my brother just bummed off of my mom and never did anything, not even graduating high school because she enabled him. Mind you, he is a grown man.

He holds a lot of resentment for how he, my mom and I were treated when we were younger, however I decided to let go of it and just use it as fuel to improve my life. He thinks he knows it all and never listens to anyone's advice in spite of him not having any life experience. He is very disrespectful and my mom, who is batshit crazy herself, only ever makes excuses for him saying he was hurt as a child I'm like

 ""how long are you going to use this as an excuse? He isn't a child... Not anymore.""

I have tried to help him for a long time to get his life together whether it was going to school or making a resume however, each time we've started with something he never finishes it.

Cutting to the chase, the other day he told me he needed me to help him with a resume. Reason being, my cousin told him he's going to start a sales company and that my brother must have sales experience in order to work with them. So my brother wants to apply to a sales job.

I've been so very busy with a wedding and since my job revolves around school I have been SUPER busy with work as well.

He's been pestering me to help him out with the resume I haven't had time but the other day I sacrificed hanging out with my wife and watching a show so I can help him, I told him to create an email address that was professional because his other email address was not professional. Mind you, I told him to do this many years ago but he just never listened to me.

We took like half an hour trying to get an email address for him alone because his first and last name were taken. I spent the rest of the time compiling his very limited job history and looking up the job descriptions to put for him. I told him since I was so exhausted and had so much work to do, I would start with the resume now and edit it later. The next day he calls me and tells me that he needs to apply for the job soon. I planned on working on it during the weekend because I have so much to do, he tells me how dire it is. I get mad and tell him that this was a last-minute thing I can't always stop what I'm doing for him because he's put me in that position many times in the past, and it is exhausting. Then he gets mad and goes off on me. I tell him he should have had his resume ready for years and that I spent a lot of time helping him he needs to stop pressuring people because that is always what makes people not want to help him.

He tells me I want to feel powerful by always giving him ultimatums and that is the reason I told him he must create an email address before I can help him. 

I called him a fool and told him creating the email address was to help him, as I get no reward out of him having a professional email.

He recalls the time that I was going to loan him money but ask for it back because he was being a disrespectful asshole. And tells me I can't do a favor without power tripping. Then he starts insulting me.

I blocked him and I don't think I will ever unblock him because despite his age his growth is retarded and he will never make it mentally past the stage of a child. However, I am wondering if I should do him this one last thing and complete the resume before cutting him off for good or if I should just say ""fuck him"" and not finish the resume.

Because he shows no signs of maturity, he doesn't respect anyone, and likely never will, and I'm frankly tired of this.",06Oct2017,0
124,"I had a complicated childhood, and I'm trying to go through it continuously to sort of what issues have propagated into the current issues that I have today. Also, keeping it chill, I don't want to overemphasize any problem, be it when I was younger or now. I can roll with the punches and take responsibility. That being said, I'm willing to look at any problem at all, even a minor one.

For clarification, my ""not having a mom"" scenario doesn't fit most other scenarios, so reading articles on typical experiences is only *sort of* helpful. My mom didn't abandon me. She wasn't unloving, mean, or anything. She was actually a truly incredible woman who was unlucky to get cancer. (This was when I was 8). Prior to this, nearly my entire life was a mix of custody battles, half and half parenting, and some allegations that my dad was abusive (this was too young for me to rememeber now). After my mom passing, I didn't fall back into a cozy family. I lived in a group home, foster homes, and then finally with an alcoholic father whose psychological problems I couldn't even accurately describe. With strict rules and a rural residence, I was put into a box even more. I mostly had to raise myself and received very little guidance from my father. I was also isolated from my more loving family until I left the home at 18. Probably what kept me sane was playing sports constantly and doing Boy Scouts.

One of the things that just occurred to me is that lacking a mom (which I did from 8 to 18, and I rejected all of my friends' moms who tried being mother figures to replace what I lost) is that I may lack some ability to empathize with women. Everyone says having relationship issues as an adult can be a symptom of growing up without a mom, but they don't say why. Are there many reasons, or does empathy summarize that?

It's not without trying that I've failed to ever have a long-term relationship. I get the feeling that girls fail to empathize with me early on in the relationship and never stick around to learn to like me. I say that because I can have good relationships with men and my family, so I'm not a complete asshole.

So if I can't empathize with the woman, I communicate something to my mistaken image of that woman. That woman takes my message to the mistaken image of her (not knowing I've made a mistake), develops a mistaken image of me, and sends a message back to that image (rather than the true me). It seems like, almost invariably, this loop swallows everything up, and it's over. I'm usually ghosted or close to it. But then again, isn't everyone in the age of smartphones?

A few months ago, this thought of mistaken communication was already brewing in my mind, and I just chalked it up to the difficulties of dating. But now, I'm wondering how much of it is *me*. How much of it is my fault?

If the mistaken communication thing is real and accurate, then why does it occur with dating but not as much with other friends that I make? Is it simply because in dating, you have to get to know someone as quickly as possible (so you can either advance the relationship towards the end goal or quit and look for someone else), whereas normally you just get to know someone at whatever speed you want to get to know them? That makes a lot of sense to me. However, I don't know what I could even do about it. I don't think I can mention it. I don't think it's a buzzkill, but I can't help but think other people would view it that way.

132,"Alright, so here goes.

The guy next door inherited his father's home when he passed. He's renovating the house. When he first came around, he heard I worked the night shift, and said ""I'll be renovating the house during the day, you'll have to deal with it,"" but didn't generally seem like a bad guy.

These renovations have been going on daily for the past ten months or more. Every few weeks I guess he decides he didn't like something, they tear it down, and start again. The past few months, with the exception of one day a week have been sleepless as they start 7am.

The bigger issue is the subcontractors. They come unprepared. At least twice a week, one comes knocking on my door ""can we run an extension cord, our generator (conveniently) won't start,"" or ""can we fill some buckets from your hose so we can work?""

When the generator does work, it's running 7am to around 3pm (except when needing refueling) even if they're not working. They eat lunch with it running.

Trying to be a good neighbor, I run the cord or fill their bucket. I know, naive, but hoping being cooperative when it's my turn to do work he'll leave me (my experience in life being tells me he'll f*** me first chance he gets, I'm hoping different, and don't want to give him any reason for retaliation by denying the workers and holding up his work).

Now I'm getting a little annoyed. Once or twice a week, they're doing work now at my cost. Last time I was reluctant and the contractor's worker said ""what's your problem? It's just water.""

One subcontractor said he'd leave his card when he found one, and give me a break (yeah right) if I needed work. He of course disappeared without leaving it.

The guy still lives in his old home, as this one is uninhabitable pretty much while they work. So, I never see him. I really want to address this issue with him, but if *I ever get to say anything, it will be after it is all done, and he moves in*.

Is it possible to say anything to this guy at that point, without looking petty, or an ass? To be honest, I'm unsure of how I would feel if someone approached me likewise. This is getting excessive, and to be honest, starting piss me off. 

Edit (added from a reply): My main interest in my post was to discover if it was possible or advisable to say something to this guy later.

133,"So this story is kind of a long one, but you might need to know all the details to understand. Wish I didn’t have to come to reddit for this, but I have no idea what to do anymore and I’m confident someone can help me with this.

So I lived in Michigan from the time I was born to when I was in fifth grade. During that time, my parents divorced when I was young and we lived with our grandparents on my Dad’s side. Had a normal childhood, but in fifth grade, my father met someone in Vegas, and they ended up getting married, so I knew I was going to move out there with him by the end of the year. Needless to say, I was super sad, and decided I needed to “live it up” until I moved, even though I was just fifth grader. I ended up getting a “girlfriend” who is the girl previously mentioned. We were both way too young and stupid to understand what a relationship was, but we treated it as a serious thing. We texted, never went on dates, and then I moved to Vegas, and didn’t text her for three months because we had no WiFi at the new house. When we did get WiFi, I got a text from her saying she wanted to break up. Little old sixth grade me was crushed but I got over it quick. We had a few bouts during the time I lived in Vegas, but nothing too bad, and the only thing I think that’s importance is that she once faked her name to not reveal I was talking to her once (and I found out it was her when my friends told me). During ninth grade (last year) I got abused a lot, so I took action and moved back to Michigan with my grandparents (3 months ago) and now I’m a sophomore in high school.

Ok, end of backstory.

So on the first day of school, I walked into my 1 period (Japanese 1), and lo and behold, my “ex” walks in to the class and sits down at the table next to me. At first she had no idea it was me, but I knew exactly who she was. Needless to say, it was super fucking awkward when she figured out who i was and we were both super embarrassed to be that close to each other. The class ended pretty fast, and we both just got the hell out of there.

Fast forward two days, and I was sitting at my desk playing csgo, and I get a dm from some random girl on Instagram saying “do you know (something Korean)”? And I ask if it was an ad for a meme page, and she says no, but we keep joking about memes the rest of the night. It was kind of fun to talk with a random stranger about stupid stuff that shouldn’t be funny to us but is. 

Fast forward again to the next day and I’m in a group chat with the same person and one of her friends (they’re both cringy Kpop fan accounts (that’s important)) and they send some stupid meme of a guy from some lame Kpop band, so I say, “Nice Kpop meme” and I don’t get a response for the rest of the hour (first period). As the class ends, we’re walking out, and my ex walks out he same time as me. I’m trying to speed up, and so is she so we just end up walking together. When she has to turn to the next hallway however, I hear her say “Nice Kpop meme” really loudly and bolt off. At first I thought it was just a voice in my head and I brushed it off as such (took me about a week to realize it was her).

Fast forward again, and we’re talking in that weird group chat again, and I mention that my Japanese class is super weird because of one reason. All of a sudden, the account that first dm’d me started freaking out like “WHY IS YOUR CLASS SUPER AWKWARD?” And I was about to tell her, but something told me to check out her account (I hadn’t already). There was a link to one of those stupid Sarahara things, and I clicked on it, and it was my ex’s name and photo on the account. I freaked the fuck out. I had been talking to my ex this whole time and she was using a fake account, and the other person is probably in on it too.
So she kept pestering me about why it was weird and I kept saying that it didn’t matter, but after a while they got impatient. So I decided to them after a while because I realized that this was a chance to tell her exactly how I felt about everything, and how I felt we she faked her name when I tried to talk to her (a year prior to this). During me telling them, she kept saying (referring to herself) “What a bitch, I can’t believe someone did this.” I took this as a sign that she was sorry for everything, and that’s why she wanted to talk to me but didn’t want to do it face to face. After I was done telling them the story, they immediately said, “you should talk to her sometime, I’m sure she’ll want to talk about this too”. Another sign she wanted to talk.

Fast forward yet again, and me and my ex are walking home from school talking about everything that happened, and how we were terrible at love, and reminiscing about the past years of our lives. It was really a good time and I was happy that things weren’t awkward. We slowly started talking more (with her actual number) and the group chat she created to fake me out slowly faded out.

After about a week of talking, we decided to meet up at this fair our city was doing and hang out there. We are both terrified of heights, but we decided to go on the Ferris wheel at about 8:00 at night. She got super scared and clung on to me (which was a huge shock) and we were screaming because we were terrified but in a funny way (if that makes any sense). Then we started talking some more and getting really deep into stuff, and we kept talking about how stupid we were with each other and how we never should have dated because it ruined our friendship and all that jazz.

After that roller coaster (see what I did there?) we talked again and arranged a movie night for the next week. The entire week in Japanese, we kept talking about how excited we were for it and what movies we were gonna watch (The Room, and The Lazarus Effect if you wanted to know). So when the day finally came, she came over to my house (no one was going to be there for the next two days) and we spent the entire time holding on to each other on my couch cracking jokes and being each other’s comfort. We talked about homecoming (which is tomorrow) and we said hat we would go together in a group so we wouldn’t both feel left out at the dance. At one point, we both became too comfortable and lazy to get up from our positions, so we spent the next four hours talking and joking around while “cuddling” (the best word for this I guess). She eventually asked if she could spend the night, and I said as long as it was ok with her parents. It wasn’t, so I ended up walking her home at 11:00 at night. One of the best nights of my life.

But now here we come to the advice part. That was two weeks ago exactly. I’ve been trying to text her and the only response I’ve received was a “Yeah” on a Monday when I asked if she didn’t come to school because she was sick. I’ve tried to arrange more times for us to just chill and hang out again, but nothing. And now homecoming is tomorrow and things have been really awkward between us and I don’t know what went wrong or if I messed up somehow, I at least just kind of want an explanation. Should I approach her and just ask what’s going on, or just assume that the relationship’s dead. I still don’t understand why she made such a huge effort to talk to me and just suddenly blow me off like I’m some sort of hassle to her. I just need some advice 

Sorry for the really long story, I just needed to get his off my chest and ask someone what to do.

134,"**Story:** I am volunteering/interning at a suicide hotline to graduate. Part of my job description is to call and receive calls from people that have issues coming into and out of their homes. 
The rules of the organization stipulate that we do not give out our real names. Instead, we have phone names for privacy considerations. 

I haven't spoken to my boss for six weeks after I graduated the training necessary to work on the line. On this day, though, she was training a new person to work and showing them the phone room. I got a call from a client and we chatted a while. She said that a member of our organization came over and worked with her for a little while on some things. At this, I was confused because we do not typically have people from our organization go out to help people on the other line.

She told me the first name of the person, which was the name of one of our employees, but with an extra ""D"" in the name. Confused, I repeated the name of the employee with the extra D and the client corrected me. 

When I got off of the phone, my ""boss"" quite literally yelled and berated me for about five minutes in front of the new worker and another, more senior worker in the room. This was the first managerial interaction I've had with her in my six week tenure at this organization.  She was so loud, though, that she could be heard down the hallway by other employees. 

I know I screwed up, but there are case workers that work for our organization. I told my boss how the mistake was made, and she wasn't having it. She then left the room a short while later. 

After I calmed down a little bit, I went to go speak to her in her office. I asked her to ""Please do that in private from now on."" She said it was a learning opportunity for other workers, so she reserves the right to do that from that point on. 

I was furious, and I felt tears coming to my eyes. I was just publically humiliated for an honest mistake, and my boss was not even remotely conciliatory. I'm a grown man, so this is exceptionally embarrassing. Only my boss saw it, though. 

My boss said I was ""taking information as personal criticism."" It is hard not to do that when you're being yelled at in front of other people. When I say ""yell"" I mean she was raising her voice with aggressive intonation and aggressive body language. She was also parroting my responses back as screeches that the whole area could hear. 

**Problem:** I have to continue in this position to graduate. I have a 4.0 and I'm not going to jeopardize all of my hard work because of this horrible person. I only have to stomach it for another two months, even though the organization I'm working for wants me to volunteer for a year. I'm not going to do that after being treated this way, though. I'm furious, and I don't know how to handle myself and all of my shame in this place in the future. The other employees are nice, but this woman is the most miserable sack of shit alive. I don't know how to handle her; especially after she has reduced me to crying in front of her.  I am not exceptionally prideful, but this is unbearable. How should I proceed, especially when I occasionally have to deal with her?

**Resources available to me:** I have a professor in charge of the class I'm taking. I'm trying to get her to give me a recommendation to grad school so I don't want to stir up unnecessary problems for her. 

The boss that yelled at me in front of everyone has a boss in charge of her that I suspect doesn't like her very much. 

**My thought is this:** I am going to quit when I get the opportunity to do so. I am then going to write the executive director and tell her about the incident, citing that this person is the reason why this organization has a hard time keeping volunteers, aside from the nature of the work. Is that too vindictive? 

**TL;DR:** I volunteer/intern at a suicide hotline so I can graduate from my program. I made a pretty egregious but honest mistake in front of my boss, who I rarely see. She is in charge of 50% of my grade for the class I'm taking. My boss took that opportunity to berate me and yell at me in front of other workers for about five minutes after that call. I then cried in front of my boss in her office when she said that the incident should be looked at as a ""learning opportunity"". I am unsure as to how I should proceed. ",06Oct2017,1
136,"Tl:dr I am constantly being making fun of some of my acquaintances and friends. What do I do to stop them? Thanks in advance 

Hi. I'm 21 yrs old of age and I would consider myself being bullied from a day to day basis. Not the rough bullying that you may think of, just being made fun of in front of other people, i.e. in front of friends, or class (like this day where the whole class clapped just because I stepped in front to start my presentation, happened 2 times today, which I did nothing about, I just wore my poker face the whole time) sometimes in my our group chat, sometimes in our online video games pretty much anywhere. It's just minimum banter for laugh, I get it but sometimes, you know, it really gets to me.

And I hate being made fun of in front of a lot of people, it makes me very uncomfortable since I consider myself an introvert, sure I maybe considered a funny guy but still, I hate it. The people who make fun of me, they're nice guys when no one else are around. I get to talk to them in a decent manner. I actually get along them pretty good. But whenever someone comes up and kind of join us, or they just feel like it, they just make me their comedy material, I hate it. I consider myself a pretty smart guy, I'm tall, good looking enough, but what they I exploit is probably my patience. I am a very patient guy, I always just say to myself I'm better than all of these guys, I'm smarter, better looking, I love things that matter unlike (which btw I can't talk to anyone to in real life) these fuckers who laugh at the most trivial things and like making fun of people. There was that one time when it really reached me, like this classmate just kept making fun of me in front of the whole class so I told him ""That's okay, I've observed that people who like bullying me are intellectually inferior."" so he shut the effed up the remainder of the class, but i kinda felt sorry so i texted him hours after saying sorry that that was just my defense mechanism kicking in and shit like that. Now there's a new classmate that keeps in making fun of me. I don't know how to react. Even my closest friends sometimes gets to me every now and then. Most of the time I just stay in silence. I always say to myself that if I retaliate, things would just get bigger and maybe get out of hand and I don't want that, so I let them get off. I think that they feel like that they can make fun of me, bully me and get away with it without a hiccup because I really rarely get angry.

So the I'm asking for an advice of how I should handle myself whenever I'm in that situation, how I should react. Should I just stay in silence, put my earphones on, and say to myself ""Ignorance is bliss""? Or think of something smart and retaliate again. I don't know. What should I do? I'm constantly torn to thinking between ""I don't give a flying fuck of what others think of me bc I think I'm better than them"" and ""Is this really how they think of me? What should I do to make them think otherwise?"" I'm like that confident but insecure kind of guy, but that's just inside of my head. That's it for now, hope someone actually responds.

Thanks in advance",06Oct2017,4

138,"I was a first semester freshman in my first month of school when I was told that suspension was on the table for 4 school issued alcohol charges that I received in a misunderstanding where I even passed sobriety test. Because my parents believed having a suspension would make it impossible to get into different schools they told me to withdraw before the case was resolved. I am now looking to start at a new college in the spring semester but most colleges will not even let me apply. I have been really depressed and stressed over the situation because I feel like I am in the worst possible position. My high school GPA is 3.8, 1470 SAT, and three sport athlete. I really appreciate any help you could provide for the following questions or just general advice:

Do you know where I could find schools that will let me apply in this position? I have 17 attempted credit hours but all W's on my transcript.

On one of the applications it asks if, ""there an unresolved or pending disciplinary matter at a prior institution"". Based on my situation would I have to answer yes? Also does the admissions office have a way of finding out?

Do you think I will have a chance to attend any university with my situation?

If college asks about why I took a gap is it best to be honest?

I still have the opportunity to fight the charges but because of preponderance of evidence I am scared that they will suspend me. Is it better to have the withdraw or a suspension on my record?

If you have gone through a similar experience please let me know because I feel like its just me that has gone through this and I have been very depressed about it.

I really appreciate any possible input you could give because I currently have no guidance and everyone has given up on me. I really am not a bad person and I just need help finding a path. Thank you very much for your time.",06Oct2017,3

143,So I have this “friend” who isn’t a very good friend and I want to end things with her. All I am to her is a therapist basically and when I’m having issues which I often do she is terrible about listening. She has little interest in listening to what I’m passionate about and we have very little similarities. For example I’m an environmental studies major and I kindly told her I have a recycling bin next to the trash can and she put all of her recyclables in the trash. A few days ago it was my birthday and she texted me about things going on in her life and never wished me happy birthday despite seeing me post things for my birthday on social media. I don’t really want to be friends anymore because I’m tired of the one sided conversations and that we share zero interests. I don’t really want a dramatic falling out so next time she texts me should I just ignore it? I don’t want to be immature about it but I know if I mention anything about this she will get catty about it as she commonly does with other things and I don’t feel like dealing with it. ,06Oct2017,3

It’s a bath and body type shop so we make all the soap and lotions and what not. Only a few people work there and I am one of the main cooks, along with the owner. 

I love interacting with customers and helping them find good smelly stuff and it’s an all around really enjoyable place to work.  I do suffer from depression and anxiety and working here a lot has really helped me with that, especially being the main person that makes the product because it makes me feel like I actually have some sort of purpose.  

Today I was talking with the owner and she was letting me know that she has had employees say that I can be mean or rude. And even some customers and I am genuinely.. confused ? I would never intentionally be rude to a customer or another employee. It’s so hard to be mad at this job because everything is so relaxing and I love everything about it. I don’t know how to fix this because I don’t know where I am going wrong . I don’t know when I come off as rude and it’s making me rethink everything about how I am and how I act towards people.

147,"I work at a daycare that offers night shift because I lot of the parents work at the hospital across the street. My shift is 3:30pm to 11:30pm. I was all alone with ten kids, two of which were 7 months old and 7 weeks old. The ratio in PA is one teacher/aide per four kids and is going down to one per three children. I was hired as an aide, and there was no teacher. I was watching ten kids by myself, and a child asked to go to the bathroom. I was outside of the bathroom and was talking to another child when she got into the soap and started playing with the water. When I noticed I struggled with her while holding a 7 week old baby. I was supposed to have another aide with me, but since she's the owners sister she does whatever she wants and was walking around the building completely ignoring the chaos coming from my classroom. When she saw that I was struggling with the child in the bathroom, she didn't help but instead told on me to the owner. The owner screamed at me the next day in front of parents over something that was really not my fault. If she would have had a meeting with me and got my side of the story I wouldn't be as upset. 

When there is a new child, parents are supposed to send a list of how they want their food prepared, served, ect. The parent of the 7 week old never did that. She had the bottles already made, and if there was no bottles I wasn't the one making them. All I had to do was feed and burp the baby and put her to sleep. My coworkers apparently didn't think to warm her milk. I always ALWAYS check my formula before I put it anywhere near a babied mouth. Since it was room tempature, when I checked it on my wrist I didn't feel anything which is how you check. The owner found out that they weren't warming her bottle and yelled at me, when all I was doing was feeding her. I had no part in the making of the bottle. She didn't ask for my side of the story, but she berated me and screamed at me in front of a parent for something I had no part of. She told the parent I was feeding the baby ice cold water which was not true at all..

Then after being berated, I was obviously upset. I was holding a screaming baby, while a 3 year old was climbing all over me, trying to steal my phone and trying to grab the baby. I'm struggling to put the 3 year old in time out for striking out and not listening while holding an infant. My coworker did not get up to help, didn't reprimand the child at all but sat there and watched as I struggled. I ended up bawling my eyes out because I was so stressed, so my coworker left the room. She left while I had 8 children, one screaming and the other hitting and kicking me. My coworker walked around the building on her phone, not a care in the world. I can't say anything to the owner because my coworker is her sister. 

Another coworker started screaming, red faced, at a child. Over all, it's a very hostile work environment that isn't a safe place for children. I am currently looking for a new job and I have an interview next week. Should I report this child center right now or after I get a new job? Should I report them at all?

155,"I just want a bit of advice on what to do. Going to be a slightly long post. 

TL;DR
He was a best friend, but I got uncomfortable and wanted to stop being friends. But he just called me over 30 times after not speaking to me for 3 months. I did not pick up. 


I was friends with a guy for almost 8 years. He became a Best Friend, talked about a lot of things, common interests. I did have a huge crush on him and was a little obsessed (like asking him to be my BF) but he never acted on it and just let it pass. 

Due to this obsession, I did many things for him. Many errands for him. During the course of middle/high school, I helped him to purchase items he needed, then delivered it to his doorstep, never seeing his face. He asks me to follow him out, but he never tells me where or what we are doing. I prioritise him over my friends, ditching my friends when he texts to meet me. 

I don't know anything about his friends, or family, or what he's studying, what are his future plans, or anything. Because he did not want to say anything. He said he would feel vulnerable if he says such things. I did not really pay attention during that time. I liked him, right? 

I stalked his social media to find out what course he's in. I talked to his friends to find out how he's doing. 
I tell him about myself. My troubles, my family, my happiness. Everything. 

6 years ago, he ignored me for more than a month. I did not do anything at all, I just texted a message everyday. One day, he replied and pretended nothing happened. 

4 years ago, he called me a show-off, saying hurtful things about me, my friends, my family. I retaliated saying if he didn't want to be friends anymore, then okay. He said he still wanted to be friends. 

When I graduated high school, I had a long vacation before college. My feelings for him died then, but I did treasure our friendship. However, he started to change. He complained about my long vacation and how he doesn't have one, saying things like now I have all the time for him. He became even more introverted, and just complained about his school all day. 
He finally quit school. He stays at home Everyday, expects me to meet him when I'm free. 

I entered college. He grew more frustrated because I couldn't meet him. He scolds me when I'm late. He ignores me when something doesn't go his way. He gets upset when I say no to him. 
It only got worse. 
He started to ask me to help him purchase things online. Obtained my credit card information. He insults me when I spend my money on something expensive, saying I don't know how to control my spending. He insults my appearance and my weight. He insults my friends, calling them fake. He insults my parents. 
Sure, he said he's just joking. But such things can't be jokes. 

I was annoyed. So one day, we were supposed to meet up, I told him I'm busy. And I never said anything. He didn't say anything either. It remained that way for 3-4 months. 
During that period I tried to calm down and think about the way he has treated me. And I thought, if he did not reply, we're done. 

But he replied 3-4 months later, and he was furious over text. Saying things like I didn't care enough to text for months, saying things like he's hurt that I don't care. I ignored the text. Then a week later he texted again, trying to defend himself saying he's such a poor thing and I was heartless to not say a word. I replied, saying that I was tired, I'm scared of him always lashing out at me. He insisted on meeting me which I declined fervently. 
Then when I said I wanted to break off (indirectly), he said he doesn't want to. 

So I gave him another chance. 

Everything was fine for awhile. 

Then it came back. 
The favours, the expectations of me, me having to fit him. The insults. He tried to take control of my social media to help me, but instead used it for his benefit. 

One day, he asked me to follow him out early in the morning. He did not tell me where we were going, Nor what we were doing. (sounds familiar?) 
I said okay, because I was giving him a chance, maybe it'd be okay. 

He was late for almost an hour. 
He didn't talk to me during the ride towards the location. 
Once we alighted, he just rushed off. 
And left me there. 
Alone. 
In a place I was not familiar with. 
And this is not the first time he has dragged me and left me. 

I was pissed. Who wouldn't be? Waking up early, and then left there like that? I contemplated leaving, but decided to grab breakfast first. 

He texted me 2 hours later. Telling me to wait more. 

We met again. He looked upset about something, but I was more upset about how he just ditched me there and expected me to entertain myself. 
I just sat there and used my phone. 
He told me to get a drink for him. 
I snapped. ""Can't you do it yourself?""

Then he told me to wait and walked out for awhile. God knows why I still bothered to sit there. 

We took the transport home, it was so awkward during the ride. I was pissed, and he's upset. So on the journey back, I told him I had to go elsewhere and just left. 

We didn't talk for a week. 

He texted me afterwards. Angry text. Saying things like how he was upset at something and I could've been more caring. How I'm always using my phone.
Then another text, saying I'm his only Friend, but I treated him like I didn't care. Putting him 2nd to my phone. How he was so pitiful. How he left to cry in the toilet because I didn't care. 
Saying things like how it always seems like I'm bullying him or attacking him. 

So I replied, along the lines of we're done. 
""I think we are no longer compatible for each other, we're expecting too much from each other that we cannot provide.""

A few days later, I was going out for lunch with my family, he appeared, and dragged me off to talk. 
I didn't say anything. He continued to defend himself. Saying things like how I'm so unemotional and how I didn't care about him. 
Then the (one-sided) argument turned weird. 
He said that he ignores me sometimes because if he talks to me he will keep asking favours. 
I am his only Friend, can't I just take him as a sad and depressed Friend that needs company? 
He doesn't thank me or apologise to me because he feels that it's a given, he doesn't need to. 
He made me wait that day because he wanted to feel that at least someone is waiting for him. 
He asked me to say something but cuts me when I do. 

My family cut in to stop him because he talked non stop for an hour. He still insisted to talk. My Brother told him enough is enough. I told him to just conclude and say what he wants to say. 

He said he wanted to continue being friends. 

And I said,
""I'm sorry, but I cannot do it.""

We arranged to meet the next day to return each other's items. 
But he did not appear the next day. I thought it's over. 

I changed my passwords, credit card details. Blocked him on social media. 

3 months later, today. 
Suddenly out of the blue, he called me. I only noticed after 3 missed calls. 
I asked my dad to pick up, I did not want to talk to him. 
My dad asked what's up, he said he wanted to talk to me. 
My dad said I'm busy. 
Dad asked, when will he return my items. 
2 weeks later, he said. 
Dad said, okay please come over and deliver it to my house. 
He still insisted to talk to me. My dad declined. 

Then, he continued to call non-stop for half an hour. 
Every time the call ended, it started again. I could not use my phone at all. 
35 missed calls. It stopped. And I blocked him. 

Now I'm here typing this. 

I'm scared. But not really. I don't know what to feel. 
What should I do? 
I'm afraid of him coming to confront me again. But I'm not afraid of what he's going to say. 
I am very confused about what to feel about this. 

Thank you for reading. If you need any clarifications I can answer them. 
Please give me some advice. ",06Oct2017,11
156,"I very suddenly lost one of my two cats a few days ago, most likely due to a virus she could have had since she was a kitten. (We did not know about the virus and still don't know for sure.) The illness appeared and progressed in less than a week. She was only six years old, she showed virtually no symptoms until it got really bad, and I'm heartbroken. We tried so hard to get her the help she needed, but she ended up passing away during her stay in the hospital.

But I can't stop worrying that something could suddenly go wrong with her—there's no way to prevent the virus, and the only advice the vet gave was to keep her happy and healthy. 

I've been having nightmares and not sleeping well. On top of losing my first cat so suddenly, I'm now terrified of losing the second.

I'll go to the art store and buy a really nice sketchpad, some expensive pencils, and use about 5 pages before it's demoted to the shelf and i don't look at it.

162,"A little background:
Graduated from a great college in 2008. Financial downturn made it difficult for a 3.0 student to get a job in Finance. I started working for my fathers company (Logistics) He WAS doing very well...
I mean very, lives in a 4 million dollar house, owns a Porsche and a Ferrari etc. 
In the last 3 or so years extremely key pieces of business have slowly been deteriorating. Some not any fault of ours. One manufacturing facility that we did a ton of business with moved from NJ to SC. There are other factors, but that's a large one. 

We're now operating at a much smaller yearly revenue, and we cannot sustain the overhead. We're thinking the business has about a month before all money has run out - My father has been keeping it afloat with his personal finances, and with roughly 200k of his money in the business he's scared to put any more. 

I started from the bottom, but I pretty much run the daily operation at this point. I've gotten very good at the day to day goals of a logistics company. I make a seriously competitive salary right now, and was hoping to take ownership of the entire business for the last 10 years. I believe I worked extremely hard for something that at the end of the day died due to no fault of my own. 

I'm freaked out because I will have to look for other work. However, I've grown a custom to not having to answer to anyone. I've also gotten used to a certain lifestyle. 
I also feel as though I have no specific craft, like engineering or accounting. I basically only know Trucking/Logistics.

173,"Here's the deal. A while back I found this vacansie for a Sound Engineer at a local bookstore. It's a very famous bookstore and they have events every week with a couple of hundered of visitors. Mostly interviews and readings but sometimes a band.

I figured I know the basics of audio and mixing audio so I'll apply. I got hired right away and the first two interviews were fine, I did everything perfectly. I just had to work with a couple of microphones. Nothing big.

I then found out I would have to mix a larger band that is quite famous. The band is probably in the top 20 most famous bands in the Netherlands. So last night, after taking a line of coke to get over my anxiety I mixed the band.

Long story short, I didn't fuck up much and pretty much nailed it. They complimented me and everything. After the gig we all had a drink and the lead singer, a guy that I see on talkshows every now and then and sings at huge festivals and shit, asks me ""are you interested in working with us on our new tour""?

I smile, act like he's joking but then he goes. ""We could really use a sound engineer to travel around with us and to use our own equipment. We always have issues with the local engineers and we've been looking for a good engineer for a while now.""

TLDR: A have very basic experience and got offered a high-end Sound Engineering job touring through Europe.

175,"I'm 31, male, from the United Kingdom and [currently] single.

I have one minor worry in my life and this relates more to social skills than any actual conflict. It's how to avoid being mistaken for asexual.

I am **not** asexual but if people talk about sex or anything sex-related I change the subject [I was taught years ago that it was ungentlemanly and impolite to talk about sex, at least, in public anyway].

It was only once that I was mistaken for asexual [some point around mid-2005] and I had to explain to the woman at the time who I was friends with that I wasn't asexual, just trying to be polite [she was an acquaintance I'd met through friends at university].

Am I wrong to worry about this sort of thing [(well, worry about it occasionally)] or not?

For me, I'm not a beer-swilling lout who makes crude sexual jokes, and I'm not going to change that, I've always been someone who's tried to be respectable, polite and gentlemanly.

My situation is exacerbated by the fact that I'm not actually with her, instead hundreds of miles away in a different state. My father is looking after her - and she doesn't respond particularly well to him, for some reason. She runs from him and is known to sort of disappear for a while when he's around, but he can always find her. Until today.

She wouldn't've run away if I was there. She's scared of my father and I'm not sure if he can get her back. We've put up posters and I've posted on every pet-finding website I can get my hands on. I'm just so nervous and scared and I feel like I can't do anything.

She was my first ever pet to call my own. She and I talked to one another, I would call down at her and she would chirrup back and nudge my legs. She always followed me around the house, she would go wherever I would go. I love her so much and she loves me back and fuck, guys, I'm just jumping to the worst conclusions about what could have happened to her.

Her name is Coraline, but she only usually responds to ""Cora"" or ""Kiri"". She's a short and stubby American Shorthair, a brown mackerel tabby with big green eyes and a red nose with a tiny black dot in the center. She's a little chunky, but her height makes it seem like she's more dumpy than she is. She's usually friendly and curious and alert, but right now she's probably scared and alone and painfully shy.

She's very displaced at the moment) that we can put out, but would placing her litter box outside be of any use?

184,"So here's the lowdown.

I currently dislike my job-lots of problems.  However, the benefits are great. (Bonuses, 401K match, health &amp; life insurance, extra life insurance (meaning, the company will pay my husband if I pass away a year's salary), work perks like a phone, computer, camera, etc.) I get 10 vacation, and 8 personal days currently.  It doesn't pay a huge amount $37,500. 

I received a job offer from another company. No benefits, no bonuses, just straight up salary. $55,000 in comparison. It's 8-5 job, no weekends, and less than 2% travel. I would NOT receive any perks (no laptop/phone/camera). Only 5 vacation, and 7 personal days as well, until I'd been there 3 years. 

I can not buy individual health insurance. I have looked and found 0 options where I am located. (Apparently it's been nixed in my state, and not an option-other than short term, which would NOT negate the tax penalty. Plus I wouldn't have health insurance...) I've been on the phone all day with health insurers and it's the same story across the board...short term is our only option, but that only lasts 3 months.

I am freaking out, because I have NO idea what to do. I have until Monday to let him know my decision. I'm currently sitting in my office, having a mini panic attack about this. I almost threw up earlier when the phone call came through, offering me the position.

Also-the job Im currently in is like a bad relationship, and has kind of made me feel like I'm not any good...and I'd like to think that my work (as a graphic designer) is up to par, but part of me worries that I'm hacking my way through this. I'm worried that if I take this position, that I am NOT any good and will lose my job and be S.O.L. 

EDIT-Also, I've tried talking to family about this and all they tell me is ""do what you think is best.""

TL:DR-Not sure if I take a position with higher pay and less benefits, or keep my crappier but better benefits job.

I have Japanese class and this new girl is in it. Apparently she moved from France 1 year ago. She wasn't here at the beginning of the school year, at least for Japanese class. First interaction I had with her was the first day when she asked it she could sit next to me. Once I saw her I was immediately attracted to her. I swear she's the cutest thing I've seen.

Thing is though I have social anxiety and depression so I really don't know how to start and/or continue the conversation. I sit in front of her right now. I've tried starting conversation but they don't last long at all. I've asked things like if she likes cycling or not. Asked this because the biggest cycling competition is hold in France.
Thing is though I didn't even ask her this directly, I had to ask the person next to me where she went for middle school then asked her. I don't necessarily have trouble starting a convo in class but continuing is the problem. I've seen her by herself eating lunch on a bench for a few days now. Every single time I walk past her I just want to sit down and talk to her. However my brain just gives me so much anxiety, telling me things like what are you going to say and such. 

I of course have looked at her before in class, not necessarily stares but maybe like glances. I think she notices it since she sometimes look back at me to even looking back at me. I know there's a few way to interpret this. She can be just curious or to even being creeped out. 

She doesn't have any friends here as far as I know. I've seen her texting a lot so it might be some of her friends back at France. I figured this is the best chance for me. It'd be much harder for me to talk to her if shes somewhere else or with someone.

205,"Hi all,
I could really use some advice.

A little background info:

Im 26 now, when I was 19 (moved out before that) my mum meet a new guy, got married etc.  
I love my mum and want her to be happy so I really tried to get to know this guy, but he doesn't acknowledge me or any of my siblings who had already moved out when they got together. It's so bad we're not even using familiarity when speaking, he refers to us as ""mum's"" kids not stepdaughters and we use mums husband not stepdad :(  
Over the past 7 years I can honestly say I've barely talked to him for more than 10min, aside from hello, how are you, pass me the salt etc.  
At first I figured he just didn't want to overstep any boundaries, but I've tried to reach out many times, tried to talk to him and get to know him and in general attempted to include him in my life... and nothing.  
 However he does have a funny/joking relationship with the 2 siblings who still lived at home, and he of course likes his bio kids from a previous marriage. It just the ones who had moved out who aren't included and he has even said once that he doesn't consider us family.  
Then about 2 years ago my mum called me crying, they almost split up because he'd cheated on her with several different women, they stayed together because he agreed to counseling and seemingly worked it out. A few months ago he got caught cheating again, he moved out of the house and into an apartment halfway down the block, they're still together but claims they are better not living under the same roof. 
I'm worried about mum of course, but she's an adult and it's her life, it's not my place to say if she's making a mistake. I'm just going to support her and be there for her no matter what, however I've kinda given up on ever getting to know her husband.

Now to the current problem:  
I've 6 siblings so that's a lot of Christmas presents, normally  I give to siblings + mum + boyfriend (joint gift to his sister).   
I work in ""art"" and usually make about half the gifts to cut down on costs and spend maybe 350$ on the rest.  
This year mum suggested we did a draw, we'd draw one name and give just one gift of 100$ (or more) we agreed, we can always try it one year right?  
My sister texted me that I drew mum's husband, I asked if I could redraw or switch with someone.  
I don't have a relationship with him, he has always been dismissive of me and my efforts to get to know him has been completely futile, I don't give gifts to him at all (he doesn't give us gifts either, mum doesn't even add his name on our gifts at his request) he basically have made it clear he doesn't want to be apart of our lives/doesn't consider us family.  
Now I thought it was fairly innocent and reasonable to ask for someone else, I give gifts to make them happy after all, and a younger sister offered to switch, she lived at home at the time so she's ""family"" according to him.  
Done, right?  
No, my sister now keeps bringing it up, telling me I'm being unreasonable and it's just a gift. Yes it's ""just"" a gift, that I spend time or money on in the hopes of making the receipient happy. Why would I give gifts to people who aren't family? (His words not mine)
I didn't think it was such a big deal, I tried to explain that if I'm to give only 1 gift I want it to be special and make someone I care for happy. But her criticism is never ending; petty, selfish, cheap, is just the first of many things she's said since the draw, she tells me to get over myself, but I thought I had handled it well by just nicely asking to switch.  
How do I handle this? Am I being unreasonable? I thought I was a quick fix to just switch and my other sister made no fuss. 

Tl;dr  
Mum's husband has always refused to get to know us, going as far as saying we aren't family to him. Now she asked to do a draw for Christmas, one name, one gift, easy right? I drew mum's husbands name and asked to switch with my sister, she agreed done deal.
Now second sister keeps bringing it up, saying I'm unreasonable, I should just give him gifts and include him more (he made it clear he don't consider us family) that I'm being petty, etc it's never ending, how do I best handle this? What do I say/do?

I really never learned how to properly clean things. I'm always really embarrassed to invite people over because things are always a mess. There's always cat fluff at the very least in the corners of the room.

Do you have a cleaning schedule?

How do you keep shit organized? Do you re-organize things every so often, or is it just that way from the get go?

How do you keep the kitchen clean? 

How do you keep things off of random surfaces? This is really my biggest problem! I'll clean everything, have the counter all clean, then in a couple days it's COVERED in things. The things are all clean, but it's like spices, containers, etc. that don't have a home to go to (not much space, really).

211,"As I landed from parasailing, one of the men removing our equipment deliberately grabbed and slid his hand against my vagina. He waited until my boyfriend had walked a little further away. I instantly accused him and he claimed it was an ""accident.""

I called the coast guard, who claimed it technically wasn't illegal (it's a private island). They did not realise I could also speak French (their language) and said awful things about me. That my dress was too short (it was 35 degrees Celsius and this is a beach holiday place) and that I was going to ruin his family all because of a little grab. That I was a ""stupid slut."" At one point, a coworker of his sat me down and asked ""we know he made a mistake, but just this one time can you please forgive him.""

I felt so absolutely powerless. I went to the nearest land and found the local police who insinuated they could assist me. They arrested this man after several hours and asked me to identify him face to face. He called me names, brought five of his friends and they spat at me and shouted that I was going to ruin his life.

The police have told me that I need to be available to fly there for Court dates if I want to continue this. That it will take months and there is no proof. I do not have the money nor the time for this. Yes, I know it's important but life must go on. He has been arrested and held for one night. His family knows. He cannot work again for this company because he is now known as a sexual offender and we have made several reviews with his name included.

The police insisted I take an intimate examination but the contact was over my dress and bikini. I refused. I did not want someone poking around me intimately at all. They took my refusal seriously as if it made no sense. 

Part of me wants to just let this go now. The rest of me feels violated, shocked, sad, embarrassed, dirty, and the list goes on. I am walking around like an emotionless piece of wood.

215,"I'm so sorry for the impending essay. 

So, I feel like this post requires a little background about me first: 

I'm 27 years old. My current life situation is that I'm happily married so that's going well. Unfortunately not much else is. I stay with my parents because I'm trying to get through my bachelors. My relationship with them is strained to say the least. We love each other, but my parents are two deeply broken people with issues that they need to get help with but refuse to. In addition, my dad is terminally ill and dying. My mom isn't handling it well. 

I have no extended family. I've cut most of them out because they're chronic substance abusers who would throw their own flesh and blood under the bus so long as it meant they could continue their way of life. There's no love lost on my side, but I do wish I had some family sometimes. 

I have PTSD that I deal with on a regular basis. I'm not going to get into specifics, but my father used to be abusive (I've since forgiven him. The man is dying and I wanted to fix us. He got sober and is a different person now. I've let it go for the most part) but the PTSD mostly stems from another abusive relationship I was in for the majority of my teens. It was extreme, to say the least. It's been a decade. I'm functional and for all intents and purposes, happy. I'm not fully over it however. I don't think I'll ever be. 

I'm in school full time. I don't have a job. I'm okay with that, but I'm kind of a high anxiety person due to all of this already - and school just ratchets it up from about an 8 to a 11. 

Anyway, my point in relaying all that is not really because I want sympathy - it's just that I'm going through A LOT right now and I have a WHOLE lot on my plate and I think that's integral in explaining the issue I'm having with people. 

Despite all this I'm a pretty happy/easygoing person. I enjoy what i'm in school for. I like my life. I love my husband. He's an amazing support system and having him in my life is probably the sole reason I can keep my head well above water most days. We've been together for 10 years and our relationship is really solid. But I seem to not have a lot of friends - and it all seems to be for the same reason. 

I make friends easily. I'm really bubbly IRL and have been told I'm easy to get along with. The issue comes when said friends have problems. I try to be there for them as much as I can - but it almost feels like they rely on me TOO much. Obviously in having my own problems I understand other people have problems too - but I don't really think I'm in a position where I can emotionally deal with other people's issues for a prolonged amount of time and I don't really know how to express that - or if I'm just being completely intolerant. When people talk to me about the same issues ad nauseum, it really starts to effect my mood. I find it emotionally exhausting, and my own issues do a great job of being emotionally exhausting already. 

The latest issue is someone who's having an issue with unrequited love. I've already told them what to do that would be the best fit for their specific situation. They have issues with being insecure and have had issues along that vein for the long time. I suggested therapy. But they seem to insist on talking to me about it, and it's gotten to a point where I don't even want to answer their texts. I've got so frustrated today I considered shutting my phone off completely just so I could recharge and hang out with my husband and not have to hear it going off. 

I don't want to be the person who shuts someone out - the thought of doing that to someone who needs someone is frightening because I would never want someone to do that to me - but I don't know how to set up or enforce boundaries about this kind of thing. I never thought I would have to because honestly - telling someone in distress that they need to stop talking to you seems harsh and frankly, callous. Cruel, even.  

This isn't the first time it's happened. And I've lost friends because of it. Friends that were chronically depressed or needed someone and I couldn't be there because the constant venting/negativity was dragging me to a place where I can't deal with my own issues. I understand being depressed isn't someone's fault - but I have my own issues and I can only be there so much. 

I don't know if maybe I'm the one who needs an attitude adjustment though. It seems to keep happening to me, and I'm the common denominator here - so I'm wondering if maybe I'm looking at this wrong and just sort of being a jerk. 

Any advice on how to set up/maintain boundaries or really anything I can do would be so helpful because I'm at a loss. I don't really want to lose friendships, nor be percieved as a 'bad' person, but I also can't keep my head above water in terms of depression if I'm constantly fielding other people's issues.

216,"I've been best friends with ""Andrew"" for about 6 years now. We met during sophomore year of college, really hit it off and roomed together for three years after that until I ended up moving back to SF after my dad passed away (Andrew lives in LA). 

Despite the distance, we tried to see each other at least once a month and tried to keep a constant text conversation going but both have definitely fallen to the wayside recently. 

It's about 2 years after we graduated from college and I've been working full time for all of it and Andrew has been funemployed. I've encouraged him to apply to jobs, sending him leads, fixing his resume, practicing interview answers with him etc ... but he's always said he was ""working through things"" or he was too busy with family stuff - which is fine. I tried and I've long since given up on that front. When he truly wants a job, he will make an effort.  

More recently, I've been deciding whether to cut Andrew off. We had our first phone conversation in months yesterday, and whereas before we would have hours upon hours of just nonstop talking about everything and nothing, this time we had about 10 minutes of awkward silences and nothing to talk about. 

Andrew and I both had the dream of going to law school and working corporate law firm jobs in New York, we'd share a closet sized apartment and complain about our shitty hours while buying top shelf liquor with our inflated paychecks every weekend - we had the entire delusion planned out. 

In order to take steps to achieve this, I've been working 60-70 hour weeks on average as a corporate paralegal for a corporate law firm, trying to balance studying for the LSAT, and supporting my mother and younger sister in college financially. 

And well, Andrew has well, complained about being funemployed and depressed for the past 2 years while doing nothing to change his situation. There is absolutely nothing stopping him from changing his life - his family completely supports him financially and other than occasional chores, places no burdens on him. 

Additionally, our friend groups have completely changed. I spend most of my time with friends who also work long hours at their jobs and have higher education goals they are willing to work as hard as they possibly can to achieve. And Andrew's friends.... well, his friends are people who spend their whole paychecks as soon as they possibly can on drugs and alcohol and definitely do not have goals academically or professionally for themselves and this has definitely rubbed off on him. 

At this point, I feel like both he and I are way too different and I no longer want him in my life. He texted me this morning and asked if he would come up this weekend for a few days, and I think I am going to tell him no - we are very different people than we used to be and I don't think this friendship really works anymore. Am I being shallow cutting him off? Am I being too self-centered about this?

220,"Hey guys

I think my friend's boyfriend is controlling her to stay away from me. He's always hated me because of how close I am with her. I think he's worried I'll steal her from him (not gonna happen, she's like a big sister to me).

I haven't had a proper conversation with my friend in months. She always seems to be with her boyfriend at her side. When they walk, he usually leads (even though before the summer break they walked side by side) their last into lectures and first out (before the summer the three of us would meet beforehand, get a coffee and go up together).

They always sit together and always away from me. Last week they sat with a mutual friend of ours in our university lecture so I sat next to our mutual friend the next day so that I could talk to my friend. But they sat elsewhere even when there was plenty of room for them both. They were the only two people in the row of seats they sat on.

I know my friend. She's the kind of person who hates to lose friends and she'll always sit next to them. Even if she's fallen out with them. She would never be as distant as she has been to me.

Last week. She asked to be moved from one laboratory group (the one I'm in) to one on a different day (he's not even in that group). And because you have to request by email. I don't think it was her decision.

But here's what made me particularly worried about her. Yesterday I found them both, on their own, in the area of the cafeteria they have never gone to. There was plenty of room in their usual area and the place I found them is an excellent place to have lunch if you're hiding from someone. I saw them and decided to sit nearby. They saw me and didn't wave (like they used to, even when they were discussing issues) walked past me twice (once to get lunch and once to sit back down) and ignored me when I clearly said ""hello"" both times and then they simply left the cafeteria with their food.

I know they were probably talking about some serious issues that aren't related but it just didn't seem like them. If they talk about their issues. They don't really care about where it is. They once had an argument right in the middle of a coffee shop.

Later that day I texted her to see if she's ok and that I was a bit worried about her. I didn't want to go into full detail in case i was wrong and her reply made me feel like her words was being watched:

""Yeah, all is good. I'm in a really good place. (Her boyfriend)'s been taking care of me a lot and honestly. I'm so lucky to have him. Thanks for asking""

Firstly. If she was fine. She'd never go into that much detail she'd usually say ""I'm good. Thanks for asking. How about you?"". Secondly, why did she mention her boyfriend. It had nothing to do with him. And why would she be praising him. Given that before the summer break, she complained about him a lot.

Worst part is I can't talk to her about it if I'm right. Her boyfriend is with her all the times I can see her and he has access to all other forms of communication I have with her (text, email, Facebook etc.)

Now I know there's a huge chance I'm just being paranoid. But. In my head, too many things have been happening in such a small period of time for it all to be a coincidence. I just need a bit of advice on what to do.

Or I just need someone to just yell 'it's all in your head' at me.",06Oct2017,1
221,"
I am a white female from a small conservative town. To give a little bit of background on my parents, my dad never finished high school and my mom barely did. Ever since I was little my dad would tell me things such as, “if you ever come home with a black guy I’m hanging both you and him in the tree.” Told racist jokes, ext. most people from my town do the same thing. But my dad says he’s not racist, because he had black friends growing up and doesn’t mind black people. 

I’m currently in my Sophomore year of College, and met a black guy who I felt very connected with. We have a lot in common and have been on a few dates.

We became romantically involved as boyfriend/girlfriend this past weekend.I had mentioned stuff about black guys being cute in front of my parents - my mom agreed, my dad said “you don’t need to be finding black guys cute”.  

I talked to my mom about it, and she said she wouldn’t mind, but said it wouldn’t fly with my dad. She said he would kick me out. 

Now, I’m visiting home for the weekend. I have a faint red mark on my neck from my boyfriend... and my mom saw it. She asked who it was from, and I told her she would hate me. “Don’t even tell me it’s from the black boy.” She took my silence as a yes, “this won’t fly with your father.” 

So to get to the point, my mother is open to the idea, but my father isn’t, and I know she will stand by his side and not mine. 

I want to keep our relationship a secret from them for a little bit to see if it would become more serious. But I know I can’t hide him forever. I will want to visit him on breaks when we are both not at college, but he lives an hour and half away and I know I will have to tell my parents the truth sometime.

222,"I recently became a manager of a restaurant that does dine ins, takeout, and deliveries. There are about 5 or 6 employees right now who work inside the store that do not have cars and rely on rides to/from work. That in itself is not the problem.


The problem is that it is becoming more common for these employees to not finish all (or any) of their cleaning/side work tasks and demand to leave right on time because their ride is here. 


I tried my best to respect that, but despite me giving them a ton of leeway, lowering their cleaning/sidework, AND having someone cover their primary job for a full hour for them to finish this work, it *still* wasn't getting done. I know I am giving them more than plenty of time to finish their work because I have done all of their jobs before. I even remind them that they can work on side work (or cleaning) any time it's slow, they don't have to wait until the end of the night.


The thing is, they think they can get out of the work by leaving. All other employees leave when their work is done. When it's crazy that means staying a little late sometimes, but usually people are out within 5 minutes of their scheduled time. Because the majority of cleaning and side work isn't getting done now, my closer and I have been stuck over 2 hours late some nights.


I'm not sure what to do about this. I put my foot down on two employees who pulled this last weekend and their mom came in and demanded they leave right now because she was already here (and they were scheduled to be off).


I'm not really sure what the best way to go about this is.


Employees who drive themselves to work would have to stay a little late to finish their work as needed. It's becoming a problem that the employees who get rides are now getting priority of leaving on time AND ultimately less work at the expense of other employees.

Do I just leave a 'happy birthday' as a message or should I say more? Or nothing at all and wait till I see her when she's back in classes. 
She doesn't live close by that I can call to her home and we are only recently become friends.

I still feel I should message her something so she knows I'm not just ignoring her or don't care about her.
Any ideas? 

I really appreciate any help you can give me in what kind of message to send her. Thank you :)",06Oct2017,1
242,"Graduating soon. I live in Houston. Have offers in LA, Atlanta, NY,  SF, and interview in a few others. What should I look for when choosing my city after college? 

To make it easier let's say the jobs are roughly the same and no family ties keeping me close. Cost of living is marginally compensated for NY and LA. ",06Oct2017,1
243,"The problem is that I really have no marketable skills since my current job is in retail.

The ultimate solution is to get an education to get a marketable skill and use that to get a much better paying job that isn't in retail. But for the time being I need a new job and I'm trying to think of places that aren't your typical corporate retail environment since that's one of the problems with my current job.

I've had several ideas; looking at government job listings, job posting websites, classifieds, craigslist, USPS has had postings up for ages but the job is absolutely brutal, maybe even working as a cab driver since my driving record has been spotless for years and there are several companies in the area, but I don't know how viable those options are and what other options I do have available to me.",06Oct2017,1
244,"I'm currently a newly graduated high school student who decided to take the year off in order to build my business. I did well in high school so I'm applying to a few high ranking universities. 

Obviously, none of my credentials are falsified. They can all be verified by my high school. Nevertheless, I have my SAT/ACT scores to justify my academic performance.

The business that I built is very successful, however... it's a fake diploma site and I know colleges won't like that. Lol, I was strapped for cash 🤷🏼‍♀️ I didn't think it would end up like this. 

I want to talk about my business because in the end, it is something i'm proud of, but I'm not sure how to present it.

Side note: the business name is registered as a basic printing company with it's own separate site. Should I present it as a basic printing company?

Side-side note: Printing diplomas is perfectly legal. Using them for certain purposes is where it gets sticky. How my customers use their purchase is up to them. 

Side-side-side note: I DO NOT OFFER DEGREES. I simply print on the paper. They know what they're buying.",06Oct2017,1
245,"Hi, Junior in high school here, at the start of the year me and this girl who I have 5th and 6th period with started talking and we became good friends fast, I like her a lot and I am pretty sure she likes me but not 100% sure, she always pokes and like fake hits me and shes real flirty.

Anyways, today she was talking to her friend behind her about some drama with this guy at her church, I kind of knew what she was talking about but I turned around to ask her what was up, She gave me a real stern NO and so I turned around and the bell rang 5 minutes later so I got up and left, usually we walk to the parking lot together but I thought she was mad so I just kind of sped off.


Anyways I got home and took a nap and when I woke up I had about 5 texts and a snap from her with things like ""Did I make you mad"" and ""I'm really sorry"" and she even thought I had blocked her number and asked me to unblock her. I told her I was fine and that I just thought she was mad. She still didn't tell me about the drama that she was talking about earlier but all she said was ""Don't worry its not romantic or anything"".


I tend to overthink everything, but it seems to me that the only reason she would tell me that would be if she wanted to make sure I didn't think she was talking to someone else and is into me. 

Think she likes me? I was gonna ask her to dinner next weekend but I'm just not sure.",06Oct2017,1

247,"My husband will be sent by his job to Italy for a week. He asked me to join him. I'm a H.S. AP teacher and it isn't my vacation time. And on top of it, his job isn't paying for me to go, I'd have pay for my own ticket. So I'd have to make sub plans and find a qualified sub for a whole week (which is harder than you'd think). The week after his work trip is Thanksgiving week, which is my vacation time. I'm asking (begging/demanding) him to stay in Europe for a vacation with me through Thanksgiving Thursday or Friday. He wants to return home to have Thanksgiving with his family, which we see all the time.

He's telling me that I'm being selfish by wanting to extend the trip where both of us can be on vacation together (because even though I'll be in Italy, he'll be working M-F, 9-7PM). I'm telling him that we need to spend time together alone and this would be the perfect time.

I'm telling him that if he doesn't want to do a vacation with me then I will go somewhere else by myself for the whole week. 

My question is, am I crazy? Am I being selfish and not seeing it? He just wants to cook a Thanksgiving turkey with his family like always and I'm a travel fiend whose had my wings cut since we started dating 5 years ago. It will be our first international trip together. I've already suggested we do a second Thanksgiving with his family after the fact and he's said no. 

I'm at my wit's end with my ultimatum and don't feel like this should be a fight. 

Any unbiased opinions on the situation?

248, yeah. Good luck with that. I couldn't get in to see my therapist for 3 weeks. I don't even know what I'm asking for here. I'm feeling particularly fragile and do not want to further burden any friends or family by dumping on them. ,06Oct2017,12
249,"I have tons of blue-tack used for hanging posters stuck on my wall. The many videos I have seen seem destructive to the wall and paint on it. It would take forever for me to try to scrape and use new tack to unstick it all from my walls.
