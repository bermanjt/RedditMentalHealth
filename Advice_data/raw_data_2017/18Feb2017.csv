0,"Didn't really know where to post this but here goes.

I just got a puppy. We've had multiple dogs of different breeds with different requirements in the past, I'm well aware of how to correctly train and raise them (not that there's just one way, there are multiple ways.)
I do live with my parents as I'm still quite young but I have paid for/am paying for everything regarding this dog and I pay for rent and my own requirements. Therefore I feel it's my house as much as theirs, but my parents are questioning every little thing. They even got frustrated with the name I picked for him. 

They refuse to let me train this puppy properly and I don't want him to end up like our current dog, who misbehaves constantly and never listens due to my parents allowing her to think she's the pack leader and not allowing me to help with training. I want my dog to be healthy and happy, and that means training and a proper diet. But my parents think it's cruel that I won't feed him junk and acknowledge him every time he whines. 

They refuse to let me spend much time with him and despite me telling them the reason for me getting a dog (I have depression and anxiety and animal companions help give me a sense of control and purpose), they are separating the dog from me and getting angry when I attempt to take control and teach the puppy what it needs to learn to understand its place in the household.

I guess I just want some advice on how to explain to them that I need this to be my responsibility without them starting up another shouting match. I love my parents but this puppy means a lot to me and I want them to trust me and understand that what I'm doing is best for myself and the dog. 

Tl;dr Got a puppy, parents won't let me care for it properly, want to know how to get them to trust me with the dog.",18Feb2017,1
1,"Basically long story short as the title suggests I came inside my girlfriend (first time having sex aswell. Great) 
Here's the facts 
She's on the pill (contraceptive you take orally once a day) 
She's just off her period and started taking the pill again 3 days ago. She forgot about today but took the the pill a soon as she was home (about an hour after sex)
She takes her pills at random times throughout the day. 
Were going for plan B (morning after pill) first thing tomorrow morning

17,"Some context: 18/m. I work at a Dairy Queen in Michigan, it's a pretty successful business... I guess we're one of the top 30 dq's in the US, and my boss takes that to heart. 


I've been working there around 6 months and honestly it's been an absolute nightmare. Most of the managers are chill, they yell at you when your being unproductive, as expected... but the Boss, lets call him Jeff, if you're doing something slightly incorrectly, he stops you (literally, stops you from working) so he can yell at you and ""correct"" you. I could tolerate that, but he literally doesn't know dick about his own fucking business. There are times when I have to set timers for him, clean up messes for him, and yes, he critiques you while your doing that, too. 


Earlier today, I dry-mopped the dining area, and apparently didn't get a spot (which we don't dry-mop, we only sweep it twice a day. But when I explained that to Jeff, he was NOT having it. I explained myself, and he said that he ""could not believe I had the audacity to tell him that."" He then proceeded to call me a disappointment, question my parents child raising skills, and heavily implied that I'm going to be a fumbling failure for the rest of my life. It sucks because I'm starting to feel like he's right. 


Naturally, it's put a damper, so to speak, on the rest of my day. I've been home for a couple hours now, and I just feel like the biggest piece of shit. Are most bosses like this? I had a boss at this place I worked at before and we we're really cool, I miss him. How should I handle this? I know the obvious answer would be quit, but we are extremely short staffed on guys there, and if I quit, the place may or may not be completely screwed. ",18Feb2017,27
19,"So as the title states my gf just sold a tobacco product to a minor in a little sting procedure.  I'm under the impression that the boss is the one in trouble as the police officer told her than this was the 6th documented time that this has happened.

When the officers came in she owned up to every single bit of it and said it was her fault.  She had just got on ""the clock"" 5 minutes prior to the incident and was trying to help her coworker handle a rush and didn't follow protocol due to the hectic situation. Obviously this isn't a good enough reason to excuse it in court. This is a convenience store.

I am completely clueless as to who is liable since she's under the table and I am pretty sure this isn't an official corporation, rather a partnership.  I saw the document that she signed and I'm led to believe she is going to be called as a witness to prosecute the owner of the business but I am not positive.

I'm looking for advice as to how to protect my gf from having and repercussions sanctioned against her.  The owner is sort of shady and I'm sure if he had the chance he would use her as a scapegoat.  

What should she say?  What sort of evidence should she bring?  Since she's not an official employee is she not at fault or more at fault?  Any help would be appreciated.",18Feb2017,1
20,"My husband received an anonymous email today telling him to be worried about a fellow student of mine (I'm pursuing a post-grad degree). We'll call this fellow student A. The sender, who claims to also be a student at my school, said they had seen things that disturbed them and alleged that A is trying to take advantage of me. They framed it as if they were concerned for me, but I think the subtext is they were trying to out me for cheating--which I have not.

I don't know who the sender is (they've already killed the email, so we can't communicate with them anymore), but should I confront A? I think he's genuine, but I haven't known him that long, so maybe I'm being naive. The sender outlined the ""tactics"" A would use to get close to me, and honestly, some of them are dead on. 

Or should I give A the benefit the of the doubt and tell him that that someone is trying to start trouble for him? The sender provided A's cell phone number to my husband, so I guess they were intending some kind of confrontation.

The whole thing is bizarre. If they were so concerned, why didn't they warn me directly? My husband thinks it's one of A's exes or someone who is jealous that I've spent time with him. I think it's someone trying to make trouble for me by upsetting my marriage.

In any case, I have no idea what to do next.",18Feb2017,1
23,"Okay so this is going to be pretty long. I know I am a shitty person for this but I was in a pretty bad place. So I have been buying lsd off the dark net and selling it at school. I am 17 and I live with my mom and sister. I have been using lsd a lot since last summer and I have changed a lot since then. My brothers steal from us and are addicted to meth and steal cars and things off the street for them to sell and trade for drugs. My mom loves them unconditionally and has convinced my sister to let them stay with us but here they are wearing my clothes because the blow all there money on dumb shit and don't have any to wash there clothes. They take all the coins and never clean after themselves. They always carry knives on them too. One of them got in a police chase in a car that he stole and ditched the car around our apartment and my clothes because he was wearing them and put on some sweat clothes he had with him. 

So last December they lived in a different place that was like a block down from our apartment and one day I had woken up because my brother was banging on the door. I had forgotten to set my alarm so I had overslept and when I opened the door he had a crazy look in his eyes and was saying all this shit about me hacking his friends computer and trying to steal money from his account to buy bitcoins for my drugs. I had no idea what the fuck he was even talking about but he ended up taking my sisters computer and my phone from me and made me go with him to his apartment. And he made me put the passwords and was looking through all our shit and opened up a bunch of random system files and said they where files I was using to hack them because they apparently had similar files in their computer. (No shit if your going through the win32 folder we're gonna have similar looking shit). 

Then looking through my phone they found child porn that I had forgot to delete. I know that was a shitty thing for me to have but I'll explain why I had it in the first place. So I had been selling lsd so I could buy more lsd and some weed and this one kid I told him how I used the dark net to get my drugs and he steered the conversation to how there is child porn on there. At the time I had been abusing a lot of lsd at the time. And I mean I wasn't using, I was straight up abusing using 5-6 times a month even though my tolerance was threw the roof. 

At the time I was depressed and probably a little out of touch with reality as I was thinking life had no meaning, I was constantly questioning reality and over analyzing everything pondering the meaning of everything. So pretty much at this time I had the mindset that pedophilia is a natural thing like being gay or straight or into beam or any other fetish. So I probably put off the vibe that it didn't bother me and it honestly didn't at the time because all I was thinking about all day was how humans are just animals and our reality is mostly just in our heads. I know I'm defending this a lot but I feel really bad that I let myself get to this new low in my life.

Well long story short he offered me 30$ if I got him a bunch of child porn and I told him 200$ because the risk and he was like okay. I gave it to him in a flash drive and then he wanted more so I just went on bing and searched terms like jailbait and this guy liked girls like 12-15 and where 17 but it's still pretty bad. So I just downloaded some pictures onto my phone during school and I transferee the images into his phone via Bluetooth for 50$. Then I deleted the pics off my phone. I have a lot of guilt of doing this but at the time in my psychotic state I just saw it as natural and that weight and wrong is a man made concept and shame and pedophilia. Maybe it is but I stopped doing acid and I can now see how fucking dumb I was being. 

So when my brother searched my phone the pics where still in my downloads folder on my android. Well then he thought I was a pedophile and also thought that I had something to do with pizza gate and politicians fucking little kids. He also thought some hacker group was blackmailing me to hack their phones and computer and store child porn there. Now I didn't know what to do so I just denied knowing anything about it being in my phone. Well he said now that he was being paranoid but he probably thinks I'm a pedo. 

Well know both brother are staying here and they keep stealing shit but i can't say anything because they tell my mom and sis that I'm a sick pedo who likes little kids and then my won't trust me alone with my little sis who is 13 but I won't do anything to her that's sick. Also they'll tell her about me buying drugs online and that I smoke weed and did acid. 

My brothers are fucking crazy one tried to stab the other a few weeks ago while it was only the three of us home and my mom knows this and we went out of state to pick her up after my older sister found out and while we where gone my brother had broken in to the apartment and had two friends over when we came back like two days later. Well my mom talked my sister into letting the brother who broke in stay with her even and my sister gave in. 

My sis has major depression and manic bipolar and borderline personality disorder and takes a shitload of meds and is morbidly obese. All she does is want to sleep and basically sleeps the whole weekend and looks so depressed all the time. But she is the only one with a job so she buys everything and my brothers just steal to buy beer and pay for the buss to go with their friends. Also one the one who had tried to stab my other brother, when he's here all he does is sleep and then wake up and goes straight to the fridge and devours a bunch of food and watches tv or goes back to sleep. He'll do this for like a day or two then leave to his ex gf who he has a kid with for a few days and repeats. 

I'm Trying  get a job so my sister doesn't have to support me as much and I can start saving. As soon as Im 18 I'm getting the fuck out of here because my family is so shit. Living with my sister is so depressing because of her mental illness and my mom can't see that convincing my sis to help brothers out and her helping them out is making things worse. I'm trying to change. The phone I'm using is one I stole from some kid at school and I stole and sold more for money for weed and I stole earphones and even a some money from my sister but I'm going to stop. I want a phone with service and I want to smoke weed and more clothes and I've realized that if I keep doing what I am doing I am going to end up like my brothers. I have to work for the things I want and not be a lazy bastard and steal shit. And my obsession with trying a bunch of different drugs is unhealthy. I'm just going to stick to smoking weed and if I want weed I need to actually earn the money I use to buy it and not steal and sell shit or buy and sell other drugs. 

So I need help with what I should do. My sis and I are moving to a new place and my mom said that my bros aren't coming. I really don't want them here so I was thinking here are my options. 

Deal with there shit until we move. 

Tell my mom everything so I don't have to keep my mouth shut for fear of getting blackmailed. 

Tell my mom and sis everything


Or tell my sis everything

I don't know what to do because I don't want my mom and sis thinking imma pedo and I can't explain the child porn to my bros because it'll seem like I'm lying. If i don't tell them chances are my bros will eventually tell my mom or sis in the future and then they'll think imma pedo and won't believe my explanation. 

Honestly I don't know if it's a good idea to abandon my whole family when I'm 18 but they all cause so much stress and I can't connect with any of them except for my youngest sister. I act like a different person around my family because I don't feel that open or comfortable around them. Around other people I'm fine but around my family except my youngest sister I'm super quiet and they think I have depression but it's only around them. My bros are fuck ups and my mom makes tries to help them but makes shit worse and my older sister is so depressing and weird as fuck and lonely.  I know that's a fucked up thing to say about my family but that is how I honestly feel about them. My little sister is the only okay one she does good in school and puts up with my moms shit but doesn't rebel just takes it. She's told me she knows my mom does dumb shut but she says the best she can do is except it until she can leave at 18. My mom is super controlling. Like when ever me and my sis want to do something she wants to know exactly what we are doing. Have to call her frequently and she'll will often check up on us to see what we are doing without saying anything then freaks out over little things like if we change our plans at all

So I need advice please idk what to do",18Feb2017,3
24,"The deal is that I have a friend who is consistently fighting with her parents. She's said that they've fought about how her parents ate the last of food that she wanted, how her parents ""don't give her enough"" money, and how she thinks her mom is being ""too much of a bitch"". She expects me to agree with her point of view on these subjects i.e she wants me to say her parents are being irrational or something in that vein of thinking. But, I completely disagree. I want to be a supportive friend but, I also truly think she needs to mature a little bit. She starts screaming at her parents if they eat the last of the food that she wanted. She spends a lot of her allowance on fast food for her meals every month and fights with her parents about how she ""does not receive enough"" money. She receives, I believe, over $40 in allowance per month despite not doing any chores. She also brings me up in these fights claiming that I ""always"" have money with me and that my parents provide it even though that is completely untrue (they give me money once in a blue moon and I do not get allowance). She gets annoyed at her mother when she tries to give her advice or when her mother tells her facts that she might find interesting and proceeds to yell at her mother for doing such things.

1) I sleep way too much as a college student. With 7 hours of sleep I can barely function, but I see many others live on 5-6 hours per night. I got tested for Chronic Fatigue, hypothyroidism, iron levels, and B12, but they're all fine. I was wondering what I should alter in my lifestyle to stay up longer? I cut out caffeine after it left my anxiety in a worse state. 
2) I don't know if I have a concussion, and I'm really afraid of going to sleep and not waking up. I have the tendency to always go to doctors and be told that nothing is wrong with me- they think I'm a hyperchondriac, so I avoided an urgent care clinic even though I hit my head on a concrete wall really hard (I turned over in bed and happened to hit it). Our copay for a doctor's visit is $60, and I already wasted the last $60. My parents also avoid doctors even when needed, since they think all I will get is prescribed medicine. 

Oh, also in before the people are like ""You're 20, you should have your own stable income and be living in an apartment by yourself""- I'm a college student who's unfortunately dependent on her parents financially, still on their insurance, and use most of my waking hours for an unpaid internship when I'm not taking 5 classes this semester.

One guy went back to Taiwan so the three of us kept the surround sound.

We kept it for another year without problem because we dormed together again.

Then third year came, I didn't manage to live in the same dorm with them. But those two did. So they kept the surround sound in their room, I was okay with it.

But one guy got kicked out of school due to a rape case. Long story short, he left around winter break (December 2016). And he took the surround sound without asking for my permission even tho the other guy (roommate) told him to ask me if he can take it.

Nevertheless, I texted the guy. And he was being REAL shady about it. He would take days to reply. I finally got an answer and he told me it was at ""his loft"". 

I asked him if he is going to keep it or reimburse us. He didn't reply. I gave it a day and asked again. Still no reply.

I threatened to tell the on-campus housing. He immediately replied and said ""no money."" I told him to give it back to both of us and we can reimburse you, he made up an excuse that he was ""not in the country."" Which was clearly a lie, because his snapchat story was him in the area.

Then I told him either he is going to reimburse us or give it back. He said, ""Idk where it is. Not my problem. Goodbye"".

This is really frustrating. This person has always known to be shady and kind of sly. I was wondering what I can do about this situation.

It tore me apart to lose him, as we had been best friends for over five years, called each other brother and had made plans long into the future. For six weeks I stopped attending work, university, sport and other commitments whilst I got to grips with the change in my life.

However now, and for most of the past few months, I am incredibly so-so about the experience, and do not feel a need to express my feelings about him even though I am still very sad to remember him and how he left us. When I do occasionally start to remember him, I have a very brief intense outburst before returning to my normal subdued state. I've been able to help others through their grief-ful moments, but my own times have been few and far between.

I wonder, is this normal during grief? Or are there healthier ways of expressing one's feelings when losing a loved one. He was my brother and I love him dearly still, but I am unsure if I'm emotionally dealing with this in a healthy way.

I've seen there is a thread on here about a brother lost a year ago, and there being no grave. The same is true for my own situation so I intend to read that thread also.

Lately my job has been very stressful so the other day I decided to poke around online just to see what else is available in my area. My job pays me pretty well so looking sometimes is difficult because I will have to take a paycut. While I was looking I happened across a creative producer job at a car dealership.

This is direct excerpt from the posting ""his position requires video editing experience with preferably Adobe Final Cut Pro, After Effects, and Adobe Flash"" I haven't used those particular softwares but I have used other video editing softwares.

Any help would be most appreciated as it would save me weeks or possibly months of indecision, and possibly a lot money too :)",18Feb2017,1

54,"So i'm a senior in highschool rn. I have plenty of friends but I don't really like any of them. I talk to them at school but i don't hang out with them outside of school. Outside of school I mostly keep to myself, play videogames, lift. 

When I go to college i'm nervous about finding new people to hang out with. I'm a really quiet guy. I'm not shy, i'm just really quiet and don't like having long conversations or hanging out with people 1 on 1 since i'll have to contribute to 50% of the conversation. But yea it's just hard for me to find new friends. I don't drink or smoke, (sometimes drink at a party but i'd rather not) and most of the people here and probably in college only do that. A main reason why i don't hang out with people outside of school is because all they do is drink and smoke and i feel like i'm the odd one out since i'm the only sober person there.

Like I said, I don't really go out a lot so I don't have any crazy stories to tell, i'm not gonna get lit with anyone because i don't want to do drugs/alcohol. There is a squad at my school that don't do drugs or alcohol but all they talk about is cars and idk shit about cars so I have nothing in common with them so I don't chill with them. 

It probably sounds fucked up and makes me look like a douche to say this but i could probably find people i'm talkin about (that don't drink or smoke a lot and can just chill without all that shit) but i don't really want to be friends with nerds. I'm 6'3 and have been working out for a few years so i'm pretty muscular and i'm pretty attractive (ik i probably sound really cocky), so i want to surround myself with other good looking people

Anyway i'm saying a lot, does anyone have any advice for me? ",18Feb2017,1
55,"So today I went on Facebook to check a post a buddy had tagged me in. I haven't logged into Facebook for quite some time, so as you can imagine, I had ton of unchecked notifications. Particularly, more so related to messenger. 

Turns out, I had close to 60 messages from a person I went to high school with. I've seen this person a handful of times since high school. He would come to some of the shows this band I used to be in would play. Hang out and have a couple beers after the show and that's it. Really harmless stuff.

Quiet, kind of antisocial is how I'd describe, but I never had a problem with him.  The last time I even seen this Dude was, I don't know, 6 yrs ago?

Anyway, the string of messages start in December of 2016 with the most recent being 545am this morning. It was all stuff like "" I know you guys didn't want me around"", or ""congrats on being the chosen man"" or ""yeah I know. You didn't want me around because I am not who you want me to be or think I am."" There was also a drawing of my wife and I that this person did and sent to me. It's kind of weird and scary.  

There's even a point where something related to high school is brought up and mind you, that was over 15yrs ago. There's a ton of times he's  referring to how ""we"" don't want him around. Who's this ""we""? 

So far, I responded to him asking if everything is ok and I hope he is doing well. Other than that I'm kind of at a loss of how to handle this situation.  

Im a musician and we blast our upcoming shows all across social media and he sees these updates I'm sure. The last thing I want is for this person to show up, and something to go down that could've been prevented. 

Can I / should I get police involved if nothing has technically happened? What is the protocol when dealing with someone who seems obsessed all of a sudden? 

Just looking for a little insight. ",18Feb2017,1
57,"my dad and i live under my grandpas roof - he owns the home and everything in it. 

I just recently moved back and I'm trying to get on my feet. Have a job lined up and everything. Anyways, my dad is an abusive drug addict (i think) anyways he's constantly verbally abused me, kicks me out of the home when my grandpa is away on business, has charged at me and tried to hit me. 

The last fight happened on thursday when my dad asked to borrow $20 mind you he got an ssi check for 2200 a week prior that he had already lost all his money on drugs, god knows what, and gambling. all of that money blown, didn't use an ounce of it to put food in teh house, help my grandpa, help me or even help himself (which is why people get ssi and disability) just wasted it all. i say 'no i need to save what little i have left on food that you'll be eating anyways' he says 'you ungrateful son of a bitch you're out of the house today you aint going to have a place to live' then he begins to get more angry etc he charges at me and begins to try to fight me - in the process he sees my wallet and opens it and takes $20 out of it. I drive to the neighboring town where my grandpa is and tell him in which he does pretty much nothing. I stay over there for the night then today when we get back my laptop is missing my father is confronted on it and denies knowing where it is. finally he gives it to me under theconditions i leave.

during this fight my grandpa says he's the one that is going to be kicked out etc he threatens my grandpa with his irs debt saying he'll make it to where my grandpa where inherit his back taxes, that he'll make sure my grandpa loses everything he has (the home, the cars, his business) it's just crazy and my grandpa just says 'okay [sons name] w/e you say'.

so he threatens and abuses everyone and the only reason i don't call the cops is because he hangs it over my head that if i call the cops for his criminal behavior that he'll plant drugs on me. i'm afraid of the police showing up and my dad putting drugs somewhere then telling the police they're mine and me denying it both of us charged wit hthe drugs or something. mind you i don't use drugs, not even weed, never have but these threats scare me out of calling the police. 

tomorrow my sister and cousin are coming up here to talk to my grandpa about what as a family we can do to get this abusvie asshole out of here or dealt with. 

what should i do? if he hits me and does criminal like he always does and i call the police i can protect myself against drug framing? how should i handle that?

thanks and sorry for hte long winded post but i can say honestly i hate my dad he's a terrible person who has destabilized my life so much i actually chose homelessness for months on end over dealing with his abuse. ",18Feb2017,1

60,"Hello all,
To start I would like to give an idea on my current situation.
I'm a freshman in college and I was recently diagnosed with myocarditis, for those who don't know what this virus is, it is a virus of the heart that can prove fatal if left untreated, luckily for me I had went to the doctor and what not and I'm currently on medication.
However, with this new illness that I have, I cannot strain my heart. I can't work out, run, walk long distances. In short: I can't do many of the things I love doing. I keep an active lifestyle and now that this virus found its way inside my body I don't know how I can spend the time recovering. My doctor gave me a 6 month recovery period, so it will not be easy for me. So I have come to this subreddit to ask what are things I can do to keep my mind active and happy for the time being. ",18Feb2017,1
63,"Ok, so I came on here a few months back because I work at a supermarket and I accidentally took the store keys home with me late one night. Long story short, the store's industrial-sized waste bin has a giant padlock to regulate what goes into it. I'd have to go into the manager's office every day to retrieve the jangle of keys so I could unlock the bin and then return the keys. One stressful day, I forgot to return them. I got a call the next day from our manager asking me to come into work ASAP and return them. She was pretty pissed off, and I barely know the woman. 

Fast-forward a few months and people still keep giving me shit for this one-time accident. *''Don't take the keys home with you again''*. 

I'm on my day off, and the store manager just got one of my co-workers to text me asking if I know where the keys are. Apparently, keys are missing again. But I can't help but feel like this doesn't look good for me at all. I haven't touched the keys in over a week [they're used daily by people], but they have grounds to be suspicious of me because of what happened last time. 

I'm annoyed for a few reasons — partially, I don't feel comfortable with this bin responsibility if people are going to lose their shit when a margin of error can easily happen to anyone. I'm not a manager, I don't get paid enough for this. Secondly, I haven't touched the bins in a week, so It isn't me who misplaced the keys. But I am getting super paranoid. 

I keep asking myself even if I did misplace the keys, where would I have put them? Where would *anyone* have put them? The fact she's asking me through text [and I barely know her] leads me to believe she's asked everyone else immediately at the store and they've all been clueless. 

I think I actually got threatened last time that if I do it again there would be trouble, so now I'm worried that this looks really bad for me. But there's nothing I can do. I texted back saying I have no idea, as I haven't touched the bins for over the last week — the cleaners have been taking the garbage. But I don't think they retrieve the keys to throw the garbage into the actual bin.  They just leave it on top of the locked bin. 

So basically, I'm one of the few logical suspects.

64,"I'm going to be graduating at the end of this year with my bachelors degree in physics and mathematics, and I know that I want to get into physics research but I'm still so unsure about what particular area. My own university leans entirely towards astrophysics, but I was always interested in high-energy and particle physics. 

Since the physics department is composed entirely of astrophysicists I've had a lot of research experience in that area, but absolutely none in any other. The department's only theorist retired a couple of years ago, so there isn't even anyone to discuss this with. At the end of this year I'll be heading straight to honours (a kind of fast-tracked Masters for anyone in the US) and won't have time to do another research experience gig. We only get 2 weeks off between the two semesters, so I won't have enough time to do one during the year either. 

So without the ability to test out another field of physics before I graduate, I think that my only option would be to try out particle physics in my honours year or PhD. But this would be a massive risk. I might not like it at all and end up doing terribly, whilst I really don't mind astrophysics and am doing pretty well with it. **Should I try out something new and risk ruining my credentials if it goes poorly, or should I stick with something that I know I'm good at and risk missing out on a better field?**",18Feb2017,1

68,"So, to start:

I'm a 26 year old man. I am (was) comfortable with myself, though i'm somewhat awkward when it comes to social interactions. I spent quite a few years behind a computer screen and I believe that severely stunted my social growth.

I'm currently working in a retail environment. I interact with customers often. I have few cuties who are crazy about me, a few that flirt, a few that respect me and a couple that can't stand me. 
My hobbies are extremely limited, I mostly just go to shows  on the weekend and watch youtube videos during the week. I don't really like ""weird"" things, but things I thoroughly enjoy are few and far between. That being said, although I interact with customers in an extremely short and professional manner - I have trouble holding a conversation with almost anyone, including my closest friends.

Worse than that, I seem to put off an aura of creepiness and weirdness. I'm not sure why. I'm quite stylish, but I am to myself and strange looking. I don't often approach people,  but will talk to the person next to me at a show, or someone in my store. They always look surprised that I spoke to them. I also find people, both male and female. Maybe this is because I look strange.

My question is; how can I be more approachable? Although I permanently look like a creep, is there something I can do to put off a friendly vibe?

How can I improve my social skills? I go out as much as I possibly can and have been working on it for YEARS with little improvement.",18Feb2017,1
69,"I got the urge to reach out after seeing a post about a German children's book teaching kids about homosexuality and the situation in the book is nearly identical to my family's situation. So i want to hear how other people would react if they were in my (or my mother's) position. I would like to hear any advice from people who have experienced a situation like this. And i would also just like to hear your thoughts on it and how it all went down. I truly appreciate those of you who take the time to read this novel. It means a lot to me as i spent over 2 hours (i think, i wasn't paying attention) writing and editing it. Any input is appreciated. Thank you all.

I apologize for the length of this post but this is the first time i am really reaching out for others thoughts and opinions on this very rare scenario that is now my reality. It is very relieving to get these thoughts and feelings out for others to process and i appreciate your time and thoughts on the subject. 

 After 30+ years of marriage, from the age of 18 bearing 3 boys, my father came out as gay to my mom. They kept it a secret from us kids for 3 years while they tried to figure something out. they went to counseling, my mom got a boob job, they tried many different things to get that attraction back. but nothing worked for my dad. I agree that Homosexuality is not something a person has control over. but my mom being very religious she sees it as a horrible sin and is disgusted by it. As much as she loves my dad and wanted to keep the marriage going she refused to do so if he was gay, its not fair to either of them. So the separated.

 So last year they sat me down, i am the youngest (28yo) of 3 boys, my mom sat in silence with tears welling in her eyes as my dad explained to me that he is attracted to men and has felt that way since he was 12. I was the first of our family to be told and i had to keep it a secret for another 4 months before he told my brothers, and when i try to ask them about it i usually get little to no response and we have yet to have an in depth conversation about it. As of now My mothers parents know, a couple of my dad's sisters, and a couple of his cousins know the truth as to why my parents are getting a divorce. My dad doesn't feel like he needs to tell his parents the truth because they are in their late 80's and feels like its not important and could cause health issues by stressing them out. So by him not telling the whole family the truth, they are left guessing why they are getting divorced. my grandmother asked if there was another woman in the picture and my dad said no and left it at that so now my grandparents believe the my mother is the one who was unfaithful because the idea of my dad being gay wouldn't possibly cross their minds unless it was brought up specifically. and ii find it despicable that he would allow my mother, who did nothing wrong, to look like the unfaithful partner when in reality he is the one with a dirty secret.

 His reasoning for hiding it was because times were different back then and homosexuality was not exactly acceptable, especially in our hometown (Lansdale Pennsylvania) or his family ( devout Mennonite Christians). I still and always will love and respect my father just as much as i did before he came out and i understand his fear of coming out back then and am happy that he can finally be himself and live freely without fear of judgement from the world.

What  bothers me and has bred some resentment towards him is what this has done to my mother. They built an amazing life together only to split up before they could grow old and end that amazing life together.

 He got her pregnant on prom night at 18, built a loving family and lived a very comfortable and privileged life. she had hopes to grow old with her HS sweetheart and retire and travel the world but then my dad realized he was getting old and has been living a lie. Before it was too late He wanted to live free and honest and experience the gay side now that it is accepted by the world. i understand that completely but why start a family and drag someone else along for the ride? Yes its not like she was kidnapped or lived a bad life by any means but her plans for the 4th quarter of her life are now shattered and she has to pretty much start back at square one while my dad is ALREADY in a new house with his 30 something boy toy living it up like his decisions have little to no effect on his family or more greatly his ex-wife. This only makes my resentment towards him grow. I was living with my dad until last month. when i moved out, his BF moved in that same week. I have a slight feeling in my gut that this guy is going to milk my dad (no disgusting pun intended) for as much as he can and then dip out. My dad paid for the penalty for him to break the lease on his apartment so he could move into my dads house. They go on trips at least once a month to random places. My dad is just giddy with this guy. its like teenage puppy love and he is spending money willy nilly. It is probably because he is making up for lost time. he didn't experience this as a young adult, so he is doing it now. I just hope this guy is genuine and doesn't take advantage of my dad's kind hardheartedness. 

Sometimes I wonder if my dad kind of had this planned to some extent, Did he start our family to cover up his homosexuality knowing that at some point he would be ready to come out or did he maybe hope the homosexual urges would eventually subside? what was he thinking would happen when he decided to marry my mother knowing all well that he was gay deep down. What was his end-game?

 He was a great father and provided our family a very privileged and comfortable life. He was always very loving and caring, he has a slight temper but was never violent so i know he never intended for this to cause a rift in the fabric of our family but its inevitable. 

Over the past year i have noticed a drastic change in how my dad acts and thinks. For one, he used to be a die hard conservative republican, now he is very liberal and leaning more towards democrat. He acts like he is a young adult fresh out of college, he swears more than i do, he is getting a sleeve of tattoos done, its just crazy how much he is changing and living it up while my mom is just left to wonder "" What the fuck do i do now?"" She is a strong, smart, and beautiful woman and will definitely have men lining up for a shot with her i'm sure (she looks about 35 yo) but she loves my dad and wants only him. She realizes now that is no longer possible. She doesn't deserve this. she deserves the best and i truly hope she can find a man that will treat her the way she deserves. My parents are still best friends and they go to dinner at least once a week. Kind of hard to just walk away from 35+ years of being together everyday. My dad being fairly well off, still takes care of her and pays for a lot of things for her. They are still in the process of getting divorced. But i feel so bad for her because she was maybe 3 years away from being able to retire and live her dream of traveling the world with the man she loves and has spent most of her life with. But now she has to find someone else that she connects with and that will treat her the way she deserves. How would you feel if you were excitedly planning what you were going to do and where you were going to go in 3 years when you can finally retire but then your spouse blindside you with ""Im gay and i want to explore that lifestyle"" I can only imagine that she felt crushed and completely confused as to what happened to the last 35+ years of her life. 

I just feel like if my dad knew he was gay at the age of 12 and was afraid to be open about it then why not just live life single until he felt comfortable about coming out instead of starting a family essentially as a cover up and then when he finally feels comfortable just completely change his life and in turn put your wife's life on pause. 

I have a few questions for anyone who took the time to read this i know some of the questions might seem harsh or insensitive but i dont hate my dad, quite the opposite acctually. I still love and respect him im just confused on how to react and handle different situations and being my mother's youngest son we have a special bond where i feel more obligated to defend her and ""side"" with her even though there are no ""sides"" to be taken. And sometimes i am stuck in the middle of them, for example after visiting with my dad my mom will sometimes ask if i have met his BF yet, or ask how he was acting. I want to be there for my mom to talk to and be able to support her when she is feeling low but i also don't want to get in the middle or have to choose sides.

1: How would you react if you were in my shoes as the son (or daughter) 

2: Do you think it was wrong for my dad to start a family knowing that he was gay?

3: How am i supposed to react when my dad continually asks me to meet his Boyfriend and to accept him as part of our family.

4: what is the best way to support my mother when she feels depressed or lonely?

5: How am i supposed to support my dad by accepting his BF and treating him like family when i know my mother is hurt and struggling.

6: Do you think my dad should tell everyone in our immediate family so they are not left to guess who and what is the reason they are getting divorced?

7: If not everyone then don't his parents have the right to know the truth about their son?

75,"I literally just woke up from a dream where I was trying to kill little baby elephants but they just wouldn't die... Its because I love this cat dearly, but I have been thinking about killing him so that my mom doesn't spend all of her savings on it. 

I often try to convince myself that money doesn't matter. But on the other hand I recently realized that my family and I live in working poverty. We all earn under £10k, however we have been lucky enough that my mom has these inherited savings that have slowly whittled down to ~ £2-3k. 

Yesterday we went to the vets and when I heard them asking for £500 for a scan, I realised this could easily be end of those savings. We don't have cat insurance so that means she is spending it all directly.

78,"My friend who is like a sister to me (19 yo) is stuck in a relationship with a guy that no longer cares about her. She lives with him. He uses her, tries to make all of her decisions for her, tries to keep her from talking to her other best friend, and doesn't understand her mental illnesses.

Almost all of her friends have moved away and no longer talk to her often, the one other best friend is willing to take her in but his mother wants $300-400 a month which she can't do. She is in debt for college, loans, etc. She could live with her dad, but he is not financially able to take her on. He is taking care of her younger sister and adding my friend would put them in a bad place and she doesn't want to do that to her sister.

She feels trapped between being homeless and staying with this guy. Granted she didn't listen to a lot of people when we said to not go back to him, but she doesn't deserve any of this.

79,"So I had been working at Red Robin for like 3 months as a line cook, it was my first job (I'm 18) it was going good at first, getting good performance reviews from my boss and such. He told me I needed to get faster but since I had never worked in a restaurant I guess they were thinking it was just a matter of time. Anyways fast forward 3 months later, I find out another line cook got fired because he had a bunch of late tickets. Then right after that I see my name isn't on the schedule. He calls me in for a meeting and shows me this check list for certification that I didn't meet. This was like the first time I had heard of it. But he goes through this list of things I need to get better saying that he's getting reports of sluggish performance. and then gives me 2 days (Saturday and Sunday) to improve. So I go in on Saturday and try to make sure that none of my tickets are late but the manager that was there still wrote a report saying that I was insubordinate, not dropping things (in the fryer) and not washing my hands for more than 45 minutes. (Which I thought I was doing every 15 minutes) When I go in on Sunday he shows me the report and says he ""thinks it's time we move on"" has me sign a paper and then that was the end of it.  I really enjoyed working there even though it might not sound like it, and I don't think the time I spent learning the menu should go to waste.

I need your help. I've applied to over 50 places in my area over the past two months looking for a better job but alas I hear back from nobody. I've basically exhausted my options. 


I am a full time student and a full time worker at a factory. I'm working 8 hours a day and 7 days a week on the graveyard shify while balancing some morning and night classes and I cannot take it anymore. 


I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer science and I love it. I am on my third year and coming close to graduating. I've been trying to find a full time job locally in IT but I hear nothing back from anyone. I've literally applied for every position I feel I could do.

85,"So I moved into a new flat in the past couple of months, and am semi-comfortable around my two new flatmates. When I was chatting to one of them, she was talking about how she needs to get her license (and I agree, because she has to bus some serious distances), and I offhandedly said I could give her some lessons if she needed some.

She took this as a green light to go and book professional lessons, solely relying on my availability to give her multiple practice sessions in between them, with me, in my car each week. I am super busy currently, and don't have the time to do this. Also after giving her a lesson, it turns out she pretty much has no experience and it was terrifying how many times she nearly crashed my car.

She's hassling me for more practices now and I just straight up don't want to give her any more, and the fact that she's assumed I have time to do this bugs me.

86,"My parents punish me by restricting the internet access under parental controls in the options of my router. The internet is blocked when it is my bed time and if I don't go to bed than there is no internet between 6 A.M. and 3 P.M. (=9 hours) the next day.

Now this seems highly unethical to me because I'm usually at that time catching up on homework because I don't attend school due to my autism syndrome.

This is such a stupid rule because my father who is in charge of the router is very ignorant. He also can react very unpredictable.

I don't have a problem with my parents blocking their own devices that I use because it are THEIR devices. I do have internet on my PC but that's because I switched the name of my PC with a TV tuner we never use. But I do have to hide my internet from them. This seems ridicilous to me because they maintain 2 standards.
My brother can get away with a lot. He's a very narcistic person but for some reason he gets favored in my family.
My parents have very stressfull jobs and it feels like im just their punching bag with their stupid rules that make no sense whatsoever. I also think they have sex problems but I'm not really sure about that
My brother has unlimited internet access and I only have officially about 8 hours/day. I think they just punish me for stress relief with their rules.

Which by the way are 'forcing' me to not to attend school. Because if I give in to these retarded and ineffective rules, I will be their marionette.

So basically I'm done with my parents restricting my internet access based on how much I sleep. I'm not a rebellious teenager but these new rules are insane.

87,"Not really sure where to start but I'll give a quick background, I'm the youngest of 3 sisters, my middle sister is 25 and we're pretty sure she has borderline personality disorder (we being my mother and I, we haven't discussed it with her for fear of inciting a major meltdown). My mom said that they'd always had small issues with her growing up but I didn't really notice anything until she was about a junior in college, which is apparently the time that a lot of mental illnesses manifest themselves. She started picking fights over tiny things and refusing to let go of what she perceived as insults to her, often insisting on having it out with my mother in public. She moved back home after college and according to my parents would pick fights with them almost every night. Often over trivial things that would then lead into her bringing up bigger issues, so I perceived her getting mad about small things as a way for her to bring up her actual, deeper set grievances (her thinking my parents loved her less than my other sister and I, typical middle child stuff, money, etc.). My parents are both the type of people who don't really like to fight and would rather let things go, but she would keep at the issue until my dad would snap and yell at her. Neverending cycle of perceived insults or small grievances, her not letting go of the issue and turning it into a rage, and then her crying and having a meltdown. Repeat.    
My dad died about a year ago, so now it's just my mom having to deal with her. I don't feel like it's my place to step in - I'm positive she would just scream at me about how it doesn't involve me - but it hurts to see my mom having to deal with her. It can be over an hour of her fighting about and not letting go of the smallest thing, like my mom making an offhand comment without thinking that will make my sister light into her. In public sometimes as well which is really embarrassing and frustrating. I know a lot of this is BPD symptoms and she sees things differently than we do but it's so incredibly frustrating. She hasn't been able to keep a job for about a year now and is currently unemployed and living in an expensive city, which is a burden on my widowed mother. I don't want her living with my mom though as I know it will be too much for her to happen.  

I guess I'm just looking for tips, advice, or reassurance that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Not even for me but for my mom. Thanks if you read all of that. 

TL:DR; my sister has BPD and is making life a living hell for my mom,sister and I. Any advice from someone who has maybe gone through a similar situation? ",18Feb2017,1
88,"So I have a Wii U.
I've only had it for two years, and in those two years, I've bought five games for it. That's it.
While some other games have caught my interest, I never viewed them as worth the $40 or so dollars, when I could be getting much better games for my PS4 or 3DS.
 
My last game for the Wii U was Wind Waker HD that I bought last month. I haven't beat it, but this is mostly due to lack of interest.
(This, and one other game I have for Wii U can also be played on the gamecube, which I also own, as well as a Wii.)
While there is some sentimental value to the system, (since it was the first game system I bought myself), I am unsure of what other reasons there are for keeping it.
 
I currently have a pre-order on the Nintendo Switch, as well as BOTW. 
With all my games + the Wii U + accessories, I could get around $160 in store credit at Gamestop.
 
This would allow me to pay off BOTW, 
buy Horizon Zero Dawn, pre-order Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Remix, and pre-order Danganronpa 1 &amp; 2 reloaded, as well as pre-order a pro controller for the switch.
 
All together, that's ten games (if you count them individually). Five more than I've ever had for the Wii U. 
And the Switch will come out with more, as will the PS4, per usual. 
 
I'm trying to think of reasons to keep 
it, or reasons to sell it. Personally, I'm very excited for the Switch release, and I've heard people saying to wait and see how badly it does, or how shitty the programming is on release, but I've never had any issues with Nintendo systems.
 
If anyone could give me advice, I'd be super grateful. ",18Feb2017,1
90,"It's probably going to be a long one.

Anyway, I'll try to keep it simple. I don't know what to do, I had to drop out of college last December because I couldn't afford it anymore, especially with my Mom's boyfriend ditching her with the rent and all stuck in a lease. So I moved home to help my mother. 

I was just trying to recoup from the major depression I fell into when I was in college but it wasn't really happening. That's when my mom had a major heart attack while I went to visit my girlfriend in Michigan (I live in Memphis TN) I drove 12 hours to see her one last time because I was told it didn't look good. She hung in there for 2 months and seemed to be coming back before she caught C Diff and the doctors weren't in any hurry to figure out why she had a 105F fever. 

She eventually passed and I have been on and off of severe depression ever since. Now my aunt and cousin, who are basically like my second mom and my sister, are about to be kicked out of their house by her ex-husband (I know it doesn't make sense but he's a major dickhead and the house is in his name because she didn't have the credit).

Anyway, I'm looking into renting a place with her until we can both recover and get on our own two feet. Problem here is I don't have a job. It seems impossible to get a job in Memphis. I had an interview at a bank as a teller on Tuesday, but I am just fearing the worst. I feel so helpless, like my family is just cursed and we will never get a break.

Any advice on what I should try/do would be incredibly appreciated. I'm pretty desperate here. Thank you in advance, sorry that it's so long.

92,"I'm a 25 year old making 27k a year before tax, having worked for three years in the profession I got my degree in (a 2.1 Bachelors of Science in this specific field). No debt, thank fuck. I live in a country with freeish education (the registration fee is a couple of grand, sneak that in there). My expenditure isn't too bad as I don't have a car, share a room in a 2 bed apartment with my boyfriend, no kids etc. 

The low pay is specific to the career in this country, not just the company I'm with. The issue started a few months ago when my company stopped paying us overtime at a time when overall workload was increased and generally the work/life balance just tipped and the work environment has become pretty toxic. I go into work every day keeping up a positive appearance because I don't want to a) contribute to the overall negativity and b) start becoming intrinsically negative and accept it as 'just the way it is'. But this is draining and affecting my mental health over all, it's taken a while to realise I'm not just becoming an overall boring, crap person (I think, the jury is still out to be fair) but that working in that environment is sneakily taking it's toll. 

I've updated my CV and interview skills, am applying frequently to entry level positions and some niche things that the overlap of skills might apply with, but as my primary degree and experience are in this specific field that I'm trying to leave I haven't had much success.

In terms of dealing with the mental drain of rejections and realising I no longer want to stay in this career I've been going to counselling, journalling and trying to set aside time where I don't stress about it by hanging out with friends. 
In terms of practically trying to get out of it, I search and apply for jobs several times a week and have researched a few masters and found one (totally different to my field but I would qualify for it) in International Business part-time. I've contacted recruitment agencies and been told they don't handle career changes and only want to work with people looking for careers in their field of experience. I spoke to a career counsellor who told me to continue what I was doing, applying for jobs online and consider a masters. I've started learning excel online to try and upskill a little.

So my question is, is there ANYTHING else I can do that will help feel like I'm working towards a goal and not just drowning in shit? I appreciate any and all replies here, and thanks for reading!",18Feb2017,2
93,"Throw-away account for obvious reasons.

My grandfather suffers from COPD. At this point he is only coughing up slime every once in a while, but I know how it will end: hospital beds, blood coughing, oxygen masks, wheel chairs, etc. He's furthermore overweight and refuses to get exercise, both of which are behaviors that only expedite the severity of the illness. He is dying and he knows it. 

Now if it was only that, maybe I could be okay with it. But my grandmother also doesn't want to leave him, even though he is often abusive and ungrateful for all she does for him. He is having her spend her last years in fitness and health on servicing him 24/7.

We want to take our grandmother to NYC before she gets too old, but he is the roadblock. She will never go without him, and he can't go. Sometimes we even have trouble taking her to the park, because she wants him with us. We have all told her to get more independent, but old people don't change very easily, and at this point we will just have to accept that she is not gonna' leave him alone for weeks, let alone divorce him (which we have also suggested).

Now don't get me wrong, I love my grandfather more than anything. Despite all his shortcomings, he can be charming, funny, loving, and caring. But he is holding too many people back from living their lives, and it won't be long before we all will have to spend hours of our day just keeping him alive, visiting him at the hospital, resupplying his oxygen etc. Furthermore, he brought his current state completely upon himself. From age 25-65 he was a raging alcoholic, probably averaging 10 beers and 2 packs of cigarettes per day. My mother remembers that when she was nine years old he proudly exclaimed to her that he ""didn't expect to live a day beyond 60.""

When he got diagnosed with COPD at age 74, he cut his smoking completely, and also stopped drinking. He actually also lost a little weight. But we all know, things are only downhill from here, and I feel like he has been a millstone around our necks for long enough. 

Conclusively, when things get worse, I will want him to die. Because neither him, nor my family, deserves to be put through something as horrible as advanced COPD. When that time comes, I want to speed up the process of him dying. I don’t want to let my grandfather suffocate to death over months and months (and he is a resilient motherfucker, so for all I know he could lie in a hospital bed for years before giving in), and I certainly don’t want my family to watch him do it.

103,"Some background: I went to college 5 years ago with my best friend. We were room mates at a shared student place where I sublet/sublease one of the rooms. His dad leased the whole building. In the winter things went bad when we had a harsh winter and the rooms weren't heated. In short: there was frost/water damage to the building and there was a struggle about money (no insurance wanted to cover it). Also the land lord put all the financial burden on my friends dad. The costs where high and we had a lot dispute about it. My dad and my mother were also planning a divorce at that time. There was a lot of physical violence between them (mostly my mom, my dad just defended himself). It's was a hard time. My dad insisted not paying a single dime. I was also a bit angry than with my friend. Tried calling him but no answers. Only his dad. In the end we didn't pay anything because they started threating with lawyers.

I feel bad because we didn't pay back. I had some money at the time for college but not much. I don't know why we just asked to pay in small amounts over time. After that no contact was made. No lawyer also.

112,"This has been a recurring problem in my life, and because I'm kind of a shy person when it comes to socializing, I never know how to properly deal with it. When I was little (5-6 years old), I slipped and fell to the kitchen floor on top of a knife that sliced my arm, not badly, but enough to warrant stitches. When my mother took me to the ER, I refused to have local anesthesia before the doctor put stitches in my arm, but he and my mom forced me to have it and ridiculized me in front of everyone for ""trying to show off"", as my mom put it. I felt horribly betrayed and cried in my room for an hour afterwards, because I couldnt't believe my mother didn't want to stand up for me.

In my teens, I fell down trying to do a stupid stunt with a bike and broke a tooth, and so needed some dental work done, and again history repeated itself: basically the dentist and both my parents laughed at me when I suggested if we could start without anesthesia and add it up later if I needed it (I didn't think I would). I could tell a lot more of stories like this one, but I don't want to bore anyone, just would like to ask for some advice on this: now that I'm a grown up, does a doctor have the right to refuse to treat me if I refuse to let him use anesthesia?

If i could give any perspective on this, I have a perspective of a anarchist / Anti-authoritarian view, not that form that wants to see the world burn, but rather have the view of liberating the human from government and religion, And i do have the view of ""as long as I'm not doing anything wrong, government should shut up"". Some say that's a right approach, but I see alot of big government sway in the right. Such as making abortions illegal. That's a women body, that should be her choice/ doctor and not the government, and their attempt in to outlawing gay marriage base off nothing more then religious convictions. Hell, I think Georgia wanting to have a bathroom police to see if the people going into the bath are really men or women. You can't get anymore big government then that.

I think I'm a lefties, because I don't think god should have no bearing on our lives, aside from church and our homes. I believe we are a secular state and should remain so, that is our ""traditional values"", we don't follow religious laws, we follow civil laws. But this doesn't stop you from following a religion. 
I also believe we should have some socialism in this country, such as free tuition for school, or else we are gonna have a nation full of unproductive retards (pardon my bluntness) most people skills consist of only knowing how to work a cash register, something that will be phased out in a year or so, furthermore, we should have universal healthcare for those who have pre-existing conditions that many insurance company won't cover, this is to ensure that they are insured.

I don't think that Business should be given special treatment, some places are making billions but still need to save money, and they should have regulation on them. I argue that you wouldn't want McDonald workers not wearing gloves when touching the meat, or throwing waste into the water supply. I'm sure these are extremes, but you get the idea.

I've always suspected bipolar which was made worse by alcoholism, which runs in our family (sorry to play armchair psychologist). He's amazingly talented but he's never held a long term job or lived away from home.

Not working, but helping Susie around the house and throwing himself into open-source design projects. 


The person  he was working on the open-source project with went on vacation for a weekend, and that's when it turned bad. Instead of working on the project, he started reading the news and within 24 hours he had ""uncovered"" this vast conspiracy. The details are irrelevant, but he is convinced that he pissed off some very powerful people by revealing the conspiracy, and our family is in grave danger.


He's already called the FBI, the cops, the Cia, several news outlets and Bernie sanders. Only eats packaged food (like canned soup) to avoid poisoning, he created a 2nd facebook and sends messages to himself to communicate with allies (I guess they're intercepting his communications?). Weapons are strategically stashed throughout the house in case of black-ops attack (no guns thankfully). No hallucinations that we know of, just complete paranoid delusion. 


So what now?  All the online resources I've checked seem to indicate that there's not much we can do but wait til he comes off of it, and hope we can talk sense into him then. Susie called NAMI and there wasn't much they could do, since he's technically not a danger to himself or others. We might be able to get a 3-day hold but that might make things worse if he thinks he can't trust us. She and I both have upcoming therapy appointments, but that's not for a week or so. 


 We suspect schizoaffective disorder, which is kinda like bipolar with some schizophrenia thrown in. Grandad had it. Cycling between mania, depression,  and total delusion. What I took as him doing well was possibly just a long manic episode. 


Susie is miserable, she can't even live a normal life because he thinks she's in danger of snipers shooting her thru the window while she watches tv. She's afraid he'll have some sort of episode where he mistakes her for an enemy and hurts or kills her. And of course she and I are both worried sick. i have no idea what to tell my 8 year old son. 


Had anyone gone thru something like this? I don't even know where to start or what advice to ask for. Please just help. 



  **tl;dr**: my cousin might be suffering from schizoaffective disorder,  he's completely paranoid delusional, terrified for his future, no idea what to do.

I was piterally trying to find somethingto get her for like 2 hours, All I got is chocolate (since she LOVES it) and something else, I got a VERY big teddybear like thing, it's very big and I really want to give her that, since we're meeeting and she's coming with bus, my idea is to give this teddybear to her friend who is also my 'okd school friend' I told her she could keep this teddybear at her house, so when I meet with her I can later on go to her friend get the teddybear and give it to her, does this sound like a good idea??

He doesn't have a doctor of anyone that he goes to, he went once before but said that they plotting against him and never went back, that was through a public system I think, 

He's always been delusional, says that he all knowing in a way ""sixth sense"" but I try to talk him down as much as I can, getting him to see sense that the things he believes and aren't fact, apart from his illness he's such a nice guy, really artistically talented, he has so much potential. 

I've been reading into schizophrenia but I still don't know how to help him. 

Last night had what I would think of as really bad attack, he called me up freaking out saying things were happening to him that are impossible, I can explain what he said but I don't think it's necessary. He's got really bad trust issues, so all this get put onto me and my other friend because he doesn't tell anyone else.

132,"I have a pretty big dilemma to be honest, my mother likes to go on vacations pretty often and she's starting to get upset that I  won't go with her anymore because of the fact that she takes my Aunt and her family (husband and 3 kids) with her all the time. I haven't ever wanted to cause any family drama so I've just politely declined/come up with reasons I can't make it. I love my mother and my siblings and absolutely adore spending time with them, I would spend more time with them if they didn't have like 4 cats (I'm very allergic to them), but I just can't stand even spending holidays with my Aunt's family much less going on genuine vacations with them. My aunt and her husband themselves aren't the issue it is primarily 1 of their daughters a kid who I used to adore but grew into a genuine demon as she got older, kids normally go through phases but she entered this one and hasn't left yet (she's like 11 at this point, acted like this since 5 or 6). She is absurd like I genuinely think she has severe mental health problems, she will literally scream in her mother's face like full on banshee level screams, and it isn't an 'oh she had an episode' that happens multiple times in a night in public even. She is also a genuinely terrible person and will purposely insult people just to see how they react, it isn't restricted just to family either she'll do it to strangers. Her parents just don't care, her dad occasionally snaps and goes ballistic making people worried he might genuinely put her in the hospital or something, followed by my aunt soon engaging in a fight with him resulting in a 10-minute on demand family fight whenever you want it, even the late Billy Mays couldn't make this shit up.

134,"Hiya, I'm currently a college student (rather not give specifics about age but I can't legally drink, so there's that). Everything so far has been going well for me, my grades are good, future's looking bright, and everyday I'm feeling more comfortable with my new relationship. We've only been exclusive for a few months, but we're anticipating being together in the long-term, enough for me to think about my future and how my SO fits in it.

The only issue is that in the future I want to do things that some might consider hard to do when you're ""tied down"" in a relationship, like traveling for example. I really want to travel the country, even the world. But most people I know or know of that travel are single. Even my own family has made a few comments on how its unwise to be in a relationship at my age, that I have my whole life ahead of me, and that being in a relationship would take away my autonomy in doing whatever I'd want to do. 

But the thing is I didn't *look* for a relationship, it just happens. Before my SO, I didn't even *want* a relationship until he came along and we both decided to give it a shot. Having a relationship is a commitment, but I can't help but feel like the way my family/others look at it is making me think I have to choose.

For the record, my family doesn't know of my current relationship and I haven't talked about this to my SO yet. This is something I'm thinking about a few years down the line and I figured I wouldn't bring it up until me traveling was a more concrete possibility.

My thinking was also inspired a lot by [this comment](https://dg.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ugkwt/serious_people_whos_spouses_have_died_and_are/ddub3t8/) I found on an AskReddit thread about people who's former spouses died and then remarried. The person who commented said that when his spouse passed and he began dating again, most of the recent stories/memories he had of his life involved his late spouse. He had spent so much of his life with her making ""we"" stories, most of his life revolved around her until she was suddenly gone and he had no ""him"" stories to offer.

That's what I'm kind of afraid of. I want to have ""me"" stories, not just ""me and my SO"" stories, and I want to have new and exciting experiences that are my own. But at the same time, I feel like I shouldn't have to give up my SO to do that. I feel like there's gotta be some way to reconcile the two.

It kind of sucks. What do I do?

My father was instrumental in both achievements above, without him, I would probably still be employed at the dreadful 11$ hour job. 

Now I've recently got my license and of course being financially illiterate I decide to lease a brand new 2017 car, and in less than a week, I have inflicted damage to it. Not surprising I know... but the other car involved was my Dad's car, he doesn't know, because the damage is very minimal on his end. On my end it isn't as good but it isn't pleasant... cosmetically I have mostly removed any visible damage, but a medium sized creased dent remains on the body line of the car above then fender and below the hood. My Dad's car suffered only a few visible scrathes that surprising my Dad hasn't notice... I plan on getting my dent repair for the god awful few hundred its going to run me, but my question is whether I should tell my Dad or not.

My Dad has warned me time and time again not to be out there driving I didn't need to so I am afraid that I am going to disappoint him. I respect him too damn much. I know my problem isn't the end of the world but the car is totaled or anything it's just this dent is causing me to lose confidence in my driving abilities and giving nightmares about potential disappointment from my father.

140,"At this very moment im writing from my car, that i now live in, the temprature is a bit under minus. The reason that I am in this position is a longer story that I will try to keep as simple as possible, but I need to go into some details so you will get a clear picture. 2016 febuary, I finished my education and i went on to find a- job, wich was not easy, I ended up with washing windows for a old friend of mine who had a small company. At this time i needed money so I did a lot of overtime. My Boss/Friend told me had a bit of problem rasing the money to my salary, so he proposed that i could live for free at his house. At this time I had broked up with a girlfriend and was struggling with the bills alone, so i said yes to the deal.
2016 June, I was working 60 hours pr week, and i cash out what looks like 10 dollars pr day(I live in Denmark, normally the pay is 20 dollar pr Hour) The thing that made me put up with this, was that I simply was forced to keep a good morale otherwise I would be without a job and home. ( I was really hard to keep a good morale because my boss was going out to the city every weekend getting drunk and using hundrerds of dollars, so ofc I could not understand why I still could´t get paid a fair salary.) In this company I was the only one who didn´t drink everyday and therefore i was also the only one with a license and I had to drive everyday because they were afraid of getting a ticket.
2016 november. I finally managed to save up to a depositum to a new place. Of Course my boss have this friend that have a small house with a nice garden I could rent cheap. I went and talked to this ""Landlord/friend"". I need to go into details now because this is important for the outcome of this story. Me and my new landlord meet at this small house. It was not in good shape, and the rent was not at small as he promised. So we made this deal, that if I was working on the house, with new floor, new walls, isolation etc, I could get some rent lowering. In this deal he also told me that he would make sure that the electricity and fireplace would be working inside the next week. He also told me he had some craftmanswork for me, so everything finally seemed to be going my way. (The thing is where i was raised and lived most of my life and oral deal is binding, but damn I got smarter) After this talked i moved out, and a week after me and my old Boss got into a verbal fight cause i told him i wanted more money than 10 dollar pr day. He actually told me to go fuck myself, and you have no idea how much love and worked I putted into this work, all my customers were always happy and i really like what i did, but I was starwing. 2017 Jan. Nothing works in the house, water is cold in shower, no fireplace, no heat, and it is January. All the deals he made with me had not been succesfull. At this time I had gave more than 200 hours working on that house, all the stuff I had made should easily cost 10.000 dollars in Denmark. And he promised me a Job and of course he did not succed with that part of the deal aswell.
2017 ( Feb) One morning im freesing, but im starting to get use to the cold because i dont remember heat. But it is litteraly icy on my bathroom floor so i call my landlord and tell him, that i think he should start do something about his deak, because im freesing as fuck, and im paying full rent even doe i have been working so much on the house. And once more in my life i got told to fuck myself, and that I should move out right away. Normally in Denmark you have 3 months to get your stuff out and I only got 2 days. I moved out in 2 days, and than i called him and told him at least i should get my depositum back. (Depositum was like 3000 dollars). He told me that we were done. I told him I will go to the police about it, and he told me that if i do that, one day it will be hard breathing for me.
So reddit, what can I do. Im not a bad guy, Im 26 years old, I smoke some joints sometimes, I drink sometimes with my friends but not on some hardcore level at all. Im not anything speciel and I do not know anybody who can help me. At this point I know it is impossible for me to get any money, because I have trusted the wrong person without anything on paper. But I really feel shitty that this landlord own 30 houses, a carpenter company, and mechaninc company and he is rich and powerfull in the comunity, and he using anything to his own benefit.
How can I do something to stop this guy. He is really a mean scumbag and I know for a fact that he has done this with people before. I was thinking to maybe spam him with mails, and calls but I do not have the ""Know how"" to do it. Please reddit some advice to make this place a bit better.

At my previous job, the work wasn't so challenging and I wasn't learning new tech skills. However, my boss and work environment was really great and flexible. I was able to work remotely if my kids were sick, contractors coming over, and whatever else life throws at you. I worked an easy 40 hours and came home to my family around 4:30 on a typical day. 

My new job gave me a 20% pay increase and has a ton of mobility, plus learning some new tech skills. However, I need to take public transportation now and I miss out on coming home until 6pm. So I am losing out on about 2 hours of family time every day now. I don't have the flexibility of working from home until 6 months, on Fridays onl.

Hes probably 60 years old and could be an old school style of managing employees. It's to be updated for every 1:1 we have. It's a red flag for micro management, in my opinion. He's also pushed some people out of the team and we're at 6 out of 8 people now. He plans to stick at 6 for now and may open up additional positions.

150,"This is going to be a long road so grab a bag of chips and relax a little while reading.

The story starts with a little 6 years old me, I had a friend who i used to play pokemon with almost everyday for a longtime(let's call her Y),and when we got 10 years old i asked her to become my girlfriend and she said yes. We were little, so we didn't know much about how that kinda of stuff worked, we barely touched (we never even kissed) but we used to send each other lovely messages and stuff. 

This has been going on for about 4 years, then we got into high school. We went to separate schools so our paths divided and we eventually stopped talking. A little later I heard that she got a girlfriend, she turned out to be a lesbian.It didn't bother me at all because I realized that we have never been really lovers, more like really close friends. Things started to get weird: whenever I happened to run into her she would avoid me and wouldn't even answer my messages. I didn't even know why, still up to this day I wonder why she didn't talk to me during that period. 
Anyways, time flows and I get 18 years old. A friend of mine introduced me his friend and we eventually became friends(we'll call him X). Once when I was at his home he tells me:
""Hey i gotta confess you something, i've got a crush on this girl"" and he shows me Y's facebook page.
I didn't tell him she has been my girlfriend in the past, i straight told him ""i know her, she has been a friend of mine for a long time but then she stopped talking to me"" I didn't want to destroy his dreams so I didn't tell him about her sexuality.
During that summer I went on a trip with my class in Norway, and one day while I was there X sends me a message :

""When you get back we're going to hang out together with Y"" ,and I told him, ""dude, no she hates me for some strange reason"".
He then asked Y the same thing and she said ""no, he hates me""
I don't know why she thought that, i've never felt hate against her nor I have told her anything bad.
But anyways, i get back home, and we hang out.
We started talking but she didn't look me in the eyes. We never even said ""hey long time no see"" or ""glad to see you again"" and that stuff, we just had one of those uncomfortable conversation that makes you think ""I wanna go home"".
It was getting late so I had to go home, but I didn't feel accomplished so before leaving I told her ""I was glad to see you again"", and she didn't answer me. Time passed and we eventually started to hang out together more often. We all became friends. We used to go on trips and talk about more stuff, we had fun.
One day while strolling through town at night X kisses Y. We were 5 people, everyone saw them. At first I was a little confused because I thought she was a lesbian, and indeed shortly after she reveals us that she's heterosexual and eventually X asks Y to become his girlfriend. She says yes and things started to change:
a lot of our friends stopped hanging out with us because (I understeand them) they said that our relationship started to feel different.

2 years ago I got a car. My mother needed me to have a car because so i could help her with a lot of errands, and that's the only reason I wanted to use the car for because I really hate driving. On saturdays though, sometimes I use it to hang out with some friends and X and Y are some of them.
Y is from my city while X isn't. X always says he can't come here for hella lot of reason that to me look like a bunch of excuses so we end up meeting at X's city. The thing is, I have to drive Y there. Every saturday I have to drive Y to X and back to her city.  We have never been alone since we were like 10 and it feels fucking Strange. Even though it's not that distant (about 6KM) it feels like an eternity every single time. We both feel uncomfortable in that situation. I tried to talk X about that but he's so stubborn and whenever you try to tell him something wrong about his realtionship he gets so mad he won't listen to anything.  
While driving we eventually start talking just to break the silence about things we don't care about, and she looks away while doing that.
So here I am, still up to this day every saturday i have to drive my ex girlfriend to her boyfriend. Does it feel wrong for you guys? because for me it surely does. How should I get out of this situation?

151,"TL;DR

Received a job offer from a good company in an area I wasn't anticipating living in (Detroit). Good opportunity for my career at the cost of personal desires. Accepting the offer would require some fast acting upon new living arrangements. Can't tell if this is something I want to do, or I feel obligated to do because of the good job offer.


So first off, I'm hoping I'm posting in the right subreddit. Please let me know if there's a better place for this. 


I'm graduating college in May and I recently received a job offer from a very reputable company. I'm extremely thankful for this opportunity and in no way want to imply that I'm looking beyond the fact that it could be extremely beneficial to my future career. I'll be 22 this summer and am leaving school with almost no college debt so the possibilities after school are slightly more flexible than others, which I do not want to sound like I am taking for granted.


I go to school out of state from where I live and had intentions of going back home to find work, see my family, and take care of some post graduation needs/wants. The job offer I received would essentially throw all of that aside; I'd be moving from my school apartment to an apartment near the work location (Detroit) and I'd have very little time to pursue some of the things I would've liked to do after school. 


Here's what I've boiled it down to.
Pros are:

- great job
- coworkers seem great
- lower cost of living in new location
- opportunity to ""hit the ground running"" with my post college career


Cons:

- Not sure this is exactly where I want to spend the next 2-5 years of my life.
- Inability to see my family as much as I had hoped.
- Moving/living arrangements need to be made in the very near future (much sooner than I was planning).
- Zero knowledge of the new living area


I'll admit, the cons to this opportunity are a bit selfish and aren't exactly deal breakers, but they are important aspects of my life.


Can anyone who's made it this far in my post relate to this situation? Those who live in metro Detroit area, what's the lifestyle like there? Also, what's housing like in that area?


I would be taking a large step in a direction towards an area I know absolutely nothing about, I do not want my nervousness/skepticism to scare me away from passing up a great opportunity. At the same time, I don't want to move farther away from the people that are most important to me solely because I feel obligated to take advantage of an opportunity that has been offered to me.


Hope that makes sense and I've provided enough information to help give an understanding on the debate I'm having. 


Feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts (good or bad).

154,"Today I got a new haircut because my hair was getting thick and in the way. I asked for a short haircut where one side was longer than the other and specified my bangs to be at eyelid length. I even marked the length with my finger. The hairstylist (a Turkish guy who barely spoke English) did everything fine except **he cut my bangs too short. He cut it above my eyebrow, like pixie-length bangs.** I was like ""this is not ok, why did you cut it that short when I told you I wanted it at my eyelid?"" Not only did he argue back that it's not too short (and purposely stretching my bangs to make it look longer), it'll grow out in a week, etc. but he got the entire salon full of his Turkish friends to defend him (I was the only customer there). They tried telling me the same shit and how I should be proud of my hairstyle for it represented my identity, blahblah. If I didn't also get a wash, I would demand my money back. The scissors had already snipped, so I could only be really pissed off at this point. Many objects were kicked on the way back home.       
I tried looking up remedies online and found things like twisting my bangs into a curl, using castor oil, and other things that range from doable to highly inconvenient (I'm a student living abroad so I can't invest too much money). And this is all because the hairstylist decided not to listen to his customer. I resolved to wear my beanie all the time, but I can't avoid showing this horrendous haircut at the gym or martial arts class. I'm really partial to my bangs since I had bangs all my childhood and it took me a long time to grow them to a side-sweepable length. And I like the look.           
So now I ask you, how can I grow back my hair in the fastest way possible without using chemicals? For background info, my hair is black, medium thick, and grows at a medium/slow rate. ",18Feb2017,1
155,"I'm in my second year of college. I have a lot of anxiety and depression, with a long background of trauma and I posses a diagnosis of about 3 disorders. I'm on medicine, but it has been giving me terrible side effects and my doctor wants me to wait it out. I've had friends that I talk to once in a while but now I've realised we are a lot more different than I thought. I have a hard time getting close to and relating to people. My therapist literally has told me that she's stuck and doesn't know what advice to give me, which doesn't makes things any better. My family back home? Single unemployed mother with depression who does not want to get help and has basically given up on life, and a little sister. Me? I'm trying to get help since I admit I cant do this myself. (I'm about to withdrawal from the semester while still living on campus so I can focus on getting better). The person I talk to the most is my ex, who is now a friend. Even he has pulled back. Not because he dislikes me. He does care but​ just has a lot to get currently done this year. I have a hard time talking to females especially. I'm not interested in a group of female friends. Believe me I've tried, but then things get uninteresting. I just wear cheap red lipstick instead of putting on a full face, I like listening to loud vocals and heavy guitar instead of top 40 pop hits and so on and so forth. Also with the fact that my dad was barely around, so its reasonable that I'm drawn to the company of males in their 20s. I've been told I'm attractive, intelligent, kind, and posses a good sense of humour. But right now I feel like im letting it go to waste. There's this guy who seems interesting and who thinks I'm attractive, I texted him and it just came out way wrong and I came off as clingy, crazy and submissive and now I feel like I ruined it. So that completely lowered my self esteem. I know I'm not different. The world is a big place, the campus is a big place. But I'm struggling to find people who I can truly connect to. Any advice?",18Feb2017,1
156,"Ok long story short I live in Texas and I apparently accumulated 30-40 toll violations which after all fees assessed came out to over $1800. And the car I want to sell isn't valued over $2000.

158,"I've been working part-time at a restaurant for about a month now. The job has been going well, it's helping me pay for rent and the schedule flexibility is allowing me to work on my broadcasting portfolio.

Most people would think this is not a bad thing at all.

Unfortunately, it's the exact opposite with me.

Every time I've gotten a job, I get extremely stressed by the end of the second or third week there. I usually have no free time or the energy to do anything, get constant jaw pain from clenching my teeth every time I think about what I need to do (I have to wear a jaw brace at night because of this) and suffer from constant stress headaches that make it impossible to think. I can barely eat, sleep or ever feel relaxed. My anxiety is always bouncing off the walls. My friends (the little I have), broadcast directors and family always get mad at me because I don't have as much free time as before - they don't understand I need to pay for food and rent.

This happens *every* single time. By this point, I usually have to quit for the sake of my sanity and health because I work myself into the ground.

The problem is I literally can't afford to do that. If I quit, then I lose my car and possibly my house, killing any chance I have for a career for at least the next few years. If I back out of my broadcast work, then I throw my career prospects and dreams away and get stuck working in restaurants for the rest of my life.

If I keep working and don't do anything, I'll go insane. I'm working at this restaurant seven hours a night three days a week as well as doing sports broadcast work at least twice a week for five-seven hours at a time. I'm already missing opportunities to advance my early career because of this part-time job.

I just don't know what to do anymore. No one seems to understand the problem because they think all of that = doing well. Meanwhile, I want to die inside.",18Feb2017,1
159,"So I'm a 20 year old girl in North Carolina and I've been living with my parents in one of the most rural parts of the state for a few months since I decided to take a break from school. First of all, they're driving me up the wall. Every other day it's ""when are you going to get a job, Anna?"" or ""when are you going to go back to school, Anna?"" and ""have you thought about these three colleges that are all within a mile of our house, Anna?"" It's beginning to feel suffocating.  Not to mention me and my mom are at odds with each other all the time; she's always up my ass about every little thing and I just can't seem to keep myself from being snappy and rude.  They're super conservative and I'm super not and I feel trapped.

I'm not too concerned about school; I don't have a time limit on going back, and I want to have some time to figure out what I'm going to do when I do go back. What's concerning me is all the trouble I'm having finding work. I live in a pretty small town. We have a Wal-mart and a Belk's (that nobody goes to). We have maybe 10 stoplights. I've applied to almost every retail location I can think of with no luck. I've called to follow up on a few of them and always felt like I lessened my chances because I called. I tried food service over the summer and every restaurant let me go after a few days because they didn't need anymore servers. I've tried working in the bigger cities that are 40-50 miles away; I end up spending more on gas than I get paid - but I've still applied to jobs in those cities with the hopes I can crash at someone's house.  I even signed up for a Care.com account for pet sitting and Tutoring, but no one seems to be looking at my applications.

There are people in Raleigh (which is three hours away) that will let me crash on their couch while I look for jobs there, but I don't know if I should risk that since these are people I barely know.

I was always told to put school first, so I never had a job in high school and I'm afraid that my lack of work experience is keeping me from finding a way out of this small town. I'm not sure at all what to do or where to go from here, all I know is this house is getting smaller and smaller every day and I have got to get out.

Tl;dr:  Small town, can't find a job unless it's super far away, person might let me sleep on their couch in Raleigh but idrk them so why should I, starting to feel hopeless and like a caged animal.",18Feb2017,3

161,I used to abuse Xanax and had many seizures from the withdrawals. It's been about 2 years since that time. I got 6 2mg Klonopin about a week ago. I took 2 of them the first day. 2 more of them yesterday. And I was thinking about taking the last 2 today. After I take these last 2 I will not get anymore or take anything else.

163,"So, long story short my mother is officially kicking me out on Sunday. I'm pretty scared because I've never gotten my own place and don't know where to look. I don't need much, a studio, efficiency or anything that's small and cheap. I've looked online a bunch but can't find anything under $700. 

I have a full-time job and I make 12.50 an hour plus commission which comes up to about 2 grand a month, give or take depending on how commission is that month. The reason why I can't afford too much is because while I was unemployed I racked up some credit card debt so I have a loan I have to pay off ($225 for 3 years) and a credit card that has about 3 grand on it and is no interest until July. Oh and I pay about $900 in total for car payment and insurance. (I have an expensive car)

Any idea where I can find cheap housing? Other than my 2 credit cards and my car, I don't have other bills. Am I overreacting? What can I realistically afford and how do I find it? I don't even know how leases work so I'm a bit worried, too. 

Thanks everyone. I'm really scared and I appreciate anything you can advise. I live in Miami, by the way. My job is in Miramar. So I'd be open to living anywhere from West Palm Beach down south. ",18Feb2017,1

169,"Quick backstory. My father has been in and out of jail all my life for driving without a license numerous times. This last time he was doing extremely well until my parents were buried in debt. My mother lost her job because the company she worked for was closing down. So my father got a job doing some contracting. Eventually, he had to get the behind the wheel of a car again so he could get to his jobs. 

He was arrested today. My mother has no job. No source of income aside from my brothers SSI (my brother is mentally challenged). She's already behind on bills since she lost her job and work was slow for my father. We haven't heard from my father yet but the police officer who told my mother that he'd been arrested said to call the jail in about an hour. We have no idea where his truck is and it was the only family car. 

My mother is quite unhealthy. She's been alone most of my life with my father in and out of jail so she's had to support two kids, one being mentally challenged, for the majority of the last 26 years. She's worked herself into exhaustion. She's overweight, and has a thyroid problem. She'll have to get a job eventually and she knows this. 

What I'm asking, is what can she do to get as much financial aid possible to keep up with bills and food until she can manage to get a job? Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance. ",18Feb2017,1
170,"Big question haha. Anyway yeah so basically im 19 now and I went through school and I was fat, I didn't have any friends, and I didn't try in school because I was depressed. I did lose a lot of weight. So now I'm very unfit and skinnyfat. I also have a spine condition(that creates a hunchback) that I'm waiting to get surgery for. I was supposed to have it last month but it got cancleed.. 
At this point I just feel like my life is really sad and boring. It always has been... but I'm sick of it. For the last 4 years I've been going increasingly crazy from having no friends. Fits of crying and anger and all that jazz. 
Every time I focus on one aspect of my life ( like working out ) I get extremely sad over another. ( No friends, virgin, no hobbies, boring, I hate myself, I hate my life)

I tried joining a club but they never got back to me.. and all of the other clubs at my college seem pretty terrible. I should mention that I did 1 semester of college but I'm not in college right now due to my surgery that was supposed to have happened. I'm scared to go back. I was EXTREMELY depressed and had a recently heavy workload and I could barely handle it. (This is community college. I'm a fucking dimwit)

Anyway please help. I don't know what to do..
1. Body. I'm trying to work out but it's a slow and confusing process. My back interferes with working out too... 

2. Back. I'm awaiting my back surgery again.. I don't know if I should go back to college or what

3. School/career. School is so hard for me. I have 0 academic interests because all I think about is how much I want friends/a girlfriend. Im uneducated and boring and can never bring myself to read because I'm always in a sad haze 

4. Friends. This is the biggy. Im going insane due to having no friends. I'm trying to get out there but everything I try fails. I don't even know how people develop friendships. It makes no sense.

5. Hobbies/interests. I have no hobbies anymore. I used to like horror movies and piano and videogames but now I just like piano... That's the closest thing I have to a hobby( and no I can't use it as a social thing. I can't play piano with others). 

6. Unsatisfied. I just don't enjoy living. Actually I hate living. Life is just work and sadness. I don't know who I am. There's nothing to me but a blank shell of sadness. I've always been like this though. Even as a kid I used to try and copy other people's personalities because I didn't have one of my own. 


I'm just so bored and unsatisfied with my life. Everyday I just think ""I can't believe this is what I've become.""  I'm 19 yet I feel like I'm 80. My body hurts, and I have 0 good memories from my life.

Anyway. Advice would be appreciated! Sorry for writing so much... I just feel so damaged and my life feels beyond repair. I just want to kill myself but there's so many things I didn't get to experience in life (basically everything. I've never truly existed)

I just want to be smart. I want people who love me. I want to love others. I want people who want to spend time with me. I want to be interesting, and have passions and hobbies. I want to LOOK normal/attractive. And I want to not hate every fibre of myself. And generally have a life I enjoy and a positive looking outcome. I don't know how to do any of those things though.

175,"A little back story: About a year ago now, I uprooted my life to move across the country with my boyfriend and a few friends. We had had a pretty solid plan where we would take a few months to save up and then move. Well that ended quickly as we moved a month later because the other couple we moved with decided they didn't want to wait. So we moved, half assed, and put ourselves in a shit load of debt in the process. Ever since we got here, it's been a train wreck. I share a house with four other adults and two children (not mine). We were supposed to divide things up like a team and make our first year here easy on all of us until we get adjusted. But one person has had a problem with that from the beginning. And he has completely run us out of the house. My boyfriend and I share the garage, while still paying a fifth of the rent and bills, each. We've tried making the best of it but it's becoming too much to handle. I work thirds and he typically stays up late to spend time with me but we feel like we haven't slept in a month because our very aggressive roommate is constantly slamming cabinets and the garage door or because he's screaming at his wife and kids. And now today, after dropping my bf off at work, I come home to find that he went through our room while we were gone because he accused my bf of ""stealing"" something that was my boyfriend's to begin with. We have every intention of moving back home in mid April, but the problem I'm facing is that I'm on the verge of a massive mental breakdown from being trapped like rats in a cage in this fucking garage. I want to move tomorrow, but we don't have the money. And I'm at a lose for how I'm supposed to keep my sanity for the next two months and keep my relationship from falling apart. This is weighing heavily on both of us. I am horribly depressed and I'm just lost on what to do. I fear if we stay much longer, things are only going to get worse. This same aggressive (male) roommate got in my face (I'm a girl btw) screaming at me because I refused to take the bus to work. I work in the worst part of the city and the buses don't run during the shift I work. And when I tried to walk away from the fight, he started screaming at my bf and I lost it and started screaming back. He physically launched himself off the couch and kept chesting me and I kept shoving him away from me while everyone else just stood there and let him. Everyone is too afraid of him to stand up to him because he's got horrible anger issues and lashes out over every little thing. Had I known this, I never would have moved in with these crazy fucking people. And although we had felt run out of the house prior to that already (can provide more hell examples if anyone wants them), we never went back into the main house after that. And that was back in October. I just don't know what to do. My anxiety is through the roof. Every time I hear a loud noise, I jump. It's like living with my abusive father all over again. And I just can't see a way out that doesn't end badly at this point. If anyone has any advice for how to get through the next two months without killing myself or how to make extra money to try to get home sooner, I would really appreciate it.

I can't get a job in my field right now cause all the jobs around me require a year long contract and I can't commit to that sadly. So Im quite stuck at the moment.

Im in California by the way where it is legal. So the problem I have with it is that everywhere I am, people are always talking to me about weed, the last time they got high, stories about them getting high or their plans to get high. It doesn't matter where I am, it's always mentioned. I will get snapchats from friends smoking or of their weed, my co workers all smoke and always talk about it, my girlfriend smokes from time to time, my dad smokes, and now my best friends are all smoking. Even the one friend I thought wouldn't smoke, his whole family is smoking now, including him. I just want to get away from it all but being in SoCal, it's quite hard to do that. I feel like I just need to find new friends to be with, but it's hard cause my best friends have been my best friends since I was a little kid.

The issue is I really want to still be friends with her, and I know she doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but we continue hanging out I think I'll never get over her. I've already spent the past few months with her as my sole romantic interest, and I don't want to continue liking someone I have no chance with.",18Feb2017,1
188,"I'm in a rather nice living situation with my best friend in a two-floor, five bedroom house with five roommates. Everyone gets along relatively well, and the house is owned by my best friend's parents. She lives in the only bedroom downstairs, and everyone else (all guys except for me) lives upstairs. I share a bathroom with a guy, but he's relatively clean in that aspect. 

When I moved into the house a year ago, I moved out of one of the worst living situations I had ever been in. My roommates were previously close friends of mine, but absolute nightmares to live with. In the end, none of them were my friends by the time we moved out. My live-in roommate in that apartment instantly became an enemy within weeks of moving in. He abused my cat, stole my food, and regularly invited my friends to hang out at our place- as long as they didn't associate with me. As luck would have it, he ended up homeless by the time our lease ended, so my kind-hearted best friend took him in as our sixth roommate. 

Since he has moved in, he hasn't caused as much trouble, but he has continued his streak of inviting my friends (and my best friend) to hang out and purposely leaving me out. He has even gone as far as to make get-togethers for all of the roommates, as long as I'm not included. Over the past few months, he has been spending more and more time with my best friend, and she has been gradually becoming more and more distant with me. I have been finding out important information about the household and about her long after everyone else in the house knows, no matter how distant they are with her. If she had a crush on someone, I would be the last person to know. 

I feel like I have been replaced. 

In addition to that, on the community whiteboard, one of the roommates had been writing that there was going to be a dog coming soon. Nobody told me about this nor asked me about this. I feel physically ill anytime I smell dog musk, and I'm terrified of big dogs. I wrote back on the whiteboard that we should get an iguana instead, to which they wrote back, ""it's not your house"".  We already have two cats who barely get along, one of which is already sickly thin and losing fur, and the other (my cat) gets distressed easily and urinates outside the litterbox anytime she is stressed out. 

So, I came home Wednesday from work, greeted by a giant black dog and the pungent smell of wet dog and flea treatment that filled the house. The cats are terrified and going to the bathroom EVERYWHERE, and the dog won't stop chasing them anytime they are near it. My one male roommate is pleased as peaches to finally have a dog in the house, and nobody else seems to be affected by the change, but now I can't function at all. 

I'm the type of person who obsessively scents every room of the house, because I can't relax if something smells off. Now everything smells off, the whole downstairs reeks of dog musk, and I've completely lost my appetite anytime I'm in the kitchen or the dining room- the only places I eat. I haven't eaten in days because of this. 

On top of that, the two roommates on either side of my room have opposite sleep schedules from me, and play video games very loudly throughout the night- until EXACTLY 6 am, the moment my alarm goes off. I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, even after I had spoken to them individually about the late-night gaming issue. 

So, Reddit,.... What do I do?

My best friend has Asperger's, so I'm not sure if she knows how this is affecting me. I don't want to come off as bitchy, but I can't keep living like this. I'm not expecting her to put the dog back in the pound, just because I don't like it, but I don't know how to cope either. I'm rapidly losing weight and sanity because of this. 

*Note- male roommate who has been earworm to best friend is very gay. Not a romantic interest. ",18Feb2017,5
189,"Getting some backstory out of the way, I am a freshman in college, and the dorm I live in is set up so that there are two rooms connected by a shared bathroom in the middle (basically a suite). Anyways, things have gotten pretty heated between my suite mates and myself, with them constantly playing rap music as loud as they can on their speakers at 3 in the morning and getting upset whenever I ask them if they could turn it down. Tensions have only been rising, with this week one of my suite mates accusing me of stealing an electric razor that he keeps in the bathroom. Today, as being woken up at 6:30 by my suite mates playing some loud music I had the great decision to drunkenly retaliate by taking down two small UNC women's lacrosse ""posters"" (about 1 foot by 8 inches) that one of my suite mates had tacked above the toilet. Afterwards, that suite mate came up to me and talked about how he had talked to his dad and was going to get me kicked out. At this point I'm unsure about what to do, my RA is out of town for the weekend, and I'm already dealing with quite a bit of relationship stress and more importantly academic stress since I've got 2 midterms Monday and Tuesday. At this point I've rambled on long enough, and I'm asking you guys whether 1) I should be worried about his threat 2) what my next course of action should be. As you can probably tell, I'm a little out of sorts and am not making the best judgement currently so any and all advice is immensely helpful. ",18Feb2017,1
190,"I met this wonderful girl in Febuary 2016 an instantly fell in love. She somehow is the cutest thing I've ever seen and has some beautiful views on the world, which challange mine in an interesting way (basicly: I'm very rational and shes more the emotional type, but in a nice way). In the start she couldn't show any feelings, but she obviously wanted to spend as much time with me as possible, so this went on for a while since I never wanna pressure things. I took a lot of time until we kissed and a lot more until she said ""I love you""... most splendid day of my life :). Nonetheless This would take to long to go on, so I'll go right to the problem:
I had a lot of stress because my parents both getting really sick (for my dad it's possibly lethal..) and my current semester at university was by far the hardest, which made me really depressed, but I'm working on that (just to give some background). The first problem with my girl is, that when she is stressed, she really turns into another person, she often said things that hurt me and was rarely able to be really there for me, which made both of us very sad. Things grow over her head rather fast. I understand that because she had a really rough life (dad died early, sister constantly in hospital and a lot more..), but it still makes me loose trust, since I've allways been at her side when she needed me. The second thing is, that when we talked about our sexual past, I learned she had a huge amount of sexual partners before me. I come from a religious family and even so I dont believe in God, I still think that Sex belongs in serious relationships and never went for one night stands (shes my thrid). Also she has a lot of star crushes from bands and movies, which she kept telling me about in the start, which also annoyed me at some points, because she showed more affection for them than for me. Since she wants to work on her skills in helping people etc. (sorry if this sounds stupid cus I couldnt go into more detail) and I need to fight against my depression alone for some time, because I tend to eat up the negativity of the people close to me, we agreed to go on a break. The thing with her amount of partners (constanly picturing it, cant help it.) along with the star crushes an her lack of affection (sometimes) really made me insecure about sex overall. Im here to ask you people what you think I should do about this topic in our break (probably 2 month). 
Things I same up with:
1. Wait for myself to get along with it (didnt work at all until now)
2. Therapy, which helps overall, but doesnt fix that particular problem
3. Wait for my girlfriend to help me with my insecuritys, but that would very likely be to much for her right now
4. Have Sex with other women to make it ""even"", since for some reason quite a lot are interested in me right  now (funny how a relationshsip makes you seem more attractive haha)
a. tell her about it, honesty is important to me
b. dont tell her about it, which would question my morals extremly, but keep her from getting hurt, she wouldnt find out

All of those dont seem quite perfect..

Ps: Sorry for my bad english, ask me any question if something is unclear
I'm 21, she is 22, both from germany.

192,"So we started dating two weeks ago. We slept together on Valentine's Day on our second date. We go to college together and honestly she doesn't really speak to me. I spoke to her about it yesterday and she said she was sorry and that she was just nervous and sometimes is too scared to talk to people in case she annoys them. 

On our dates she's bubbly, laughs at all my terrible jokes, is completely 100% comfortable with me but in college it's like she doesn't know me. We've gone for a coffee in college and stuff but sometimes it just feels off. We aren't 'official' yet but we're both good friends with the same person and they've said she isn't dating anyone else. 

I'm probably seriously overthinking this and should stfu but I don't want to be messed around because I have been before. I just find it weird how we're completely comfortable on our dates but in college it's like we don't know each other. On top of that we slept together, planned another date for this Saturday (which she canceled but rescheduled for Monday) and haven't spoken much since.",18Feb2017,25
193,"So this would be easy (since I got a pixie cut before) if I hadn't complained so much about it the first time I got a pixie cut. Some background: my mom let me cut my hair into a pixie a year ago, and I really did love it a lot, for like 2 weeks. And then I started missing being able to put my hair up in different styles, so I didn't like the pixie as much as before. Of course, I had to be very verbal about it, especially during the grow-out phase. My hair is currently in a long bob, however, I don't wear it down, since I (started to realize just now how I) don't really like the feeling of hair touching my neck and getting all tangled and sweaty (during summer), but especially I really dislike that feeling of the hair on my neck. I want to get a pixie cut again, also because it feels like a much more exciting haircut than a lob, or any other longer hairstyle. I've thought about it a lot more than the first time I had a pixie, and I'm becoming more and more irritated with this length of hair. I think that even if I wanted to grow out my hair again, I would definitely not complain as much pfff
So I asked my mom recently about it, and she definitely remembered my complaining, and told me maybe I needed to layer my haircut a bit more for some variation, but not cut it so short. So, I need advice on how to convince my mom to let me get a pixie cut, considering that I did complain nonstop when I had my last haircut? I should also mention, that it did take a while for my mom to come around to the idea of me getting a pixie cut last time. 
Thank you so much!!",18Feb2017,0
194,"Hey guys, not sure where else to post this, so here goes.

I have my State Driver's License and I'm looking to go out of country this summer. However, my drivers license weight and eye color say something completely different than what I am. I've gained weight, since that figure was back when I was 17. Also my eye color changed a bit. 

Should I have my Driver's License renewed or reprinted? It doesn't expire for several years. I just don't want to run into any snags with the Passport authority.

196,"I was adopted from an asian country when I was &gt;1 year old. I have lived in America all of my life. I never knew my biological parents, or feel any sort of connection with my country of birth at all. I have absolutely zero connections with anything asian, I don't speak their languages, I couldn't even tell you what province that I was adopted from.

However, my siblings and parents are white. I live in one of the whitest states in the country, and I have never met (or connected with) anybody asian.

I've been searching for differences between race and ethnicity, and still can't figure out what to define myself as. Whenever I fill out standardized tests, job applications, or any official forms I always contemplate which box to check. I have come to the conclusion that I'm racially Asian, however ethnically white. Is this fair? If the question asks me for my race/ethnicity which boxes should I check? Would it be fair for an employer to believe that I am white, but observe my asian appearance at an interview?",18Feb2017,1
198,"I've been pretty insecure for the better part of my early adult life.    In my head I have to be the best, or in that upper level, of any talent I associate myself with, and when I see other people that I consider far beyond me I feel fraudulent.  I also think that I have to meet some sort of prerequisite in order for me to go out and have fun.  For instance if I don't think my physique is looking good enough that day, or my wardrobe just isn't working I won't go out to the bars with my friends.  I realize, even, that no one gives a shit about those things but me, but I just can't seem to change my way of thinking.  Anyone have any advice they can give me on how I can fix this?  I don't really want to be an insecure, self-obsessed jerk anymore

200,"Lately I've started getting really vivid dreams at night. Some are obviously dreams, but some nights the dreams aren't particularly obvious. They can be quite mundane and simple, like just sitting with a friend in a cafe chatting about stuff, texting friends etc.

As a result I've started to lose my grip on things a bit. I can't remember which conversations I've had with people have actually happened, and which I only dreamed about. 

I've found myself accidentally talking about secrets nonchalantly because I thought they knew about them when in reality they ""found out"" in a conversation that never happened, I've started talking to people and continuing conversations only to have them ask what on earth I'm going on about.

Is there anything I can do to ground myself or determine which memories aren't real? I don't like this. ",18Feb2017,1
206,"Moving in with a former coworker into our first apartment. I'm fixing to be 22, I've always relied on my parents to pay for everything, food bills. Always putting the down payments on cars when I choose to trade them in and I feel like it's time to grow up and realize I'm not going to be able to ask my parents for a down payment for a house when I'm in my late 20's or 30's 

I was going behind my parents back and today I told my dad and he said I wasn't right. That my head was all kinds of fucked up for wanting to move because I had it easy and always could go to them for money and that If I do decide to move out to never come back. 

Honestly I'm 21 with a midnight curfew And just want to be able to live life. 

My mom on the other hand is ready for me to leave. She's always bringing up her friends kids who I kinda know cause we went to the same High School and is always saying how they have their own place, go to school and work and that I'm just lazy. She's always comparing me to my cousins who moved out when they were 20, and everyone still acts surprised that I still live at home. 

I know it's going to be hard, and I know I'm going to need to get a second job and struggle a lot. I'm just honestly ready to grow the fuck up and not have everything handed to me.

208,"My neighbors, among other annoying things, have these two dogs that they just leave outside all day. They go through people's trash and leave it strewn all in the street and across people's yards. They stand in *my* yard barking at *me* when I'm going back and forth to my car after coming home with food or groceries. They follow and chase people who are walking by with their dogs. 

I can't even take my dog outside anymore because of it and have to walk my dog in the backyard because they'll run up and want to ""socialize"" but my dog is quite small and these other two dogs are like a mutt and a pitt-mix.

Today my sister was coming in with a pizza and one of the dogs chased her trying to get it. I'm super annoyed with them. And my neighbors don't care, otherwise they'd leave them tied to the **big tree in their own front yard**.

211,"The obvious answer is 'ask her out'. But I don't feel confident about my appearance yet to do so. I want to gym really hard until I feel confident about asking her out but am worried that she might get a boyfriend soon.

I live in a really classy hall, where everyone gets good grades, there's a lot of med students, it's pretty much silent after 9.30 pm and there's virtually no drinking.

I'm a fairly skinny kid. I am fairly toned. But I grew some facial fat over the summer break and I think a sharp jawline would increase my attractiveness massively. I'm also a med student.

She's in my year and she seems quite shy (I think she may be a second-generation Russian?) and doesn't talk much. Maybe that's why she hasn't got a boyfriend yet. I'm fairly sure that she isn't a med student.

My current plan is just gyming my ass off (I'm already eating very well) and hoping to ask her out in 2 months. (Obviously that won't be enough time to build much muscle, and I will continue gyming hard... but perhaps enough time to lose that facial fat and become more toned).

I mean, jesus christ, in the words of Jeremy Clarkson, this is the type of woman you would eat dung for. I can't believe that no-one in my hall has asked her out yet. I am currently just gyming really hard and hoping for the best. I'm sure that it's a race against time lol. Maybe it would be a good idea to let her know that I'm interested but I'm concerned that at the moment I'll be rejected.

This is a one in a lifetime opportunity... I am going to go all out in the gym. Jesus christ she is ridiculously attractive.",18Feb2017,1
