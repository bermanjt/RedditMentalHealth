1,"Hey there is this girl who works next to my gym in the hairdresser. 

She smiled to me and looked after me and I turned around and she was still smiling. I want to see if she will smile the next 1-2 times too and then maybe approach her.

I dont want to bother her during her work because it could be awkward for her (and me). 

How should I approach her. I was in a relationship for quite some time and never approached girls outside of clubs where you actually have to talk.

Hope you guys (and girls) can help me :).",03Jan2017,1

5,"To get straight to the point. I have this feeling I was abused, but have no memory of it. Anyway, my dad is a transvestite, he once did it in public by our home making the neighbors call the police (I didn’t see it myself, but police came). He was also sexually abused at the school he attended.

Anyway, when he stands by me I feel this need to move and don't like it. I'm male adult.

Any ideas about this??

I have been living with my (15 year old) brother for all of my life and I don't know what to do (I am 13 almost 14).  I know the way he treats me is abuse but I don't know if I should stop him before it gets worse, I don't even know what to do. I live with him and my mom (she is also yelled at by my brother), father is divorced but he visits every week. Both are on good terms (not the best but good).  

My brother at a young age had shown signs of severe anger issues, screaming and throwing tantrums constantly, getting angry over small things, breaking objects when angry, and just switching moods (happy to angry) in just seconds. 

He’s 15 now and has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, minor depression, cant get social cues, and some other stuff (I gained all this information by eavesdropping on my mom, I couldn't hear some of the other parts) He has gone to therapy but it didn't work, he kept on refusing to go and when he did he didn't listen to the therapist. He has since stopped going to therapy, he went to a support group for a while but it didn't work either.

He talks very dangerously. He is mean to the LGBTQ+, mean against certain religions, talks about WW2 a lot (does the salute), jokes about making bombs, suicide, etc. I have no idea where he got this from because no one in the household talks or thinks like this. I have to play along otherwise he will call me a dumb and other stuff. I don't know if he's joking when he's saying all of this but he says it constantly and it scares me.

When he is not talking about all of this stuff and when he's in a good mood he acts like a child. Relying on mom too much, calling her asking how to make a hot dog, how to treat a cut, how to change the temperature. He talks in a childish tone, and tells mom that he loves her alot.

He plays video games all day, holing himself in his room and only coming out for food and water. No matter what he is always doing something with electronics. He also has a intense interest in military stuff and war, watching documentaries a lot and having knowledge of what different guns do and advanced knowledge in weapons. 

He is put under a lot of pressure to succeed, we come from a strict asian family. Mother is kind and is understanding of most situations, the only strict people of the family is all of my father's side (successful businessmen). Father tries his best to connect with him but he's only pushed away every time. I don't really like dad because he's snaps sometimes and tries converting me a lot which makes me very uncomfortable.

So onto the abuse and situations that has happened because of it. 

I probably started realising about at the age of 9-10. I sort of realized that having a brother that yells at his mom and belittles her all the time is not normal. He threw things at walls, punched walls, and slammed doors. He would get angry all the time and cry while screaming about how terrible mom/the person who was talking to him is. I thought he would grow out of it but to this day he still does it, less frequently at least. 

I don't remember much at those years so I’m just going to skip to present. So present day my brother is verbally abusing me. He calls me stupid and retarded when I get something wrong or when I say something funny, he threatens to kill me if I anger him in the slightest or annoy him, he does anything to put me down, when he gets really angry he describes how he's going to kill me (stab/shoot me in my sleep), and tells me to “shut the hell/fuck up” whenever he's in a bad mood and I try to talk. He does all or half of this daily, mostly at dinner time because that's the only time he comes out of his room to do stuff.

When he gets really angry because of something I did, he sometimes punches me and I have to run away, lock myself in the bathroom and call mom. He also likes to grab my wrist really tight and hard so I can't run away and forces me to talk (like if he suspects me of stealing his money, or if I lied about something really big to him and he found out.) I know it seems like “what goes around comes around” but his actions are way to extreme and make me fear for my life. I have never fought back against him because it’ll only make him angrier.  

I remember one time I got so scared because he was hitting me and yelling that he was going to kill me that I grabbed a knife for self defence. He has also frightened me to the point of where I sleep with a weapon under my pillow. The worst one probably was when he got really angry because I was playfully teasing him (he doesn't get social cues) and screamed at me he was going to kill me and my friend with a knife or gun calling me a bitch and a slut, and punched me. I had to be called down to the guidance office for that one and people came to my house and questioned me, asking if I would like to live with my dad instead, if i feel unsafe, etc. He just hit me in the chest today right in front of my younger cousin and father’s side of the family, no one noticed though. 

He also does this thing that is very unsettling to me. He would yell and scream at mom calling her multiple curse words and belittling her, then an hour later he would come back down and tell her that he loves her, but never says he's sorry. He acts like nothing ever happened and goes on his way acting that the opposing party forgives him. I have to go with this whenever he does this to me. Except he does not tell me that he loves me after he yells at me he only goes back to his room and a day later I have to talk to him like nothing ever happened.

I don't know how I’m doing. I have never went to therapy and don't plan to. I sort of just feel sad all the time when not in school and don't have much motivation to do things, but I think that's normal for a teenager going through puberty. I like finding distractions for these emotions, school and videogames are some, I think it's a bit unhealthy. I know his abuse is having negative effects on me I just can't figure out what the effects are. I never self harmed (and never plan to for moral reasons) but an idea of escape (running away, just for him to be gone and mom happy) is really nice.


I can't tell my mom all of this she's already unstable and insecure about my brother. She blames herself for him being this way. I need advice so I can handle this without her, she works everyday and is trying her best. I want her to be happy in the end but I also want to be safe from my brother.   

If I report him the social workers say that I will have to live with my dad but I don't want to, I like mom better. If I get him arrested mom will be devastated and I don't know what she will do. If I leave him be he will just get worse, I fear for my life already I don't want to die because of him. 


Please I’m not one to seek out help but this is really getting out of hand. I might just be a dumb 13 year old but I’m really scared. Redditors I need your help and advice so I can survive. How should I handle this situation so my mom can still be happy in the end? How do I protect myself? What should I do?

  **tl;dr**: **My 15 year old brother is verbally and physically abusing (13 year old) me, threatening to kill me daily. Hitting me only when he's really angry. I think he's going to kill me one day and I am scared for my life. What do I do that can still lead to my mom being happy in the end? How do I protect myself? What do I do?**


**Update**:
Went to the counselor and talked about it. Got Dyfus involved, they didnt take him away:( He has to go to a therapist now. Apparently he has Aspergers and was never diagnosed until now. My dad is not letting me live with him, hes a really crappy parent the more I think about it. I still have to live with my brother, its still the same bluh. Honestly I'm just desensitized to all of his shit now, I don't feel fine but ill manage (i think i have some sort of depression). I'm fourteen now so I hope my life gets better, I'll update if anything else happens.

9,"A friend of mine was drunk and invited a male friend to hang out with her. He was stone cold sober. They're just friends. My friends and I were all pretty sure he was interested in her, but she clearly wasn't into him. You can see where this is going. 

Anyway, she says he started kissing her and she was sort of resistant at first (like ""no we shouldn't""), but then she went with it, and then they hooked up. She is really embarrassed now and doesn't think she would have done it sober. He is proud that he finally hooked up with her and has been telling all our friends about it. 

So...is he a piece of shit? Totally fine? Stupid? A rapist? That last term seems pretty harsh since he's generally a nice guy, and he almost definitely would have stopped if she had asked him to, but I wasn't there. A lot of my friends have been throwing the r-word around. I don't know what to think. I feel like there's a big difference between *forcing* someone and taking advantage of them being kinda drunk.

17,"for context, I'm a 20 year old male college student, and I've been depressed for a while now, but only recently admitted it to myself. I used to think that it would get better as I got older, but that clearly isn't working. Last semester was absolutely hell, and I struggled to take care of myself and ended up tanking my grades. Starting to think I may have BPD due to rapid shifts in feeling okay vs. feeling fucking awful, and also getting irritated very easily.

My problem is I don't have health insurance. My mom had medical issues while I was in high school that bankrupted my family (not like we were rich to begin with). Since then my parents couldn't afford to have me on their plan. Each time I go back home I plan on telling them about how I think I need antidepressants, but then I remember how tough they have it and how they can barely feed themselves and my little sis. (I make enough money at my workstudy to pay for my groceries at least). Can a college student with barely any disposable income get health insurance? Would it be safe to buy pills from black-market?

I just don't know how to tell my parents, professors, or peers how hard I'm struggling right now. It seems like no one can even tell. I think about killing myself quite often and how nice it would be to stop living, but I know I can't do that to my family and friends. My family especially has been through so much already. Not like I have the means or the guts to end my life anyways.

tl,dr; really need anti-depressants - possibly anxiety relievers too - to function, but I have no health plan and no disposable income. What do I do? Who do I talk to?",03Jan2017,3
18,"Hi! So I'm 18 years old. I'm Halle by the way. My situation is very complicated. 
I've always been raised in a super strict religion. I've recently figured out that I no longer want to be in this religion. I've gotten tattoos since then. I started dressing the way I want to. 
My friends are the same way. 
So anyways, enough background info. My friends are both hooking up with guys. Like casually. 
I've never been one for relationships. Except for guys who are in the religion. But we never did anything. Except maybe kiss. 
This casual relationship type thing seems very intriguing to me. But at the same time I am so reluctant. There's this guy who I met over a dating website who wants me purely for casual sex. The offer is intriguing to me. At the same time, I feel like I'm holding myself back. 
It's not some ""I'm scared to lose my virginity"" type thing. I'm not really sure what my issue is. I think I might be trying too hard to fit in with my friends. I don't know. I'm rambling. What do you guys think I should do? Thoughts? ",03Jan2017,1

As you can tell from my username. I'm quite young. I'm 17 at the moment. I'm currently at sixth form (first year) studying pretty tough subjects. 

I just feel overwhelmed with all the pressure I'm under. The amount of homework I get is ridiculous. I rarely get Free time. And so on. 

I recently moved so don't have too many friends at my new college. Which is where part of this stress comes in. 

As well as this I'm at the age where I can learn to drive, the thought of which scares me. 

I'm up until very late most nights worrying about my life and the stress gets too much.

23,"I've known my dad was a narcissist for a long time but my mom says he has changed. But I have a specific time I need advise for. I make chicken dip for myself to eat. But my dad demands I share with him when I make it. He doesn't say please or thank you it's just you give me dip because I say. Again no please thank you or anything he just demands!!! I ask him not to eat it bc I make enough usually for one. At first I did make him some I would make 2 batches but it got old the demanding. (That's reasonable) He showed no respect and I understand I am the child and he is my father but it's basic human respect I say pls and thank u and u don't demand someone do u a favor. After awhile (2-3months) of this and after voicing my frustration to not only my father but my mother I had had enough. I wrote my mom a text it was not disrespectful but it was the honest truth. Saying how it angered me and how I felt like he just comes and takes whatever he wants bc he can. He tries to tell me to be respectful but it's utter hypocrisy. My dad saw this text. (Again it wasn't mean just very honest) and he screamed in my face saying I was disrespectful rude ungrateful and he says I was 100% in the wrong. I believe I may not have been 100% in the right bc I should share but he wasn't 100% right either he treats me like he owns me and shows no respect but yet demands it. My mom doesn't like to disagree w my father (he gets very angry and things get ugly to say the least, no physically but mentally and emotionally things used to be worse but I guess he's gotten a little better) but he is still controlling and refusing to admit he does anything wrong.

25,"I have been dating this guy for about a year and a half. I met him about 5 years ago, but have not been in contact with him the whole time. I ran back into him when he had started working with my mom back in October of 2015. Everything has went great despite the ups and the downs. We've had quite a bit of people judge due to the age. He is currently 20 and will be 21 in March. I am currently 17 and will be 18 in June. However, my parents fully approve and my dad even recently got him a job where he works. Anyways, He was very badly in debt when I met him. I've continued to handle his finances as I would if we were married. He appreciates it, but doesn't always follow through with my plans. Every time I seem to start to get him out of debt it seems that something happens (Car troubles, phone breaks, parents need help, ect..) that puts him back in debt. Therefore, I've kind of lost ambition to even figure the finances out. Anyways, he lives with his parents who both have physical and mental illnesses. He pays his father $75 A WEEK to live there when all he does is take showers and sleeps there. My family feeds him even when we go out to each which is typically often. He stays here all but to sleep. A lot of the time he buys drinks and food for his parents. So, the problem is recently a lot has been brought up about engagement. He has said that he was going to ask my fathers permission to propose on 2 year mark. My dad is aware of this due to someone running their mouth. However, this is where the problems come in. About 2 months ago I moved about 45 minutes away from him when I used to live like 15 minutes. Which has been hard on him due to gas. For the simple fact my parents do not like me going places by myself or driving far even though I have my own car and my own job to provide for gas and pay my car payment. I have been giving him money for gas so that he can go back and forth to work along with coming to see me. He has recently asked that he could take a day off a week from coming to see me because we see each other 7 days a week for like 4 or 5 hours a day besides weekends. Therefore, I'm not sure how to feel about that because the duration isn't very long. It's not like it's all day everyday. Today, the subject of his dad wanting him to move out came up. I brought up the idea of him moving up here since it would be closer to me and closer to his job. However, he said no because it would be too far from his parents. Although he comes up here everyday and wouldn't have to go down there everyday. He was looking to rent to buy a house right around the corner from his parents. I feel like I shouldn't have to move all the way down there when he won't move all the way up here. I'm 17 and I feel like I should not have to move away from parents so fast. I feel like with him being almost 21 he should be ready to get out on his own and be independent and not wanna be up mommy and daddy's butt. I feel like maybe hes not mature enough? Maybe hes not ready for commitment? I brought up the fact that he'd move up here if my parents let him move in and he said maybe. Which I know he wouldn't. What is everyones thought on this?

28,"Hi all. Last year, my husband lost his job. We live in a Work at Will state and his firing came to an extreme surprise to himself and as a result our family. He has been at a loss since his job loss. Unfortunately the field he was/is still passionate about is not a large one in our state so it was great for us that he was able to work there. Last year we bought our home and were in the height of our wedding planning -which his employer knew. 

Since then, he has done odd jobs and constantly applying to any and all jobs here. Since he worked solely in that field for so long he lacks experience and education for many places. And often when I ask him to be open to changing career paths he feels like I'm stripping him away from his dreams and a failure at something he has worked hard for. 

The loss of his job has spiraled him into a depression. In addition, since we just bought our home and I'm in a nice job it doesn't feel right to just move elsewhere. 

Any advice for him or us as a newlywed couple in how to move forward. Obviously finances are a big woe in our relationship ah the moment.

29,"It actually sounds strange to think about, but I'm 28 and I've never actually lived alone. I mean, there's definitely a nervousness about having to take care of everything on my own, and not having a ""fall-back"" (my roommates have been awesome about not making me pay rent when I was between jobs).

Really, though, I think my real concern is that they're kind of the center of my social network. They're both social butterflies, and since I live with them, I'm able to meet and hang out with people fairly often. On my own, though, I don't really know anyone, and if I move out, I'll probably wind up living like 45 min away.

Not that it's *that* far, but it'd be 45 minutes in a direction completely opposite to most of the people we hang out with.

I dunno, for some reason, I've had a difficult time making friends as an adult, and I guess I'm worried that when I move out, I'm going to become a complete shut-in.

Plus, I'm gonna need to seriously start adjusting my budget, as I'm not *entirely* sure how I'm going to afford rent. Still, it's an issue I clearly have to solve at some point.

We often will meet up for wine and dinner to catch up and text all the time. Recently she informed me she found texts on her boyfriend's phone from his ex. He still maintains a relationship with his ex and hangs out with her frequently. When she confronted him he basically said he didn't consider them in a relationship since he doesn't like labels. They have been dating for 3 years. Ultimately she decided to work through it and she is still dating him. What kills me is she is the nicest girl ever and he totally takes advantage of her. She helped pay for his DUI and she paid 3 months rent when he lost his job. Despite all that he cheats on her. I expressed to her strongly to dump his ungrateful ass.

31,"At the start of 2015 we started dating, i was leaving to work abroad 2 months later, we had an intense 2 months getting to know eachother, she pulled out of a holiday to spend more time with me, I was pulling sick days off work to be with her. 

Mid June she came and visited me for a weekend, and wanted to talk about the future and I just wanted to enjoy that moment, much like everything we'd experienced to that point. 

We talked for the rest of the year and I came over to Australia to visit her at the start of 2016 for 6 weeks. meet her family, it was magic, everyday we did something special, pictures upload to facebook, everyones so happy for us. On our last day together she sat me down and told me she ""liked me more than like"".

I head home to the UK and pick up 2 dead end low wage jobs so i'm flexible enough to leave by the end of the year. She starts university again, the pressure is through the roof, i was there to listen, talk, offer assistance, support. She breaks up for holidays and we talked about her coming over but it was too late and the flights were too expensive in june to do even though I offered to pay half. We talk about me coming over and she tells me I can move in with her, and she'll support me and my life over here. I get her a sold out ticket for our favourite band I had just seen in london who were touring down in Australia in july, she cries when she finds out I bought it. We get tickets for a festival to spend new years together. Uni starts back up again in august and the pressure ups again, i'm hearing from her less and less, but i've bought my tickets at this point, and have a work visa so I can come out for longer, and pursue this relationship with her more seriously. 

As the months roll by she talks to me more about how anxious she is, starts to tell me that I need to come out here for myself so that the expectation isn't so high. 2 weeks before I come out I get a concerned call saying she is freaking out about me coming, I organised some alternative accommodation with family, tell her not to worry and that I want to be there to talk to her about this. 

I arrive, day 2 of being here we meet up. Have lunch, talk about my family, and what it was like saying goodbye to my ill father. She tells me that I can't feel restricted by his illness and that I should focus on living my life. We move on and she tells me how difficult her year has been, and how she has felt her life has been on hold, her feelings have shifted and that she started feeling something towards someone at university which she tried to fight off because she was scared, I had never been made aware of this and to hear it for the first time crushes me after all I had done to try and be here. She drops me home and we sit in the car, agonizing over how to say goodbye, she wants to know that the one thing she didn't do it hurt me, but i tell her, that is all it has done to me, she sobs has a panic attack and I calm her down. She tells me she is upset because of her anxiety, her emotions, the pressure, i don't make her cry she makes herself cry because she is so confused about her feelings. We reminisced about a few nice times. I can't find the words to say goodbye, she said her brother would like to see me, that this isn't goodbye forever. I say goodbye.

The next day I sent her a video I made from our trip together earlier that year, she asks ""what happened to us?"". I ignore her message. a few days later ""i'm worried you're not in sydney"" ignore.a few days later ""do you still want your festival ticket"" - i'd rather she sells my ticket then lose out on the money so i reply ""no"". Christmas goes by, nothing, i've checked if she had put anything on facebook and I ask my sister if she's heard anything, she has been posting photos to her instagram from south america for a few weeks with friends, I feel sick, i just don't know her anymore, new years goes by, nothing.

34,"So someone working at a car rental place was backing out of a building and into my parked car and made what seems to be paint damage and scratches.  I was buying something and was just coming back to my car.  Luckily I was there to witness it otherwise that guy might've just did what he needed to in the first place and shutdown the gates after that and I might've been SOL or he could've been honest and left a note but I read their Yelp page and it wasn't good.  



Anyways I filled out an incident report from the car rental place and he filled out the info he needed including admitting it was his fault and called their claims department now I am just waiting for the person that assess the damage to call me.  My car is still pretty new.  The sensors in front of the bumper still works.  Like I said it was just paint damage and scratches but that is just looking at it from my point of view.



I am not sure what exactly happens next because I've been driving over 10 years and never got into an accident until now.  I suppose once the person assesses the damage, I go to the auto body of their preference and they look at my car too.  Since they might suggest an auto body shop for me to go to since they might be working together to save money or whatever and both of them agree I don't need a new bumper, should I insist on a new bumper?  What if they say no?  And if they give me a new bumper, how would I be able to tell if they gave me a new bumper or not?  In situations like these can I go to an auto body shop of my choice?


The damage might not look like much but another car did hit it and it might cause me problems in the future.  Also any other advice related to this would be nice.",03Jan2017,1
35,"When I was little, I was brought up catholic so I know what I remember from ten years ago. Lately, I've been struggling with my mental health as well as my physical health. I've tried many ways to get through the day and try to make the most out of life but lately something has been feeling different. I feel like I've lost my way worse than I ever have. I find myself looking to God's help because I feel like I have no other option. When I was at work the other day, a customer pulled me aside and talked to me about God and for once, I actually listened. I'm scared to go back to church or open up to people I know. If there's anyone with strong beliefs that could maybe give me an idea of a direction to go, I'd really appreciate it.

36,"I'm a 20 year old, still living with my single mother as my college is within walking distance. She is dating a guy who has cheated on her multiple times and had a coke habit for the first three quarters of 2016. Recently she has had her boyfriend over very often, and he has been commenting on my mary jane habits. I've quit smoking since then, but I can't stand the sight of him since he himself smokes it, as well as having that coke problem sitting over his head. I overheard him talking/criticizing me for a little over three weeks, and my mother made me feel insane when I brought it up to her the first time and denied it all. Towards the last few days before I quit, a friend of mine made some edibles. One of which I gave to the boyfriend, to see his reaction. After giving it to him, I went to the restroom and could overhear him telling my mother that she should storm into my room and remove anything I have to do with the drug. She openly stated no, but when I asked her about it she again acted if I was hearing things. Things slowly got worse, I even made threats saying that I would cause physical harm to him if he were to come back; she then accused me of being ashamed of her, completely changing the topic. I denied it then sent an angry reply to which she didn't respond. Last night he was back, after I had worked a total of 24 hours over the day of new years eve and new years day. I sent her a text telling her that I was now ashamed of her, and that if he was not gone within twenty minutes that I would fight him. My mother will no longer look at me, and often slams her door shut if she notices me out of my room.

TLDR:
be college student living with single mother and other family members. get criticized about once a week pot habit by former coke head and constant smoker. gets worse over a couple weeks, leads to threats of physical violence
mother accuses me of being ashamed of her, deny it. new years day return home from work to see that he's here, immediately text her that I am now ashamed of her, then go to sleep. wake up and have a few hostile text messages shoot back and forth. my mother will now slam her door shut when she notices me out of my room, and gives me little to no eye contact, doesn't speak to me either.

43,"Greetings! 
 
I am a 19 years old boy from Norway (if that matters), and I don't know where to go on with my life from here. I'm gonna start with some backstory. I recently graduated from (our equivalent of) high school. I chose a music program, out of pure love for music. I did not feel like I was good enough to go all-in on music, so I decided to use the school year of 2016-17 to catch up on some subjects. I take maths and physics, and the way I'm doing it right now, I'll be able to cover most requirements for higher educations where scientific subjects are needed. 
 
But know, I don't know if this is the right thing for me to do. I've always liked science and maths, but I feel like I don't master it the same way I have been earlier, and I'm starting to think that this isn't for me. I know I'll be able to finish this year, I just don't know if it'll be worth it. 
 
Another thing is that I really do like languages, and I'd love to learn more and experience more. I enjoy learning about languages and culture, and could see myself doing that for a while. I don't know what I'll do with it later, though, and that's a bit if a problem for me. 
 
I would also like to be doing YouTube or stream or something similar, but this isn't anything I'd blindly pursue. If it happens, it happens. 
 
tl;dr I don't feel like I'm good enough musically to pursue that dream and go all-in. I study maths and science now, but don't see myself enjoying it in the long run, would like to learn languages, but don't see that many opportunities. Don't know what to do. ",03Jan2017,1

47,"... but I need advice, or help, or support about a current and extremely recent situation. 

I suffered from PIED (Porn Induced Erectyle Dysfunction) while I was with my now ex-gf. Back then I didnt realize that I did have that problem/a porn addiction. We broke up a little over a year ago and lost contact. She remained friends with my friends, some of which I have known since elementary school, which was totally fine with me. We didnt have any contact through the group, so ofc I didnt care. As time went on I lost the negative feelings toward her and we met this new years eve. I was kind of glad to see her again, I thought we could be at least cool with being around eachother. She joined our discord channel after some time again the past few days and we had fun. 

Anyways, she was playing some weird game where you get a dick trophy at the end (don't ask) and she was like 'Oh well, I only got the bronze dick... thats my life I guess.' The two friends of mine laughed. I know they sent messages back and forth, probably joking about my inability to perform in bed back then... she probably talked to them about it... and they basically mocked me for it while I was there... When I asked whats so funny they just said they cant tell me, that they feel bad and that it's kind of 'a snitch thing to do'... She was uncomfortable with the situation too, for an obvious reason... I think... idk.

I just left the channel without saying anything. I'm not even mad about her telling my friends about the problem. Even if they knew, up until this point they treated me with the same respect as before. I just feel betrayed now. Maybe some guys know what I mean when I tell you that porn addiction and it's symptoms are something I battle with constantly... it's just a silent battle inside of me... and I feel like if they knew about all of this they'd not make fun and memes of it... either that or the mockery would get worse.. Shit idk what to do? Do I confront my friends? My ex? I really feel overwhelmed right now... please help... ",03Jan2017,1
49,"Hi Reddit. I don't really know where to begin. I guess to start off, I have never really felt secure in any relationship. I have never ever felt like the person really wanted to be with me. I have never felt love from anyone except one person. The first person I can really say that I ever loved. But it was a really intense relationship, and she broke up with me for someone else. Years later, in the most promising relationship I have ever had, I feel this same way. As I have in every relationship. I don't feel like she loves me. I never feel like I'm enough. As stupid as it sounds, whenever i see her post something about some other guy, I automatically get snapped into this manner of thinking that somehow, I'm shitty, she deserves bettert than me, and would be happier with [whomever she tagged or wrote something nice about on social media]. This has caused a lot of problems in our relationship.

I read somewhere that this is due to some form of emotional trauma as a child. All I can think of was that my dad was always angry when i was a kid. I dreaded being picked up by him after school. He would never hit me or anything - he would get angry and promise to spank me so hard I couldn't sit for a month, but that was it. 

What could have possibly made me this way that I question a girl who appears to love me deeply? Why do I have such insecurity? If it's any help. I suffer from depression, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and my social skills aren't the greatest.

Can any kind redditor help me here? I've read that the first step is stopping the negative thoughts, but I wouldn't even know where to start.",03Jan2017,1

53,"I've known this girl since middle school and we are both early twenties now. We have been close on and off throughout the years. We recently became close again for about the past year. We would consider each other best friends. A week ago, we had a talk where I told her that I thought she was amazing and perfect etc. but that we had a friendship barrier that I don't think we could overcome. She agreed with how I saw things. Since then, we had a few conversations regarding liking each other, seemingly getting closer and closer to admitting it. This all led up New Year's Eve. (we hung out during the day and had separate plans for midnight) when we kissed. We had a conversation and finally admitted we had some feelings for each other. She had been worried that if we kissed it would be too sibling-esque, however we both realized it wasn't and it felt right. Anyway, she had a New Years kiss with another guy that night and they flirted but nothing happened. I told her I wanted to kiss her again and then she basically retreated and said she didn't want to dismiss anything or pursue anything right now and that she enjoyed kissing but we shouldn't do it again for the sake of our friendship. We hung out yesterday and I immediately kissed her and she at first said we shouldn't but quickly continued. We had a looong conversation and kissed throughout on and off. It concluded with basically me telling her I like her and want to be with her and her saying she liked me too but ""needed time to figure out what she wanted"" because she had a lot going on and didn't really want anything serious with anyone but wanted to consider it. Today, we talked again and she told me she had feelings for me and she wishes we could work right now but we can't. She said she is so frazzled with life and can't be tied down right now. She also said she wants to see what things are like with other guys (not dating, but she's been really reserved throughout life and wants to try not being that way). She said that there is a guy in her home state that she has strong feelings for but she doesn't know what they are and knows they could never work, but wouldn't feel right pursuing me feeling that way about someone else. She also told me that she just needs basically a mental cleanse and that things could change in a week or two (but they also couldn't) and she thinks that one day we will date, but she doesn't know for sure obviously. So, for now, she wants us to remain best friends and no kissing or anything so she can get her life together and be independent without stringing me along.

Sorry for the wall of text, it's just been a very overwhelming week and I know all I can do is give her the time and hope she still likes me. But, I feel like absolute horse shit and would like someone's interpretation of the situation. Thanks in advance, it means a lot. Happy New Year.",03Jan2017,1

59,"Hello, all. This is a newly-made throwaway account, as my... experience, only happened about an hour ago, and I can't really use my regular account to describe what exactly went down (no pun intended).

So, just to begin with, everything that took place in this story is entirely my fault and I realise that, I don't need anyone telling me I made a dumb decision or that I didn't think it through because believe me, I knew it was dumb at the time, and I've been thinking about it for years now. I'm a 17 year old guy from -insertplacenamehere- and I've been interested in sucking a dick since I knew dicks could be sucked. I'm straight, as I've now 100% certified, but I've always had this fantasy. Luckily for me, as it turns out, I've never had the chance to follow through in this dream of mine.
Until tonight. 

See, I've been in a bit of a depression of late for various reasons. Not that I'm ever anything but depressed, but I've been feeling it more than ever recently. Today was a proper low note - I didn't get out of bed until about 6pm, sat about doing fuck all but feeling sorry for myself, and spoke to my girlfriend on the phone for a while. For some reason, the urge hit me to suck a dick, real bad. So, being the amoral, impulsive jackass that I am, I hit up Craigslist and started perusing the ""men seeking men"" section, to no avail. 
Then, I posted an ad of my own, which received many replies, but only one of which was actually feasible. So, nervous as fuck and just about as excited, I arranged for this guy to come and pick me up so we could have some ""NSA fun"", bearing in mind I live in a pretty rough city and it was after midnight. 

Now, there are just too many red flags here for me to count, but, me being a stubborn cunt, I simply pocketed my pen knife in preparation for the worst case scenario and sneaked out into the night to meet my Craigslist lover. I realise that this is horrendously disrespectful and disloyal to my girlfriend, who I fucking love more than anything in the world, but I didn't and still don't really consider it cheating. I just really wanted to see what it was like to suck a dick, it didn't mean anything and it was only the once. 

Anyway, I got in the guy's car, and oh boy. I was worried the moment I saw him, mid-40s, kind of brutish, real scrunched up face. I thought I was going to die. 
He immediately put me at ease by being a genuinely chill, friendly guy, so of course I didn't want to be a dick and bail last-minute when it was me who offered the blowjob to anyone who was willing to take it up on the Internet. We drove to this little industrial estate near my house and parked up in the shadows near the back of the lot, at which point I got worried again. Thankfully, he was being really understanding about the whole thing, trying to ease me into it, as he was already hard and ready to go. I tried my best to get into what was going on, but the guy was just too unpleasant on the eyes for me to do so, not that I'm much of a looker myself, but still. I didn't want to straight up say no to the dude as he was my ride home - not normally an issue but again, rough area after 2AM, and I don't blend in with the locals at all - and I didn't want to have inconvenienced him by making him drive the entire 8 minutes it took for him to get to me, so I kissed him as enthusiastically as I could and did as much for him with my mouth as I could swallow (oh, God, no pun intended) and then wanked him off for a bit, because that's the kind of person I am. I think he could tell I was pretty uncomfortable and he finished himself off, but he never once stopped telling me how grateful he was and how attractive I was throughout the ordeal. Then he drove me back up to my house, making small talk along the way, which I appreciated. He thanked me again, told me to message him if I ever felt like doing it again, and then I got out and he drove off. I went back inside, washed my hands, face, and rinsed my mouth out, then came into my room and began writing this. My legs haven't stopped shaking since I got out of his car and I just feel... off. I kind of want to cry but I've felt like this all day so I guess that's nothing special. I regret what I did and wish I hadn't done it, but I can't erase the past and now this is something that I've actually done, in real life, not twenty minutes away from my own home, while my girlfriend slept sweetly, blissfully unaware of what her boyfriend was doing on the other side of the city.

What the fuck is wrong with me and how do I recompense for what I've done? 
And no, I wasn't raped. The guy would have stopped if I had asked him to, I hope, but I didn't, because I value other people's happiness over my own soundness of mind, it seems. Also, the legal age of consent in the UK is 16, so this was all above-board, which somehow makes it feel even more depraved.

This however requires me to utilise CBT techniques to compose/collect myself before having to do this.

65,"So recently I applied for a three month summer internship with a major company in Jacksonville. A few weeks ago, I was selected to be an intern. The pay is good, the location is a few hours from Tallahassee (I am an FSU student) and my research on Glassdoor shows mostly positive remarks about the company. The main issue here is that I do not own a car and that limits any apartments not in walking distance.

Since this is my first internship away from home (Royal Palm Beach), I am somewhat nervous about finding a place. My hiring manager suggested Craigslist in an email but I don't feel comfortable using it.

I recently found an apartment complex that is walking distance from CSX (where I would be working) called the Metropolitan Lofts in Jacksonville that offers furnished apartments. The only thing that makes me reluctant is the high price tag of $1700 per month for a studio apartment. Keep in mind that I would be in Jacksonville for only three months.

So, does the apartment sound like a good idea? Your feedback is appreciated.

66,"So, my mother is moving to the islands in a few years. I'm a college student, with dreams of being in business and technology. 

My worst fear is something happening to my mother while I'm 10,000 miles away. She'll be alone, I can only assume she will be pursued by men of all types and I just am worried sick about her. 

I go to school about 200 miles from my home. I occasionally visit, but I talk to her every day and always stay home during the holidays and summer. 

We had a rough time in my teen years (we still do, on occasion). We've improved greatly. This is pivotal. Whenever my relationship with someone starts to get really well, things always go south immediately. It's almost as if life is karmactic injustice and telling me ""No, you don't get to have a perfect relationship with someone"". 

So my fear is that my mother will die if I get too close to her. Or... if I get close to her and she dies then I'll be fucking wrecked and devastated. 

I can't keep thinking like this. I need this nightmare of constantly thinking about her death to stop. 

I want to be happy and think of good times with her, not worry about her death every time we have fun. 

I know the world is harsh and cruel. Bad things happen to good people. But I don't want them to happen to her. She's 50, she should have another half-century to go.

We started back up our fling and things went really well for a few days. 

Jared was supposed to come over and visit me when I got back to college and we were supposed to hang out and possibly do other things. Within the past three days Jared and I have spoken about our fling and restarting it back up and even mentioned it today when I confirmed if he would come over when I returned to school. 

Fast forward a few hours and Jared is tagged in a picture on Facebook with his ex, both looking very happy. I text Jared and tell him that we need to talk when I get back, in person, and he says okay. Then I decide that tonight may be better because I want to know what's going on, so I text him and he states that he is back with his ex girlfriend as of yesterday...

Now let's remind ourselves that Jared, in the past three days, including yesterday and today both confirmed that he would visit me and be physical with me so that means he was saying these things while trying to get back with his ex.

68,"Hi Reddit,

Two days ago I met a man from Craigslist who was asking for someone to help list his items on eBay as a sort of odd job on the side. For compensation I would be allowed a percentage of the sale price of his item, and give him the rest of the proceedings in cash.

However, after meeting him he promptly gives me the items he needed to sell (some pet care supplies; electronic fence collars and some trimmer blades). No questions asked; when I asked him to tell me a bit about himself, he got defensive and wanted to know ""Why do I need to know about him?"" He didn't tell me is last name and drove off, promising more stuff to sell ""next week"". 

I sent him another e-mail asking him for his e-mail and some more contact information. He refused to tell me his last name but finally responded with an email, which I did some searching online. With that I did find his full name, along with some extremely shocking info.

He was arrested several times in Florida for various thefts and drug charges in the past, and did jail time for almost a decade. He also was arrested in my state as a pretrial felon for assault charges and bailed for $50k.

I'm extremely worried and want all of this to stop. What do I do? Report him to the police? Pretend I don't know and just tell him I'm not interested anymore? I'm genuinely worried about my safety. I'm also concerned that the items he asked me to sell may be stolen after looking at this information.

78,"Three years ago, I met my girlfriend in high school, a Czech foreign exchange student. We instantly hit it off, fast forward to now, we see each other about twice a year in person, along with Skype and Kik to stay in contact. Obviously I'd like if we could be physically together more.

Currently, I'm enrolled in my third year of university in the US, and she is enrolled in her second year of dentistry in Prague (out of 5). She attends there for free, whereas if she came to the US, it'd be 8 years and would cost a fortune of out-of-state tuition bills. She applied after high school and while she got into plenty of schools, did not receive nearly enough financial aid to justify abandoning free education in Czech. Whenever we talk however, she always vents about how she is lonely and stressed, since she lives alone in a city apartment and dentistry school in Czech is pretty cutthroat. She has told me plenty of times that she wants to move to the US and live with me once she graduates or some other allowable circumstance.

I know I'm leaving this pretty open ended, but I really feel like there's something more one or both of us could be doing or should do in the future to ensure less stress and more physical connectivity. Does anyone have any suggestions to help the situation, or are aware of any programs in the US or in Czech that could potentially help?

Potential solutions I've thought of include: 

Going to Czech on a student or work visa after college to attend graduate school or to work once I graduate with my Bachelors here.

Her coming here (if she really gets fed up with dentistry school) and either reapply for school hoping for more money this time around, or attending a technical school and doing something aside from a four-year education.

Thanks ahead of time!",03Jan2017,1
80,"I am a 25yr/f, new to reddit advice. I'm a little desperate for advice.

BF and I have been dating for about 4 months. He's 10 years my senior, has insomnia, maybe apnea and possibly some other health issues. It hasn't been the smoothest relationship, but we get along and connect very well. He lost his job a couple days before Christmas.

He's always had a sleep problem, he acknowledges this and knows it's affected his past relationships, and he is aware it's affecting me to some degree right now. We've talked about it and are trying to work it out.

My question is how can I support him through his job loss and sleep issues. As with many men, he doesn't like talking or sharing his issues. In the past, he had a routine - he would have to wake up to get to work in the afternoon, get off around 12am-1am (sometimes earlier depending on the day), come home and do his own thing and fall asleep anywhere between 4am-8am, wake up past noon. My work schedule is not a typical 9-5 so I can adapt to his schedule.

Lately however, it's gotten to a point where he sleeps at 8am, wakes up at 4pm-6pm, and the cycle repeats. Sometimes if he would wake up a little earlier, and take a nap in the afternoon (5pm-8pm for example).

I am a meek person by nature and don't like confrontation. I don't believe in trying to change a person, but I am wondering if in this situation, me putting my foot down on this is justified? Or alternatively, how can I motivate him through this time?",03Jan2017,1
81,"This is a long story that begins when I was 13 years old. All my life my brother has been a mean, vicious person who used to hit me and insult me. This behavior changed when as a 13 year old he (20) walked in on me in the bath. It seemed like an embarrassing mistake on my part not locking the door at first, but after that he began to approach me regularly trying to act like my friend, and began intentionally picking the lock to my door to catch me changing. He would try to talk about sex with me. I could go on and on about the things he did, but he was essentially attempting to groom me for a period of months, and he only stopped because he got scared because I almost told my parents.  

A couple of years after that he moved across the US and I thought I was free of ever having to deal with him again, but I was forced to tell my parents what happened when about a year ago (I was 22 at the time) he decided to move back to our state. He was going to stay at our house for a few days, and I absolutely could not handle that. I broke down in tears and told my dad what happened, and they sent him off to the new place he was living while I stayed in a hotel for a night. I never saw him. My dad seemed to doubt me, and my mother seemed to think it was something that my childhood imagination made up. She told me, ""you tend to exaggerate"".  

Recently, I learned that my brother is actually a convicted sex offender. He was arrested for, not surprisingly, the possession of child pornography. We have an unusual family name so a quick Google search of his name shows everything. I confronted my dad about this, hoping he didn't know. But he did. He knew about the conviction way before I told him what happened, but somehow he still doubted me. He then told me that my mother doesn't know, and that knowing would ""kill her"". They still send my brother presents at Christmas and shit, though I think my dad isn't bold enough to go visit him anymore.  

This has severely damaged my relationship with my parents and my ability to trust them. I want to tell my mom about the arrest so she will believe me about how he groomed me, but my dad has kept this from her for five years and telling her will obviously start shit. What can I do to possibly trust my parents again?",03Jan2017,58

84,"Hello,

Since I was a kid I've had some mild difficulty breathing during exercise and most commonly before bed. My mum took me to the doctor and they said it wasn't asthma so I think I never took any medications however the problem persisted. I'm 25 now and I got used to this problem, it doesn't happen that often and its not terribly critical so to speak. 

My symptoms are basically breathing difficulty while I fall asleep, I feel chest tightness, cannot get a satisfying breath, wheezing and coughing. It gets very annoying as it many times won't let me sleep but when I eventually fall asleep it'll be gone by morning.  This only happens for a couple weeks a year probably and then its gone for the rest of the year. 

During this time I also get the same symptoms while exercising. Although I must say exercising has always been difficult for me cos I often feel I'm out of breath and I get tired very easily but don't usually experience the wheezing, etc. 

I'm 25 now and for the last couple months I've experienced these symptoms but more severely. They usually won't be gone in the morning and sometimes will last all day. I am even getting these symptoms when I simply walk at a faster pace. 

I asked a coworker and she suggested I buy salbutamol, which I did. I didn't know it was an inhaler, I thought it was either pills or a syrup. 

I've tried it twice already in the last two nights and it helps so much! The symptoms are completely gone within five minutes and I can sleep so well. 

I am wondering if maybe I do have asthma then? Should I go to the doctor to get tested again? Or is there something else that is going on?

Thanks!",03Jan2017,1

87,"Last week, an old friend of mine unfortunately passed away. Growing up we shared the same social circle but haven't talked in 4-5 years. His funeral is this week and I am conflicted about going. 2 years ago, another friend of mine passed away and I attended his funeral. It was the first funeral I attended for someone that I knew. The funeral was very sad and seeing my deceased friend's family broke my heart, and as much as I hate to say it, I felt worse off about his passing after attending his funeral although I did feel good for just ""being there"". The point is, that experience made me really dislike funerals. Cut to now where i feel conflicted. On the one hand, from the experience of my previous friend's passing, I hate funerals. On the other, I feel like it is selfish of me to not attend and disrespectful to those that will be attending. I don't know what to do. ",03Jan2017,2
88,"I met this girl on Twitter. We spoke for about two weeks or so (phone calls, FaceTime, etc) and got relatively close. She then invited me to spent NYE with her at her college that was 3 hours from me. The drive exhausted me (I left out early in the morning) and then we got to her place I took a nap. When I woke up, she was getting ready for the party we were going to later that night. I'm a relatively low partier, so when we got there I stayed primarily to myself and became more and more outgoing as the night went on. Throughout the night her friends would come up to me and ask why I wasn't talking to her. Honestly, I had no answer. That night we kissed after the ball drop and then I went back to her room where we kissed again and went to sleep in the same bed. The following morning I told her I'd text her later and she said ""okay, let me know when you make it home safe."" I did, also apologizing for not talking to her much, and got no response. I asked her what was wrong and she beat around the bush and then altogether stopped replying once more. I unfollowed her on Twitter, blocked her on iMessage, and deleted her from Snapchat. She unfollowed me too and subtweeted ""Lmao CHILDISH."" The next day I brought it up again because she retweeted something specifically from my profile. She said she was bothered that I barely talked to her and didn't know why I'd think things were going to go back to ""normal"" when I barely held conversation and thought a text was going to fix it. I asked why her friends kept coming up to me, telling me she thought I was a nice guy, and to go talk to her,  and she told me that she talked to them about me not saying much but never explicitly told them to come up to me, they just did. We sent a few texts back and forth, and I explained I didn't want to force conversation and wanted her to have fun with her friends. She only came up to me once asking why I was talking and I told her I would but never did. I like this girl. We have a lot in common. I'm just not extremely talkative when I first meet someone. She blocked me on iMessage before I could get my last text to go through, saying that I hoped things could go back to normal and that I thought she was cool and wanted to know if she was still interested or not (a question she wouldn't answer). Should I drop it altogether? I was thinking about waiting a few days and then trying to bring a conversation up on Twitter but I don't want to seem overbearing or like I'm harassing her. I just want to show effort. ",03Jan2017,1

90,"So I’m currently 20 and I feel I’ve gotten nowhere with my life. I have had confidence issues for my whole life and I believe it has been caused by my parents’ divorce. To start with the back story, my parents got divorced when I was very young because i was not planned. My mother and father are both extremely stubborn and because of this the divorce case lasted for over ten years. (one of the longest in my province). The reason the case lasted so long was because my father kept fighting for half time and was not granted it. Both my parents tried to keep my twin brother and I out of it until I was around 8 years old. From a young age I always struggled with school and my brother excelled and this is where the problems started to occur. My father has an extremely loud and aggressive temper when things don’t go his way, and it would be sparked by the smallest incident. He began taking it out on me by yelling, swearing and slamming doors and cupboards when I didn’t understand my homework. The part that affected me the most was when I would be crying and he would continue to tell me how “Fucking stupid” I was. 
Fast forward to today, I had been apprenticing as a carpenter for the past 2 years though I was Let Go in the beginning of December because my boss said I was not at the level of training he wanted me to be at. He would make observations of how unconfident I was and how I would constantly beat myself up over every screw up.  I would get confused very easily and am a very slow learner.

When my mother learnt I was laid off she sat me down and told me of how worried she was for me that I was not going anywhere with my life (In a very demeaning matter)and told me that I should have done better in high school if I had just “tried harder”. It was extremely insulting because I have tried to bring up to my parents that I struggle in school and they always think the answer is that I’m not trying hard enough.

So in summary I feel I struggle with confidence because of my parents’ attitude towards me. I am afraid that I don’t know what to do with my life right now and would like some thoughts.
Thanks

I'm worried about possibly losing my merit scholarship to that school, as well as my complete loss of motivation in that class. I just had Christmas break and had the opportunity to catch up on work, but didn't do any work at all. I have no motivation for that class.

I've done very well throughout high school. I've studied hard, done well in my classes and standardized tests, but have on nail in my pack that is really weighing me down.

95,"So here's a little story:

I'm a 22-yo kissless virgin who has been fighting depression for years now. I used to live somewhere else and I was attending the first stages of high school when I got diagnosed and everything, sort of, started falling apart. I didn't find the motivation for school work and eventually ended up dropping out and doing nothing for a year. I contemplated suicide (still do) and I also was close to having a girlfriend: she was the only one who really understood me and we were close friends. I never was courageous enough to do what was necessary to start a relationship with her even though I tried; I guess I got friendzoned. She's about a year older than me (I skipped a year in kindergarten). I moved away from that town and we eventually lost touch and our relationship was forever destroyed.

I got back to high school at the end of 2015, after 4 years of inactivity and my own personal hell as a reality. It still kinda is such. There's this girl I feel very attracted to... but she's 16. She could be 17 soon, idk. The very fact of acknowledging this IRL is just unthinkable to me due to obvious societal judgement, even though I would consider it lacking in understanding and reasoning in this case because I am no shady guy.

I have never had sex before and I consider her mentally mature as a person. I must say there are 18 yo girls less smart than her. And I also must clarify it is not common for me to feel like this toward people her age. I even feel weird about it myself but I figure, the more I let time take its toll on me (biologically speaking) the more ""impossible"" any sort of encounter with her is gonna get.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I just want to find a way to at least date her without repercussions and, of course, if she's comfortable with it.",03Jan2017,2
96,"I am 17 and my parents died when I was young. M was a friend of my dad's and has been my legal guardian since my dad passed, when I was 13. Due to some complicated issues I won't go in to, M, his son N (17), and I all live at the same house I grew up in. This will legally be my house when I'm 18, in November. The house does not belong to M at all.

When I was 13/14, I noticed M seemed to spend a lot of time outside, no matter the weather or temperature. There were several occasions where I caught him smoking. The first times I caught him and asked what he was doing, he tried (and failed, horribly) to cover it up and say ""What? I wasn't smoking. Why would I do that? You're just seeing things."" Eventually he realized it was impossible to cover up so he started saying it was just cigarettes, which I believed, but was uncomfortable with. But one night when I was 14, I caught him smoking something that smelled really funny. I confronted him about it and he straight up told me it was pot. I was pretty scared when I found out. He showed me where he was growing it, in my shed. I know he also smokes cigarettes, too. Since then he got rid of the pot in the shed, now I don't know where he gets it.

I know there are worse drugs than pot, but it's disgusting and makes me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe. I've politely asked him to stop but it leads to a shouting match starting with him getting really defensive, and refusing to stop smoking. Then it leads to him cursing and calling me a bitch. I've tried to compromise by asking him to do it outside, when I'm not home. No luck, he still does it. He's introduced it to his son N, who smokes it in his room. I don't want them to smoke in the house because the smoke can damage the walls and cause the whole house to smell like shit. I just came back from spending the day at a friend's house and I can hardly breathe because he/they sprayed Febreze everywhere to attempt to cover up the smell, but it just smells like pot and flowers. I already had a cough because I was sick last week, but now I can't stop coughing.

I also have a suspicion M may be using my money to buy his pot and cigs. He has access to the estate money so he can buy groceries and things for the house, and the amount he spends for groceries is usually around $200, which is WAY too much imo. Considering a carton of cigs (I know he buys cartons, I've seen the cupboard where he keeps them) is about $50, that leaves $150, which is about the average price for groceries. He basically lives off of the estate money and rarely works (he runs his own business). I have no idea if he's buying pot with my money, though, but I wouldn't be surprised.

I also live in California where pot was just legalized.

I'm 17, and there's only about 10 more months left until I turn 18. When that time comes, I'm going to kick them out of the house, but is there anything I can do until then? I've been getting out of the house as much as I can, but when I am here, it's hard for me. Not just because of the pot (even though it's a large factor), but because he's a shitty guardian who only looks out for himself and his son. But that's another post for another day. It's been increasingly hard for me to even be at home. I feel unsafe and think he might be searching through my locked room for money when I'm gone.

Before you even ask, no, I will not get emancipated. The executor of the estate thinks it's a bad idea and would rather wait until I turn 18. He knows about M and N smoking pot.

My godparents would only be willing to take me in temporarily (2ish months) and the executor of the estate can't take me in because he's almost never at home due to his job.",03Jan2017,2

111,"I was a drunk for years. All through college (the seven or so years I went to a local community college, never finishing) I drank, even when I studied abroad. I was a joke, but I was smart. Well liked. Shame made me quit, and I haven't had a drink in over 4 years. Somewhere in there I began a very toxic relationship with my mother centered around addiction. She let me try some of her  methadone when I was in a bad mood one day. It became a daily habit very quickly and for years my mother parceled out some of her methadone for me everyday, and in exchange I helped her support her. I worked at a bar, still do, at a job my friend got me when I told him I attempted suicide after I was forced to leave college (my number one choice, University of Illinois, fucking up a full ride) because drugs was more important. I was lazy. Pitiful. But generally well liked. My mother never wanted to control me or anything like that, I think it was about survival. She didnt really have the self esteem to leave the house unless she was so fucked up it was noticeable. So we did that for years. We'd go to the methadone clinic, get high, maybe thrift shop, go back home and I would drink coffee and play Call of Duty. Meanwhile student loans are crawling towards default. I didn't open a piece of mail with my name on it for years. I didn't want to. I wanted to hide. I got so goddamn fat. I mean I was fat anyhow, but at the end I was about 330-340. Then one day my mother shoots herself in the chest with a hunting rifle. She survived, and is in a care facility now. That was September. I think she did it to save me. Give me an out. The methadone stopped immediately of course, and I havent had any since. I also quit smoking cigarettes, &amp; have lost 70 lbs (since July?). I lost one of my teeth to infection, and have to have another pulled in a few weeks. I'm terribly ashamed of that. But the smoking stopped the drugs stopped I don't have to lose any more. So here I am. Sober now. I go to the gym everyday no matter what. But I am so bored. 

I studied English and Mandarin Chinese in college. I was good. I am about 2-3 classes away from an Associates. I owe the college about $900 before they would let me enroll again. But since I've quit smoking and started taking myself a little more seriously, I have saved about $800. But English seems like a dead end. High school teacher? I think if that was a good idea I would be able to say, ""I want to be a teacher."" I dreamed of being a professor. English Literature, especially American Poetry.  But I am 27 now. My car is falling apart. My teeth are falling out. I have and make no money. So yesterday I went to an interview at a welding college. I don't know anything about welding, but I know it is a useful thing to know how to do. I covet that more than anything when I look at others' lives, their usefulness. I am a talented guitar player and poet. I can juggle very well. I can't change my oil. A student loan I took out to study abroad leaves forbearance 1 February. I have such feelings of urgency. I feel like I need to make up for last decade in the next fifteen minutes or I will combust. I don't know how to do anything. I dont feel like a man. Women see it.

116,"I've been super stressed out about this and my brother isnt much help, so I decided to come here since i really dont know much places or people I can go to about this. Well lets get started, I am currently 23 yo and going to school. The big stressful issue I have is that I am a student studying to do 3d modeling and animation, however my parents want me to do radiology so that I can make money. At beginning when they brought that up to me I was 22 and had no issue with that and just went and switched my major, however after taking classes for about a year I would not stand it. I had no interest in it what so ever. It cost me to lose a lot of motivation and made me question what I want to do in life for a bit of time. After a few months of me thinking and thinking I decided to go back into 3d modeling and doing something that I truly loved. When I do animation I can go for hours and hours and lose track of time. Since then I have been truly passionate about 3d modeling and to peruse a career in it.

Now comes the part that has been stressing me out. When I decided to go back to doing 3d modeling that was about a year ago. In that year I stopped taking classes for radiology and focusing all my time in my 3d modeling. I haven't told my parent what I am doing and my plan. I have been keeping everything a secret from them and the only person that knows is my brother. They would keep asking me about my classes and when I would finish and get my radiology degree. It always kills me that i have to constantly lie and keep this secret from them. I really want to tell them but the last time i talked to them about this me and my dad got into a huge screaming match which ended up with him crying and saying that he is embarrassing that all of his friends kids have degrees and good paying job and I have a son that doesn't have one yet and is still going to school working a part time job. My mom also said the same thing. I really want to tell them but I dont know how to tell them at the same time. I feel like if I do i will get into a screaming match again with my dad which would hurt our relationship like it did last time when I had a screaming match with him.

117,"Hey guys so I am a computer science nerd and previously I have slacked in my math skills during high school and the college I am at only teaches one course for Math.

I looked up what Math would be useful for computer science and found this link

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14868480/math-for-computer-science

So I was mostly wondering where I could learn this for either free or cheap? Is Khan Academy a decent option or is there a good youtube series? Mostly interested in Linear Algebra as I'm going to be messing with graphics since I want to make my own video games. Thank you guys and have a good day/night!

129,"for tldr, read low, but i really need somewhere to vent about this. 

When I was younger, I had a friend who used to both physically, sexually, and verbally abuse me while manipulating me into basically what she referred to me as her 'slave'. It was fucking weird. She'd cut me sometimes, or rip out my hair, or force herself on me for a power trip. She would dehumanize me and call me worthless while beating me on the ground. I never told anyone because I was lonely. She was my first friend and she knew that, which was mega fucked honestly, because she'd use that against me in my lowest times. One morning I was on her floor shaking from being forced to sleep outside in her backyard during a sleepover, and she hugged me then, making my heart pound in fear. She told me then I was her best friend, and she made me go into the pool with her later in the day, kissed me before forcing herself on me like usual, but it was more gentle and less violent. She treated me so gently when I was scared or hurt, which always caused me to stay. I cut her off when I was around 11, but she'd always find ways back to me, always finding new threats to throw my way to getting back to her. Sparing the details, I finally got away from her, as she dropped out of my highschool. I find myself often thinking of her but not in disgust or anger, but rather I miss her, and I miss the way I felt when she'd smack me or grind against me or call me a waste of space. Thinking about it gets me excited. I don't want to be but it just makes me super fucking giddy. Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about being choked by her like before, or when she'd injure me and lick my wounds (which was fucking weird btw, jesus christ). I can't figure out why I feel this way, and it makes me feel sick, but the sickness just kinda makes me wanna keep thinking about it really. I'm in a healthy state of mind I believe, I've grown as a person since I was young &amp; I've grown since I've been away from her toxicity, but I recently just can't stop thinking about her. I can't tell if its a sexual thing either, or maybe a power thing, or idk. i've never felt like that towards other girls before.

130,"I am about to approach my 2nd semester of college and I am dreading it. Not due to the academic portion, but socially. 

I have absolutely no friends. none. It saddens and hurts me to be in such a social environment yet I don't have anyone. It sucks to watch others with their close friends, people posting pictures with their groups and etc, and even walking into my dorm room and seeing my roommate with her friends talking about their next fun plans together. I even get asked by others ""who do you hang out with because you seem alone?"" and it bothers me cause its seems like others notice I don't have a life. 
I have even gotten to the point where I lie and say I have such a fun time with college friends to my friends back home to make it seem like my life is so great..but it's not entirely. 
I refuse to even attend my school's events because I just don't want to be alone. It's also hard to just approach people and groups at this point because it seems as once people find their ""clique"" they don't care for others. I've tried to approach groups and people and I was always left behind while the clique walked away together. It leaves me feeling embarrassed. 
It hurts. Because it makes me feel like something is wrong with me and that I am ""unfriendable."" I battled not having any best friends in high school either. So it makes me feel like if I didn't have friends all of high school, then all of college will be the same. It's not like I'm an evil person or unapproachable because in high school I won class favorite, and even in college I have alot of acquaintances who respect me and enjoy my company. 
But acquaintances are not the same as friendships.
I don't have that friend who I can depend on, laugh with, cry with, grow with, create memories with, travel with, and etc. I don't.

To describe myself, I am not afraid of approaching people, talking to strangers, and etc. But I feel like my introvertness has contributed a lot to my problem. I just love being to myself, and can only withstand a certain degree of socialization before I feel drained and overwhelmed. 
I decided first semester to think positive and focus on the other aspects of my life. I am a pre-med student and I was able to get a 4.0 fall semester and cater to myself such as working out, doing things I love, and just focusing on myself. 
But I don't want college just to be about school, or just spend college life dedicating my time to myself or the books, but I also want to experience the social aspects of it. I don't want to waste the young years of my life being alone while everyone else is out having fun.
I am not a party animal and don't do anything like such, but I know there are people out there who are like me. But i can't seem to find them. 

I am just here asking for you guys advice or experiences.
Did you not have friends as well? How did you get friends? and just overall advice?

I know the cliche, join clubs and etc. I am in clubs, but even that has not worked. I have acquaintances from there, tried to reach out to them, but when we would hang out I felt like the conversation was forced, I felt uncomfortable, and it just didn't feel like it wasn't working out. Plus most times the people never texted me back or tried to hang out with me. It was like a one sided ""relationship."" ",03Jan2017,9

As the title says, I've recently been approached by a talent recruiter via LinkedIn to interview for a very lucrative position within a very large world wide known company - the position is an SEO lead overseeing a team of SEO specialists.

My current situation is that I am in a start up agency and have been here from the beginning and I consider the whole office my second family - they've treated me well and the job itself is great - amazing hours, great office atmosphere, amazing friendships made. Only problem is that, as I said, it is a startup, I took a substantial cut in wage to be at this company and it has become a lot more stressful lately due to making sure the company survives as its on a 2 month cushion, if anything went wrong, jobs will be lost quickly. 

The company that has headhunted me is an extremely large, multimillionaire, well known company within the igaming industry, wages are known to be considerably high. 

My problem is this extreme feeling of guilt to the company that I've been with for almost a year and a half. 

Do I cancel the interview out of guilt? Do I go and just hear them out? What if my current employer finds out I am attending an interview? I would lose all respect gained. One thing to note is that the offices are within the same town and a small community.

139,"So my mom has triple-negative stage 3 breast cancer. Yeah it's a bitch. She hasn't begun treatment yet but is generally more open to it than some of her late friends have been. Her doctor hasn't assigned her a time yet. She goes in this week to have one last discussion with him about some test results before determining if she'll undergo treatment.

I don't expect any amazing crisis-averting advice here but I figure asking around won't hurt. My mom has been a staunch evangelical Christian for decades, at least for my entire life. That doesn't bother me anymore. But given this turn of events I'm afraid her faith may prevent her from getting the treatment she needs. Lately she has been investing a great deal of time into it. Generally I'm OK with and even supportive of this. I want her to have anything that makes her more at peace about her sickness. But there's been talk of how maybe she doesn't need treatment, maybe God will heal her. Right now it's just talk. Thing is, if this reaches stage 4 (it's at 3 right now), the average prognosis for people who don't seek treatment is a year. So I'm not thrilled about the possibility of her rejecting treatment.

I understand she's probably very scared. I would be. I try to be sympathetic to that when I talk to her. I guess I'm just asking advice on how to talk to her. I want to paint a picture here of what I'm trying to avoid happening: as I said, my mom is religious. But she's the type who I can imagine, if she gets TOO invested in her faith as a means of healing, she will begin to reject even DISCUSSING medical treatment, and at that point if I were to bring up medical treatment, she would tell me that the words I'm speaking are ""from the devil."" This shit runs deep in her head so this is a real possibility. She's used this rhetoric in the past, especially during stressful times. I want some advice for how to speak to her 1. To prevent her from getting there and 2. How to deal with it if she does reach that point. Thanks",03Jan2017,1

So my girlfriend, she lives with her father, mother, and sister.  They share a home with a friend of her mother and her son.  We'll her mom's friend S for short.   From what I can guess, S either owns or shares partial ownership of the house.  Or that my girlfriend's parents and S need each other to pay the house.  

This all started late October, S started causing fights with my girlfriend's parents.   I don't know the cause of the fights or why it's happening.   Apparently S gets really violent and starts breaking things while she screams that they're terrible. S gets drunk and starts to go on a tantrum   S's outbursts get more frequent as time progresses and my girlfriend can't handle the situation.     Every night while it happens she has to stay in her room holding her much younger sister and not being able to sleep because all she can hear is yelling and screaming.   It's starting to negatively impact her school performance as she received her first C at the end of this first semester.    She continues to be this amazing girlfriend and person regardless of what happens but it's painful for me knowing I can't do anything but say meaningleas words over a screen hoping it'll make her feel better.

The people I have told about my Asperger's have been surprised to hear it, because I don't really show any signs of being anything other than neurotypical. I can hold a conversation alright, and pick up on social cues fairly easily, but something that has always eluded me is romantic interactions. I've always struggled to understand how exactly I am expected to act to convey romantic interest.

Recently I've developed a crush on the cashier (about my age) who works at my local EBGames. One of my proudest achievements recently is having been able to hold a conversation with her when I went last, so that gives a good indication of where my social skills/anxiety are at in this context.

I am doing an apprenticeship in networking which I started back in 2016 January. I now have a couple months left to it, which I can complete at any company.

However I am also going to be moving houses to an area that is quite far away from my current high school that I have attended for 3 years now. So this is where I need help: As I'm moving houses, I've also been given the decision to move schools (a decision in which seems entirely up to me). So the situation is that if I decide to stay at my current school I would have to wake up 2 hours earlier than I would if I was to move schools as my current school is a 1hr drive away while my potential new school is only a 20mins walk or 5-10 drive. Now a few things to consider: the reasons for moving would be that going to school would be easier as the school is much closer and transport is much easier as i dont have to rely on my parents to take me to school on their way to work or use public transport in which will be frustrating as I may have to take more than one means of public transportation (ie.bus-&gt;train). In other words it is going to be costly and make my life and my parents lives a bit harder in terms of getting me to and from school. In addition to that it also seems that my parents would prefer I move even though they say the decision is all mine. Now lets go on to the reason I wouldn't move, the reason being the fact that at my current school I have good friends that I wouldn't want to leave after spending a good 3 years with them. The way I see it, this is the only reason I am wanting to stay as things like the education in the new school doesn't really bother me as I believe it would be fine.

156,"Hi Everyone. Just wanted a bit of help with my thoughts at the moment. 

Ok so back in high-school there was a group of about ten of us. We were all very close friends, from the beginning of high-school right up until the final year (5 years) where everything changed D:

In the final year when everyone is seventeen or eighteen and it suddenly becomes necessary to be involved in (underage) drinking and owning and cruising in done up cars, I had a falling out with them.

I had developed Epilepsy two years earlier (they all knew because I had a seizure at school) and it never really affected life - except for a few seizures a year which was manageable. Anyway, towards the end of my final year of high-school all these friends started drinking heavily, having their own parties, going to other parties and whatever else. Because of my Epilepsy i couldn't (and still cant) participate in drinking/partying with them and couldn't drive.

As it became cooler and more ""required"" as the year went on, the more and more they started to excluded me from their group, their activities and socially. I decided to confront them about this one day and asked why they didn't invite me to anything anymore. I told them it was unfair and they just seemed to get defensive and this argument led to a falling out between the group and myself. This may sound a bit whiny on my part but I believed that this wasn't the right way to treat a friend. 

Fast-Forward another five years (im 25M now) and due to my work and whatever else, I have made only a hand full of friends/acquaintances. I never get invites out and im usually at home outside hours. I quite often feel lonely but I just keep going on as best I can. Here's where I ask for your help

Lately I've been feeling pretty bad, and was thinking to myself, should i reach out to them and maybe get some friends back - especially after all these years because I miss having friends D:

159,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old guy.

I've been depressed for like 5 years now. Last year, I lost a sibling to heart disease and I was on bad, bad terms with that sibling. So much so, that the guilt cripples me on many days mentally. I don't trust people, there's not a single person I can say knows EVERYTHINg about me (that I wish people knew) and I'm just skeptical about love, long lasting friendships (I've burned bridges with many so called ""best friends"" at various points in my life.)

And yet, I liked this girl. Note, LIKE. it was always going to be a passive like...because I'm not a relationship person, I assume. My past two didn't work out, and I just mentally have this thing where relationships are just not for me.

And then she proposed to me. Turns out, she was head over heels for me. I said yes, and at that time, I felt something deep within. Almost fuzzy (I know this part is cheesy) but I did. I like hanging out with her. She's cool, she gets me.

But she goes SO overboard. I'm not only not used to this kind of grand display of love, I've ruled it out so much so that it makes me uncomfortable. She messages me saying she loves me at least 5 times a day, says she has dreams about me EVERY day, says she sees "" a powerful future life"" for us, and what not.

I LIKE her. The first time she used the word love it had me nervous. VERY nervous. I gradually started using it too, but partially because I felt like I wasn't being invested in the relationship. I don't know. Sometimes I try to blame it on the depression, on the past year, on my personality etc anything. Just anything that I can find to explain why I am such a cold, hardened and detached person. I just don't know why I don't love this person who is the sweetest, kindest person to over fall in so deeply in love with me, that in her own words, ""think of my life as before you and after you"". 

I don't talk to her about this obviously, because if I do, she'll just eventually agree with me. Like, she'll just be like ""okay sorry I won't express myself this much haha &lt;3"" and this HURTS me. This sort of control I have over her (that she has given me) really, really intimidates me. I don't see this relationship ever ending cause I sincerely doubt she will ever let us part.

Sometimes, I consider breaking up. Not because I don't have feelings for her, I do, but because this kind of unconditional love I feel is getting wasted on a disaster like me. I've been used to living a very very dark life, but no one knows this cause I hide it excellently. I haven't ""loved"" any of the girls I've dated in the truest sense of the word and I don't know why. Hell, I used to deny it, but i'm even considering the possibility that I, as a person, am just ""scared of love"" or whatever. I don't know.

We resolved the issue and she said she just deleted/deactivated her fb account, but kept messenger (as I asked why I could still see her fb account with one of my other fb accounts - never got fully answered). 

Then she added me on snapchat again, cause everytime I looked for her snaps, I couldn't find them (to me, I thought she had blocked me) - she ended up recreating her snap accnt. She also added me to instagram after all this.

I can see her photo changing on her ""new"" fb profile to ones on instagram. I'm just confused if I'm getting played or messenger app creates a profile for you or if she didn't actually remove her fb or if there is some edge case here I'm missing with how fb works?

Any ideas?

164,"I had kids young, and currently have a 1st grader as well as a 9 year old and two preteens. When the oldest two were young, I tried everything to make them listen. Nothing worked, they ignored my every word until I started yelling and being a little more stern with them. Eventually I was on edge all the time, it got a bit out of control. I had to, they were putting themselves and each other at risk. By the time my youngest was born this state had become my default. I've been to half a dozen psychologists as well as psychiatrist and all they tell me is that the kids have behavioral problems and that I have to find some way to make them listen, no practical advice on how to make that happen. The kids have zero respect for me and they physically or emotionally attack me and each other. I can't even go for a drive with my kids because the older two attack each other or the younger kids in the car, and on occasion us.

The oldest two have only gotten worse with time behaviorally speaking. My 9 yo is a social butterfly who can easily ignore what's going on in the house and holds his own but the 6 yo is very sensitive. My oldest two will gang up on me especially and as my husband and I work separate shifts (I work mornings and he evenings/nights), I've had a hard time coping. I've been having crying fits lately, just sure that I am an awful mother because of my children's issues and comments directed at me and my 6 yo is very aware of it and has taken to comfort me that I'm not a bad mother. She pets me and tries to soothe me as I cry and complain about my issues the way I do her. It's comforting but jesus, I know there's something seriously wrong here, so I've been trying to tone it down. It's also a question of pride, others in the community knowing it's that bad here. Sometimes I'll have a bad day with the oldest two as well, just throwing open the door to their rooms and yelling at them, grabbing them (over something serious like them attacking each other), as they attack me, and I'll still be in that mode and do the same thing to my 6 yo or 9 yo even if they've not done anything wrong and are just doing something like playing with crayons. I recently slapped the youngest for playing games when she was supposed to be getting ready, full of adrenaline after an incident with the oldest two. I'm being pushed to the edge with my oldest and it's affecting my relationship with my younger 2, with the 9yo kind of fading into the background and maybe getting to be too self reliant. My 6 yo is an extremely anxious child generally and clingy to me, scared of the oldest two. I know this sounds bad but I have taken my oldest two to many professionals who don't know what I can do with them, I was not like this before years of constant stress due to their behavior started wearing me down. I'm a shell of who I used to be.

The problem is I don't know what I can do moving forward. Parenting classes, psychologists, psychiatrist have done nothing except tell me that I need to make them behave. None of the methods I'm taught do anything to curb their bahvior.

So out of control kids, out of control house, professionals aren't helping, what should my next steps be? I'm completely lost.",03Jan2017,0

167,"I lost alot of weight when I was about 15 and had alot of gyno(man boobs) left over. I don't really go outside much because of it, and in the past year I haven't left the house at all. People point it out pretty often and I should just laugh about it but it hurts for some reason. I've had medical issues in the last few months, like I hurt my back, had severe constipation, stomach pangs, and instead of going to the doctor and get it checked out I chose to wait out the pain and spend the month in bed. I couldn't go to the doctor because I'm too embarrassed about my man boobs. I can't really even talk to my family about it. My back is still having problems sitting down about 2 months later. 

 I've spent alot of the past few years trying to lose more weight or eating more veggies hoping it would get better, but the last year I've determined it's gynecamastia and being really skinny doesn't clear it up. I need surgery, but it's $5k and I don't have a job and I don't want to ask my parents and they don't even have much money right now.  If I got surgery I could go exercise when I want, leave the house when I want in whatever clothing, be able to actually have a real conversation and not worry if they can tell.

174,"Sorry if this comes across as choppy, but I'm trying to summarize and paint the full picture here.

While at work in 2006 I met the most amazing women of my dreams. It was instant love at first sight on my part. In my early 30's at the time so I know the difference here.

Worked with her closely for 4 years and every day my heart grew for her. After New Years 2010 I had to confess my love for her in order to be honest with myself and to her. I pulled her aside one day at work and read a letter to her. Basically said I was crazy about her and I know she doesn't feel the same way so I need to break our friendship off cause I cannot just be friends with her and I'm with someone presently and so is she. I didn't use the word love as I know just expressing my feelings was enough. Only thing she said was ""sorry"" and stood there shocked as hell. Haven't talked since that day.

Four months later (April 2010) she comes to my floor at work to tell her friends that she got married over the weekend on the spur of the moment. Reddit, let me tell you my heart and soul was crushed. Going on seven years now and I will never forget hearing those words. Felt like someone had taken the air out of my lungs and crushed my soul. 

Six months go by (Aug 2010) and I need to quit my job because I simply couldn't see her face and not talk. Every day at work was a struggle. I faked being happy for several months. Hell 7 years later and I still fake being happy.

A few months later I move out of state (early 2011) as I needed a fresh start...

Five years later she moves into my town (Oct 2015) with her husband. Yes Reddit you just read that correctly. I moved almost 700 miles away and she now lives 12 miles away from me 5 years later. Her moving showed up on my Linkedin feed cause of former coworkers and same connections. and yes I am guilty after seeing relocated I looked her up. 

I have the heart of Forrest Gump... let's just say the destiny line immediately came to mind.

Now a year later I am struggling not to go over to her house and tell her how I have felt since 2006. She is married and I need to respect her husband, her, and property. I get that. My feelings are so bonkers for her that every time my doorbell unexpectedly sounds my stomach churns and my heart flutters and think ""omg what if she is coming to my house"".

I need to stop this as this isn't healthy and it's been way too long. I was doing better until she moved into the same town I am in! How fing crazy is it that she moved just 12 miles away from me after I moved over 700 miles away to get a fresh start.

175,"As the title states, I don't have any motivation to draw. Pretty simple and to the point and most people go through dry spells. But, it's been years for me. Even when the trickle of enthusiasm for an idea comes to me, it gets lost instantly within the environment I'm in. 
Everyone who has come in contact me when I'm drawing or anything ""artsy"" always says the same ""I wish I could do that"" or ""That's not fair"". Even when I was first developing my skills when I was younger my mother, who is also a self-taught artist, stated that it's not fair because I've always had natural talent.

181,"Background: My CEO randomly decided to move my desk into the basement. I currently have a decently sized office all to myself. But now I am being moved into this tiny office space in the basement and share it with two older guys. My desk space will be decreased and insufficient for my job requirements. Everyone in my office agrees he did not think this decision out whatsoever and it will make it more difficult on me and my coworkers. I am uncomfortable with being alone in such a small space with men older than me, and ones that make me uncomfortable in the first place. (weird, obnoxious and inappropriate).

My biggest issue with this though is, I can complete my weekly work within two hours, three if I take my time. They have automated my job so now I only do about 20% of what I used to. I literally do nothing but scroll through the internet (my own emails too) all day. I don't think they know this. I've asked for more work but there is none for me. So these two men will be seated behind me, with full vision to my screen. WHAT. THE. FUCK. Am I going to do all day? I'm already bored out of my mind with the entire internet at my fingertips, but now that will be cut completely from me. I will have to stare at an excel sheet for 32 hours a week and not do a single thing.... Any ideas on what I can do to help this not be so miserable? I have spotify but there's only so many times you can listen to the same songs over and over again. 

Second question is. My employee handbook claims our company has an open door policy and encourages open communication. My CEO made my supervisor tell me of his decision and never provided a reason, just that he wants to put a full timer in my spot (but this person is NEVER in the office. she can go months without stepping into the office. Should I call him out/ask him what's going on? This is the second time my desk has been moved for the benefits of others, but this time it affects my job. (Will now have to walk up and down steps about 100 times a day to get things from my printer, and to talk to my coworker about issues). I don't like confrontation, and usually in these type of situations of me discussing something with a higher power makes me very nervous and shaky. What do I say? Or should I go directly to my HR manager? Should I tell him why I don't agree with his decision and how it will affect mine and my coworker's jobs?

192,"I grew up slightly well off until my dad lost his business when I was 11 and we had to move to a much smaller house in a new city, and we were from then on out, definitely poor. Not welfare poor, but my parents both worked to provide the basicsfor me and my brother and we didn't have huge Christmases and birthdays like before. 
Most of my friends are from this period of my life, school mates and kids from the neighbourhood. One guy in particular was very close to us, a very good friend for about 6 years. After high school he decided not to go to college and stayed home. I went to a college about 3 hours away. We drifted apart, mainly because I had gotten a good job, and he was always bumming money, cigarettes, booze, etc. He came to visit me at college twice and both times I paid for everything. He had a part time job in a Mexican restaurant and still lived with his folks.  After the second visit, I got angry and told him that I didn't want to provide for him any more and to stay away unless he could pay for things himself on his next trip. I didn't see him again. 
I graduated college and got a good job. However, 3 years ago, after working for only 9 months in my new job, I won big in the lottery, to the tune of 30+ million. Of course I quit my job and have invested my money well. I now own a 3 bedroom townhouse in London and live a fairly lush life. I don't work at all and spend my days in leisure. My parents and 2 closest friends are the only ones who know. Everyone else thinks that I work for a British investment bank and that is why I left.
About a year ago, my old friend contacted me via facebook and said that he wanted to be friends again and make up our lost time. We Facebook chatted, texted and eventually spoke on the phone.  I bodyswerved the career question by saying that I am in investing. 
Now he wants to come visit me in London and I don't know how to handle it. should I tell him that I just do well at my job? I am not sure if he will believe it. I have 3 staff, 4 cars,  a Bosendorfer grand in my living room,and several hundred thousand pounds worth of art on the walls.  Not possible for someone who has been 'in investing' for less than 2 years.  I am afraid that if he finds out, he will blow my cover and I will have people coming out of the woodwork asking for money. I also think that of course he will do the same. 
My best friend here said that I should rent a small, niceish apartment appropriate for a mid levele employee at an investment bank and stay there while he is visiting. Should I go to this much trouble, or just tell him not to come?

He's always jokingly flirty with other heterosexual guys in our class (he's almost turning them gay lol), but not with me so I already know he's not into me. Besides, he likes big and strong men and I'm only 5'4"".

I don't have the amazing social skills he has, so I never flirt or even hinted that I like him. Still, I can keep a decent conversation going, we stay in touch on social media and sometimes meet on parties outside of school. I wouldn't consider him a friend yet, but we're definitely not strangers to each other.

I was thinking of telling him on Valentine's day, maybe get him a little gift or write a witty poem about how I feel. I feel a bit guilty I guess, for not being as upfront about my feelings as he always is. Best case scenario: he finds it somewhat flattering and we can make jokes that I'm a hopeless romantic and just laugh it off. Worst case scenario: I somehow create an unbearably awkward situation which would be disastrous for my social skills.

205,"This is a long one, sorry. 

I (29/F) have been friends with 'B' (28/F) for about 17 years. She is very important to me and I know she also cares for me a great deal, this being a very important relationship to us both. I am NOT looking to dissolve our friendship or be less involved with her, but we are having a bit of conflict and I would appreciate advice on if I should back off, if I should try and reevaluate how I feel, or anything useful you have.

Here's the story:
B got marriend in 2014 to a guy (38ish/M) I always disliked. She was aware of my feelings, but when they decided to marry I backed off and tried to respect her decision. They are in the beginning stages of seperation and divorce now and she recently said that she wished I had talked her out of it, whisked her away from her wedding day and stopping the whole thing. She admitted she wouldn't have listened, this is a strong case of hindsight being 20/20. This indicates to me she wants and values my opinions, though she freely admits she likely won't listen.

Years ago we worked at the same location, at a terminal with dock space and tractor trailers. There was a guy who worked as a forklift operator who we found unpleasant. 'M' was married and had a reputation for sleeping around anyway. He was aggressively flirtatious and suggestive and we often discussed how disagreeable we found him. 

A little over a month ago she called me, very upset, saying her marriage was over. It took quite awhile to get any details from her, but basically: B began seeing M as friends in a social setting, at first only as friends, but soon they were developing feelings. She was texting him and lying as to where she was in order to spend time with M and her husband picked up on something being amiss. He confronted her and she admitted to the affair (not yet sexual, but very emotional) and told him she wanted a divorce. 

B and her husband have 2 children. B owns the house where they all live[d] and it is not marital property according to a lawyer. The first night her now ex took the kids and went to his parents. He came back and declared that the kids should be home (B agrees) and that he will be staying with them. Here is the first part I disagree with significantly; she left her ex and the kids and came to stay with me. I insited she see a lawyer for a consult to ask about the kids, the house, and the affair. Reluctantly, she did. He said:

* the house is not marital property and she owns it in its entirety.

* she needs to reach a written custody agreement asap with ex.

* the longer she is away from the boys the stronger a case for custody is for ex.

* she should ""cut out"" having an affair.

She tried staying at her house with ex and the kids but things were tense and he was aggressive towards her, making her feel unsafe. So she simply left again. She has spent time at my home and a lot of time with M. M has informed his wife he wants a divorce but they still live together with their own two kids. So they rent hotel rooms or go to friends houses.

She agreed with me at one point that M and she needed to take a break and she needed to settle custody, living arrangements, and figuring out how to live on her own with the kids. But they went away for their 'goodbye' weekend and... didn't say goodbye. Both B and M's spouses are very angry, they know of the relationship and have current possession of the kids. Meanwhile, even knowing they need to find ways to financially exist independently from their spouses, B and M are dating and going to parties like they have no responsibilities.

B is going to need to have her gallbladder removed. Initially I belived she intended to remain here and to have me help her through recovery, but she said M may be getting a place for them to stay for the week.

She's having a hard time, her family very vocally believes she is crazy and should stay in her unhappy marriage. I want her to trust me and come to me to talk things out when she needs a sounding board. My issue is a don't approve of a lot of her actions. She gets frustrated with my dissaproval but says she wants me to tell her at the same time. Recently she has started to pressure me to have a game night with my Husband, myself, B, and M. I told her I don't understand what she wants, if she KNOWS I feel negatively yet she's looking for my blessing. She said she wants me to just see them together and for my Husband to meet M.

I feel like I don't want this drama in my house around my own kids, and I feel like M is a perv who has too long a history of cheating to be trustworthy. He also seems lackadaisical (at best) with his parenting, not even buying his own kids gifts for Christmas, yet giving B crazy expensive gifts. I worry he doesn't prioritize parenting and wouldn't be good with B's kids. I haven't broached these topics with B.

I have said that she needs to get in gear and figure out custody, even though ex is being difficult, she can't just not do anything. She needs to spend time with her kids, she has spent very very little time with them,  because the house is ""awkward"" but I think if they can't get along she needs to make ex leave and stay with the kids. Ex has threatened to go for full custody many times. Mostly our conflict is over M. I feel that her level of misery in her marriage put her in a place where anyone could have swept her off her feet, so M isn't special. I feel he's untrustworthy. I feel they are acting like they have no responsibilities and are spending money recklessly. I feel that she needs to be ok being alone, that, at minimum, she needs a break from M so she can get her own life in order and makes sure she can take appropriate care of her kids. I feel like even if they are good together, their relationship is getting in the way of their kids, custody, their families and that eventually that will poison their feelings. I feel that she shouldn't be ignoring the lawyer's advice, she's hurting her case every day and she just keeps saying she doesn't want to be alone.

I'm frustrated, she won't take responsibility. She was unhappy for so long she is trying to do a do-over, but she can't start fresh, they both have kids. She says things like ""just let me have fun"". I, admittedly, have a poor opinion of cheating, and feel this is a bad omen for their relationship. I have prior negative opinion of M, but haven't seen him in years. Am I being too.... Judgey? Am I just being too strict in opinion? I want her to be happy, and though she is right now, I don't think this is a path to long term true happiness.

208,"Hey guys! I really need some advice here. Recently, I participated in my school's musical as a dancer and it's really a great chance for me since its my first and last time to show my skills (last year in Hugh school)  .  But I'm still having doubts since I don't have any experience at all and it's my first time to do so. I'm also really insecure with myself since I'm the only not skinny person and I'm not good and all. The dancers in there are really great and I really feel out of place . If I don't join the musical as a dancer,there's another option for me. I could be one of the photographers where I feel so much more secure with my ability as a photographer. Not only that, I have a major examination this year and I need to focus very hard to get really good results since its gonna be a huge thing to be use  to apply to college and stuff.

However, Today I receive an email from my school stating that I am 1 class shy of graduating. After talking with my university I was told this was a mistake by my advisor and that I am 1 class shy.

So.. this all could be my fault, but this is why I want another opinion. So for the last couple years I've been picky about hanging out with this group and I've been trying to go my own way. Well I got married last year (2016) and everyone was up my ass then. Everyone wanted to be my friend, and I can't lie I did like the attention a little bit. Thinking that I had rekindled my friendship with my long time friends, I began to open up again. Well comes around time for the annual Christmas party my friends host. Guess who wasn't invited? Me. Guess who made sure that every one of those people were invited to my wedding. Me. Guess who didn't call me or text to ask where I was the night of our annual Xmas party.. NO ONE. The next day I found out I had missed it, through looking at Snapchats. I was pissed. I told my best friend that I hadn't been invited and asked why no one texted me, her response was, ""Well I figured you were probably busy doing something else. If it makes you feel better I'm so hungover."" So yea, I've been ignoring everyone since then and on of the girls' birthday party is coming up this week.... Do I quit being a sad sally and just go and get over my feelings, or do I continue to ignore them and move on with my life? I don't need these people, even though they are my only friends.

I have a little experience planting trees from working on farms in my area. I'm looking at Fleming's Sustainable Trails Certificate program, which consists of online courses and day classes over a semester, as well as their Forestry Tech program which starts in September and runs for four semesters. I don't know who to talk to about reforestation, so I don't know if these courses are a necessity, an asset or just overkill. I also don't know which orgs or companies I should be looking at for employment. I really don't know anything about the process, except that you end up in the bush planting trees at some point. I'm honestly pretty impatient; I know that college will probably provide me with most of the answers to my questions in time but if I really don't need to be there I'd rather not waste the time and money.

Would anyone have experience in this field, or know someone who does, that can provide guiding footprints for me to get started? Should I just apply to the courses?

223,"Three years ago, I met my girlfriend in high school, a Czech foreign exchange student. We instantly hit it off, fast forward to now, we see each other about twice a year in person, along with Skype and Kik to stay in contact. Obviously I'd like if we could be physically together more.
Currently, I'm enrolled in my third year of university in the US, and she is enrolled in her second year of dentistry in Prague (out of 5). She attends there for free, whereas if she came to the US, it'd be 8 years and would cost a fortune of out-of-state tuition bills. She applied after high school and while she got into plenty of schools, did not receive nearly enough financial aid to justify abandoning free education in Czech. Whenever we talk however, she always vents about how she is lonely and stressed, since she lives alone in a city apartment and dentistry school in Czech is pretty cutthroat. She has told me plenty of times that she wants to move to the US and live with me once she graduates or some other allowable circumstance.
I know I'm leaving this pretty open ended, but I really feel like there's something more one or both of us could be doing or should do in the future to ensure less stress and more physical connectivity. Does anyone have any suggestions to help the situation, or are aware of any programs in the US or in Czech that could potentially help?
Potential solutions I've thought of include:
Going to Czech on a student or work visa after college to attend graduate school or to work once I graduate with my Bachelors here.

225,"My dad owns a small woodworking shop, family run business, and a few years ago, his cousin came asking for a job to a friend of his, according to him a very good man and a very competent salesman, as the business was expanding, and my dad who used to run after sales was getting busy with other things, supplies mostly, and hired the man, who I am going to call ""J"" to take care of sales, pretty standard sales job: For every sale you close, there's a X% cut for you, with the time, J started to grow close to my dad, very close, best friends of some sort, as J  moved from afar to here and was paying rent, my dad got a house from a friend of his at a good price and offered to J for a infinite amount of payments, then things started to get weird, at first, J used to delay those payments, 1 or 2 days in the start, soon it was 5, 10 days, at some point he would not pay anymore, then he started to ask for small loans to my dad, once two months, then once a month, then for anything he needed some money, and guess what: Nobody ever saw those loans anymore.

My dad was constantly in denial about what was happening under his nose, he used to say to us, my mom and I, that it was all part of his comissions, that he was such a good salesman and was bringing us a lot of revenue, that all the money he received was part of his fair share. As the business was family run, my mom used to do the accountings, soon after she started to question the amount of money that was going to J, she got cut off accountings and was sent home, to do full time care of my sister, who was a toddler back in the day. 

And the time passed, J now has a good house, one that he never paid for, he bought a brand new Chevy S10 back in the day (Guess it's like a Colorado for the american redditors), his family would throw regularly parties for friends, like every weekend, they would be walking around in expensive clothing, they would regularly travel, all this while my dad struggled to keep his business together, at this point we were in astronomic debt and things got out of hand, my dad was once sent to the ER with a supected heart attack, and then my mom lose her mind, after a couple threats of divorce and some confrontations with said J, he was gone as he came, left the house, the job, everything, never said a word, at least not that I know, and my dad, oblivious as ever. After this we discovered some things about J's past, to cut things short: He was not an example of a man, and my dad wouldn't believe a single word of it.

Fastforward to the present, after the help of some true friends and dad's hard work, they're back in their feet again. I got a couple weeks off from work (I live and work in a city 200 kilometers or about 120 miles from here) and came to stay with my parents, a week ago I overheard one of my mom's conversations on the phone and something about J's return was said, and today, when I was at my dad's shop I saw him there, now, fearing for the well being of my dad, and the well being of his shop, what is everything to him andis what paid for all my basic education and college, the food, well, everything in my life prior to my graduation, I ask you /r/Advice, what can I or my family do to prevent such a thing from ocurring again?

My friend and I (both male, 24 and from the UK) are looking to head to the US for two weeks later this year. The problem is, we have no idea where to head and were hoping the wonderful people of Reddit could help.

With us both being single and not exactly bogged down in responsibilities, we'd be looking for a place that is fun, cultural, full of young (ish) fun people and, well, as seedy as it sounds, girls.

We've been looking at various cities, including San Francisco and New York, however, not being too well educated in the country, these are merely just random guesses.

We aren't looking for anywhere with a MASSIVE nightlife, that's a party 24/7 but perhaps some cool chilled out bars we could head to, rather than huge raves or anything.

Neither of us take any drugs or do anything crazy - we are from the UK after all, but we like the idea of visiting somewhere we can see some college sports, drink epic coffee and fall flat on our arses when we try to chat up women.

And how do I say no if he asks me to hangout again?

Update So I let him know how I felt and that he made me feel really uncomfortable last time, and he apologized multiple times and kept saying how sorry he was and how bad he felt etc. etc. and then he asked if I would still want to hang but without going that far EVER again. Should I hangout with him again? Are boys serious when they promise to not go far??",03Jan2017,1

264,"Hello everyone, 

I'll start with a bit of context. 

This School year I had to change schools for personnal reasons. Back in my old school their was a programm that allowed for students that were pretty good/fluent in English to have certain subjects taught to them in English. Three years prior to me getting into this new school I had a althought not super good, good enough English level to join the school that had the programm. My English was not that good when I first joined but from me talking English on a daily basis with other native speakers (talking about students here, teachers too but mostly students) my English got much better. I extended my vocabulary, made less grammar mistakes and although my grades were not the best my English sure was improving. After two years in the programm I was at a point where I could speak English fluently. I would probably make some mistakes here and there but It happened rarely and my accent was similar to the one of a native speaker (A lot of people assumed I was from America when I played communicated in the process of playing video games online). The problem now is that I no longer have native speakers around me all day meaning I don't practice my English as  often and that my level is going down. Hell, even the teacher makes grammar mistakes. Now don't get me wrong their are some people who speak really good English in my class but they prefer speaking their native language which is  understandable and I'd look like a show off speaking English out of English class.


I was wondering how I could  improve my English/ maintain my level (I probably need to improve since I'm pretty sure my English level has  declined since September [time of the year where hs students go back to school in my country])

TL;DR Use to be in a school with a lot of native English speakers (I don't live in the UK/US/Canada/Australia) Changed schools and ever since my level had been declining need to fix that asap. Please help me find a way to do that.

Thanks in advance,

266,"This all started about a year or two ago when my mother really got into Facebook. She started posting all about her gardening, cooking, usual mom stuff. Where it started to upset me is when she started posting about me on her public page. She will post things ranging from ranting about things I did wrong to posting pictures of me sleeping on airplanes. She even takes pictures of me when Im not looking and upload them even if I beg her not to. It's all very embarrassing and I can't seem to get her to realize that while she is fine with having the intimate details of her life online, I am not. I don't even have any social media accounts (besides Reddit) I have tried talking to her about it respectfully and she still has this 'you're my kid so I can do what I want' attitude.

270,"I've been in mechanical engineering pre-major at The Ohio State University for the past two and a half years and I've hated almost everything about it, so I want to transfer. I've retaken and improved in 25 cr-hrs of classes and I still haven't met what I think are unnecessarily difficult requirements to be accepted into the actual ME program. And on top of that, my college experience at OSU has been absolutely awful.

I don't know where to start looking for a new university, which is why I'm here asking about it. 

I'd like the school to have a good and somewhat prestigious engineering program. The OSU ME program is one of the hardest engineering programs in the Country to get into and I'm currently really close to getting into it, so I feel like there aren't many schools out there who's ME programs are too difficult for me to get into.

I'd like the school to be somewhere warm. Ohio weather sucks and I get seasonal depression during the winter. But I'd rather not go to school in a bright-red southern state like Texas or Alabama. Cali would be great, but I feel like it would be too expensive to live there.

It's probably best if I went to an average- to large-size school. I feel like going straight from the second-largest university in the world to a small school would feel awkward.

Since I'm dead-set on getting a degree in a very lucrative field, paying-off student loans doesn't worry me that much. But still, the cheaper, the better.

TL;DR: looking for a decent-size university with a good engineering program in a state that's warm but not shitty.",03Jan2017,1

Problem is I have no idea what I want to do and feel completely lost, I've spent the last 4-5 year in and out of uni with 2 different degrees and I have worked at supermarket job for the past 8 years which is about all I have going for me as I have no real usable skills but I do not want to do that for the rest of my life.

I don't know if its worth pushing through the degree and finishing it (minimum 2 years left) or dropping it, if I drop it I feel like I would be pressured by my parents to get a full time job but I feel like if I stay I'll be semi miserable. I don't have the goals or drive that other people have for their future careers the only thing I know is:

I dont want to work retail for the rest of my life. I do not want to struggle like my parents do, I want to live a comfortable if not well offish life and never really have to worry.

That's really my criteria for picking my future bu all I really know now is I would like to travel or something like that but do not know if its viable as I don't want to waste any more years just fucking around.

Basically I need advice on what I should try to do in this case, if you've been in this situation or know someone who has because it is driving me around the twist.

278,"I’m in a possibly-leave-roommate situation (probably not uncommon), and was hoping to get some third-party perspectives. If I’m being an arse or unreasonable, I’d request to hear honest opinions about that.

Basic situation: halfway through in a two-person lease. 

Background: I want to sublease (which is allowed) or transfer lease (must request) my portion as a primary tenant. We’ve known each other since college, and though not best of friends, we are more so acquaintances with mutual friends. We don’t see each other much in the apartment (3x a week probably), and don’t hang out or go out together. We mostly have passerby, smaller conversations in the apartment. 

Why: We live in a very busy intersection, and I get inconsistent sleep from the noise. I’ve tried noise blockers, fans, etc. Unfortunately it affects me at work. Also, without going into too many details, having my own place would allow me to mentally recharge much, much better.
_____________________

Pros: 
-Rent will be lower in the winter here in NYC if I start looking now, as opposed to the summer (rent is highest) when my lease is up
-Live alone and have a good space to recharge alone and sleep well without constant traffic noise

Cons:
-I don’t want to be an a**hole and burn a bridge with my roomie

If I were to leave, I’d of course handle finding a new roommate, my portion of the rent, etc and ensure that my roomie’s responsibilities are as few as possible. Curious about anyone’s thoughts! Thanks guys.",03Jan2017,1

In 8th grade I screeched and jumped in my chair, a stim.

I left that school and went to another, came back as a 10th grader, more normal, but would subtly whisper to myself and ran a lot randomly.

I sat down cross-legged in a skirt, realized a boy next to me could see my pubic hair and was kind of looking at it. I tried to pull my skirt end down, didn't really help. He still probably thought I was gross. :p

11th grade, normal in a socially acceptable way, just not good at conversation.

12th grade, much more normal as far as I know, unique but not in a really gross way.

Kids aren't rude to me, they talk to me and are nice, (they used to not be in middle school), I got invited to two or so things, hung out with people who said they liked me, that being said, no one usually invites me anywhere.

Also, many of them were in a grade below me in 6th grade, thus not in my school, or not in the school system at all.

I will go to college soon, but my brother tells me I just don't put myself out there, but I just think I am gross and no one would accept me.

And don't be mean, please, I know I am disgusting. :( Just tell me nicely if I have no hope.

I have satisfied the required courses for McCombs (Macro, Micro, Calc I &amp; II) and achieved an overall gpa of 3.5 with 46 hours completed. After next semester I would have attained 59 hours and met all core curriculum requirements including mathematics, science, government, history, English, foreign language and arts. I will ultimately be a few courses away from getting an associates in Business Administration, which I plan on attaining by taking those courses at UT and implementing a reverse transfer of credits back to ACC.

Along that note, I have been heavily involved in extracurricular like Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society, which I was recently elected for Vice President at my Main ACC campus. I'm additionally involved in Student Government, where I was elected as Senator at a neighboring campus. Thirdly, I'm also involved in ACC's Student Life program called Male Leadership and will be working next semester as a mentor for prospective students. On top of that, I attained marketing and leadership experience in two internships this past summer.

At this point I want to say thanks again for giving a shit about my academic life achievements, and I appreciate any of you for continuing. I have a few questions I would like to ask:

Is it possible, and how likely or unlikely would you assume my chances are of getting into UT McCombs with a GPA of a 3.5?

How likely or unlikely would you think my chances are of getting accepted into the Moody College of Communications at UT if it were my second choice major?

Ultimately, if my chances of getting into either one of those schools at UT is unlikely, what's another school you would prefer I apply to for a Marketing Degree? (In state Texas or even affordable schools out of state)

293,"Hey everyone!

So during the off-days during these past holiday weeks, I decided to start looking for an internship required by my university. I started filling out information forms on several sites and sending out my CV to the companies that looked promising. 

On December 29th I got a call from a recruiter from one of the best companies in my area about my application. According to her, everything I sent was perfect and she just made the call to clarify some minor details. She told me all that was left to do was to get my schedule to be able to work out my hours with my university courses, and to have the in-person interview. She told me that work would start at the beginning of March.

I mentioned that my schedule might be a little weird because I would be taking classes from the course one year ahead of mine to lessen the load later, and that I'd send it to her via email as soon as we finished the call. Anyways, I did just that. Now, I might just be nervous or anxious because I would really like to be an intern at this company, but I sent that email on December 29th and have still not received an answer. I understand that we are still in holiday season and she might not be back at work yet, but I'm assuming even if my schedule doesn't work out with them, they'd let me know through email, right? 

I know it's only been a couple of days and I should just wait and see what happens, but should I send another email at some point to see what's the status on the whole issue? If so, how long should I wait for this? 

I probably sound really desperate but the truth is it's my first chance at an internship and the fact that it could be at a good company has me racking my mind a bit. ",03Jan2017,1

I still did my best for her and tried to fix everything. Eventually we grew apart.. we still see each other a lot though because we are in the same college. But we never talk, we ignore each other.

The problem is: i still think about her.. like i dont know how.. but i still do.
