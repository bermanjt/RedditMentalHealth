1,"The problem is that where I live, safety isn't really important to people.
A couple of months ago I've seen a car accident near my house, one of the drivers had his skull cracked and died shortly after.
Since then I've been trying to make my mother and my sister wear the seatbelt, but they are really stubborn.
I need something graphic or emotional they can see, hoping it works.

2,"I have this habit of picking up ""friends"" that either make me slightly uncomfortable, are too clingy, just seem more interested in my presence than I am theirs, or all of the above. Maybe my reasons for not wanting them around anymore are mean and I'd understand why you'd say that of me. I just don't jive with them like they jive with me and when they ask to hang out I have a hard time saying no. I've tried to send them signs that it's just not mutual. Shitty response times, short/one word/emoji replies, never initiating, etc. I know it's kinda mean, but I don't have the heart to tell them outright why.

These same type of people also have a hard time finding and keeping friends around which adds to my guilt of coming out. I don't want to just block/ghost them because I know it'll hurt them, and I know I'll see them around in person. I just want them to find friends that actually want them around (ie. not me), but I don't know how to tell them that when they seem to have a hard enough time as is.

4,"I have a major presentation tomorrow, and stupidly only decided to time myself on how long it takes me to present it today. I am only suppose to present for 15 minutes, but so far my shortest time has been about 25 minutes, even presenting the in the most stripped down way possible. I'm suppose to be presenting the findings of my (64 page) research paper; it involves me explaining the results of multiple graphs and then drawing conclusion from multiple sets of data. I'm unsure how to shorten my presentation without leaving out important information. Does anybody have any tips about how to make a presentation like this shorter?",12Jun2017,2

10,"I'm a sophomore in high school. Right now, I'm taking Pre-Calculus/Trig and I have a C-, which is a huge problem. In my other classes, I have As and B+s, and I'm not really worried about them, but this C- has caused my GPA to be a 3.3 which is pretty low. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any advice? I still have to take the final in that class, but it's pretty much hopeless for getting that grade back up. My main question is whether or not I should retake this class, in order to not have a C show up on my transcript, or move onto the next math?",12Jun2017,6
11,"I just turned 18 recently, and my mom is about to take my to my pediatrician for the last time. I started exhibiting some symptoms that looked like low blood sugar or possibly diabetes. She told me that they would test my blood and conduct a urine analysis test. I have been smoking weed everyday for the past several days. Will they likely see the THC in those tests? I also know that there is doctor-patient confidentiality and that I'm 18 so that applies to me, but my mom will still be there to check me in, and its the pediatrician that I went to before I was 18.

13,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll try to keep this short, I'm 22[F], and I'm about to graduate from university with a useless arts degree. The tenancy agreement for my flat runs out in a month, and one of my flatmates is moving out to live with her new boyfriend. 

I'm trying to decide whether to stay at the town I've lived in for the last four years of university (I had to repeat a year, we'll get to that later), or to move back to my hometown, in another country, over 1000km away.

I don't have a job or any job prospects here but could easily get a job back home.

Now for the fresh start, I've had a pretty hard time at uni, I grew up in a mentally and physically abusive home which I escaped when I was 16, due to that I have PTSD, anxiety, and clinical depression. 

I failed first year of university because I didn't get out of bed for a month straight, but somehow managed to crawl over the finish line to graduation this year.

Also, last year on my 21st birthday, I was sexually assaulted at a bus stop a few minutes walk from my university after a night out, and I was also raped in November of last year (2016). On top of all that, my little sister tried to kill herself whilst visiting me this past February (2017).

All of this makes me think, fuck it, let's move back in with my dad and get a fresh start. 

I'm pretty good at dealing with trauma (a lifetime of practice), so I thought the past year (starting on my 21st birthday) didn't really effect me, but actually I just pushed it all down to try to get all my university work done and graduate. Now that classes are over and I've submitted all my assignments, I went home for a month to kinda of test the waters and see how it would be, and honestly I loved and hated. I really enjoyed not having to worry about rent, bills, food in the fridge, etc. When I'm home everything is taken care of by my dad or grandmother, who are very loving and caring.
I also feel a lot safer there than I do in my university town.

The only problem I have with living at home is that my dad is a (barely) functioning alcoholic/addict, so sometimes I have to cover-up his drug use/binge-drinking and take care of him when he gets into a bad state. 

Here, where I am now, I live with my best friend, we've known each other since we were 16 and we both come from abusive families so she's basically my entire support network (I do have a counsellor too), my best friend also suffers from mental health problems but is doing a lot better lately, and has a very serious boyfriend who wants to move in with her.

So basically, I want to decide, should I stay here, in this town where horrible things have happened to me, where I will struggle to support myself and find a job, or, do I move back home, where I have a place to live rent-free and a (basically) guaranteed job, where nobody knows how fucked up I am and I can get a fresh start and feel safe.

TLDR:
I'm graduating university and can't decide whether to leave the town that reminds me of all my traumas or move back home with my alcoholic father.

14,"I am a semi-pro football player, but I'm not a physical player for the life of me. I play cornerback, I'm great in coverage but I can't play press coverage well and I'm a god awful tackler, how can I mentally open up to be aggressive and learn how to unlock that killer instinct?",12Jun2017,1
15,"I graduated college in December, and took on a full-time job in March. The first 2 months went pretty well, and I felt comfortable enough to move out of my parents home and into my own place. The position pays very well for somebody with my level of experience, therefore I was able to afford a more pricey apartment. Fast forward to the last couple of weeks; I have been miserable and have come to the realization that this position is not a good fit for me. The company has some pretty unethical practices and a staff that is lazy and unmotivated, to the point that I dread waking up and going there. In addition, I moved from working 8 hour shifts, to shifts that last 10-14 hours, which has really screwed with my body. I feel like this job has a had a real negative effect on my emotional health.

Another complication is that the company provides a vehicle for me at no cost, which can also be used for personal use, not just company business. For that reason I transfered my car lease to my Dad, so I no longer have a personal car, only my company car and a motorcycle.

I have a decent amount of cash saved up(~$15,000), which could get me through at least a couple of months, while searching for a new job, I'm just not sure that I can find one soon enough that can pay a similar salary(the job market isn't so great in my area).

I'm locked into my lease for a year, so moving back in with my parents isn't really an option.

Should I stay at my job and tough it out until I find something different, or should I quit for the sake of my happiness and risk running into some financial issues?

18,"So I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in Economics, and have worked for roughly 8 months at a large custodian bank. I do not enjoy my job and in short, I don't find it interesting or motivating. 

My girlfriend and I are looking to relocate, something that I'd really like to do; but then the issue arises: ""what type of jobs are you going to pursue?"" To be honest, I have no idea. I know what I like and what I don't like in a job, but on a very macro-level. I have a terrible time boiling down an industry/firm/position that I'd like to shoot for. 

This sort of not knowing has really begun to upset to me as I feel that all of my friends/colleagues have a career path in mind, and I feel like I am just out there, floating. Is there any advice you could give on how to find your niche, or any personal stories of those coming to understand what motivates them? Thank you.",12Jun2017,2

24,"I recently got this new job through a hiring agency, and although I’ve only been there a few weeks now I don’t think it’s for me. I graduated college last May with my Bachelor’s degree and have been working as a server ever since because I couldn’t find a full time “grown up” job. I have applied to tons of places and interviewed for a few, but no one would hire me. So I contacted a local hiring agency and worked with a woman who has placed both my mom and sister in their jobs. But after like 6 months of coming up short I think she just threw me into this one because she couldn’t find anything else and it had been a while. Anyway, so the reason I don’t like this job is because they hired me as an administrative assistant and made it seem like I was going to be doing a variety of stuff. So far I have only been doing spreadsheets, and everyone else in the office (who have been there for years) do the same thing. The company is like a distributor for industrial equipment, and I work in the “office portion” of a warehouse. The other few women who work in the same office space as me barely talk to each other, it’s boring as hell, and even if I stayed with the company I don’t think it would take me far. As a side note, the building next to us is a testing facility for rats and the smell of dead animal carcass and feces sometimes seeps in through the windows, which is disgusting. One of the other girls I work with got hired through the same hiring agency as me and as much as I hate to admit it, the fact that she doesn’t even have an associate’s degree bothers me. I know we all have to start somewhere but I’m a little ticked that my hiring agent was okay with placing two people there that have such different levels of education. I’ve given it two weeks and it hasn’t gotten any better, and I doubt it will. Every day is such a struggle to get through, but I feel pressured into staying because my hiring agent told me that I just need a place to give me a chance, and I needed some kind of office experience to put on my resume. But I want to gain actual experience, not just copying and pasting the same thing into Excel all day long. There is also no sense of satisfaction or accomplishment that comes with doing that. I don’t know, I have looked at various blogs online that say anyone who quits a job after two weeks is ridiculous, and not willing to work, and all this complaining about millennials who expect everything to be handed to them. I don’t want to be looked at that way, but I really don’t think this is the type of job for me. Should I stick it out or should I quit? ",12Jun2017,1

28,"This is an online friend I met back when I was 14 or 15. We did the online relationship thing and it was fun at that age, but after that we stayed friends. One of the best friends I've made online.

We talked about the serious stuff in our lives and also the not serious stuff. We have very similar tastes in video games so we spent time over the years playing different things from an old MMO, minecraft, to a few Nintendo games. Our communication has varied a lot, sometimes from talking to each other every day to sometimes only leaving each other offline messages. The varying communication was never an issue, it just happened as our lives would take different changes.

Then it just stopped...At some point it hit me that I'd been the one leaving offline messages for over a month with no response. I waited to see if there would be any response ever and it's since been over half a year. I don't know if the term ""ghosting"" applies to non-dating relationships, but that's pretty much what it was.

We both know enough about each other that it'd be easy for her to find my other social media accounts if she needed a new way to contact me, she even had my cell# if it was needed.

I checked her social media and saw she's still been online, it's just me that's been cut out. Not the best feeling in the world and that was the last time I checked.

Part of me thinks that if our 15-year friendship meant so little to her then it's best that it's over. Another part of me thinks that friendship like that is worth putting in some fight over; everyone else I've known since that time either IRL or online has drifted away or moved on, she's been the friend that's always been there.

And the most negative part of me thinks that's this has gone on for so long that the damage is already done and there is no point to stressing over it anymore.

So /r/advice, what do I do now?",12Jun2017,2

31,"So here is kind of a short story, but my aunt has a diabetic son and I think he is on the autistic spectrum somewhere. Well he is about 54 years old and lives with his wife but my aunt suspects that his wife is giving him more medicine than is prescribed because he will come over zonked out of his mind and sleep all day. His sugar is always so high, but she ignores the doctors advice constantly (we suspect at least). Where he doesn't really understand what's going on, he can't tell her no if she is giving him extra medicine.

The hospital also sent a nurse to stay with them for a whole when he had a feeding tube, but the wife told them no and that she would take care of him but then an hour later, she called an ambulance to take him back to the hospital. 

My aunt also doesn't want to confront neither wife or son because she's afraid the wife will punish the son while my aunt can't be there.

34,"So I was at a party last night and was having a good time with one of my friends. After she leave a guy I have a huge crush on starts dancing with me. Awesome right? Wrong. This guy lets call him Sam, has told me he wasn't interested in me a few months ago. So Sam and I end up grinding then he goes to dance with his friends. We are both drunk him way more than me. As the night is coming to an end Sam is at the food table and I go over to get a bottle of water. We start talking and he offers me some of his drink which I take. After giving him back the bottle we start kissing. I tell him that he's really drunk a couple of times and he rushes off. 

My sister is coming to pick me up and I ask him to walk me down the driveway because its dark. As we near the end of the driveway I stop and thank him for walking me to which he responds with a kiss and a hug. 

This morning I text him asking how the rest of his night was and if he remembered anything from last night involving me. He said ""just the dancing why?"" I tell him that we kissed a bit totally downplaying it. He didn't remember. I asked what it meant and he said sorry and that it didn't change the fact he wasn't interested. 

So logically I'm a little upset about this and am getting the feeling he was taking advantage of the fact I was into him. 

I have no idea what would be going on in Sam's head and need an outside interpertaion because my friends are no help and he doesn't freaking remember.  ",12Jun2017,1

40,"Right now I'm a 20yo 3rd year undergrad student in the U.S. pursuing a double major in communication and Spanish with a minor in business. I've really planned on working sales and distribution for the majority of my college career because I've worked in distribution roles before and really see myself in the industry. However, right now I'm interning at a marketing agency and I absolutely love it. 

Getting an MBA would definitely open more possibilities for me in this industry, but it would also put me at least $40,000 in debt (going to graduate undergrad with no debt).

43,"Hi, this is my first job I'm at right now. It's an easy job in deli at a grocery store. I've never had problems with previous managers and I get along with everyone just fine. I get along and have good relationships with the other managers and customers. I feel like my manager is out to get me. 

He repeatedly gives me hours on my schedule that I have told him multiple times I cannot do. I cannot work Tuesdays and he always schedules me for 7 or 8hr shifts on tuesdays. He complains when I remind him I cannot work on tuesdays. He says that I am being a burden to the everyone else in deli by having to switch shifts with a co-worker. I also have a max limit of working 25hrs/week but I am always scheduled for 30+hrs. Whenever I tell him something about this he gets pissed off at me for ""not wanting to be a part of the team"". I can count on one hand how many people work more than 25hrs and they are all full time workers (I am part time). He also gives new employees in our department the ones I specifically ask for (mornings). I am not always available during evenings because I have to take care of my siblings. 

Also, when things go wrong when working he always finds a way to blame it on me. Last week when taking inventory he mistakenly marked that we did not need to order anymore American cheese. I asked him a simple question while he was taking inventory and this is when he made the mistake. He said i made a huge distraction to him and I'm the reason were losing profits this week. I feel like 9 out of 10 times I'm the scapegoat.

Lastly, my Manager, a coworker, and I were discussing a shift change. I was to take co-worker's shift on Monday and he would take my shift on Tuesday. I show up on Monday to take his shift, all is fine.  On Tuesday, coworker does not show up to my shift.  I get a call 30 mins after the shift.was scheduled to start. My manager asks where I'm at and says I'm scheduled for Tuesday. I told him we switched and said he was there and instantly accuses me of lying. He says what I'm doing isn't right and i shouldn't throw my coworkers under the bus like this. He demanded I come in and I explained i wasn't able to go. Coworker then shows up 2hrs after shift was scheduled to supposed to start and left 1hr before shift was supposed to end. Apparently, I owe coworker 10hrs so he got the whole weekend off while I had to work his shifts on top of mine. I asked my manager yesterday why I have to do this and he says that we never had this conversation and I am lying. I remember the exact conversation. He tells me to get back to work.

45,"My girlfriend and I have been together for just over three years now. We just graduated university together and our moving back with each of our families here in New York City. Long story short, my girlfriend is constantly abused by her mother. Her mother always hangs things over her head, degrades her, steals money from her, and my girlfriends' grandparents always take her mothers side. She feels like she has no where left to turn.

Today, her mother told my girlfriend would have to start paying her car bills on her own, which equates to about 500 dollars a month. My girlfriend is scheduled to go to graduate school in the fall, and cannot possibly handle both a full time job and full time graduate school. What's worse, when mother and daughter went shopping for this car, my girlfriend wanted a cheap, used car. But her mother INSISTED on getting a brand new one. Her mom paid for the car initially, but is now thrusting all of the expenses on her daughter.

Her grandparents are complicit in this abuse. They never reprimand their daughter in how she treats my girlfriend. They say she should ""be grateful"" for what she's done for her.

My girlfriend is seriously contemplating not going to grad school now (she is scheduled to attend Colombia University in September), so she can survive. Her father is completely out of the picture now since my girlfriend turned 21 (he is now not obligated to give her money). She has already taken out massive loans from undergrad (which her mother barely helped paid for). Another thing her mother did is claim all of my girlfriends refund money from the loans for herself since she claims her as a dependent. My girlfriend has some savings, but those can only last for so long.

This has gone on my girlfriends whole life. I feel so frustrated because I cannot do anything to help right now. I am currently looking for a job myself so that I can support her. But she has worked hard her entire life and I would hate to see it torn away from her.

But I want to try my best to forgive so what they did will stop keeping me up at night and giving me panic attacks.

I don't think this is fair that he expects me to be cool with driving him around especially since he could have driven here too. He hasn't offered to split money for gas or other maintenance. We will be living in the same home in our new city and our job is about 22 miles each direction . gas here is about $2.20 per gallon and my car tops out at 22mpg as it is a large truck.

He's now happily engaged and I feel like my life is the same since the summer he left. Of course there are fewer tears now, but I'm still grieving over what I thought we had. The whole thing sort of fucked me up. I know this sounds stupid, but it's hard not to feel like I can't love anyone else the same way. In so many ways, I still miss him.

Since college has ended, I haven't been able to pick up a pencil for so much as a doodle whereas when I was younger you couldn't rip the pencil from my hand.  

I know my issues go a lot deeper than this.  I have a problem with perfection, but since achieving anything that can come close to passing as 'close enough to perfection' is so exhausting, I kind of choose to just do nothing instead.  Also, I think I'm realizing I have an issue with self esteem.  It's like, I have many talents, but I'm worthless and therefore anything I do is also worthless, so what's the point?

I used to do so many things and I was good at them.  Now, and for the past several years, I do the bare minimum, and if I have free time I just stare into nothing or lay on the floor and fool about on my phone.  I guess I'm afraid but it manifests as laziness, disinterest, and crippling resistance to doing the things I'm good at and/or enjoy.

64,"I know, I know, I can already predict what you're going to say. ""If you have an issue with alcohol, you need to quit completely..."" And I totally get that. Trust me I do. Just hear me out.

I had some trauma happen to me about 4 months ago. I was raped by a coworker and had to quit my job because of it. I never experienced anything that horrifying and traumatic and it definitely lead me to use alcohol as a crutch. 
I literally just got a new job today which I'm super excited about, but for the last few months while I was unemployed, my depression really skyrocketed and took over. It was hard to control. However, at times, I could go a week without alcohol and feel fine. But then in another week, I feel like shit without it. My addiction is very strange and fleeting and I don't quite know how to describe it. (Before anyone asks, yes I have a therapist I go to every other week) 

Sometimes when the depression hits hard, I'll take a little bit of vodka with me to a friend's house and casually sip on it while we hang out. I never get trashed, but sometimes I get a bit too tipsy and say/do shit that embarrasses me in the long run. And I hate that.

So basically what it comes down to is, I know I have an addiction problem. Believe me I do. The vodka in the water bottle thing has become more of a common thing than I'd like to admit. But before the sexual abuse, I could manage alcohol pretty well. It was never a real issue for me, (I'm 21 by the way), so drinking publicly was a really fun new thing for me, so I would get pretty drunk at bars now and then, but it was never to the extent that it is now.

I just want to know if it's possible for me to get back to the point of drinking casually again without stopping completely. I have a few vacations coming up this summer with a bunch of friends where there will obviously be alcohol involved, and I'd just love to get back to that happy medium where I can just have a few beers/ glasses of wine, or a shot or two and stop there. I hate to say it, but I think alcohol can be a great thing when used CORRECTLY.

I hope I don't sound pathetic saying I don't want to give it up completely... I just want to get to the point where I'll just drink with friends again. If anyone has any advice for me that would be absolutely wonderful. Thank you for hearing me out ahead of time, any feedback would help me out tremendously. :)",12Jun2017,3

I have the stats to apply and get into medical school but was hesitant about applying so I am now working as a research assistant at the Boston Children's Hospital for 2 years. I was planning on taking these two years to think about what I really want to do (AKA what my ""dream"" is) and realized that the only thing in the world that makes me happy and puts a smile on my face is children. That being said, I thought that being a pediatrician would be enough but after shadowing a few, I just don't think it is for me. I want to be a part of something bigger. This is not to say that pediatricians aren't awesome and provide a needed service but I just want to be someone who can make a bigger sociological impact and get more involved.

80,"Hi Reddit,
I currently teach piano and voice lessons at a music school. I love music, I love teaching, and I love working with kids and teens. At this particular school I just feel like I cannot do anything right plus the school just added new rules that seem unfair to me. There is a very long list of things which are persuading me to leave this position but I am only going to list the top 3. Please tell me if things are indeed unfair or if I am just being a brat.
1)	I have to buy any materials that I need for classes out of my own pocket. 

The school offers an introductory music class for kids ages 3-5. Since they are too young to actually play an instrument (Most kids start playing at 5-6 years old or if their parents decide to start them earlier they usually have to find a private teacher) and since the school provided me with a room that doesn’t have any instruments in it. I decided that I would teach them basic rhythms, notes, and play music theory games. One day I decided to play a game with music flash cards with the kids in the class, I didn’t think that there was anything wrong with it, and the kids had fun doing it. At the end of class, they could successfully tell me 12 music symbols. After the class was over the general manager came in a told me that she “didn’t approve” of me teaching the kids with flash cards. She told me that the kids should be doing more arts and crafts, coloring, and playing instruments and that what I was doing was unacceptable. As I said before, there are no instruments in the room I teach that class in, and they didn’t have any supplies or arts and craft stuff available for me to use. When I brought that to her attention she gave me a bag full of bells that she said the kids could play and said that I would have to buy the arts and craft stuff myself. So for months I have been using my own money to buy the materials I need to make simple musical instruments, and I also have to use my own ink to print out sheets for the kids to color.

2)	One of the new rules is that “if a student is a no show teachers will not get paid”

I feel that this is unfair. At other music schools, if a student doesn’t show up for their lesson the teachers still get paid for their time. Last week I drove to the school and 3 students didn’t show up that day. So I didn’t get paid at all for the 30-minute drive to and from the school and for waiting around for 3 hours for no one to show up.

3)	I think that the manager at the school is unfair.

For example, one of my students called me and said that they would be around 10 minutes late because they were stuck in traffic. I told them not to worry about it and since I didn’t have another lesson afterwards I would make sure that they got their full lesson time. I was just sitting in the vocal room and playing the piano while I waited then the manager walked in and said “what exactly are you doing”? so I explained to her that the student had called the front desk and told me they were late but they were on their way. Then she told me that “the bathroom needed to be cleaned” and that I could do that while I was waiting. Luckily my student walked in right as she was saying that. But I still don’t understand why she wanted me to clean the bathroom at the school. I’m a piano/voice teacher not a janitor. Why would she even request that?

81,"I'm 20, staying at home for a while as I'm between jobs and homes. I plan on moving out asap once my new job starts up. 

He's paranoid and easily angered. Its not uncommon, but he seems to ""forget"" and deny that he's ever accused me of anything.

He is frequently blaming me of things that either A) don't make sense, or B) both don't make sense and could have been anyone if they ""could"" make sense with a few backflips (4 people living here total).

He goes to me first, and it begins. He asks. I say no, because 100% of the time, I have no idea what he's even talking about. 

He asks the next person, he says no, and its fine he believes him.

So he goes back to me and begins freaking out for the next half hour or longer. 

There were times when it had something to do with my phone (he fucking thought that I was recording him in his sleep?), I yelled back and said that I could pull up the evidence that I didn't do X right now, then he angrily rejected seeing the evidence right off the bat and right there, accuses me one more time, then leaves, refusing in disbelief that I would offer for him to see my phone and all that he's ""looking for.""

If it doesn't stop there, he continuously tries to reason out why I'm lying and why, and lets me know. Constantly. Then gets furious that I don't ""just admit it,"" and is angry that now I'm upset because he's accusing me and only me of everything.  

Tonight, it went on for 2 hours, and I've had it.

I was in the bathroom, and he goes and asks who was in his room. Me? No. Other guy? No. So it **has** to be me, and not the lying druggie ex-con artist who lives with us.

So he begins getting angry and telling me how he saw a ""phone light"" in his room. Great.

He goes on and on, yelling and calling me a liar and telling me to just admit it.

What the hell am I supposed to do? He went to bed and refuses to believe me and asked a few times before laying down for good if I just wanted his toilet paper.

What am I supposed to do for the next few months? I can't leave, and he's losing his shit at me and no one else. ",12Jun2017,1
82,"I work on a boat that goes under a bridge that people jump off of in order to kill them selves. It's hard to estimate the frequency, but rough estimates place it around 1.5 times per week. 98% of jumpers die. 

I work 3 or 4 times a week. The boat goes under the bridge 4 times per day. 

Since the beginning of the year, our boat has come into direct contact with a jumper 6 times. By that I mean, we see someone jump, we radio the coast guard, we wait on seen for the coast guard to arrive. But I've never been on the boat when we've had to deal with a jumper. 

Earlier this week, I wasn't working that day, there was a jumper and the coast guard requested our boat secure the body because they were first on scene. 

My coworkers held onto the body floating in the water, and the captain decided to bring the body on board to attempt cpr. There was a doctor on board, a passenger, who assisted. The man was dead. The coast guard came up along side and took the body about 10 minutes later. 

Given the frequency, I feel it's probable that I will eventually come into contact with one of these jumpers. And I'm dreading it. 

Everyone I work with recognizes the seriousness of the jumpers, we never joke about it, or pretend it's not terribly sad. No one is jaded by it. It's really a sad thing every singe time. 

It seems to affect some of us more than others. I feel guilty because I've never even come into direct contact with a jumper, but every time I hear about it I get so sad. I think about it most of the day, and I've dreamt about it. 

My boyfriend says I should try not to think about it. It's a random event. There's no use obsessing about it. 

I've never told anyone this, but my mom attempted suicide about 5 years ago. She took a combination of prescription drugs and called me to tell me what she had done. And that she was relieved that it would soon be over. 

I hung up and called 911 and she did not die. She's much better now. I don't think about that night too often anymore. 

The jumpers make me sad because I wish someone in their life, who knew them, could intervene and save them.

85,"Hi, so this is my first post and a lengthy story so bear with me.

I've been obsessively thinking angry / sad thoughts about a former friend of mine and I'm not sure how to get closure on it. If I could afford therapy- trust me I would.... I just want some outsiders opinions and advice on this.

I'm going to tell this story as honestly and unbiasedly as I can. It's a strange situation. 

So when I was 21, I met this person, a 20 year old male at a hookah lounge which allowed drinking. he approached me randomly and started conversation and we become friends. I was just out of a relationship and drinking a lot and at the time didnt see any issue with casual sex, so when he pursued that with me I accepted it. I made it clear to him i did not want a relationship as I did not have feelings for him more than platonically.

 we hooked up / hung out for about 4-5 months and I met someone else and became disinterested in hanging out with him so I cut him off (or ghosted him as some would call it) he continued to send me messages when i did not respond for about a year or two after. he sent about five so. it was not too excessive, though i ignored them all- until a year ago when i was 23. i felt bad about ending the friendship abruptly and figured we could be friends again so i finally replied...

We make plans to hang out at my apt. During the time I was abusing xanax that i was prescribed. He brought beer and i was drinking too. If you know anything about these drugs then you know they make you black out easily when combined. I had explained, before blacking out, that i was no longer interested in him yet we could be platonic friends. he said that was fine. I invited him to stay over and went to bed. I remember the drug combination was hitting me hard so i went to sleep. we were both fully clothed. i wake up to him penetrating me although im so out of it (im an extremely heavy sleeper, especially when drunk) that i cant comprehend the situation/ wake up/ come to so i fall back asleep instantly.

the next morning i wake and he is not there. I am still clothed. I am wondering if what i thought happened was a dream although it felt too real, though i try to shut it out of my head bc i didnt want to think he would do that to me.

later i confront him about it. he admits that after i fell asleep, he proceeded to move my clothing and rape me. he doesnt call it rape at first though he admits he did it after i fell asleep. he later admits that yes it is rape by definition as he understood i was not awake or conscience for it . he then proceeds to tell me that it ""was revenge for ghosting him years ago/ because he was high on hash oil/ because his friends make rape jokes and it was fucking with his head/ because i flirted with him a little bit before i fell asleep etc. etc.""

 i consider this rape. he has admitted it was rape. we have had conversations about it. however the nature of it was so strange that i continued to try and maintain the friendship as he apologized for it. i know that i should not have done this. the friendship was obviously very toxic after this and we fought a lot. i was very depressed and abusing drugs heavily at the time so i kept him around. we became having an intimate relationship again too although i ended it recently because i could not get over the thing he had done and the intimacy was very empty to me ( i was heavily using drugs and did not enjoy it half of the time, hated myself for doing it. while still feeling confusing feelings of hate and attraction as i once had for him before) 

the friendship after was also very strange bc he told me he wanted to be together ( i told him i did not want to date him after what he did) and when i started talking to other people he got extremely jealous and would slander me to people. it was very unhealthy so i cut him off. 

so this is why im writing here i guess. even though we are no longer friends (by my choice) i still feel very angry. i sometimes want to try a pursue legal action ( he admitted to one of his former friends about it, and i may be able to get screenshots of that conversation) although bc it was forever ago/ the situation i doubt anything would come from it. I know I should have never continued talking to him after. i was confused about it tho bc i was lonely and sad. 

I know i should not sit around feeling sad about it all the time, its just greatly affected my ability to trust people, my self respect, and trusting that others respect me. it also makes me angry / worried he will do it to other people.

how should I handle this ?

86,"so in the words of the fresh prince; my life got flip-turned upside down. But a little context to past history first: my parents got divorced when i was 7 and i haven't seen my father since (in 27 now). i grew up with my mother in a lower class family of two (she never re-married), my mother was abusive both physically and mentally and growing up was honestly a nightmare. I've been working since the age of 14 and had to literally save up for anything i ever wanted, since high school i have served 2 years in the military and am not writing my bachelor thesis after working full time and paying my way through university over 4 years. i'm not rich but i'm reasonably secure financially at this point in my life, and i don't really talk to my mother unless he calls me and needs me to screw in a light bulb. 
so through some miracle and believe it or not my girlfriend i have re-established connection with my father, and as it turns out the divorce got messy, and my mother threatened him which is why  he never popped into my life again (sounds like bullshit to me as well). but now he's insisting on paying my ticket halfway across the globe to meet him, and as it turns out my father is rich... really rich, like fuck you rich. my question is how do i handle this, i know he will want to shower me with money because of guilt/whatever else... whats the best way for interaction, what boundaries to place? how to behave? i grew up without a father figure and i really don't know how to behave or handle this, there's no rule book for this and i'm really really confused and in emotional turmoil.

But my life feels pretty empty. I don't like any movies, or any tv shows, or any video games, or any hobbies that I've tried. I have one close friend, but no romantic partners. I've never had any. For a while, having one was one of the things that I wanted, but I gave up on it. 

It's likely that this is just a mood, but I checked some of my journal notes and I remember that I've felt like this for a long time. Even if I feel happy, often, I think that the feeling of happiness, in this context, is wrong; there should be more life than what I do.

I'm not sure why I feel unprepared. I can continue my education for another 2 years to receive my BA, but of course thats expensive and I'm paying for myself to go to school. And what if I still feel this way?

90,"With my long unfulfilled sexual urges I've been trying to hold them in and for the last month or so it seems like they haven't been bothering me so much but today when someone from my past who I at one point WANTED to give my virginity to but she wasn't interested ended up calling me to check up on me alot of my old feelings resurfaced and I was reminded of the fact that yes I still have those urges but no healthy way to fulfill them.

96,"Sorry guys, this is going to be a long post. 

I have a close friend who recently got engaged to a guy she has dated for almost 8 years. For the past couple years, she has been quite open, after a couple drinks, that she wants to get married so I am happy that she has this now. I really want to be there and be supportive and happy for my friend and believe that this is what she wants. My friend has always had self esteem issues and image problems. She suffers from anorexia and bulimia which is an on going battle. A parent also passed away in the past couple of years so she has not had an easy time the past 10 years.  

My problem comes from the fact that she told me on three separate occasions that she does not love this person and does not want to be with them. Just to give you some back story; the first time she said this to me was about four years ago. We went to a pretty heavy party with a lot of booze and drugs free flowing there. I knew her boyfriend was into smoking a bit but that was all I was (and still really am) aware of. When we got out of the party some guys tried talking to us who had been partying heavily and my friend blurted out to me (and another person) how she hated that her boyfriend took drugs and that he brought them into her home and that he would sit around getting baked with his friends and she came home to that after a hectic day at work and she could not see a long term future with this person because of this and that she wanted to go and travel a bit and he didn't and she has money saved up to go do it which he knew nothing about. Next morning we get up and the other person that was with us tries to approach the subject and my friend brushes it off as just being drunk. We encouraged her to speak to her boyfriend about how she felt and she said she would but I'm not sure if anything ever came of it. 

So about a month after this incident, friends that my friend had made through her boyfriend were putting a lot of pressure on her to hang out and come to parties (my friend had a pretty demanding work schedule at the time) and to be at events with them. The other person who had been with us at the previous party, the night my friend opened up to us, said to my friend ""you do know that these people aren't your friends""? My friend took that as an insult and felt like this other person was jealous of her new friendships. I believe she was saying it because she wanted her to know that if they broke up (which she had said to us was a real possibility) then these people would not be there to support her like we would. My friend and this other person had a very strained relationship after this and her boyfriend only ever speaks nastily about this person now. 

So fast forward about a year and a half, we are sitting in a bar one night and my friend opens up again about how this is not what she wants. At this point they are living together and her big worry is that she will have no where to live if she does break up with him. I try to encourage her to do what feels right for her and that she will work something out and be there for her. Anyway long story short, he finds out what she is thinking and talks her into staying with him. In the meantime she has told me again she doesn't want to be with him.

Since then, all my friend does is spend all her time with this guy, his family, his friends and friends she has made through him. If you ask her to spend time together, she will make up a reason she can't. If she does, he will come. She has spoken to me at length about how she does not like one particular girl in this group of his friends, how this person is nasty and demanding and how they make things awkward when they are out in a group, but my friend will spend a lot of her spare time with this particular girl on their own going on weekend trips and to events and posting on social media like they are best friends. I feel like she just does this because she is part of her boyfriends inner circle. She also overshares her relationship with her boyfriend on social media.

He always make remarks about her being stupid and how she can't do things for herself without him, but he does it in such a sly way it comes off like a joke, but it clearly isn't. He wants to move back to their hometown in the next year, it's a small place with not much happening there but his family own a local business which he can work in, but there won't be anything for her there. That's another thing, her boyfriend has no work ethic and sponges off his fairly well off parents and it's rubbing off on my friend. I feel like she is happy to go along with this moving back to their hometown thing because it will mean she's closer to her living parent and they like him, but to me thats not a reason to marry someone. 

I know I need to put up and shut up and put a smile on my face but it kills me for her holding all this inside. ",12Jun2017,2

100,"Hello, 

I work around 50 to 60 hours a week in a good organization, have a good family life and I have my finances in order. I will inherit some real estate so my life is pretty much sorted, nothing to worry about. 

I'm wondering daily if this is it, do I want/need more from life? Do I need to startup some business with my skills or not? My skills are fairly easily marketable and I have the contacts and live in a big world city. Do I want to risk the stability and a good life and am I just too greedy because I see around me that it is possible to run an own business and then sell it after 10 years for some of cash and call it the day? 

This is of course a huge 1st world question and I'm really grateful for the life and opportunities I have. I understand not everybody is in the same boat as me. 

I don't know what to do, work another 20 years like this or throw it all upside down and start on my own. 

Am I an idiot? 

Thanks. ",12Jun2017,10
101,"A little backstory: I work for a family friends company and our schedule is just a day by day thing. They either tell me my next day after a day of work or they text me. 90% of the time they text me around 11am-430pm. The latest has been 700pm. So on Friday my boss told me that he'll either text me Sunday or Monday depending on how Saturday went. I waited until 10pm before figuring there was no work because I couldn't see him texting me that late if we have to get up at 5AM plus like I said the latest was 730pm. Plus the latest they work is 6pm. I ended up turning off my phone at 1030pm since it was at 3% and was already talking to friends in Discord to confirm I could play our D&amp;D campaign. About an hour later my mom comes up and says ""oh the bosses son says there's work tomorrow he tried getting ahold of you"". 

I was already starting to get fed up with working for them but this just pushed me over the edge. I told her ""yeah if he wants to tell me there's work, don't tell me at 1130 at night. I'm not just going to ditch my friends after I made a commitment. Tell him I'm not coming in"". She proceeded to tell him that I'll be ready when he picks me up. We argued back and forth for a bit before I just shut my door and pretended to sleep. I've been up all night hoping I can sleep through the chaos that is to happen or at least use it as an excuse. This guy, the bosses son is literally the worst kind of person. He's always putting his brother down like he's beneath him or something. He thinks just because he's been working longer then we have it gives him the right to treat us like shit. He also forces me to go to their family parties. I try to say no but then he just says ""ok but you know my Dad really likes having you around and he'd be really disappointed if you weren't there"". 

It sucks too because his Dad, the boss, treats everyone with so much respect that you just like working for him. I don't intend to work for them much longer. It's getting to the point where he wants to get me on their level so about 50-60 hours a week with no off days because he thinks I want to be like him. I'm only 21 I only took this job because I was struggling to find a job and I just wanted to save a little money for school by working part time. If I tell him this he'll just let me go on the spot because he'll know I don't want to work for him instead of keeping me at part time. What should I do? Am I in the wrong for not going in because of how late he texted me and the fact that I had already made a commitment with my friends?",12Jun2017,2
103,"I was born with a female body. I wore dresses when I was really little, but i stopped that kind of stuff by age 10. I was actually really transphobic and homophobic when I was young cause my mom was and she had me brainwashed. Then I moved, cause she was also abusive and someone found out. Now that I've lived with my dad for 2 years, I've started to finally work out who I am. At the end of last year, I think I must've searched something along the lines of ""I don't feel like a woman"" and found out what the term ""trans"" meant (before I thought it was something else). A lot kind of made sense with that. I feel horrible and very wrong when I get my period (not like cramps horrible I mean ""this isn't me and this is wrong"" horrible). I (sometimes) get really upset about having a not-flat chest. mosy of all, I hate being called a woman. I feel more like I'm ""just a person"", genderless. I honestly wish I could have an androgynous body. But I know I could never transition. I am especially against people seeing me nude, plus I'm terrified of surgery. It upsets me when people say that because of this I'll always be a woman because I just know I'm not. I dream of a world where this is normal, where I could come out and it be no big deal. But that'll never happen. Plus, I'm worried it's just a phase. I'm only 16 and it's only been a little over half a year. Maybe it's just my semi misogynistic atritude that makes me not want to be a part of ""women"" (I am trying to be less misogynistic btw I know it's bad). Or maybe im just mentally ill because of my mom abusing me. I already know if I am trans that I won't be accepted by others, but I at least wish I knew what I was so I could accept myself. I'm just so confused if this is a phase, so sorry for rambling. I'll add a tldr cause to be honest I doubt anyone wants to sit through that wall of text.. 

Tldr; I've felt I might be trans since at least last November. I am 16, born in a female body. I honestly feel like I am agender, but if I had to pick I'd rather be seen as male. I'm just so scared and confused that this is just a phase. It just feels ""wrong"" to be called or seen as a woman. ",12Jun2017,2

108,"Hi Reddit,

I'm not sure where I should post this, but appreciate any advice on how to handle addiction with a family member.

Context: my sister and brother-in-law have been married for a little over a year and have been together for about 12 years. Most recently he has lost his job and surfaced a steady cocaine habit. Apparently he has been casually doing coke the last few years, but recently it has turned into a daily habit (I believe around the time he lost his job). We found out a couple weeks ago about his usage and he promised he would stop. He thinks he can stop on his own.. but he's still using. He lies to my sister about his usage even though she can see the white power on his nose, on the floor, on his desk, etc. I love my sister very much and hate to see her worry. 

I have done research on inpatient and outpatient substance abuse facilities in our area and have given the information to my sister and bro-in-law. I talked to a substance abuse counselor and they advised he needs to be the one to make the change. Until then, any advice on next steps? Advice for my sister? ",12Jun2017,1

I have been objectifying these women hoping to get to have sex with them. I want to stop doing this, so I want to remove Tinder. I don't really want to match with new girls because I don't want to repeat these same mistakes.

But I have two Tinder dates almost planned. One is in a couple of days and another is ***possibly*** going to happen in a few months - she said she wanted to think about it and will be away until then.

Thing is, because I wanted to stop this behavior, I'd feel really bad if I ended up having sex with them. It's obviously the case that I want to have sex, but I don't think I should because I haven't exactly been the coolest person in the world about it.

116,"My divorce with my ex-wife finalized a little over a year ago. I have primary time-sharing with our 11-year-old son. The man she ran off with is a douche and quick to anger. She's living with him in a home rented by his family (I'm not sure of the lessee.) 

She's been having drama with her bf's brother and brother's wife(?) who moved out recently. Last night, the brother and wife(?) went over to her place. Words were exchanged and the wife(?) punched ex-wife in the eye, leaving a very nasty bruise. 

She has time-sharing with our son and called to say  I should come and get him (a few hours away.) I asked what was wrong and she told me. I advised her to call law enforcement. 

Her bf didn't want to call the law because it's family. She calls me back and tells me that the bf said that if the law is called then he would cut her wrists bad enough to admit her to a psychiatric hospital (she has a history, but is back on meds) and that he would tell the law that I (and my gf) abuse and molest our son. I told her to tell the law exactly what she told me.

An hour or so later, I call for a status update and her father put her up in a motel, remotely. She told me that the deputies who responded know the bf and her family. They (somehow) coerced her into signing a paper saying that she didn't want to press charges, despite telling them what the bf had said.

I advised her to call the sheriff's office and file a report and a complaint. She was told that it would only be a misdemeanor and if she didn't like the way the sheriff's office did things in that county, then she should just leave. 

I will be heading out to pick my son up after work. She asked that I bring her back to my county. Where? I don't know and she is vague about that,  but it can't be at my apartment. Her other family and friends in the area can't or won't take her in.

What should I do? Should I follow up on the ex-bf attempting to accuse me of a crime I didn't commit to hush her? Is there a place I can take her in Lee County, Florida. She has family in Mississippi, but there aren't funds to get her there. She is jobless and about to be homeless. 

Any advice is welcome. Thank you.

119,"I am at a career crossroad and would really appreciate some advice. I have been in my current job for 4 years now and feel utterly stagnant in my role. I am not learning or growing professionally and am afraid that the longer I stay here, the less ambitious I will be and the harder it will be to get out. The thing is, this job is extremely comfortable, has no stress, I never take work home, and pays extremely well for what I do. I am 32, married with a toddler, so a good paying, secured, and a stress-free job is somewhat important. But I also feel like I am only 32 and I cannot possibly sign my life away at a dead-end job, even though it pays very well. To add to the mess, I have already accepted the job offer, but find it difficult to actually resign because I keep thinking about all that I am giving up. We are also in the middle of a move (buying and selling a house) and a new job may put us in jeopardy when it comes to getting approved for a new mortgage. It is just a very stressful time. Given the pros and cons I've listed below, can you offer me some advice as to whether I should leave or stay? 

Current Job Pros:

- Will be earning 100K+ come August

- Flexible hours (can come in the office early and leave early if needed)

- Minimal stress

- Doing work that I am naturally good at

- Great location, lots of shops and restaurants steps away from the office (can get dental appointments done during lunch or run errands)

- I get along with my boss

- Secured (company gets steady government funding and is always expanding)

- Cheaper and shorter commute (30 minutes of subway ride)

Current Job Cons:

- Extremely boring

- Feel completely stagnant in my career

- Dwindling ambition due to boredom

- No friends here, lack of social support

- Nothing to learn

- Behind a computer all day

- Feel very isolated and lonely


New Job Pros:

- Will be working under a leader in my field who is well respected. I will be able to learn a lot from him

- More mobile

- More challenging

- New environment

- Great learning opportunity

- One extra week of vacation

- Can be a stepping stone to the next step in my career


New Job Cons:

- Pays only 90K (but has performance bonuses up to $7000 a year)

- Job is more demanding (was told by a colleague who worked there that there is a lot of stress and may have to take work home)

- In a more isolated industrial environment

- Hours are usually strict 8 am to 4 pm

- Longer commute (20 minutes of driving but may encounter traffic due to rush hour)

- Probation for 6 months (always a chance to get laid off before probation ends)

- Not as secured as the company is at risk of some financial restructuring (depending on which government is elected next year)


To add is that if I decide to stay at my current job, I will burn bridges with the new company, which I truly do not want happen as I am still fairly new in my career and this field is small.

122,"My Spanish friend just had a kid a couple weeks ago. He isn't married. He had sex with A random girl at a festival and the girl randomly hits him up on Facebook 8 months later saying he is going to be a father.

I had a gut feeling something wasn't right from the start. Mainly cause I saw this girl hooking up with guys left and right that festival weekend and is sorta trashy. You know the ones that seek child support through any means.

 But when I saw that baby, my suspicions arose. First, she didn't let him into the labor room. Ok whatever. Then the baby comes out and its as white as the president and his hair is RED. This is supposedly a child of two 100% hispanic ""parents"".

But the last few months my friend has been having the best time as a new dad. I can see it in his eyes that he is happier with this new purpose. Before he was just getting fucked up and hooking up with randoms at festivals.

There is just noticeably less joy in just about any activity I am doing.

I try to imagine things that would make me feel excited and alive as I was some decades ago, but they all seem ridiculous, in contrast to who I am and what what everybody (including me) thinks of me. I want to try different things and different lifestyles. But they all seem forbidden to me. I am in a long term marriage, with a long term work contract, long term mortgage and have a long term obligations towards my kids - none of which I want to break of course. And yet I dream of being someone completely different, behaving differently, living basically the opposite of the life I have now, even for just a while.

The thing is, I know I can endure. I can sacrifice and just pretend for everyone that I'm happy and content, for the benefit of everyone else. And that's pretty much what I've been doing.

I can imagine what some of the answers are going to be, depending on your personal beliefs: 1) Just stop your whining and be grateful. 2) Find a hobby that complies with your lifestyle and obligations. 3) Pursue your happiness no matter what. None seem possible for me. I am looking for 4) but can't even imagine it.

138,"I'll keep this concise. I've been staying up late since I was like 13, and for the past several months (nearly a year) I've been staying up all night even when it completely coincides with my daily activities on a weekly basis, and going to bed ridiculously late in general. I've had small periods of time where it got better, but it's never lasted more than a week. I'm so much happier when i get up early and go to sleep at a regular time, yet I can seldom achieve this due to a variety of reasons including anxiety. I feel so far gone at this point I think I just need to see a doctor, which I hate to do because I know they will just give me medicine and probably won't fix the behaviors. But I really don't think I can do it on my own after a year of basically the same thing, and it never getting better for very long, and several more years before that of general lack of a schedule.

142,"I ordered a microphone headset on EBay from someone for $5.99 on sale when the item was originally $19.99. It was a Logitech H110/H111 noise cancellation headset. I needed something that'll get me by for when I do voice calls afar with my laptop.

This seller, sends the wrong item. I got, instead, an Logitech H151. It's about $9.99 in value, $19.99 depending where you go. I sent a message to the seller, being civil, about asking him if he mixed the items up. Showed him the item I bought from him and the item he sent. I also requested a refund during this point too, which I did get.

He apologized and said he'd send a replacement. Okay, cool. I'll use the refund to send back the wrong item in the hopes of getting the right one in return. 2-3 days later, I get the wrong item again when it came in the mail.

Frustrated now, I send a message, pointing him to the item he sent wrong. I had images to back both of my messages up with the first message picturing the wrong item as validated proof. I sent him a photo with two of the wrong items as validated proof. I correct him again as to what the item I really purchased from him was.

I also proposed several options we could do, to try and be fair about this:

* Cover the shipping costs that it'll take to send these back and I won't do business with him again.

* I cover the shipping costs under my own schedule and he takes the negative feedback as the hit.

* Cover the shipping costs it'll take to send these back and send me the right item

* Under wishful circumstances, I keep both items in recognition of this error.

I had another option to propose to him but EBay's character limit prevented me from going further. I was going to also propose that I send one item back and keep the other, since, I do have the item I would need for communication when afar. It almost doesn't matter what it is as long as it's a headset and not a junker like those stupid earbuds I've seen listed.

Seller has not responded since and I'm wondering if he prolongs this expecting me to either leave feedback or send the items back. I still have the refund in my paypal, unspent.

Should I expect to keep both items if he says nothing for longer periods?",12Jun2017,2
143,"Yesterday this number started texting me out of the blue with some weird cryptic messages. 

I started talking to them as I thought they knew me and were just being playful. They said things that made me think they knew things about me, so I continued on in conversation. 

Well, as time went on, they would not reveal their identity and I started to become a little weirded out. Now they will not reveal who they are. They insist that the only thing they know about me is my name, but that doesn't explain some of the things they said or how hey have my name and number (my number is not listed on my Facebook and on top of that my Facebook is private). 

None of my friends recognize the number and I'm super sketched out. They haven't threatened me or anything, but I feel super uncomfortable that this person has my information and wants to talk to me for some reason. I finally demanded they tell me their identity and now they haven't responded. 

I still don't feel very good about this. I called the number and the voicemail it went to said ""The [textmail] (couldn't hear that well) subscriber you called is not available."" My friends and I think it's a fake number through an app. I'm suspicious that it's my ex boyfriend fucking with me (which is just.. psychotic). I emailed him, but he hasn't responded. 

I live alone and I don't take these things very lightly. I don't like that someone randomly has my number, knows my name, and is wanting to talk to me. And on top of it, won't reveal their identity to me. What should I do? It's not like the cops can do anything. He's not violent or harassing me. It's just creepy. What can I do in this situation?

She's a bit impatient, so she just emptied all the clothes into a cart (like she didn't throw them all over the floor or whatever) and started using the machine. Some time after she loaded up the machine, the guy who owned these clothes came down. Like he said, ""Who took my clothes out of the machine?"" My mom said, ""Oh, I did"", and then he completely lost his shit and started shouting shit like ""I'LL CHOP YOUR FINGERS OFF. I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU. YOU'RE LUCKY I TOOK MY MEDS TODAY. YOU'RE A WOMAN AND I DON'T TOUCH WOMEN. BUT I'LL TELL MY NIECES TO COME BEAT YOU."" (Whole time my mom was thinking ""WTF, for what, just moving your clothes out of the washing machine?"") 

Anyway my mom was pretty damn shaken up. She talked to two neighbors about it afterwards (but they weren't there at the time). One basically said ""Oh yeah, I know him, he does have mental issues. But he's also harmless. I'll talk to him."" (Dunno if he will.) Another said ""Oh, carry mace with you! Oh wait, it's *that guy*?

160,"I busted my butt for two months to find the perfect apartment to accommodate me, my boyfriend, his two kids, and his pitbull. There are almost no complexes in the city where I live that are accepting of pitbulls, mostly for insurance reasons, so I struggled to find one that would fit our needs. I probably called 50 places, all of which turned me down because we have a pitbull. 

I finally found the most perfect one - a two bedroom for rent, convenient for both he and I to get to work, had a nice dog park, had a big pool, and was completely accepting of pitbulls. Literally everything we wanted. 

Because the complex accepts pets, they need paperwork to verify that the dog has her shots and is spayed. My boyfriend had no paperwork on her shots and she isn't spayed, so once again I bust my butt to find places to take care of these things. I find a vet clinic that does free shots (woo whoo!) and a vet office that will spay her at a lower cost (woo whoo again!) . I schedule all the appointments and get everything ready, only for my boyfriend to tell me the day before her spaying appointment we can't take the dog to the complex because his ex (who apparently is the owner of the dog, meaning he didn't help pay anything for the dog) will call the cops and have him arrested if we try to take the dog.  Now this whole time, he's been telling me she doesn't want the dog, she doesn't care if we take the dog. 

Do I have a right to be upset? I think I do because I did all the hard work finding the complex that will accept her and scheduling all the appointments. Or should I just suck it up and get over it?

Edit: Bringing numbers into the discussion - 
Apartment with no dog at the complex: 
Rent = 795
No dog deposit, no vet bills, no maintenance bills (food, collar, leash, etc.)

169,"My boyfriend of a year and I are both college students who live with our parents during the summers. Recently, our relationship has been strained, as his mother has been very controlling since he came home- would make him cancel dates with me because she wanted him home, needs to ask her permission to leave the house, if we're out for more than an hour she's liable to call him and he has to pick up regardless of what we're doing and regardless of how silly the content of the call is. We see each other 2-3 times a week, usually while she's working so that they still have time together, and she gets upset that he spends too much time with me and not enough with her. She's made me uncomfortable in their house a few times (details withheld for anonymity) and I figured the solution was just to avoid her. However, this is proving really difficult. If I propose a date out or invite him to my parents' house, she tells him to have me at their house instead. If I am unwilling to move it, she needs an explanation... and also forbids him to leave the house. I don't know how to talk to his mom about it because, well, it's his mom and people don't take well to their mothers being disliked. We've discussed it before and he seems to think it's normal/acceptable. 

How do I handle this situation? Do I swallow my pride and avoid her, deal with the discomfort of seeing her, or try to talk it out with my boyfriend and hope he doesn't hate me for disliking his mom?

170,"My friend is currently struggling to find work, and I'm trying to help her. She has zero experience going through the full job search and interview process, and neither does her family (they've always worked in family businesses), so I'm doing the best I can to teach her the ropes. 

I can tell her everything from how to find the job listings to writing cover letters and getting to the interview, but I can't help her much once she's there. She isn't very good with speaking to strangers and English is her second language, so although she is fluent, her speech skills aren't up to par when it comes to sweet talking her way into a job. To top it off, she has self esteem issues and doesn't feel qualified for anything. (I'm trying to talk her through that, it's kind of a whole other thing.)

We can't rely too much on the resume getting her through, as hers is just okay. She's only had one job other than the family business, and her grades were average. She has an economics degree from a big university, but she isn't passionate about the field. She just wants work to pay the bills and doesn't care much about the kind. 

I'm a social person, so I'm not sure what advice to give her on how to win someone over in an interview.

189,"So, to summarize, I am 24, and already pretty burnt out on my IT job in my current state (Alabama), have lived in Alabama for 12+ years and would like to see much more of the world than the heart of dixie.

There are aspects and parts of Alabama that I love and will always keep in my heart, but I'm just not the kind of person who can find complacency in one area that easily, especially in the area I live at the moment with limited career options for what I am truly passionate about (stand-up comedy...you're gonna laugh I know, but hey, that's the point I guess lol). 

With that being the case, I made the decision a couple years ago that I wanted to move out of state to find work in a new area, with a much higher population, and plenty more options for my dream career being a comedian. I fully understand the hardship and difficulty that can come from a performing arts career field, and will accept every ebb and flow I get along the way, but before that can even happen I need to lock down a decent ""bill payer"" job that can support the living essentials (rent, utilities, car payment, moving costs, etc.) in a brand new area that's more conducive to being a performer.

I have already signed up for GlassDoor (job finding app) and am searching for the bill payer job in areas like Fort Worth/Dallas, TX and Denver, CO to increase options for IT jobs.

IT work experience summary: no certs, about 2+ years of corporate/factory level Tier 2 support (official title at current job is Manufacturing Support Specialist, but it is essentially pc technician with a bit of experience all around from SharePoint admin to minor server/database support) I'm glossing over a good bit, but believe me I have enough to build a solid resume for at least tier 2 hardware support-type jobs, but my expectations are not high.

If I had to make highlight questions outside of general advice, they would be:

•what's the best way to reliably find a job out of state?
•how do I go about securing this job out of state while still working at my current job?
•people who have experienced this kind of move, what are general things to look out for/expect?

193,"This needs some backstory so please bear with me. I went to community college for two years and I ended up doing decent and I got into two 4 years: University of Minnesota Twin-Cities and Boston University. If I go to BU I'll be 50k in debt but if I go to U of M I will be in 22k (this is for 2 years combined including room and board btw). A few weeks ago I had talked about this with my grand-aunt (a professor who has given me a lot of advice over the years) and she insisted that I go to Boston because it would be a great learning experience. The first time we talked about this I convinced myself that I would go to BU. After talking to my sister however, I realized that it would be really risky as I would have to take out a parent plus loan; a loan that if I myself can't pay down the line my parents have to. My parents happen to not make much money despite how hard they work (25-30k combined) so I am not willing to take out a loan like that for 26k for a single year. Since then my decision was to ignore BU as a viable option, even though I wanted to go. However, last night at my sister's graduation party, my grand-aunt happened to be there and she asked what my final decision was. I told her that I would attend U of M and that BU was financially not viable. After telling her this, she once again insisted that I go and that ""I'll help you pay"". I replied saying that I'm not sure if I can accept an offer like that and I ended up getting dragged away by my sister to take pictures. 

So there it is I guess. I don't know what to do at this point. I talked to my mom about it and she said that I should go for it and that my aunt is pretty wealthy so ""that kind of money isn't a big deal for her"". I personally really don't feel comfortable asking for something that big but I also **really** wouldn't mind going to Boston.

201,"My ex wife and I have a daughter together. She abandoned us for another guy when my daughter was six months old. I have been raising her myself ever since. She is now 7. She moved to Arkansas a while back. About three years ago I get a call from social services asking about my ex and saying she recently had another kid but tested positive for drugs, and they were asking if I wanted to take care of the kid since my ex and I were still married. I told them no so the father could take care of the child. Soon after that call I got an attorney and filed for divorce. I have full custody If she wanted to take me back to court she would have to undergo a psychiatric exam because she is also bipolar to make sure she is fit to be a parent and I could ask her to show me drug tests before she see's our daughter. So our daughter is protected. 

Fast forward to last week my ex's mom texts me and said my ex was back in town and wanted to work something out to see our daughter. I decided to text her and let her know that our daughter has been asking about her and  I would be happy to sit and talk in person to see what we can do. 

Long story short I found out the drugs she was doing when I received the call was Meth. She also told me she was using and selling Meth. Her and her boyfriend moved back up here to get away from it and he is working a lot so he doesn't go back to it and she is pregnant with a 3rd child. I asked what happened to the other kid and she said it was adopted by the boyfriends mother. They say the mom does not like her or her boyfriend but the fact they were doing Meth makes it sound like she doesn't want anything to do with them because of their choices. I feel like I am not getting the whole story from them but it's non of my business. 

She told me she was clean and she is living with her mom and her mom told me she is out if she is ever caught doing anymore drugs. 

So question is I am worried about letting my daughter meet her real mom at this time. What I want to have her do is have her current baby, get her life together and really hope she doesn't have a relapse with the stress of having a new baby. My current girlfriend says I should ask for six months of weekly drug tests before I let her meet our daughter and  do supervises visitation first and down the road maybe unsupervised visits.

I am wondering is this an unreasonable request? If anyone has been in this situation how did you handle it? Or should I just say sorry because of your choices I don't feel having our daughter around you is good for her.

I would like for my daughter to know her real mom I just want her to be safe.

However I am in a position of feeling stuck and unable to move forward because I can't get employed. It's caused me to rethink the likelihood of graduate school, career opportunities, and general wellbeing. As a result, the last eight or nine months have been a period of depression like I haven't experienced before.

Like I said, I know what kind of work I want to be doing and what programs I'd like to pursue in grad school, but I just feel completely stuck and don't know what to do.

208,"A few years ago I was prescribed to my general doc citalopram and xanax for anxiety and depression. The xanax was there for flair ups until the citalopram fully kicked in. A few weeks later I was good and stopped the xanax with a few pills left. 

For the past few months my anxiety has gotten bad again. I'm still on citalopram 40 mg. I got a fidget cube and have been using the techniques I have to get me through attacks. All of that is barely helping. 

I'm going to the doc on Wednesday and I wanna ask him for xanax again cuz it helped me during flair ups and panic attacks. But I don't want to be labeled a druggie. I'm not after a high, just a bit of help so I can get through my day. 

This has also been effecting my job attendance so I'm in big trouble at work. 

Thanks.  ",12Jun2017,3
209,"I've tried having the conversation with them, but as you might imagine it's like arguing with a brick wall. They seem like ""true believers"" now, and they think that he's somehow actually reaching dead spirits to talk to them. I realize they're probably getting old, sad, and want to reminisce about old times, but I just am so sad and frustrated seeing them taken advantage of by what is essentially a con man fleecing them of their money.

214,"I’m reaching out because my close friend’s sister is currently going through what I think is severe depression and it is having a large impact on both of them. My friend’s name is Nicole and her sister’s name is Stacy (fake names). Nicole and Stacy are both 21 years old (twins) and they live on their own without many (if any) family connections, so any adversity faced is that much more challenging.
 


Over the last month or so Stacy has expressed feelings of loneliness and depression to Nicole. More recently these feelings have escalated to the point where Stacy has stated several times that she wishes she was not alive anymore. During the last week of May, it got to the point where Nicole was taking time off of work and dance classes to stay at home with Stacy. Nicole took Stacy in to a doctor, as well as to a counselor. Stacy has stated several times that she does not believe counselling will help her and that the only way she will go is if Nicole goes with her.
 
The challenge for Nicole is that she is becoming increasingly upset because she has to constantly be with her or attentive to Stacy. Nicole is someone that needs her alone time and I can tell that not being able to go to work, her dance classes and the gym is really making her feel awful. She feels like she’s falling behind in her life because she has to take care of her sister. She wants her sister to be able to help herself- to go to counselling on her own.
 
Normally, family members would be a great support for this, but they have no family in Calgary. Their dad is a recovering addict who lives in British Columbia at a treatment centre and they have no connection with their mother. They left behind most of their friends when they moved from Humboldt, SK, to Calgary.
 
From what I know, Stacy has recently graduated from ACAD. She was also in a 3 year relationship that ended about 6 months ago. Both Nicole and Stacy have faced many challenges in their life, with abusive (maybe not the right term) parents that struggled with drug addictions and split when they were young. I imagine this is why they both came to Calgary, to start a new life and abandon past troubles.
 
Most of this information I’ve been told by Nicole and I believe it all to be true. I’ve witnessed her leave work in tears because she had to go home to take care of Stacy. There’s so much more, they honestly have both faced more challenges in life than anyone I’ve ever known.
 
I just want to know what I can do to help both of them. How can I support them? What advice can I give? I rarely see or talk to Stacy but I talk to Nicole almost every day and this topic has come up every day for the last few weeks without fail. I want to see Stacy help herself and I want Nicole to be able to return to her routine without having to overly worry about Stacy. I miss the days when I used to talk to Nicole about the good things, and now these conversations really bring down my mood as well.
 
If there’s anything I can/should do, please tell me.

222,"I am currently faced with two somewhat major life decisions and I cannot decide which option I could go with. I change my mind on which one is better probably 4 or 5 times per day.

First some context. I live extremely far away from 95% of my friends and family. I recently lived in the same town as my brother and sister-in-law, but they have moved back to the lower 48 (I'm in Alaska) and so I am essentially here by myself with a few friends/casual acquaintances.

The fact that my brother has moved away is the first of two major factors that have brought me to where I am. The second factor is that my father's health has taken a slightly drastic turn for the worse and we are now just basically playing the waiting game. He isn't the type to give specifics, but I get the sense that he has 1-3 years maybe.

Furthermore, I really *really* dislike the town that I am in. It is very secluded and there is not much to do, especially during the 8 month long brutally cold winters. I also recently got out of a long relationship, one that I was not quite ready to be out of.

Here's the caveat. I have a pretty great job considering what my qualifications are (a degree in Humanities). I am making great contributions to my retirement and I am well on my way to being debt free in the next 1.5 years or so. I will add though that the work is very boring and not something that I am in the least bit passionate about.

So my options are:

1) Stay here. Keep working at my job to build my resume/pay off my debt/save for retirement. My job has a vesting period of 5 years. I will be 75% vested in November and 100% the following November 2018. If I leave now I will be leaving a healthy chunk of cash on the table.

2) Move back home, where I will be closer to family and friends, but also put myself back into the job market where I am not guaranteed anything close to as good of a job that I currently have.

Typing this out, it kinda seems apparent which option I should choose. I just have some major anxiety about giving up a perfectly good job, one that I feel is beyond what I deserve really, and risking getting something much crappier. ",12Jun2017,3

224,"In March, I left a job that I had invested a lot of time and effort into. I'm the kind of person that gets really attached, really loyal, and really pulled into a job. I left the pizza place though because emotions were high, and had been for a long while- and to me, it didn't seem that the boss was doing anything to alleviate the problem. He made a snide comment about my best friend/roommate, and I told him that night that I wouldn't be back.

Little background on the past 3 years that I've spent at the pizza shop. 2016 was Hell. End of 2015, my first car rusted beyond repair. Moved into my dad's car and started making payments to him- Finally paid it off in January 2016. Busy night delivering pizza, too much trust in my driving ability, approaching 11 hours on the clock with that night being my 6th day in a row- totalled my car. Then in March, I had another car accident. And pretty much, the whole year I had trouble keeping a vehicle and something terrible would happen every month. I missed out on a lot of work because of extenuating circumstances- pizza boss was understanding and helpful as I navigated a minefield of adulting that I'd never experienced before.

Pizza boss had a lot going on in his life too, so he wasn't making sure pizza employees were running pizza shop right. I got irritated, and things just continued going downhill. Then he made the comment (which, granted wasn't abhorrent. It just really pushed me over the edge. It wouldn't have taken much at this point) that irritated me.

Fast forward two weeks and I get a cool telemarketing job. My own office, smoke breaks whenever I want them, lunch guaranteed 30 minutes (pizza was 10 if I was lucky) and I could leave to go and get what I wanted for lunch. Telemarketing for a cemetery. Fast forward again, about three weeks. Now, they need me to move to another office and be a receptionist. I’m like, “Cool, I really wanna do this.” Been working here for a while, BARELY scraping by with bills.

Start up second job at my favorite clothing store. I’m thinking, “Cool, two jobs should be enough to help me have income to save!” Not the case. So pizza boss texts me cause he’s upset with an employee that he let get away with everything. I need more money. I go back to pizza. 3 jobs now.

3 jobs is hard. I want more money, but I can’t keep doing 3 part time jobs. Pizza offers me full time and the prime spot I used to hold before being a 9-5 receptionist. I wanna take it. Put in my two weeks today as a receptionist, they counter with full time. If pizza doesn’t offer me a raise, I’ll still make a little tiny bit more at pizza full time.

Pizza Pros: 1.) I know how to do everything. 2.) It’s a 5 minute drive from my house. 3.) Pizza delivery had me making somewhere around $20,000 a year. 4.) I’m pretty much next in line for management (this is relative. A manager is actively looking for other employment and the dude that would be considered for management is going to leave in a week with no notice) 5.) Pizza boss wants to open a new store that would have a bar- wants me to be in charge of that. 6.) Pizza shop only increasing in popularity.

Pizza Cons: 1.) I left cause the store was poorly managed. 2.) Very stressful. 3.) Currently not making enough money to consider leaving receptionist job.

Receptionist Pros: 1.) I could take this experience further in life. 2.) I would likely enjoy being a receptionist- if I were trained even a little bit. 3.) Easy work. 4.) Lots of freedom.

Receptionist Cons: 1.) UBER Conservative group of people. (I don’t fit in at all. They’re Christian, I’m currently Agnostic. They’re ultra conservative, I lean left from the middle.) 2.) I’ve received absolutely no formal training- anything I know how to do was taught to me on a “As Needed” basis. When I didn’t know things they expected me to, everyone jumped down my throat. 3.) Business seems shady- my hugely unprofessional yet intelligent guess is that these guys are going under soonish.  4.) 35 minute drive on scary highway to get to and from work every day.

TLDR; They both gonna pay about the same, at least until I talk to pizza boss. They both want an answer tomorrow. Help me decide.",12Jun2017,1
225,"We used to be good friends when we were really young, but once she found out we weren't actually related(I'm adopted) she stopped treating me like family or even a friend. I originally agreed to go to her wedding just because she invited me, but now I'm not so sure I should go. 

The exact same day I told her I would go to her wedding /she offered/ to do an important favor for me, but its been two months since then and she keeps on making excuses as to why she hasn't done it yet. It is not a hard task, all it involves is delivering some papers to me, but even when I made arrangements to come pick them up myself she made an excuse. This greatly annoys me. I did not ask her to do it, she offered and I accepted her offer. If she no longer wants to, or cannot, do it she should just say so instead of lying to me all of the time. 

About a month ago her mother asked my little sister if we would serve drinks during the wedding and she said yes since we aren't too social anyways, but I feel like that is something you either hire someone else to do or you just let every guest serve themselves. Weddings are supposed to be a celebration of two families joining, but I'm not going to be doing any celebrating if I'm stuck at the concession stand all night. I feel like I was only invited so I could serve drinks, and that she only offered to do me a favor so I would agree to do it. I don't know if she plans on holding her favor hostage until after the wedding or if she never really intended on doing it in the first place. I just don't see the point in doing her a favor when she won't do one for me, and I don't see the point in going to her wedding when it seems rather apparent that I'm going to be treated as an outcast.

229,"I've just been coming to this realization.

I've never been great with change. It took me 3 out of my 4 years at college to really accept it and enjoy myself. When I moved from my home to a city far away, it took me about 3 years to accept it as a positive and not something that is taking me away from the life I loved.

Now I'm in a serious relationship - going on for a few years now - and as what happens with many long-term couples around our age, the topic of our future and settling down has come in full swing. At first, I was worried my hesitation towards the subject was due to my relationship. Maybe I wasn't really in love with my SO. If I really did, I'd want to spend the rest of my life with her, right?

But now I know that it's my own fear of life passing that is making me see it this way. The thought of getting married and settling down is one step closer to the end. It's one step closer to seeing my parents grow old and it's all the more further away from the only life I felt secure with - the life I had at home, while growing up.

I know that this is part of life. I know it's a part of growing up - but I'm afraid of my resistance and how powerful it can sometimes be - and it's not just with the subject of marriage. It's with everything substantial - every milestone - getting further in my career, having kids someday, etc.... - I guess I just fear that I'll wake up one day and I'll be halfway through with everything. Growing up, and going through school, it was like I had a tight grip on the rope - where now I am floating. I know there's no stopping this. I know there are things about it that I should embrace and see the amazing sides of...but like my title says, this is subconsious. It's my natural defense.

I just want to be secure with the pace of my life. I want to look forward to the roads ahead. I want to be happy with every piece I use to build it - but instead, I keep trying to run back to a time and place that has already been permanently walled off. It's a waste of time, energy and emotion - and yet I fight like mf'er every time I can.

How do I erase this constant time-reminder and just live my days the way I did growing up? Sure, there is a whole lot more independence and responsibility on this side of life, but does that really require a constant doomsday clock looming?",12Jun2017,1

231,"Hi guys, thought this would be the best place to seek advice on this. I've noticed that my brother in law (wife's brother) seems to be getting a bit alt-right/red pilly. Occasionally in the things he says but more often just in the things he posts on social media. Overall i think he's a fairly nice chap and like to think that this is to some extent simply him having been brainwashed by the internet. I'd like some advice on how i should go about reaching out to him? As i know its a stereotype but i think a lot of it comes down to social isolation. He moved here from Poland when he was young and struggled with the language and as such i think he had trouble making friends, he's dropped out of university now and spends most of his time on the internet in his room. I think simply inviting him out for a drink etc may in itself do some good by reducing his isolation. What i'm wondering is what else i can do?

**Side note I was so out of it I was begging them not to take me to the hospital. That's why he was happy that I went.**

Once I was discharged from the hospital. I went back to school and I started to notice he would parole where I usually hang out. Whenever I see him he would stare and wave his hand at me. Or sometimes smile.

235,"I was applying online to be an uber driver the other day. A week later uber sent me an email saying they can't hire me because my drivers license is ""surrendered"". I checked out ny state DMV website and it says that you surrender your license when you die or something of that kind. In the meantime i still have to drive to get to work etc. and if I get pulled over, the police will definitely impound my car and they could arrest me depending on the local laws. By the way I have no traffic tickets that are pending or anything like that. 

 So I went to the local DMV to see what the hell. And the guy tells me he doesn't know how this happened and has me write a statement that I never willingly surrendered my license and he faxes that to Albany and in a few minutes he tells me it's all good. My license is valid again. 

 Something like this happened about 10 years ago when the DMV didn't update my status in their system and it seemed like I had a suspended drivers license and some police pulled me over, impounded my car in the middle of winter.

So last week he posted his car wreck on social media, I got worried, so I texted him if he was okay. He was, but our conversation was so dry. It's felt as if I was trying too hard to talk to him, because I was the only one asking the questions.

I am not sure if I should try texting him again or leave things as it is. I don't even know if he would be interested in having more conversations with me. Should I just walk away from this, or should I text him some other day?

A mom of a preteen daughter (12yo) from past relationship. Be in relationship with current boyfriend for 3-4 years. Go out one night, leave daughter alone with boyfriend. 
Boyfriend drinks and becomes drunk (not unusual - both mom and bf are, simply put, alcoholics and drink till they pass out)


This night though, the boyfriend goes into the daughters room at around 10-11pm, unannounced and butt-naked. Apparently he wanted to use her phone as an ""alarm clock"" (even though they have one, my old one I gave them).


For some closer friends I've mentioned this to, they claim it as sexual harassment/assault and even have concern of what has happened on past nights she's been left with him or what will happen in the future because he obviously can't control himself. Drunk or not, it's no excuse.


Anyway, the daughter is in counselling and this was brought up as it effected her much more than she had let on when she told me about it happening.

This isn't a simple fix. Without going into too many details there are so many things wrong with this application. One of which could bring down our whole site (which he's done twice in the past doing similar things!). I'm almost surprised it hasn't come down already. 

So, here goes the rest of my week to fix his work. I don't think it's entirely just laziness, I also think he's just not a good programmer. 

Additionally, there aren't strong standards here for good programming practices. That's what makes this a difficult question. Our manager doesn't have anything in place to ensure that these kinds of things don't happen, so I feel like it's not my position to be telling him that this is a huge issue (if that makes sense). Also, I think one other person here puts the same effort I do into my work, so I think it's almost standard to write bad code, but not this bad.

259,"My wife is 28 about to be 29 and when she was 13 ish she found a baby book with a different mans name on the book and not her dads. She confronted her mom and her mom said there was another guy but they did a paternity test and found it wasn't him and was her dad that raised her.

Fast forward to now, she was in a fender bender and was doing some research and court records and came across a court record of her moms that said child support the date she was born and ended when she was 18...
So she asked her grandparents if they knew anything and they just looked straight ahead and said no really awkwardly.

She confronted her mom again the other night and said to just tell her and she won't be mad since they have a great relationship and such.
She let it all out, her dad was not her real dad and the man on the book was. She told her that he refused to take care of her and never wanted involvement and signed over his rights right away. Then her current dad came in and married her mom.

She feels betrayed and feels lied to and does not know what to do. Anyone have any ideas or guidance on this?

260,"Okay, so a few days ago I (23M) received a friend request on Facebook from a girl I didn't recognize. We had one mutual friend, who I'll call Bob (18-20M), who is a coworker of mine. So I figured maybe we worked together (I don't know a lot of the teens that work at night/on weekends). Five minutes after I accepted, she's asking me to hang out with her. Over our next few conversations through Facebook I determined that she's 17, just graduated high school, doesn't work with me, and doesn't know me. However, she claims to work at the same place I do, that she's 22, and that we know each other. 
After I called her out, she blocked me. 
Now she's doing the same thing to my friend, Russell (22m) except she told him she's 21, that she doesn't know who I am, and when he told her pieces of info I told him, she said if he came to hang out with her she'd give him beer. 

Now, when I called her out, I warned her that what she was doing was kind of dangerous. Trying to get guys you don't know to hang out with you isn't a generally good idea. And now she's involving alcohol she shouldn't even legally have...

Obviously my friend needs to stop talking to her. But beyond that, what should we do? I don't want this girl to get into trouble - I've thought about trying to contact her parents, let them know her daughter is offering strange men alcohol, but maybe that's not the right direction?

263,"tw for childhood sexual abuse, sexual assault.

you can call me R and i'm a 20 year old male. when i was younger i was sexually abused by a friend and raped by an older boy. i've been in therapy for a really long time in hopes of getting over it but at the same point, i feel like i'm really never going to be over it.

last year, i dated someone who was a few years younger than and under 18, but above the legal age of consent. we had a semi sexual relationship, although i was very clear in that i did not want to make them uncomfortable and told them to tell me to stop if i was too much. after a few months into the relationship, they pulled away and disappeared on me. i mourned, i grieved. i moved on. i just assumed it was a bad breakup and that was that.

within the last few weeks, i've started hearing rumours that i am a sexual abuser. horrified by it, i approached the person who said they were hearing them. they said my ex has been telling people i sexually abused them, forced them to strip for me so i could get off, and on top that, was fourteen when this was happening.

they said they have ""proof"" that i had done something that horrible to this person but the only ""proof"" i can physically think of is the time i sent topless photos to them or we talked about sleeping together.

so i'm disgusted and horrified. i had a breakdown that nearly resulted in me going to the hospital for a suicide attempt because the idea that i could ever do something like that and hurt someone like i had been hurt - i cannot live with myself and i'm afraid that if i did actually do this, that i'm gonna to kill myself for it (my therapist is aware and has me checking in with her every other day). i was told they were 17 - they publicly and privately told everyone they were 17 and i was 19, so it wasn't a big deal the age difference.

i'm so scared that i hurt them though and i don't think i can live with myself. several of my friends are very clearly like ""r you couldn't do this to anyone it's not in your nature."" but i'm so scared i accidentally sexually assaulted them or made them uncomfortable.

It's not dying of hotness in the room my kitten is in but it does get rather hot. Hot enough for me to be uncomfortable but I don't have a lot of tolerance for heat. Should I leave my ac on when I'm at work? Can my kitten handle the heat? Also in general how can i keep my main room cold when it's always open to the side room which gets really hot?

280,"I need help. I am desperate. I have been working at the same place for the past 2 years. It's my first full time job. I can no longer make it through the day without bursting into tears.

When I first started I really liked my job. It's in a ""female-heavy"" industry and I liked having so many role models. I liked my job. even the work itself. It paid well. I thought I hit the jackpot.

BUT things changed. or maybe they didn't but it still got worse. It's a very fast-paced environment. but things still need to be done accurately. and I struggled with that for... awhile.

Before I started there were 3 people in my position. The workload was such that they thought it merited a fourth person. but then just as I came on one guy quit and so then instead of bringing the amount of work per person down I was suddenly a replacement for a guy who had been fully trained and quite experienced (which, being fresh out of college, I obviously was not). They told me they'd be hiring a replacement soon, which they did. but then they put her next to my cubicle and had me unofficially training her (which takes months) when I wasn't even fully trained myself. and then she quit and I had to start over again with a new guy. and I started to get behind. from all of it. and obviously from my own mistakes. the ones I made because I was new to the position. the ones I made because I was fresh out of college. and the ones I made on top of all those.

so I started to tell my boss. and looking back, I think I fucked up here. bc I would say ""I'm behind."" and she would say ""Do you need more training?"" and I would say ""no... I think I know how to do everything (bc at that point I did). I'm just not able to get everything done."" and a lot of times the conversation would just end there. or she would tell me that I'm actually doing such a great job and I get so many compliments from customers and I'm being too hard on myself.

but. then what I saw coming from a mile away... came. my backlog started to bite me in the ass. customers were disgruntled. my boss would continue to tell me I was being to hard on myself but then as soon as a customer CC'ed her she would ask me why I hadn't done something. Didn't I know XYZ needed to be done as soon as we received the request? Yes, I knew. but so did ABC and DEF and GHI. and by the time I got all those done the day was over. I didn't say that though.

Things went downhill slowly for quite a time. but now... everything has been devolving rapidly for the past few months. I cry daily. I'm so frustrated. and I feel like I'm being spun to hit a pinata because every time I open my eyes my outlook is different. sometimes I think things may be getting better. and that I can fix everything and stay. which for some reason I still want to, which may be a very misguided thing to want. but then when I get hit in the face with the next blow it just makes it all even worse.

and I don't know where to go from here. I try to start every day with a positive outlook. but when the first thing goes wrong I'm crushed. my boss has a habit of sending corrective emails when she begins her day (about an hour before I begin mine) so at least once a week when I come in there will be a new email sitting there about something I did wrong. 

It's made me into a person I don't want to be. I don't act well anymore. I'm so angry and frustrated. and then I get disappointed in myself for acting that way. I know I need to leave but I have no idea where to go or what I want to do. my self esteem is destroyed. I feel like my current place of employment doesn't want me any more. my chance at references are shot. my industry is specialized so jumping to a new one will be even more of a challenge.

281,"Hello everyone, and thankyou in advance for any and all helpful advice. I have hit a wall recently and could use some direction. I figure I should start at the beginning, and be warned, this is probably going to be quite long, I'll try to keep things concise.

I'm 36/m in Florida, north of Tampa. I've made the mistake of falling in love with cooking, and have been an aspiring chef for most of my career, so that means I (used to) work unbelievably long hours at an insane pace, in a hot and dangerous hellhole, with no breaks,nothing for pay, and no health bennies whatsoever.

That being said, I have never really had any health insurance, and when ObamaCare first rolled out, I finally signed up for the first time in my life, and was baffled at how little it actually covered. it was of no use at all, and so after many attempts to utilize it's supposed coverage, I just stopped paying the premiums. I haven't had any coverage since then about 3 years ago. Stupid, yes I know. I just hate going to the Doctors... ALOT.

The trouble now is that my health has pretty much become crippling, and I don't think I'll be able to work anymore. I feel I need to apply for Disability, but don't even know how to go about beginning the process.

My medical background is scary, and I hate dealing with it, but I can't deny this any longer, I am simply unable to function anymore as a decent worker.

When I was 16, back in 1997, I was diagnosed with severe Scoliosis, and so had a total spinal Fusion, with 3 Harrington rods, and only have a few vertebra that can still move. I have since never seen anyone concerning my back, and that was 20 years ago, now the pain is becoming unbearable.

This was a major surgery and it has affected me much more than I care to admit. Since then I have had 4 hernia operations, and have been recently diagnosed with [Chiari Malformation](http://csfinfo.org/education/patient-information/chiari-malformation/?gclid=CjwKEAjw9_jJBRCXycSarr3csWcSJABthk0722WfKWNTEpxd9qOGRn_J_1o6QtOHmpw2EjAdPZPJaRoCfrvw_wcB) of the brain. I have a constant headache and my arms begin to really hurt and go super-numb when i try to sleep, and this coupled with my already hurting back are almost completely preventing any decent rest. I feel like a Zombie, I'm stiff and sore all the time, I can barley move on days with any sort of inclimate weather, and it shows. Despite all the glaring warning signs, I really had no other choice but to continue to plow on. We had bills to pay and other problems that needed attention (always). Regardless, I try to work trough it, as I always have, as we must, but it was getting more obvious all the time. I was having trouble holding down a steady job due to frequently missing work or just not being on my A-Game when I was there. it's hard for any employer to tolerate that shit for long.

At the beginning of the year, I landed a gig as head chef of a new restaurant. I working through the agony and putting in a grueling 60+ hours a week. Most days I was intolerable to work with, just grumpy beyond the point of being a dick-in-asshole. 

The restaurant was a refurbished janky old Florida home, and outback there was a small set of concrete stairs that led up into the kitchen from the back dock. about 3 months ago, during one of our busiest weekends ever, I slipped on those steps and damn near broke my knee. It's still swollen and popping and clicking with every step I take. Now im out of work for real, and getting jerked around by workman's comp to the fullest. After 3 months, I finally got a CT scan of my knee and the radiologist apparently writes the analysis of the scan. The prognosis is just arthritis, and moderate water retention (its swollen). So the Doc just prescribes Physical Therapy. not only do I not see how I am supposed to perform such PT, but the Claims Adjuster never sent over the approval for the treatment anyway, and so I showed up there for an appointment that was never approved, ergo I was sent home. I do have a lawyer for this particular WCC, but they don't seem to be interested in helping much, and the receptionist won't even let me talk to the Lawyer until after my next appointment, next week. 

Meanwhile, I am PENNYLESS and screwed, really up shit creek here with no paddle. The money dried up long ago, and I've been eating mostly ramen and peanutbutter for far too long now. I fear this my be the last month I am able to scrape up rent money, now seriously dreading becoming homeless soon.

I have no real family ties, and no real friends. Just me and the dogs. I can't hardly focus anymore. Can't stand for long, can't sit either, or sleep. The depression is crushing.. I don't know what to do anymore. Please help. 
Thankyou all for your kindness and understanding.

One of the new board members had been insanely nice to me in terms of finding opportunities to get to know me which I greatly appreciated, she is also younger than me by a lot but I didn't mind. Because of that I started being more casual with her instead of just treating her as an acquaintance.
How ever things came to a hault one day when she asked who I think will be elected as our next club president and I didn't say her name. I explained that she was still young and didn't have enough experience (she was a freshman with minimum professional skills or experience and previous members have told me she wouldn't take in other people's advice. On top of that she told me she wanted to be a leader because she liked power over others which I didn't agree with). But I did tell her she still had time to improve and I wasn't the one to make the final call.
From then on although she continued to ask me to hang out, I could feel that she just wanted me to drive her to places since she didn't have a car (to return things and eat at her favorite dessert place) and started speaking in a really condescending and passive aggressive tone. I'm almost three years older than her but she continuously calls me immature and clumsy(because I thought of her as a friend) and that she couldn't imagine a guy liking me bc of that.

287,"Background:

I'm turning 20 this year and I have everything set up to move into an apartment with two of my best friends (my boyfriend, and our mutual friend) but my parents disapprove 

I love my parents. They're both in their 50's. 
My mom is an angel. My dad is doing his best. He's still an abusive asshole that made my life miserable. They're both christian. I was raised super strictly.

I still want their approval.

I've been researching places and prices and everything for 8 months and we decided on a place last weekend. Today I told my mom and she cried a bit. I've been with my boyfriend almost 2 years. We go to counseling, we basically lived together during our first year of college, and we have talked about as many possibilities as we could think of. We have plan A-F. Us living together is going to be great. No issue with us and our friend at all.

My dad feels I don't spend enough time with my family. I don't spend much. I don't enjoy extended periods of time with my dad so we only spend short amounts. 

I know for a fact he's going to be disappointed and angry. He won't like me living with my boyfriend, moving out completely, growing up, etc. 

Should I tell him before I sign the lease (in the next few weeks) or after it's said and done but still before the next school year starts? 

What can I do to make this better? 

I suggested spending time as a family once a month to my mom. 

I don't know how to break this to my dad.

My mom said she'd accept it but not like it. That's all I could ask for.

I've been independent and very stable since I was 16. There is very little question as to whether I can handle living in this situation. It's a matter of breaking the news to my dad.

Any advice would help. I don't know anyone in this situation. Either their parents disagree because they actually aren't ready or their parents support and the person is not ready or a number of other things but not this.
