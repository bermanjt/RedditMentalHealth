2,"**TL;DR: Self perspective killing my ability to be happy with myself and others. Always alone and have been trying to be normal for years. What can I do?**

I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I'm 21, male in Western Canada. I have a degree and a pretty great full time job (In terms of pay but low in personal satisfaction and future potential), I take care of myself, completely independant (Solo renting/own a vehicle) and have no family or friends (Besides distant facebook friends) here at all. I have moved from one small town to the next about every two years. 

I am generally caring and I have a lot of interests (Especially outdoors/geography). However I can hardly meet people due to time/availability and means to do so. As well, if I do meet people, I can never form a connection because A. I am very weird. B. I am overloaded with shame and self hatred and no self confidence or respect.

I have been battling my inner treatment of myself for nearly a decade now and I'm SO much better than before (I used to have no job or school and was a self harming suicidal borderline alcoholic) but I'm still very unsatisfied with myself every day. I think I am the worst in almost every way possible and often have periods of time that last hours but feel like days where I am paralyzed by self hatred and the world feels like it's ending.

I have jumped through 3-4 therapists over the years trying to find a solution. They were helpful but too expensive and too infrequent and I could never fully get rid of my disease of my inner dialogue and world view.

Today I went to the doctor for the first time in years. I really liked him but he pretty much told me that I'm a fine healthy guy and I just need to get out and socialize. And it's not like he didn't listen to me, he was a good investigative doctor but that was his conclusion.

But I can't socialize when I feel the way I do about myself and I'm so fucking weird. I think I may be destined to be a lonely hermit my whole life. I don't know if I'll ever know a loving connection with others or myself.

I don't know what to do, any advice would be appreciated. Already I want to pack up and move somewhere else far away where no one knows me at all and I don't need to be worried all the time.

The ideal friend to me is someone who loves to go outside like camping/fishing etc and is curious about world geography/history etc. I live in nowhere and I've tried meetups, online dating, local volunteering and more to meet people.

Any advice is greatly appreciated thanks!",23Aug2017,1
4,"Hey all, 
Let me preface this by saying I am struggling with a little bit of social anxiety in this new area.

My wife and I got married last June and relocated for two wonderful jobs, since then we haven't really had a whole lot of success making a lot of couple friends our own age. We are very young to be married (22 turning 23 tomorrow) so most people our age are single and most married people we know have kids which kind of makes things difficult schedule wise. 

Nothing against our single friends but we really want to have couple friends that we both enjoy together. We finally found a couple we really like and went to a group dinner with them and some other guests recently. We all really hit it off. They initiated the invite on that one. Now we were just chatting with them about our favorite past times and we mentioned board games- turns out they love board games. They suggested we should get together for a game night soon. 

We would love to take the initiative this time and invite them over for a board game night. The only problem is our apartment is tiny (700 sq ft). All we have is one couch- its pretty big and a nice glass table in front of it with a mounted flatscreen TV. That is our main living area. This is the perfect thing to do together because dinner isn't required and we don't even have a kitchen table. My wife and I are super lowkey and we don't have a lot of stuff so there's no extra chairs or anything lying around. Given our situation, do you think it is possible for us to host this game night if it's just us and one other couple or is our space simply too small and we should find another way? If so, any suggestions? 

I desire to be hospitable and actually take initiative this time because we've let so many opportunities like this slip us by and we are quite frankly missing friendship at this point. ",23Aug2017,1

     I don't know if soulmates are real or if I should believe in them but I definitely think he's mine for sure if it is real. My relationship two years ago was somewhat like this one but it wasn't ass terrifyingly deep. I see this guy I'm with currently all the time I've known him for two years as a friend and we got together five months ago. I told him we should just be in the ""talking stage"" for now (we still are by my wish of course) because I don't want to rush it but I think I did without realizing it? I've seen him eat, sleep, laugh, cry, yell, smile. I've seen all his weird habits. I know about the relationships between him and his family even distant family. I've even met all of them. I've seen him use the bathroom. I've even seen him naked mentally and physically. I know his passwords for everything without asking. We definitely claim each other as together. It just seems crazy to me or too good to be true. I don't know if it's just knowing both of our parents met at the age we are now and neither of those relationships worked out or if I'm just scared to be completely vulnerable. I don't want this to end and there's definitely no sign of it ending anytime soon so I just need to know what's up with me from a different point of view? Thanks.

**TL;DR; : I don't know if soulmates are real but I think he's mine if they are. I know everything about him. I've seen him naked physically and mentally.

14,"I've worked hard. From essentially nothing as a teenager up to now with some good fortune and running into a lump sum of money. But for a while I lost inspiration to try, to succeed. After college at my first job. It wasn't necessarily that I hated the job so much as I never truly gave it a real chance. And half a year ago I applied myself (well Adderall helped). But even into the late hours I work, after the drug has surely worn off from the morning pill. I work my ass off trying to do better at all aspects of not just my job but the business I'm in (trying to be confidential). Socializing could be better at times, admittedly, but again...I'm working so hard I lose track at times...and I want to prove myself through my work.

My middle management boss has never liked me since I started, at least that's what I had thought. She was never capable of mentoring me in the early stages and getting me somewhat honed on the skills it takes to be successful, never pointed me in the right area or had the right thing to say. The kinda person that walks you in circles when they don't know the answer to a question only to leave you more confused than prior to the question because you're pretty sure they never answered it...but they've got a satisfied look on their face anyways. 

I say middle management because she is very concerned with office politics, and takes a furious exception to any conduct that could somehow damage her reputation, especially as a senior, ""authoritative""  figure. So as someone who appreciates humor, I've had to dull myself nearly to an inch of being able to smile in order to be extra cautious not to upset her.

After someone left the company who would rant to me and I to them, I began to have more time not ranting. And while I still did with another coworker with the same feelings, I held it in, and struggled to be better. To learn the job and skills that will make me better at it. That was 6 months ago, and my reputation is coming around...but I wish it never left, nor should it have. I've always wanted to learn, but I never had enough time with someone who could show me a few basics, an expectation at an entry level position that does not pay that well.

I've done a lot to help my team and no one at the company has pulled nearly as many hours as I, not that it matters to me. What matters is a safe working environment, not feeling mentally blocked all day because your boss refuses to trust you. And as I've learned recently, a complaint of a coworker I shared with her boss, because he pressed me for it, she has taken an extreme exception for. Now I'm not someone who likes office gossip, it makes me cringe, and in the times I disclose my feelings it has to be private. 

So when I'm pressed to talk about something, I don't snitch. This scenario was different to me, I felt telling the truth would lead to some reconciliation that everyone could be happy with. So my truth, or my ""stretched truth"" as she calls it, became her resentment, her mistrust and most definitely hate. And while she has painted the picture more clearly for me lately I have felt it there since the beginning. Which still came as a surprise when she told me she didnt want me since the interview but she wasn't my boss at that time. 

My mentor has told me to leave, but I still feel stuck. Because if I'm not working there, where would I go? What if I struggled at the next place, and had no one to help me? What if my situation here somehow *wasn't* that bad. After all I've been here 28 months (saying it like that makes it feel longer). What if the best thing for my career and my resume is to stay here and accomplish the opportunities I've been given?

Those are the combating thoughts, and yes it is a real opportunity. An opportunity my peers have complimented my work ethic for thus far...and while sometimes it feels good, I never feel satisfied. I feel like I'm being monitored, so I've been so focused on my wrong doings I haven't been able to appreciate what I've done right. But I still feel unsatisfied because I feel stuck, that my accomplishments won't gain the trust of my boss. And that thinking makes me lose inspiration to try which makes me feel empty...because I want to try. She just saps me.

She sucks away my momentum, she critiques first before attempting to find some piece of advice. Which as you should know if you've read this book is usually a word circle that leads back to nothing. Or as I've come to notice, is wrong...or at the very least questionable...but I've learned not to challenge either. But as someone who would prefer to learn when they're wrong, if I can't challenge something I think I know than what will I have learned. And if you can't explain what you've challenged, than how can you feel empowered by a baseless argument?

But she strives for the sense of empowerment, while I strive to be apart of something that matters, to collaborate, to laugh, to do better. And I can't tell if I am what she hates me to be, or if I'm the opposite version I think I could be if I were in a healthy environment. But I haven't let that discourage me from doing a good job in my unhealthy environment. It may be mentally taxing, but if I deliver on my opportunities the job experience might be beneficial for my growth. 

Which is my last standing excuse, and to support the excuse further they are true opportunities, which I have done a lot of work for so far. 

I don't know what to do about my feelings I go through on a pretty regular basis at work so I'm having a difficult time sorting the feels out. I usually am capable of telling them to subside and focus on the objective; not focused on everything trying to distract you (my boss).

20,"I didn't get the job. 

Had a job interview at 8;30am this morning and I worked at 9:30am. Already felt a bit pressured by the time presence but I can easily brush it off as the job location is close to my home and an hour is plenty of time.

I get there at 8:30am and the lady who is grading me based on the questions I answered was running about 20 minutes late, so sitting here for about 20 minutes and she finally shows up. Something about her dog or being stuck in traffic in a ""small ass town"". With about 65000 people living in it. Yeah bullshit.  (which was the other two ladies said, who are just there to ask the 11 questions as well) but the lady who was late is the important one. And all they did was apologize about being late, I almost wanted a reschedule but they needed to pick a Candidate by today. 

I felt pressured  and rush by having to work in the 30-40 minutes ( cause I'm on my last legs with the current job) which meant I had to run home get ready and drive all the way there. So which means due to their negligence, my interview on my part went super shitty.


What the fuck do I do? Any compensation I can get or just another fat apology from them. Or another interview with different questions? Super unprofessional. 

EDIT: I'm still gonna let them know of what went wrong and for next time they will know better but not to be late when time is on the clock. Also the other two ladies really wanted to start interviewing me right away but they weren't allowed. Oddly enough one of them was the one who made calls, the schedule and almost sounded like she made the hiring calls as well. she sounds pretty qualified to interview people. This is a city job and I was trying for a weight room specialist. 
EDIT: okay entitlement to compensation is obviously non-existent.  I guess typing out of frustration got the best of me. And for this job being a city job where the city pays me, that was  god damn awful behaviour they displayed.

37,"Long, sorry. I needed to vent as badly as I need advice.

I am a professional pet groomer. I have been at my current place of employment for just under 7 years. It is a small privately owned business with less than 1 0 employees located in the state of Georgia. I am considered a ""production employee"", which means that I get paid only for how many dogs I groom, not by the hour or salary.

Until recently (today), my employer did not have job description for ""pet groomer"". I was hired to groom pets, and that's what I do. I arrive shortly before the clinic opens, chat up clients, bathe and groom the critters, keep my records, clean my equipment and my area, and go home. While not standard across all pet care facilities, this is standard procedure in the vet grooming industry, and how things have worked at this clinic for 7 years.

The new owners (of about 2 yrs) of the clinic are now requiring me to come in 30 minutes before the clinic opens and stay till the last pet is picked up, even if this is hours after I have finished my work. Since I will have nothing to do while I'm waiting, they expect me to assist other (hourly) employees in doing their jobs. I will not be compensated for this time; they say it's ""part of being a good team member"". 

They are asking me to do much more computer and paper work than I do now which will add at least an hour to my day, and do client call-backs adding yet another hour or so of unpaid time everyday. 

More importantly, all that eats into the time that I have available to do any actual grooming. The clinic is only open for 8 hours per day, if I spend three hours a day doing not-grooming, then both the clinic and I bring in less money.

I don't know whether it's even relevant or not that I have neither a dedicated terminal nor phone for my use, or even in my area, and am frequently told that there is ""more important stuff that needs to be done on this terminal right now, you need to come back later"". I spent 20 minutes today with my teeth in my mouth waiting for an available terminal.

I do not get compensated for any overtime or time worked doing not-grooming related work (ex: cleaning up after boarding pets, waiting on clients), and until today have never had a way to clock in or officially record my time.

I recently asked about the possibility of adding a second groomer or an assistant to enable me to properly groom more pets per day, and was told by the administration (read: owner's wife) that I would have to hire and pay my own assistant, because the clinic ""couldn't afford it"".

There's a lot more.

I'm so overwhelmed that I'm not even sure what my question is. Can they require me to be there 10 hours a day when I'm only actually working for 5 or 6? Can they require me to do not-grooming (unpaid) work? Can they make me pay for my own assistant? I'm pretty sure it's illegal to ask me to do that, not to mention that it's just stupid to have someone working around animals with no workers comp. 

I've spent 7 years building the grooming business for this place. The groomer before me (who is, incidentally, the new owner's wife, tbe clinic administrator, and the source of most of my concerns) grossed an average of $15,000/yr. Last year I grossed just over $50k for them. I don't suck at my job. 

More importantly, I love my clientele. I've raised half of my clients from puppies and love them as my own. I don't want to leave them, but the situation has been going steadily downhill since the new owners took over. 

Is this even worth fighting for? Or should I just cut my losses and run?

Or am I the one being uncooperative?  Should I just suck it up and drive on?

I honestly don't know if I need legal advice, life advice, or just a swift kick in the ass.

38,"-One of my earliest vivid memories:: 

When she drove me to a barber shop and asked the employee to cut my hair in a short bowl shape with shaved sides and back. One that I detested. One that little me  thought was a “boy” haircut. To a girl who only wore pink dresses, this was devastating. I hated my reflection. I was embarrassed when others looked at me. I felt violated. I never felt pretty. She said my long hair would take too long to do. I guess my self-esteem was not worth her time.

-later memories::

The way she shamed me when I wanted to wear certain clothes. She said I was too fat to wear certain types of clothes. I “looked vulgar”. I didn't “have the shape” to pull it off. I was “too fat”. I was 8. 

A few years later when she told all our relatives I was very fat, so that when they saw me I “would be thinner that they expected”. I was 12.

The way she told me I looked good after I had starved myself for multiple days.

The many times she scolded me for things I didn’t do. 

The many times she physically abused, threw around a little girl, with little reason. Taking your anger out on me in the name of discipline.

The way she only told bad things about me to other people. Constantly putting me down. Making me feel little.

The way she have never taken my side in any argument. Even when she could blatantly see I was correct. It was always me fault. She would never fight for me.

When I didn’t want to do something. She never asked why. She just called me lazy. She yelled at me. You disparaged me. She didn’t want to hear me. When someone keeps repeating something over, you start to believe it. I believed I was lazy. That I had no resilience, no character. I had no ambition, no motivation, no ability to strive. I believed I had nothing of value inside. I was not until I went to college that I realized just how self driven I was.  ",23Aug2017,5

Some background to my story. I live in a very affluent high class family in the Caribbean, I am 21 years old and live with my parents while waiting to move in January to Spain to get my Master's Degree.
So this is what's been going on in my family. My brother [28] has anger management issues, weed addiction and maturity issues, he still lives at my parents house with me [21] and my parents, however, he does nothing more than have rage breakouts for ANY reason and he always makes the house tense even when he's not fighting, which always leads my mom and dad to a depression. The main problem here is the fact that there has always been a cycle that my mom allows to happen. It's like this:
1) My brother rages, emotionally hurts and insults everybody in this house. 2) My dad makes all the right decisions and my brother gets kicked out of the house. 3) My brother says he doesn't need anybody at all and he can do on his own, even though he doesn't even have a job. 4) 1-2 days later he texts my mom that he is ashamed of what he did. (Obviously manipulating her because now he doesn't have all the luxuries we have at home). 4) My mom gets depressed and jeopardizes everything and practically makes my dad yield. 5) He comes back without any change.
Rinse and repeat.
Every time this things happen my mom and dad get worse and worse emotionally, to the point that my dad almost died a few weeks ago from the pressure. And everything because my mom keeps enabling my brother to do as he pleases under the pretext that ""she is a mom"".
To put an example of how she acts EVERY time my dad takes everything from my brother because he doesn't appreciate anything. He recently got into a a rehab institution in another country for anger management issues and problems of the sort, which obviously was not going to be a happy, comfortable place. Here's what happened then: On the first day, my brother asked for water and the person in charge told him that everybody drank water out of the tap there because its filtered, to which my brother replied ""Yeah? I don't drink tap water, get me bottled water"" to which they didn't comply (obviously) so he got out of the institution and rented a hotel with my mom's credit card and told her that he wasn't going back there because it was a prison, and asked my mom to get him out of that country to which she obviously said ""okay"" with no hesitation, also while getting him some shoes as a gift in the process.
We have tried talking to her about the problem with her but nobody can ever talk to her because if we try she breaks down crying and doesn't listen to anybody and then denies any implications in my brother's behavior. My mom also has an noticeable preference for him and always puts whats best for him over what's best for everybody else. To put that into perspective, my dad, my sister and I could be dying, but if my brother is happy, she is happy.
I also have an older sister (31) who moved away a very long time ago and wants to have nothing to do with the whole situation because she says there is no way to fix it and she has a family of her own now, which I totally understand and wish I could do the same for myself, but I live here and in my country it isn't so easy to simply move out.
This is taking an emotional toll on me and I really need advice on what I could do to save what's left of my sanity before I collapse.",23Aug2017,1
42,"Hello Reddit Advice,

I'm a 23 year old dude and like many of my ilk I'm incredibly lost as to what I'm going to do for a career (or job). I'm in between contract and seasonal work and now in my lull period I'm back to my existential crisis of what can I do that will both support me and I wont hate with my entire being. 

Some background on me....

- Graduated from University in Media Studies (yeah i know dumb degree) with a specialization in journalism. Somewhere along the line I lost the passion for it while simultaneously realizing it's dying field.

- During school I worked as a summer camp counsellor for four years

- I worked for a non profit in an admin, member service role

-  I currently work as a hype team member for a pro sports team.. (wont say which)

- I currently work casually for a local brewery as a brand ambassador


My problem is I can't seem to find anything full time or stable. I have concluded I may need to go back to school for a post grad but I haven't the slightest clue as to what for. What I have gathered from my experience is I like working with people, kids are cool, and I love live entertainment.

I would love to hear some input and advice for this lost soul looking to find my niche in this world. All opinions and experiences welcomed!",23Aug2017,2
43,"I met my GF a year and a half ago through her BF at the time and we hit it off her and their daughter (just turned 2 at the time) left him after 5 years of being in an abusive relationship with him. Our problems started Feb. 13 2017 when she asked me if she could go to his parents house to visit because she missed them. Little did I know he was there waiting for her and their kid to show up and she took off to a different town without even letting me know all the while their kid was sitting at his parents house. Well once I figured out what was going on which was about 3 hours after I dropped her off at their house I went home and packed her stuff, not without talking to her first I asked her to come back so I could pick her up and was freaking out thinking she had left me because there would be sizable gaps in texting so in the middle of packing her things she calls and says she needs me to come pick her up so with all of her things packed in the car I went and picked her up. She spent a little over 6 hours with him and I have no clue what all they done well we had it out that night never followed through with kicking her to the curb. Fast forward about a month later we start arguing more because she talks to him like they are besties but at the same time talking shit on him to me so I put my foot down only text him about their kid and that's it. Might sound unfair to some of you or might make me sound like a dick but I wasn't trying to be so she stops talking to him so much or so I thought, she just deletes messages from him. A week or so goes by and I get switched to morning shift from overnight shift so now she is bored at home in the morning until I get home. She starts going over to her friends house who just so happens to live right down the road from her baby daddy and she stops texting as much. We'll come to find out she has been going to her friends and then walking down to his house and they run off to where ever she wants to go that day. The only reason I know this is because one day her mom calls me asking if me and her are ok and I told her yes and asked why, she says well I heard you two got into a wreck a couple towns over. I hang up and call my GF and she tells me that her and her baby daddy got into a wreck so I leave work to go make sure she is ok and I'm furious for one I thought she was at her friends she could've died and I would've been in the dark about everything. That's when she tells me she has been running off with him for a while so we get into another fight and everything is alright again for a while. Well a few weeks later we get into another fight because I found out she had told him where we lived and he came over and watched movies with her in our room sitting in our bed so I asked her if she is cheating on me she says no of course and said all she did was kiss him on the cheek. To me that is cheating I don't care what anyone says its cheating to me. Anyways this fight was a bad one one minute we are just yelling at each other and next thing you know she punches me in the nose and tries to put me in a head lock. Me being who I am didn't pay a hand on her except to get her off of me there was a bed behind her so I put both my hands on her shoulders and pushed her into the bed and started walking backwards to move further away. Well that pissed her off more so she bounces up off that bed swinging like Mike Tyson. I've been in a few fights I'm not a pro by any means but I dodged a few hits and took a few to the face and upper body. She got me good in the ear a couple times and I couldn't hear out of my ear and I started getting dizzy so I start stumbling towards the door knowing if I take anymore hits I would be down for the count. Making my way to the door she keeps clocking me in the back of the head and I'm just strolling out the door like nothing is going on and run off to my best friends house with none of my things except the clothes on my back. I stay there 2 days and I go back to her like an idiot after we talked things out, same old shit was said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to it'll never happen again"" so I believe her. Not even 2 weeks go by and we get into another argument. This one started out of nowhere most of our arguments build up and I see them coming but this one was weird. It was 10am and we just got done having sex she rolled over and I tickled her and she turned to me and jokingly said ""stop or I'll punch you in the face"" so I laugh and said ""fuck you"" and she snapped. Rolled over on top of me and grabbed 2 handfuls of hair and starts hitting my head off the wall now my head is decently durable so I just kinda lay there cause what else can I do I will never lay my hand on a woman. So she lets go and I sit up and try to stand and she starts in with the punches to the back of the head and then grabs my hair again and pulls me down and starts punching me anywhere she can. She goes for a headlock again and I get my foot between our chests and push her off so I can escape, well that just fuels her fire so she starts swinging like a windmill and comes back at me and I push her off again. She rolls off into the floor and jumps back up and I'm halfway to the door by that time and the punches to the Head start in again. So I'm taking haymakers to the back of the skull and walking out of the house and she stops once I get outside. So I just kinda stand on the porch for about an hour while she tosses my shit in the yard I collect it all and run back to my friends house and I don't even stay there a full day and I'm back with her again. That all happened last week on Tuesday and I'm scared shitless honestly anytime she slams a door I flinch I'm scared she is going to hit me but I know I'll go back if she does I love her to death I really do and I can't bring myself to leave her for good I always go back. I just don't know what to do anymore I'm not happy but I want to be with her.",23Aug2017,1
44,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Note: I'm already seeing a therapist and, though I haven't been able to bring up this particular topic yet I will. Still, more advice won't hurt; but don't worry, a professional is taking care of this :) Also, where I live university is free and the rest of my financial costs are covered by my family, so that's not a problem right now.

I'd like to ask for your advice on how to deal (psychologically) with being, at 25, 5~7 years older than most of my classmates and not likely to graduate till at least my 30s -- it happened because of very severe anxiety and (not as severe) depression that I'm still trying to recover from and that make going to uni very difficult (so that gap may widen).  Attendance is not required, but exams refer to many things that are said only in class (they are not recorded). I've already failed these classes because of that. I also changed fields about a year or two ago and had passed some classes from the previous one when I was doing a bit better.

Before my health issues started when I was 12, I had always had an easy time academically and socially, and even with them my grades didn't suffer that much (though my social life pretty much shrivelled up and died). As a child I was constantly praised by family for being smart and all those things family loves to say. And now, I honestly feel like a failure. I constantly try to get better but it's an uphill battle; periodically I get basically thrown back to square one and it's very discouraging. I think you can see how being surrounded with all these people who don't (seem to) have that particular problem can remind one of one's ""failures"".

I'm already doing all I can to slowly bring my health issues under control, but what do you think may help me with _this particular_ aspect of my life?

Thanks a lot again!",23Aug2017,1
45,"I wasn't sure where else to post this. This boy asked me out three times within March and I rejected him each time(nicely)... had barely any contact until May, where we hung out with mutual friends twice. I hadn't talked to him at all in the summer until the last week of June, when he texts me and says, ""I know how I'm going to do it. I know how I'm going to kill myself.""

Since then, he's been putting everything on me... asking me why he's so undesirable/worthless/ugly/, etc. I'm the only one who knows, and I genuinely do not like him as a person. He's really condescending towards almost everyone we go to school with, and most of the stuff he says belongs on r/iamverysmart.. Yesterday, he told me he was disappointed in me for having ""such a bad memory,"" because he has.. I quote.. ""a photographic memory even though there's no case of that in history."" Ironically, we are on an academic team based off points for asking questions on a central theme, and I've beaten him by hundreds of points every time, but that's.. besides the point.

Anyway: I've been depressed for about 5 years and only the past 4 months have been actually happy or me. Dealing with this every day has been extremely stressful and I constantly tell him to get real help, which he just ignores and continues to ask ME why his life is so terrible. I don't know what else to tell him, nor do I want to do this anymore, but I feel if I ignore him, and he commits, it would be my fault. I don't know where to continue.",23Aug2017,4

48,"This is a follow up to a previous post I made on this subreddit a couple of months ago.  

So whenever I do my chores like my parents tell me to, like dishes laundry etc., And I do them, but when they get home they say I didn't do what I was told and I am punished. But when my brother does absolutely nothing besides play on my PS4 that I bought for myself, he gets no punishment. He's 10 btw and I'm 13. 

I'm on my computer after I get done with my chores and when my sister gets home from work I usually go outside and my brother stays in. So when my mom gets home and I just came back inside from being outside for 2 hours to check my discord server, I get accused of being on my computer all day. When my 10 year old brother just literally sits there on the ps4. They think I'm a sort of addict to electronical devices, but I'm on them far less than my brother, and when I'm on them I'm usually playing with my friends online, developing a game with the game dev team I'm on, or just watching YouTube. 

They also restrict me on when I get to play. I'm not alowed to have stuff in my room, which I obey their rules, but after almost a year of doing so no progress of getting privelages for that. Can't play on school nights either. I can only play from 12 to 6 on weekends. Which is the time I am outside.i usually have to force my brother to go outside. 

Whenever something goes bad it's always my fault according to them because they usually go to my brother. They believe him more than me. We both have lied in the past to be on the fair side. But I've never lied to them in the past 3 months. 

I'm going to be a freshman in high school in a couple days and I have a feeling I won't be able to go to events like football games and stuff like that. I say this because they don't trust other kids or most of their parents. They almost always want me to be supervised.

But I'm stuck. I don't know what to do at this point. I've asked so many people for advice but it never works. I've become so desperate that I'm making a Reddit post about this. But someone pls help me.",23Aug2017,1

The problem is I'm in a lot of debt and want to finish school so I can get a better paying job.

If I had the freedom to major in some sort of music production I would, but constant stress of debt and wanting to move out is in the way. What can I do?

51,"I am currently living in Louisiana and My roommate lost his job, Now we have a finite amount of time before we run out of money and can no longer pay the rent for the place we currently live. The rub is when I told my landlord, I was told I would be responsible for rent until someone else took over the payments/lease or they re-rented the house. I would try and find someone else to take over the lease but problem is this house has many issues and in retrospect I shouldn't have even agreed to live in the house. It has mold in the ceiling from the air conditioner pipes getting condensation on them and dripping on the ceiling tiles the interior area, where the ac unit is located is covered in mold because the unit was creating condensation in the room without us knowing. Also I am worried that the land lord will try and blame us for this making us not only not be able to pay for rent but repairs I don't believe we are responsible for.

58,"I'm becoming worried lately that I'm taking advantage of my friend without realizing it. We hang out at her place a lot but never mine. I'll buy her coffee and she'll buy us sushi or make us food at her place, I'll give her money for gas and some of my cigarettes. It's always- in my eyes -been mutually beneficial. I talk to her about my problems and she talks to me about mine. I just worry that I might be going about this in a bad way. Recently we drove to a town 3-4 hours away with my family. My family rode in one vehicle while my friend and I rode in another with my mother. My friend drove the way there and back but we paid for gas and made sure she had the same amount as she had before. We hung out on the beach and she seemed to enjoy the day. I slept at her place the night before that and she told me about some problems of hers, we fell asleep talking as usual. 

That night we slept at her place again, in the morning her sister and I went with her to this fundraiser to help out as volunteers. She seemed very anxious the whole day and was on the verge of crying for a lot of it. We snuck off for a cigarette beforehand but I wasn't near her all day and I wanted to help her but I worry she just needed space after that and I didn't see it. She went to drive a coworker home and I asked to join because I wanted to give her a few more smokes and make sure she was okay. She told me she was fine but I know she wasn't, I've never seen her so upset. I listened to her talk and I don't know if I went about it well (I certainly hope I did?) but she still seemed upset after. This is where things get blurry for me.

My family has been over this week but I haven't seen them a lot. They drove all the way here from the next state/province over but I've been working. (I wasn't told they were coming until a few days before they arrived so I couldn't book any days off). On the days I worked they did stuff with us before and dropped me off at work after (our car broke down). When I'm off they seem to be doing other things, they're leaving soon though. Anyhow, back to that evening. I asked to stay over another night because I knew she was feeling very anxious and I was starting to slip as well without my medication. It was a yes, my family was upset with me for not being around much (despite the fact that I've been trying to fit everyone in lately and I've seen them whenever our schedules would allow it). 

To the main point, the night where my mental health seemed to completely fall apart and I hid it as best as I could. After driving back from my house (and spending all my money on my meds despite having wanted to pay her for gas. My savings account isn't set up on debit and the bank was closed.) we get to her place and we're watching some YouTube videos. Her best friend of at least two or three years calls her and she drives up to her house to meet her, leaving me with her sister. (Which is fine because I like her sister and we have a lot of fun conversations and her friend is moving very soon to a different city.) So I'm feeling really anxious all night, my ex texts me after we got in an argument about her current/borderline ex possibly cheating on her. 

This is where it gets complicated to explain so let's call my friend Claire and my ex Jane. Jane asks me to look on snap-maps to see if her current boyfriend is with a girl he'd been flirting with online ""because he went somewhere unusual"". Of course, I say no, and ask if they're back together. (She broke up with him a few days prior). She guilts me by saying that I'll be mad if she tells me (and I'm not, I just want what's best for her and I don't think being with him is doing her any good anymore) then when I say I don't have reason to be she assumes we aren't friends and all this bullshit drama. Jane gets upset and (I assume) tries to guilt me by saying Claire is a much better friend for me and I'd be better off without Jane in my life and all that. So I lie and tell her I'm with my family so she'll stop. 

Anyhow, soon enough Claire comes home with her best friend in a much better mood then before. I'm nervous because her friend is very pretty and she gets along really well with Claire while I don't know if I do. So I make a few awkward little jokes that no one laughs at and eventually start to dissociate a little. The rest of the night is fuzzy but I remember sitting around outside smoking pot and drinking with Claire, her sister, her friend and her ex boyfriend. I sit down beside her boyfriend, Ryan, and her sister because that's the only empty chair. We smoke, and we drink. Claire and her friend laugh and whisper and reference inside jokes and people that only they know. All is fine at first because I'm just talking with her sister and trying to keep myself calm as the drug kicks in.

And this, of course, is where it gets bad for me. I felt like I was falling and I quite possibly had the worst trip of my life so far. I hardly spoke for the rest of that night except for bad sarcastic little jokes no one found funny. I couldn't speak and I felt really shaky but I don't think anyone noticed the bad shape I was in mentally. Eventually I try to go to bed but I can't so I come back. The next thing I remember Ryan pipes up, wondering who's sleeping in the tent, I raise my hand and Claire responds with ""everyone but my sister"" and I think I let out a little surprised noise. When she asked me who I thought was sleeping in the tent I said I didn't know. Of course in the back of my mind I was hoping it would be Ryan and I because I have a bit of a thing for him. Nonetheless, we end up agreeing to sleep in the tent until Claire's friend declares she wants to sleep inside. I tell her it's okay, trying to make sure she feels welcomed but she ends up sleeping inside anyways. Claire goes with her. 

This would have left Ryan and I alone in the tent if it weren't for me telling Claire's sister it was okay to sleep in the tent with all of us when she piped up about it. I wanted her to feel welcome in her own home. This was before Claire's friend, Emily, decided to sleep inside. So I was left to sleep with her sister and her ex. In the morning I had to leave early to meet my family and didn't get a chance to say goodbye to anyone but Claire's sister who had woken up early to see the eclipse. 

Now, Claire and I don't talk a whole lot on Facebook to begin with and I know she's busy lately but I've been wondering if she's mad at me or sick of me or if she just needs her space. Did I do something wrong? Should I apologize to her or ask if I did anything wrong or would I just seem whiny? 

Am I an asshole or am I just overthinking everything? Please help.",23Aug2017,1

A little long post please bear with me . 

I am 20 years old and I work in a small boutique with about 4 other employees . The schedules started to get ridiculously long (11 hour shifts and whoever works that day works by him/herself) . We also are not allowed to leave the store , and we also don't get breaks . 10 AM to 9 PM . 

The only good thing is that the job itself is easy, however , the hours are killing me . A girl quit a week ago so they scheduled me this week for three days in a row for 11 hour shifts, a 6 hour shift the next day and 11 more hours the next. I had no choice but to come in since It was last minute. 

The problem is that the manager now scheduled me AGAIN for next week three days in a row 10-9PM. and to add the cherry on top of the cake , she wants me to come in on my day off to cover for someone who is going on a trip . basically only one day off and the rest are 11 hour shifts .

 I have finally reached my breaking point, I am burnt out. There are other employees who are available but she decided to schedule me instead . I am tired of this situation but I'm hesitant to quit since I been here for a year and it is a sales position which would look very good on my resume. I am afraid that it will leave a gap in my resume and will not be able to find jobs in the future, but at the same time I just can't stand being here for so many hours , this is constant behavior that people can't come and they schedule me on days off to come for them when there are other employees available . 

My cousin works in a company that will start interviewing in October and I'm recommended by her,  Should just wait and quit in October with a two week notice or just quit right away (burning a bridge) since I am extremely burnt out ?? I'm afraid of leaving a resume gap for future jobs . Please help . ",23Aug2017,1

71,"Hi!! I graduated high school and was going to UC Davis, planning on paying around 10k per year. However the bill came in and apparently it was 10k per quarter, making it roughly 31k a school year. 

My family makes about 70k a year, and I am not sure if we can handle that amount. Also it is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced (so this is college in America huh :c) and I do not want to take out loans solely out of spite and also because of another plan. 

I want to take a gap year then apply to SDSU, which would be a lot cheaper than UCD as it isn't a UC and as I won't have to pay for the dorms and such since it's so close to home. I would be there for 2 years then transfer to UC Davis. 

My mom doesn't want me to do it because it's not a UC (so it's inferior), no matter how much I try to explain that it is just to take care of the core classes. She thinks I'm doing it for my boyfriend (who will go to SDSU) but that is NOT my motive. I just wanna save money... 

My mom seriously wants me to go to Davis this year but I seriously don't want to.

Now, all of a sudden over the last few weeks, she just.. stopped using them.

She has been on this routine for years, and just now decided she is going to start shitting in the living room and pissing in the kitchen.

I don't understand. I started trying to leave her outside in the back yard on a pretty long leash (She's tiny) but she won't use the bathroom in the back yard. She will wait until she is inside and shit right on the kitchen floor in front of me.

I am half tempted to just leave her out in the back for half the day until she HAS to use the bathroom out there. I have no idea what else to do or why she suddenly stopped using her puppy pads.

74,"I hate my job, i do, but i work my ass off so i can leave on time, even though i don't have to do a few things i do. Those extra things involve helping my coworker. So F-M i have to come in an hour earlier to help one of the morning employees with their stuff, but i help one of my afternoon coworkers for my own benefit.

The only reason i help her is because if she doesn't do it herself she lags us behind 20 mins and she already works super slow. What i do to help takes me like 2-3 mins top, she neglects to do it and takes 20 mins. And if i finish early, i feel kinda bad so i help her for like 10 mins and she clocks me out whenever i'm supposed to leave because she kinda feels bad when i stay.

With my job i just want to get in and get out ASAP, i really hate working with her. She's a really nice person, but she never shuts up. Like anyone who comes in she starts a conversation and doesn't work while talking the way everyone else is skilled in. If she just kept her mouth shut she'd have all she needs. I know it shouldn't take her as long as it does, the other people who work her position finish it with time to spare before we serve food, at this point i finish all my stuff with time to spare even when i help. But lately i've been told by other coworkers i've been helping her so much that when i'm off she struggles more than before i started helping and complaining that she has to do the things i help her with like she's never done it before. She's been there a year more than i have

I tend to guilt myself of all people the most. I hate when other people guilt me, sometimes it works based on what they use. I doubt she does it on purpose, but she talks about her family a lot and works 2 jobs the entire week. But now she's saying when i leave (which i've told my boss will be the 20th) that she's leaving too.

I don't like talking when i work, i will when i'm friends with my coworkers and we're both getting our shit done, that's not the case with her. Like she tries to make conversation but i tend not to reply much other than with disinterest in the hope she doesn't continue. She also tends to touch a lot, which i'm not comfortable with. Like not anything that passes any normal people boundaries, but i just don't like being touched unless it's certain people, she's not one of them.

76,"Ok so some background: the high school I currently go to is the best school in Florida and I'm taking the IB program there. It took me a lot of effort in 8th grade to qualify to get in, and it's considered a privilege by many to even get a letter asking you to apply. 

I'm now in 10th grade and it sucks. The school is an hour away, so I have to wake up at 5:30AM just to be there on time. School's over by 3:00PM and I get home at 4:30PM. At 5:00PM, I start my homework and then stay up till midnight or later just to finish all of it. This has created a cycle of sleep deprivation and I feel like shit the next day. I have no time for any extracurriculars. I love to make videos and play guitar, but I never have any time to do either of those nowadays. It's just working hour after hour from when I wake up to when I go to sleep. It's taken all the fun out of learning. 

My dad and I were discussing moving to my neighborhood school, but I feel like I'm being ungrateful of my chance to go to such a praised school. I'd also have to wait for another 16 weeks until I could switch.

77,"This is not a suicidal post although it would be reasonable to assume it was based on how pathetic I am. Then there's the fact that I'm probably the literal millionth person to post something like this, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm actually going through this so I might as well see if anyone can help.

To begin I should mention that I'm apparently quite good looking according to a lot of people telling me so. I agree with them but I didn't just want to come out and state it like it was a fact that I determined myself. I was physically and extremely psychologically abused as a child/teen and was told that no employer/college/woman would ever want me on a daily basis. That was far from the extent of it but it's what's relevant to this post. Because of that I dropped out of school in 9th grade and have never asked a girl out on a date, to a school dance, or to any social function whatsoever. I'm simply afraid of rejection to the point that I'd apparently rather be miserable and alone than to face such devastation. I had one girlfriend when I was 22 but it just kind of happened through no effort on my part. She cheated on me and it destroyed me. So I know part of my fear stems from that.

I'm extremely poor (like third-world country poor) and I suffer from PTSD as well as a debilitating disease (which was most likely caused by my abuse) so I realize that having a girlfriend isn't going to fix my problems and maybe shouldn't even be a priority for me at this, or any, point. But I've already missed so much in life and I'll never know what it would've been like to have a high school girlfriend or to get a lot of dating out of the way during my 20s so that I can know what type of girl I should be looking for at this point. I'm afraid that if any girl ever shows interest in me I'll be so desperate that I'll fall for her even if she's another toxic person like the one girlfriend I had at 22. Please give me any advice so that I might be able to start dating at 32 and maybe, possibly, be able to find a wife before we're both too old to have children.

90,"I’m a Malaysian and I’m sad that this thing has happened to my family. 

Alright so here’s the deal. My mom purchased this house years ago. 3 years ago, my mom’s brother (uncle) got in trouble with money so she’s being nice by inviting him and his family over to stay with us. She said they can stay as long they like until they can get back on their own feet again. Then a few years ago, my uncle died (unknown cause but we suspected he was murdered by pissing off the wrong party).

Three years later, her brother’s wife (my aunt) is earning + pension by her late husband. Her son also started working and they both combined with nearly 6.5k salary in the household, despite I’m the only breadwinner in the house. Every month, this aunt only gave 200 bucks for my mom as necessity like electricity and water but never paid for cable and internet, despite they use the bulk of it. Internet and cable cost already hitting 300 bucks.

And to top it off, I got a diabetic grandmother who have trouble walking and my father who just got a stroke late last year. So my mom was doing the cooking and cleaning in the family and she was not helped by this aunt. I calculated that in one year, she probably helped like 5 times to clean the house. What I meant cleaning the house, is that she ONLY clean her own room. And maybe she helped to cook like 3 times a year. As you can imagine, I stayed and helped with the chores while these two look on as if we’re maid. And because of that, we stopped washing their clothes and cooking their food.

Apparently that has no effect on them as the aunt took up to mantle to wash and iron their own clothes.

Their favorite activity is hogging the hall, and there are no privacy when I want to discuss things with my mother. Moreover, things at the house were not maintained even though they were living on it. Toilet wouldn’t flush and these mother and son can actually continue using the toilet and just use pipes to flush their shit down. Not only that, they kept using our computer till it died. No one, but TWO computers. And now the TV with cable TV is acting up. Now I wouldn’t mind if these two can actually own up and pay people to fix them, or even go as far as sharing the cost with me to fix them. They seem to live with the filth and degradation around them as if nothing has happen.

I guess it’s because they felt that they never own this place, so they just trash it as they like, without have to pay for the maintenance. I understand if you were to stay here about a week or two that you don’t have to own up to pay. But when you live a place that long and you’re calling this your house with mails sent here, you probably need to do something to help with the household.

Now the toilet door has broken down. And again, they did nothing. Her son came back each day, starts playing DOTA on his laptop and was oblivious to the quality of life around him.

My question to Reddit is that: what is the best way to get them off our house since they are already back on their feet and still refused to leave. We previously asked them to leave since they have the finances to do so and yet, they refused to leave and kept postponing, saying that they cannot find a place yet. 

Some suggestion that I got is that purchase a new place to stay, sell the old place and kick them out. Currently that’s what I thought of doing but is there any better and effective way to get rid of them?",23Aug2017,1

Soo. this goes from a few months ago.

i'm part of my school council, and new academical year starts. there's this orientation period, and basically we're to help the new kids to get used to the school (it's a boarding school). and i met a cute new girl, who i'll call N.

the period last for a few days. and my senior, F, is the person in charge for it.  on one day, i was tasked to document the whole day. and F is mad at me for joining the discussion between the mentors and the new kids. saying i'm just there to get close to N, and things such as i'm not doing what i was tasked to do. even if i already have the photos and basically done with photos at that time.
he told me ""well, if you are done then why are you still here?"" even though there is a few activities left after that.
on another day, i basically fucked up at some degree. and F is not happy about it.

the period ends, and there's evaluation meeting for the work. F is raging on me because of that day. and it's still on my mind till this day, even though my chairman said it's fine and that F is like that, just don't let it get to your mind.


time passed, and i'm still trying be close to N, occasionally going to her class to say hello, and she seems to be interested in me. and F is still salty about it. i don't get why, i already asked for forgiveness. he already forgive me. and he's not interested in N, that's the one thing i'm sure of. so why bother?

i need some advice on how to deal with him. because on a few weeks there's this period where we will be judged to join next year's student council, and he will be in charge for it. and i'm aiming to be the chairman of a division.

tl;dr: part of student council. new year is starting. met a cute girl. basically fucked up on the orientation period, a senior is mad at me till this day. and selection for next year's student council is on a few weeks and he'll be in charge for it. how do i deal with him?

I train myself really hard and understand that pushing myself to the limits will cause DOMS that lasts longer than usual but it's lasting for 3 days after working out and goes away when I wake up on the 4th day! I'm warming up correctly, starting slow and raising the weight, eating plenty of food (mainly carbs and protein, starting to gain a bit of fat from to much food) and keeping well hydrated!

I'm definitely not overtraining  as I wait for all pain in the muscle I worked out to go away before I work it out again!

I'm loosing the will go workout out as I can barely walk after leg day for 3 days and it's just annoying! After chest and triceps I can barely lift anything for 3 full days!

What am I doing wrong and what do I do to reduce how long DOMS lasts?

107,"So, I have no clue how to word the title.   
Basically, I am a 21 year old woman who will blush/go bright red around any, and I mean any, male I speak to (between the ages of probably 15-60?). I am unsure what I would class my sexuality, but I do swing more towards women than men, but the attraction to men is there, albeit it is very weak and rare that I am attracted to a man.  
The blushing is not reserved for men I find attractive- if it was, I guess that would sort of make sense- it's men who are old, or fat, or bald, or shorter than me, just traits that I do not find attractive in the slightest. Men who I would never, ever consider going for. What I'm trying to say is... men I have zero attraction towards- the blushing is based on the sole reason that they have a penis.  
I have major self esteem issues, but at the same time, I do consider myself attractive...   
I was with a woman for three years and never did the whole blushing/making a fool out of myself with her. I don't do that with many women. I am a lot more comfortable being in a romantic relationship and platonic ones with women- I just rarely 'click' with men.  
When a man starts trying to impress me, like when I saw a teacher of mine and he started flexing his arms and doing all that typical guy crap- I went bright red. Why?!   
I avoid saying hello to men at work. If they think I'm a bitch, I get it. I say hello and good morning to every woman I work with, and a handful of men that I have build work-friendships with.  
I have been diagnosed with anxiety and avoid social interaction, if that has any relevancy.  

This blushing/going bright red thing has been around since I was a kid. My friends and adults would tease me and say I'd grow out of it, but I'm 21, when the hell am I going to grow out of it?! I am embarrassed by it, I do not want to be perceived as unfriendly or snobby and I do acknowledge how immature this whole situation is, but someone, please help me.   
How do I get over this? It's really impacting my life and friendships in a negative way. ",23Aug2017,1

112,"a few years ago, on halloween, i wanted to die. i felt so alone after. nothing in life felt worthwhile, but supposedly everything gets better? i decided to make a promise to myself. i had to wait two years to kill myself, and if i didn't kill myself on halloween of 2016, i would have to wait another two years to die. 

nothing in particular happened on halloween of 2016. i didn't get to go hang out with my group of ""friends"", and only hung out with one person. but it was enough. i don't think i want to die anymore. 

but the problem is, a few years back, we wrote letters to our future selves (and friends) for a school project. when i graduate from high school with the rest of my peers, my former friends will open their boxes of memories from when they were 16, and i am terrified of what happens if anyone reads a letter i left them. 

i hurt them. so badly. i stopped talking to them because i wanted them to talk to and befriend people who were far kinder, lovable, and worth their time than i was. my ugly self, inside and out, cut them out of my lives while they continually asked me why i never talked to them anymore. 

the letters explain how i cared about them so much, and thought it was best to stop talking to them—because how can someone cry at the death of a person they don't know anymore? (idiotic, i know.)

the boxes, or time capsules, are kept in multiple people's houses i believe. but i can't even remember whose houses for the life of me. i know at least a few of the boxes are in a male classmates house, who lives right next to the elementary/middle school. but i have no way of getting into the house and it might all be for nothing, as their letters might be in a different house. 

in the letters, i think i also mention my sexuality as a reason behind why i wanted to die. i'm not ready to come out, be it now, or ever.

please, is there anything i can do about this? or should i just own up to it, and ruin their night of nostalgia and fun? (the time capsules were made to accompany a night dinner with the entire grade, if any one person finds out, everyone will know)

tl;dr: planned for a suicide i never committed. i left my (former) friends suicide notes explained my depressed behavior and saying it wasn't their fault. they will open boxes containing various letters and memory-invoking items from 6th grade when we graduate from high school in 2020. i know one house where i think a fraction of them are in, but i don't know the guy and breaking into his house is just cruel. is it too late to do anything?",23Aug2017,1
113,"Hi Reddit, so this is going to be a bit disjointed but I just want to get it out there and off my chest.
I'm miserable. Plain and simple. I am having issues finding joy in anything anymore, my appetite is gone, all I have to look ahead to is going to work at a job I hate. I feel like my life is going nowhere and I hate it. I cant decide if my relationship that I've been in since 2013 is over or not, I feel like she's cheating on me but I can't call her out on it. Its a dry, sexless, almost loveless relationship but theres nowhere for me to go forward with it I feel like and I know she's unhappy. We both are both financially stressed so moving is hardly an option. Plus I have no ine else I can go to, my father passed away in May and I cant bear to put my step mother in to this because her problems are worse and I wont want to be a bother or burden.
 Suicide constantly hangs over me like a cloud but I don't want to go yet because of a bullshit system I set up two years ago.

114,"I don't really have anyone close to talk to so I decided to try multiple sub Reddit to seek guidance. Not even sure if I should post here. Recently turned 19. I caught my dad cheating a couple months ago. I Found lots of messages of him and the other woman. Before I found out he would use his job as an excuse to visit them(they live in another country). As a result of his actions he also got the woman pregnant. Their kid is around 4 years old. I have spoken to my dad that I know the truth and told him he needs to tell the truth. He has told me that he will tell my mom but wants to do it right. He doesn't want me to tell my mom. He still haven't told her

I thought my dad and mom had a pretty good marriage since they are married for around 20 years. My dad has been a good parent to me so it deeply hurts me to know that he would do such a thing to my mom. He coached me in football to be a better lineman, he provides for the family , and he was there for me you know. I'm pretty good at not getting too emotional into most stuff but I never felt this emotional exhausted before so I'm struggling right now. Haven't had a proper sleep since I found out. To have a dad show you that getting pussy was much more important than his own family is a pretty hard kick in the balls. 

Currently it seems that my dad continues to talk to the other woman via Skype(he isn't really good at hiding things). Right now I don't know who my dad really loves. The only thing that's on my mind nowadays is thinking whether my dad is cheating while he is away for ""work"". 

I'm starting to slowly degrade mentally. It feels like I'm also betraying my mom since I'm not telling her. I started to turn to alcohol recently just so I can stop thinking about my situation(extremely easy to get alcohol because of the country I live). 

I'm trying to give my dad another chance I really am but my mom gave him another chance(apparently when we talked this was an ongoing problem) he continued to cheat. I can't look at my dad the same. 

His explanation for why he did it was also bullshit. He pulled the ""humans make mistakes"" card on me. Yes, humans make mistakes but what he did was a conscious choice. I refuse to believe that he accidentally contacted that woman to meet at some hotel and proceed to have sex. Just makes it even worse for him. This whole situation also makes me feel like Shit. I know a guy can have needs since I'm a guy but come on you have to be a piece of shit to cheat for those ""needs"". 

I just want some guidance from those who have experience the betrayal of a parent. What has happened to you as you move on?

**TL;DR;** : Summary: I caught my dad cheating on my mom for several years. As a result he got the other woman pregnant. Their kid is now 4-5 years old. I need help from others who has had a similar situation with a cheating parent.

123,"The past is a haunting and terrifying burden to carry.

I know that everyone has regrets and I know that everyone makes mistakes but I think that plenty of people find it hard to let go of certain mistakes becuase of a variety of reasons.

""I cannot believe that was me""

""How could I have been so stupid?""

""What on Earth was going through my mind when I did it?""

And I often have trouble accepting some of the mistakes that I made becuase they carry a lot of burden.

Shame, embarrassment, guilt, and lots of regret and pain and depression

I made plenty of mistakes that I sometimes feel that it was made by an entirely different which while I can potentially feel proud of how much I have changed, there is something scares me - technology

Most of the mistakes that come to haunt me are when I hear that other people did said mistakes *(or mistakes/actions that are similar)* and that is what frightens me.

Because of the accessibility of the technology we have today and how much people can potentially destroy you if they even spread a rumor, one can easily search for it on the internet and immediately judge you for it, no matter how much you have changed or how long ago that was or how much effort you made to not make that mistake again

But apparently, there are plenty of things that in the world that are almost with you permanently if you made certain mistakes

If, for example, you took drugs becuase you cannot bear the Kenya pain that you had and for arrested, your police conduct is gonna give you a bad image becuase regardless of why you took the drugs, not many people want to employ an ex-drug addict.

Or imagine that you failed your exams or did not go well as you hoped becuase you were going through life issues like family crisis or personal torment like confused about your future, what if someone asks for your past results and immediately judges you for it without asking why the marks were so low or without realising how much you have changed.

And the more I think about my past mistakes, the more I 'hold on' to them are the more I am allowing them to be a part of me and define me.

Like for example, say I was a drug addict but the guilt was so much that it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and end up taking drugs becuase that is who I identify myself as deep down

Or a failed one test and I feel like that final mark will be with me for an eternity and I have doomed my future so from now on, I cannot concentrate because I see myself as a dumb idiot and so I get low marks in potentially upcoming exams 

and so on and so forth.

I know that not everyone has all the answers and I know everyone makes mishaps and fuck ups and everyone goes through hard and confusing times that they feel that they are not sure what they are doing.

I just feel that I have no other option but to bash my head to the wall because of my mishaps becuase I end up blaming myself and self-criticising myself over and over again and feel like I deserve punishment becuase I feel that those mistakes that I made during those said confusing times are my end to my future 

And I am saying this becuase the more I grow up, the more I realise how competitive the real world is and that scares me. 

It puts me in a position where I feel like I am in the Hunger Games where I have to forgot about living and focus on nothing but survival. It's scary really because most of these realizations happened when I was growing up, which is a time of self-discovery and a time of discovering the world and people say that youth is a beautiful time because of the adventures that you might have give you a solid foundation of how you see yourself.

 Confidence, bravery, self-esteem, social skills, self-efficacy and so on.

 Can't say that I was lucky because while youth may be an exciting time, it is also quite scary and confusing and becuase of said mistakes and traumas that I had to unfortunately go through, it did not give me a solid foundation, psychologically or emotionally, on how to face the challenges of life.

 So in a way, I feel stuck. I feel like a glitched or crippled person who trying to keep going in race of the competition. 

Like a person who all of a sudden became a gladiator, either becuase he was forced to without a chance or his action eventually resulted him to be one as sort of like a punishment for his actions, and he has to fight with himself becuase of all the fear that he is experiencing while simultaneously he has to fight  the challenges that he has to face like a crippled leg while battling against another opponent or fighting against a booing crowd which affects his morale and so on.

I feel like I am stuck in both in the past and the future.",23Aug2017,12
125,"Hey reddit, I'm a senior in high school who had participated in nearly every activity since freshman year, some even longer. I've been in volleyball since my 7th grade year. I've never been a good player, but my school allows everyone on the team. This season, I'm off to a rough start. My ankle got messed up a few weeks ago and isn't healing up, I'm struggling to make time for volleyball and cheerleading, and depression is getting worse. My volleyball coach offered for me to switch roles, and become a manager. This way, I could still be on the team, but I would only be attending varsity games, and only to record. I was originally placed as a player on the JV team, with hopes of play time there. So help me out here.
If I become a manager...
I would be less pressed for time, and could dedicate more time to my other activities. I would still be attending games, so I'd still be a part of the team. But, volleyball is sentimental to me. I didn't make the team at my old school, my father passed away and we moved here, so I almost consider it a ""gift"" from him. But sometimes that feels like it's the only reason I've held out this long. It's starting to feel like a chore... But if I become manager, I can't go back. But if I wait too long to decide, she might get someone else. And this is my senior year, the LAST year I could ever play volleyball again. But I'm also just so tired... And if I hurt my ankle beyond repair, then I will be unable to participate in wrestling, which is my #1 priority. but, I also need to lose weight for wrestling. Volleyball is how I get in exercise...
I feel like I know what is the best decision, logically. Yes, I should become manager.
But in my heart, I feel like I need to stick this out. No one got anywhere in life quitting when things got tough... But if I stay, I might not go anywhere anyway.

129,"Hello reddit,

I am selecting my subjects for next year (I live in Australia, for reference) and I am so at a loss right now. My grade is switching to a system that does the same subjects you choose in year 10 until year 12 so the pressure is on. I am at a complete crossroads for choosing my science and am torn between Environmental Science and Chemistry.

I am relatively smart, I was always at the top of my classes until I moved schools and I have always been in the advanced programs at schools. 

English, particularly creative writing is my strongest point with math being my weakness and science falling somewhere just below english.

My life goals I guess are either becoming a lawyer (maybe environmental lawyer but also possibly a corporate lawyer or something. not sure.) or a chemical engineer (particularly working in the environmental side and alternative fuels and such)

I have a passion for writing. I love to figure out things, like solving problems and such. I am not a huge fan of math but I don't hate it. I also really enjoy learning about the environment because I am very big on saving the earth from humans and our damage but I am just not sure if it will be 'too easy'. I also enjoyed learning Chemistry when we did it in term 1 this year.

132,"Hi everybody, it's been four months since this occurred and I've made excellent steps to get over this but it still comes back to haunt me every few weeks and hits me. Hard. 
Long story short, I met this guy online last winter and we hit it off immediately. It was one of those instant love connections and we only lived two hours from each out so we met a couple months later. He is a very reclusive person who prefers to stay in the confines of his own home but he managed to take me to the MET for my 22nd birthday. Nice, right? 
It turned out to be an amazing day and for the rest of the summer, we continued to see each other off and on. But every time we would have a weekend together, he would get eerily distant. Despite the connection and the closeness we shared, he'd pull away every time things were getting more serious. He'd blame something on me and use it as an excuse that we could no longer see each other and several times, I tried to quit his antics by breaking contact. 
I was hurt, I decided to move to another state to live with my brother and try something new after college. We continued speaking everyday for several hours and enjoyed each other's company. 
We continued our relationship until April of this year. It was chaotic up until that point, I couldn't even get him to come out to lunch with me and spend the day together. I wasn't even 'permitted' to come stay with him at his apartment as he thought it would be ""too complicated."" 
I'll admit, guys, he told me several times to date other people and I did end up going on a couple dates. He'd often tell me that he'd stuck around until I moved on or some bullshit like that. Then every time he'd find out that I had made an attempt to date (which failed every time as I had feelings for him) he would flip out. Sometimes he would stop talking to me for a couple days, sometimes weeks. 
 
One night in April, we had the fight of all fights regarding this when he found out I had been dating someone else. He called me a wide array of names and hung up the phone on me. Blocked me on every form of social media, skype, discord, email, etc. 

I have received one email from someone who claims to be his ""friend."" Stating that he wants to pretend I no longer exist and to never contact him again. I've been upset, I've been angry, I've been horribly depressed but I've worked myself into that acceptance stage. I did love this guy and the intensity of my feelings despite all the chaos is really messing with my head.

147,"I accepted a job offer at a government contractor on the other side of the country. They called me yesterday to tell me that I was bypassed for interim clearance, but that the job offer will be honored contingent on me passing the full clearance. I'm surprised I didn't get interim since I have a clean record and I live quietly, but it means waiting if I want this (or really any govt contractor) job.

I want to send them an email that says I will keep planning around this job, but I don't know if I should mention that I will be looking for other work. On one hand, I did sign the offer sheet to work for them. On the other hand, it could be a year before I actually work for them. 

I have enough saved to be fine not working for a while, my biggest expense is housing. Both my current job and my lease are ending soon anyway. My job is ending due to the end of a client program where I work and I only live here because I got a job here (several hours from my family). I can move back in with my parents and just stay there while I wait/job hunt again. My job hunt will of course exclude government contractors, and I feel a sort of security that I can job hunt knowing that if it takes too long that I still have one in my pocket. 

So my real issue is as follows: Do I let the place where I accepted a contingent offer know that I will be looking for other jobs?

Any advice?",23Aug2017,4

149,"Here's the scenario, and where I sit in the middle of it.

I've been working at... A building for over a year now. I love the job, I love the work, and I love my counterpart. Our job is simple. Inventory management via excel spreadsheets. Pretty simple. 


People in another part of the building like to stir up the tiniest issues, and explode them into a proportion that makes EVERYTHING difficult. The bad part is, one is a contactor, and one is not. The contractor gets the non contractor riled up, and then everything hits the fan. Even so much as a typo in an email, and we're getting slammed from all directions, when in reality, it's not a big deal. The ONLY people that take it as a big deal is... Lets call them Jess and Bob. My counter part, lets name her Jean. I have proof of this because I contact the people that ""It heavily impacts"" and they even stated to me that the typo is ""Really no big deal LOL"". And yes, they even put the LOL. 


So Bob and Jean DO NOT get along for any reason. They'll make casual talk, but Bob and Jean have worked together before. In another setting in the same compound, Bob was a manager over a different group, and fired people left and right over tiny mistakes. Bob has absolutely NO social skills whatsoever, due to the personal run ins he's had with me. [He attempted to tell me how much we affect an entire group, when in reality it DOESN'T affect a simple thing]. 


Now I'll fast forward to today. Among all the nitpicking for the past year, weather it be an error that WE caused, or errors made before the policy change over a year ago regarding items in our spreadsheets; now that some management is combining and moving around, our chief has taken an additional role, and he has asked me and my counterpart to provide a report weekly of EVERY SINGLE ITEM WE PROCESS in an excel report; along with who actually DID the item.  


The biggest issue about this is that the workflow changes form day to day. When items aren't coming in to process, we have 2 MAJOR projects we are working on that's almost mission critical. I have been ""Voluntarily selected"" to do these reports and I feel they are really wrong. What should I do? I voiced my concern for it, and the chief told me one on one that they are for ""Consistently, and its not to bring the hammer down to punish anyone"". But then he said ""X and Y are going to audit you guys"" when we already send a weekly report of how much gets processed on Thursdays.  The last time something like this happened, our third teammate was let go.

150,"I don't know where to ask so if anyone knows better spot it would be very much appreciated. 

My father has a ESA to help PTSD, we have had her for about 3 years. She is a black pit breed, very loving and amazing. About three months ago my mother found a female pit mix laying on the side of the road. She is very timid, sweet and all around a amazing dog. We introduced them slowly and they really hit it off well, playing together sleeping together. Then about two weeks ago my father's dog tried to attack our landlords yorki. A few days later she attacked the new dog. We broke up the fight and thought it was something normal, next day it happened again.. So we locked the new dog in the kennel to keep from fighting. My father's dog attacks the kennel trying to get to her. So now we have to keep them separated. I keep the new dog with me in my room and my father keeps his dog in his room. And when we let my father's dog out of his room she immediately searches the house for the new dog. Yesterday before class my father came in my room and as he was leaving his dog bolted through him and attacked the new dog, I grabbed a hold of my fathers dog trying to pull her off and she attacked me, biting me twice in my leg. I've been trying to find a home for the new dog but no luck. Even if removing the new dog from the home I am worried my father's dog will attack our neighbors dog next or anyone walking a dog past our home.

Essentially my SO of two years ended our relationship as I've very recently suffering with depression and she couldn't/didn't want to deal with it. I want to shout and scream about how I was always there for her and blah blah blah but instead I thought I'd see if Reddit had any more mature, constructive ways I could handle it?

157,"So.. For many years while I (f/22) was a child and teen and now as a young adult, I've often been seen as boring, weird, and quiet by many other people. Even my bf said I'm kind of boring (even though I'm up for trying new things and usually the only one to suggest doing new stuff - tbh he's kind of boring himself)..

Anyways, here's some more info about me that others would often see by observing me:

* I like to read and often visit the library for personal pleasure and school research.

* I suck at socializing and am usually shy when I first meet people. I'll often come off as quiet, awkward, or weird in this times. I've tried being the one to initiate conversations more often but have only seen a slight improvement in how people talk to me after. Also trying to improve my listening skills, which also seemed to have helped a little. Plus I hate small-talk about the weather and all that crap; I have to do it at work for ""professionalism"" and it constantly drains me... I've also found that people will call me weird because of my quietness/shyness.

* My humor has been described as ""dry"" and ""sarcastic"" by a few acquaintances and friends. Sometimes I'll say a joke just to get people to laugh because otherwise I won't know what to say and I'll continue to look weird if I don't say anything at all.

* I love to paint and will sometimes put humor into my pieces (Ex: Painted a middle finger and made it look like who ever is holding it is getting the bird). I did that for my own amusement but it was also cool to see peoples reactions.

* I'm more of an introverted stay at home person that watches movies or Netflix, plays video games, reads, writes, or works on art or school projects. However, if someone were to go with me to a festival or places I haven't been to I would totally go as I'm up for new adventures occasionally. Just don't want to do it by myself... (haven't found anyone wanting to do that with me yet - other than bf when he's in the mood).

* I'll smile sometimes (when I feel happy and like smiling) but I hate smiling just because someone tells me to or just for the ""possibility"" of making people like me. Seems kind of fake to me if I'm just gonna do it for the latter. I prefer honesty over 
fake niceties any day.

* My outside looks consist of plain short-ish brown hair, no piercings or tats (don't want anything permanent or to damage my sensitive hair with chemicals juts for different color - like really sensitive), and often dressing sort of conservatively as I hate the attention of men who might be pervy and stalkerish. Plus I never wear any make-up as I don't see why I have to bother with it and I get to sleep-in more without worrying about it. People would probably describe me as plain, cute and boring in terms of looks (as I've often heard). I'm 5' 6"", have size 11 feet, and a little chubby (and considered overweight on bmi but I have thick muscles in legs and work out) with some curves. I would resemble one of the rubenesque women you can find in old paintings in Europe. Tbh being called boring through the years has kind of hurt my self esteem, thus this post...

Of course there's much more to me than that, but this is what people will see when they don't know me that well and we first meet or pass by each other. By this point it seems that most have already made the assumption that I'm boring or ""normal"" because of my lack of standing out aesthetically and my initial shyness upon first meeting. It's always been an issue and I'm just tired of it.

I'm trying to see how I could make friends more easily and socialize better, but at the same time I want to be myself without trying to be someone else. 

Any advice for this ""boring"" yet ""weird"" person?

160,"Hello!

Lately I've been obsessing with this idea - this app. So basically, a couple of years ago I worked for the government. And based on my experiences there, I think my app idea would help the government and a little, but good way. Its basically an app that would shorten time spent on manually typing things into an already existing apps, making it more efficient, and easier for older employees to use.

That part of the government has already said they are focusing on IT development, and are looking to grow in the field. I feel like I could actually contribute to something here. I'm unemployed (probably not for long), but want to use my free time for something. I also have a programmer friend who says he can make the app in about 3 weeks with open source materials.

The question is: has anyone of you tried to sell an app or program to a business/government branch? 

- How do I proceed? 
- Who do I contact?
- Do I need a prototype?
- How to I tell them about the app without they just stealing the idea and making it themselves?
- How do I decide cost? (I want it cheap so they actually get tempted to buy)

Any other general advice?

162,"Over an year ago, my mom started behaving oddly. She started talking about consipracy theories and that the government was spying on us with some strange devices. At first, I was a bit confused, but then I understood that something must have happened. Somehow, I managed to send her to the mental institution and there she had the chance to talk with a psychatrist. She stayed there for a couple weeks and they put her on medications. At first, she followed her therapy and things seemed to get better, but then she stopped taking her medications and everything went downhill. The doctors said that she suffers from a schizoaffective disorder. 
Also, I forgot to say that she went through a rough divorce with my father so for a while her parents gave her a room to stay in their house. 
She became more and more sensitive and started getting mad for unnecessary reasons. In my grandparents' house there was only screaming and crying and they just didn't want to live like that anymore. So they sent her away and she basically lived in the streets. Of course her disorder got worse and she refused every help I tried to give her. I looked it up and I can't send her to any mental insitution without her agreement, unless she really is a danger for herself or others. Appearently she doesn't suit these characteristics, so I can't do anything.
Of course I try to give her money for food or tampons or water, but she doesn't want it. Right now, I don't know where she lives and I haven't seen her in over a month because everytime I try to hang out with her she cames up with excuses, even if I say that I gotta talk to her about something urgent. I don't know what to do, I feel like I don't have a mother anymore. Also I admit that in my lowest points I wished she just killed herself so that I could at least get closure, but then I just felt even more like shit. I love my mom and I miss her, I cherish every memory I have of her but now everything seems so irresolvable and I have no idea of what can I do.

168,"I'm a fairly socially awkward person. Definitely an introvert. I've noticed over the years I have trouble with re-connecting with old friends or old lovers/ex's (ones that are still friends of course). 

I find myself able to initiate conversations well enough. ""Hey, how are you? How've you been? How's the family?"" etc. 

But I quickly just basically end up reminiscing with them about old times and then...that's it. I feel like I don't understand how to end conversations at all. 

I'll use my latest issue as an example:

So an old flame of mine from many years ago recently added me on Facebook. We ended our relationship back then on good terms and were good friends before we fell out of touch (we were in our late teens, early 20's at the time. We're both in our early 30's now). Today we talked a bit about the old days. But after that there wasn't really much to talk about. I felt like it would be supper awkward to just say, ""ok bye"". But at the same time I would love to rekindle our old friendship and don't want my awkwardness to drive them away.


So yeah, this is certainly a light request. I'm just curious how you all go about talking to old friends/lovers after you've reconnected after many years. ",23Aug2017,1
169,"TL;DR So this crazy creep from school followed me home and managed to get to me. Well he was first trying to fight but I threatened to call the cops so he broke my phone and put a knife to my throat telling me if I say anything he will kill me. So he forces me back to my bed and... he raped me... I couldn't yell for help because he said he would kill me if I screamed so... let him do it and I don't know why but when the fucking creep finished he actually came inside of me and I couldn't hold it in, I screamed. But like a second later he grabs the knife putting it back to my throat and saying I told you to shut the fuck up and I did, I really made not a single sound. Yet he moved a bit and I scratched him as hard as I could, I don't know if I scared him but he dropped the knife on the floor, that pissed him off because he started punching me in the face, like hard as fuck, I started screaming at the top of my lungs, he even knocked out one of my teeth... finally he stopped hitting me and put his hand over my mouth. So I kept screaming and trying to push him off but his hands went so tightly on my neck choking me my screams sounded so disturbing... Even then he was still inside me, I couldn't get his hands off, I tried to hit him in the face, but it was like he was pulling upward.

I could hear popping noices like my neck was cracking and it was like it was on fire, he would switch and grab the back and front of my neck where he would basically be pulling my head, then it was like his entire hands surrounded covered my neck and was pulling so hard my tongue popped out trying to scream. I couldn't beg or yell. The entire room was getting dark, my hearing was fading, and finally my dad pulls him off and they start fighting, I can't turn my neck. I'm just looking into the ceiling till I finally hear gunshots and I just closed my eyes. They didn't open again till later in the hospital but my dad apparently is arrested now for murdering a devil child and he could go to prison. Any advice I can use? I already have tons of proof this creep was a psycho and deserved it. Anything? Will explaining how much of a creep he was?

This guy was a fucking creep, he always was. In school everyone avoided him, he had no friends and stood every morning on the wall alone like something was wrong with him. Worse is this creep would listen to screaming as music some stupid evil demon metal shit. One day he walks up to me and asks me out basically and I laugh in his fucking face, then I tell my boyfriend and they got in a fight which resulted in my boyfriend beating his ass so now he hates me.

Yet after that he gives me glares in class, stares at me, and some teachers have my side and he gets countless detentions or in school suspension. They were going to put him in the special class... but he decided to ask this other girl out and she actually said yes to him... So I simply warned her he was a creep and offered her go to one of my parties. She agreed and he was more furious at me but I probably saved that girl from being raped by that fucking creep. 

So this is where he gets bad, he starts harrassing me more so I made it more of a public then, calling him out and such. Everyone would find the creepy shit he does funny and laugh at him, but they would also stay near me to keep that creep away from me. It was one day that the guy sat a table away from me and half of the football players sat with him and took almost all his food and he eventually ran out like a little kid. But he still would make sure at times I see him watching me, I walked out the girls bathroom and he walks by like he wasn't there the whole time, so I push him and he falls to the ground now he's pissed because everyone says he got beat up by a girl but then he's the one stalking me...

That's just grazing how much of a creepy fucking prick he is. But like the TL;DR. I didn't even notice the guy got on my bus, then when it stopped and I walked home my dad was in the back messing with his car so I just left the door open. He followed me in and that's where it happened.

I feel like he deserved to die because he looked like he would be a school shooter... All he was is a loner, creep, who always sits by himself and harassing me. Fucking weirdo. I doubt even his family would defend him in court anyway. The guy was an ugly bastard, I doubt he had any personality. That's why it shouldn't be any deal this guy is gone. Not like he was ever going to have kids. Guy had zero purpose, my dad saved my life. The guy tried to murder me, he raped me in my house. It was self defense, the guy probably had his knife. I'm sure all of this information will help my dad win in court. So any extra advice to give me? Any help I can use that will be great to say for my dad? Any help is fine",23Aug2017,0

171,"Sorry this is going to be a long post, but the details are important to the question I need answered, so bear with me :)

I am 33f, and about 9 years ago, I was living in Chicago, had a great group of friends and an okay job. My father was suddenly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and essentially given 2 years to live. They moved about 4 hours away to a small town and I followed to be closer to them. (Update: He is still living with cancer but doing well for the most part). I HATED the small town the moment I moved, but of course, I met someone about a month after coming here and I fell in love pretty fast. 

About a year later, my relationship was not doing well at all. I began to look for jobs back in Chicago and was making solid plans to move back (since my dad was doing a lot better). Well boom, I find out I am pregnant. Being naive and stupid (and being pressured from his family and my own) we got married. Stupid, I know. We were divorced 18 months later.

When my son was 2, I made the decision as a single mother to go back to school and finally get my bachelors in graphic design ( a dream I had for a really long time). I am now in my last year of school and it is time to make a decision about my future and my career.

I don't want to live here anymore. I am miserable and there are not a lot of really great opportunities here for me to have a fulfilling career making comfortable money to support myself and my son without struggling. I want so badly to move back to Chicago where I am from. I love that city more than anything, and every time I go back, I feel alive. When I am where I am now, I feel depressed and dead inside. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression but it has never been as bad as it has been since moving here. I am scared that if I stay here, it will only get worse and I will end up working at some small company forever with no advancement and barely making ends meet.

I worked my ASS off in school. I worked 2 jobs, went to school full time, participated in clubs/competitions/etc events and managed to never get below a B in all of my classes (all while being a single mother). I worked WAY too hard to just settle for a mediocre job in this area. I worked my ass off and I deserve the career I have always dreamed of.

Here comes the problem…My sons father lives about a mile away from us. He would NEVER move to Chicago (not a city person, it would eat him alive). I don't want to take his son away from him at all, but, I feel like to save my own sanity I HAVE to get out of here. I don't want my life to keep going the way it has been. I've gone to therapy, I have tried so hard to make friends out here and Ive tried to get involved in things here but it just never works out. Im sad, and that cant be good for my son either. 

A little bit about my sons father: He loves my son so much but he is very rough on him. My son is more like me, he loves computers and my sons father is more of an athletic person. He pushes my son to do sports constantly, and lately as he is getting older, I have noticed added pressure from his dad. His dad will make snide remarks about how he is going to end up a nerd because he likes to play on the computer (mind you the computer games he plays are building games that are really good for his brain, my son is extremely smart and loves to learn and build things). His father has also been recently making comments about how our son is shy and doesn't want to talk to girls. My son is 7, he thinks all girls have cooties for Gods sake.) 

My ex husbands father was very critical of him and I see my ex heading down the same path with my son. I have tried talking to him about it but he is a narcissist and never does any wrong. He also loves to constantly bother me and berate me about my parenting skills. I want to get away from him and I feel the only way to do this is to move.

So here I am now…asking Reddit for advice :) I have no friends here so who else would I ask? 
I am a city girl, all my best friends are there, my brother and his wife. My parents are willing to move back as well (my fathers oncologist is in Chicago) and they have basically helped me raise him (my ex’s parents barely ever did anything). 

I have always struggled with putting myself first and have done everything for everyone else. I feel like its time to do something for me but don't want to hurt my son by taking him away from his father ( I should mention the city I want to move from is a 4 hour drive from where we live now so he would be 4 hours away from his dad instead of 1 minute). However, I am not happy here and I feel like I worked way to hard to not go after what I want. I don't ever want to get married again so this is not about meeting some man in a new city, I am more concerned with rebuilding my friendships and making new friends.

Am I being selfish? Should I stay just for my son, or move for myself to create a life I love and a life that will provide better opportunities for me and my son?

If you read this whole thing - I salute you :)

173,"I [23f] have a boyfriend [23], I will call him ""Dan"" who still lives at home with his folks. 

I am over at Dan's house frequently to escape my abusive family, while I try to save up money for my own place (I'm disabled, so it's difficult. Not impossible, but difficult and a slower process).

Dan has an older sister [28], ""Sally"", who has two children: ""Jax"" [4] and ""Amy"" [6 or 7]. 

Before I continue, I should make it known - **I don't like children.** 

I don't want any of my own, and I try to avoid being around them as much as possible. Okay, continuing. 

Sally frequently drops her two children off to spend time with their grandparents while she goes to work. 

Amy being 6/7 of course tries to talk to me and engage with me and knock on Dan's door to say hi to me and show me her dolls and things.

I am of course perfectly nice to her because she's a child and didn't do anything to anyone to warrant hostility. 

I am perfectly aware that it is not Amy's fault in ANY way that I do not like children. 

That being said: **I cannot stand her.**

I hate talking to her. She irritates me, and I try to avoid her because her child behavior grates me. 

She throws tantrums, she doesn't say anything interesting, she constantly tries to bug me to get my attention. She also eats my food.

I keep a few snacks at Dan's place so I don't get hungry later when he's at work and also because I dont want to eat his parents' food. 

Amy will pester them for those snacks, and just yesterday I went to go grab one of them and Dan informed me ""the children ate them all."" 

But again - she's a kid, doesn't know any better. 

I feel really guilty for not liking her. It's not her fault, and it's not fair to her. 

I was hoping maybe there was a way to change this *I really fucking hate children* outlook of mine so I don't feel like this about poor Amy who has done nothing wrong to me except be a young child. 

Is there anything I can do to get myself to like children?

**TLDR:** Boyfriend's sister has children I can't stand because I don't like children. I want advice on how to get myself to like children because I know my outlook towards her is unfair to her.

Is there anything else than coffee I could start to give me more energy to survive the morning and hopefully a few more hours?",23Aug2017,3
176,"My Dad has end stage liver disease and while I've known he was terminal for awhile now, doctors just told us he has six months. My Dad is 70 so he's lived a relatively good life, but I'm 33.

The idea of going through those life events without my Dad is breaking my heart. I can't imagine my kids not knowing him, so while I'm trying to stay positive and grateful for the time I've had, I'm having a hell of a time with it. He is very ill so we can't do much together. He can't really leave the house or go on trips. He's stuck at home so I go up once a week to be with him and talk about his life and family history, but I have anxiety about not having the right conversations.

179,"Hey everyone! I'm usually the person reading reddit posts and have never wrote a post before but I guess everyone has their first time. 

I am a 21 year old medical student and i live with my two brothers and parents. Me and my family are from the middle east but i grew up in Sweden so I have the same mindset. My parents are very strict. Although I am the perfect son, I study and pass all my exams. I do the chores, I am very respectful and I help them with literally everything around the house and whatnot. I have a part-time job and I can provide for myself. I also pay the rent and I pay for the food, internet and electricity. I have met a girl 3 months ago and she is now my girlfriend, I have never been happier before in my whole life. She is perfect and she is very smart. She lives 1 hour away from my place. Now to the problem, my dad is controlling me and he said that I am not allowed to see her more than once every two weeks, which is killing me. He wants me trapped in the house doing nothing rather than going and meeting her, he gives no reason whatsoever to why I am not allowed to see her, he just says that I am not allowed to go, and whenever I try to ask why or argue, I get shouted at and he even threatens to hit me and gets very angry and then my whole family tells me to shut up and not talk about it so I wouldn't make him more angry. I am really sick of it, I have anxiety of asking anything of him as he never says yes when I ask him. I am the least liked child as my other 2 brothers, are allowed to see their girlfriends whenever they want to. 

2 days ago I had promised my girlfriend that I'll go to her place and she had invited all of her girl-friends so I would get to know them and when I told my dad I wanted to go he started screaming and shouting at me and tried to hit me. I am really emotionally abused and I really don't know if I can take it anymore. My girlfriend got very disappointed when I told her I couldn't come. She is European so she doesn't know how it feels like to have a middle eastern parents and now she is very sad and disappointed. She doesn't know what to tell her friends to why I can't come. My girlfriend needed me the most this week as she is going to travel in a couple of weeks to an African country and stay there for 3 months. It's a part of her university program, she didn't want to go and she applied to stay and do her course in Sweden instead but the school refused and this all happened at the same time that I told her I could not come and see her this week. I really can't take it anymore and whenever I talk to my brothers or mom about it they tell me to stop complaining and that people have bigger problems, of course they don't care because Dad lets them to do whatever they want. If you are asking why dad hates me the most it's because his parents always spoiled their youngest child and he was always jealous of him and now he takes his revenge on me. I want to move out but my brother's fiance is best-friend with my girlfriend and If I move out they will become very angry and disavow me from the family and then put all their anger and blame on my girlfriend. I love my girlfriend and I don't ever want to lose her. Please help as I feel like I am losing my girlfriend, I can't be there for her when she is sad and crying. I am suicidal as I cannot find a solution to this dilemma, I keep thinking of a way out of this but I can't think of any other way other than just ending my life. I know for a fact that I would have already committed suicide if I had any medicines that would make it painless. I know suicide is selfish and that It will hurt my girlfriend but I am in huge amount of pain and I don't know how to take it anymore. Please help.",23Aug2017,1
180,"My brother(we'll call him T) is addicted to adderall &amp; gambling. T has been addicted to adderall for a while now, &amp; gambling for a couple of years. He literally blows his paycheck in 2-3 days, &amp; I know that most of it is on adderall, lottery tickets &amp; cigarettes. He works for my family business but only shows up 4 days a week, sometimes 3, and I don't think he realizes how lucky he has it that he hasn't been fired yet.


T is also gay, but hasn't told anyone except for his 2 (girl) best friends from high school(we'll call them D &amp; J). I've always had an inkling that he was(one of them confirmed it for sure last night) &amp; I have absolutely no problem with it, &amp; I know that most of my family doesn't either. The problem is, if I confront him about it, I know he'll deny it to no end. He is not good with confrontation AT ALL to the point where he won't go anywhere in town(stores, restaurants, etc) because ""he might see someone that he knows."" I want him to know that it's okay, especially with my boyfriend &amp; I(his brother is gay) but I'm not sure how to let him know.


The reason I'm writing all of this is because last week T went on a weekend trip to a casino about 2-3 hours away with D &amp; J. While they were drinking &amp; gambling, he went up to the room by himself &amp; ended up stealing money from J($160, which was her car payment &amp; the reason she didn't have it with her while gambling). When D &amp; J got back to the room, he said that one of the maids had been in their room earlier but he didn't know why(he just said that so when they realized the money was missing, he could blame it on the maid). The next day when J realized the money was gone, T didn't say a word, like ""oh wow I can't believe it's gone"" or ""maybe you misplaced it,"" he just grabbed all of his stuff &amp; left. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. So, he left them at this casino, 2-3 hours away from home with no car. Luckily someone picked them up, but needless to say they haven't spoken to each other since, &amp; I'm starting to become worried. If he wasn't at work, or hanging out with me, he literally spent every possible moment with D &amp; J. The reason I'm becoming worried is because of his depression, which he hides pretty well, because whenever we hang out he's happy &amp; cracks jokes &amp; it doesn't seem like there's anything wrong. If we're not hanging out, &amp; he's not at work, then he spends most of his time in his room. I'm just afraid that one day my mother's going to call up to him one day that dinner's ready &amp; there won't be any response.


tl;dr: Brother is gay but in denial about it &amp; I'm one of the only ones that know(but he doesn't know I know), the denial is causing him to be depressed, he's addicted to adderall &amp; gambling &amp; just lost 2 of his best friends because of it so doesn't really have anyone left but me.",23Aug2017,1

184,"Hi, Im writing this because I do not know what to do. I was at this cruise and was out drinking. Later that night me and this girl just randomly met. Our eyes met and we made out. It was so easy being with her. We didnt even talk to much, because we spoke with actions. She wanted me to add me on snapchat , so i added me on her phone. At the same time and place there was this cabin party that got the guards alerted and they threw everyone, who didnt have a cabin at that location, out. I thought i lost this amazing girl forever and was going back to my cabin when we just met at the stairs randomly. I told her we should go to my cabin and she said that she didnt want sex with people she didnt know. I told her i dont need sex i just want to be with her. So we ended up in my cabin and just laying there in bed looking eachother in the eyes. 
      Now moving forward to the next day, i woke up and realised she was still there. I didnt really know whst i should do or say in these situations because im really new to this kind of stuff. So i just whispered to her if i could go out on a date sometime and she just nodded. She gave back my shirt she borrowed for the night and hurried away somewhere. I noticed she had forgotten her jacket and rushed away to find her. Luckily i found her at the information desk and gave her the jacket. It looked like she was in trouble and because she rushed away i didnt know what to interpret it as. So i just said to her i had to go and i will snap her. This i regret so badly because i wish i would have said something more and helped her get home safely. 
      Anyways when i got home and got my phone charged i found her added you message and accepted it back. I snapped her and she didnt open it for the whole day. When i pressed her name in snapchat she didnt have a similar looking score as any of my friends on my snap so i googled it and it meant she wasnt my friend any more. So me being so desperate to have any chanse of meeting the person that made me feel like no one has never done before i removed her as a friend and added her again just in case she didnt mean to delete me as a friend. But know i havent still gotten any response to any snaps i sent and she has opened them once but after that she hasnt opened any. Know anything i do that remind me of her makes me depressed, i cannot enjoy video games anymore bevause the only thing i want now is to meet her. And everytime i get a snap my hearth starts beating faster and faster because im hoping that there would be a slight chanse its a response from her.
   Thank you for reading and i hope my writing isnt to bad.",23Aug2017,1
185,"TL;DR:
I need to tell a girl I’m dating [23F] that I [24M] have an HPV infection
before we get physical, I really need help with the wording.

Hello
Reddit! A couple of months ago I [24M] noticed some weird bumps in my anus. I
went to the doctor and it turns out I have HPV…This sucks for a variety of
reasons, the main fact being that I haven’t had sex for almost 18 months, much
less had anal sex. I got rid of them and now have to go and see my proctologist
every couple of months for a checkup, just to check if I have another outbreak.

The
good news is that they’re not the cancerous strain, just your normal warts.
Since then I have read up on HPV and I guess it could be worse, I know that many
people get them and that your body suppresses it after a couple of years.

Nevertheless,
I recently began dating this really cool girl [24F] and I feel a connection I haven’t
felt in a long time. She’s awesome, she´s funny, she paints, she´s clever…But
now we are at the point where we might get physical, we have a date tonight and
she´s hinted that she´s expecting sex. I know I have to tell her about the HPV
and for the life of me I don’t know how I’m going to say it (keeping it quiet
is out of the question).

Can
you guys help me with the wording? How should I say it? I’m picking her up at
her place and driving her back to mine, I thought that might be a good time to
tell her, but I really don’t know how. I’m prone to being anxious and I don’t
know how to handle this.",23Aug2017,5
186,"Fuck, i really need some advice. Sorry for the wall of text, it's the best way I can express things, in order to get better advice. 

Okay, first of all, we're not in a relationship. It's only been about 4 months since I've known her. None of us have confessed. 

It's also during the exam period, and it's kinda major. 

So there's this girl in my clique who I really like. These few days, she's been avoiding being alone with me(I think). 

On Monday, she said that she didn't bring her stuff, so she went home to study. 

On Tuesday, she told me that she might join me to study, but in the end, she went home because she felt like she was going to fall asleep, to quote her. I'm not sure if I've made her angry or something, she was talking about how she would own a pet in the future, since she was probably going to live alone. But she said that it was a bad idea, since it would be alone when she leaves for work. I remarked jokingly that she should get 2, which would solve the problem. She seemed a little irritated at that response after that, but she quickly got over it. She gave a snarky remark saying ""18 my ass"" when someone got the date wrong. 

And today, on my school's confessions page, i saw a message about someone losing their interest to someone, and saying that it was just probably just an infatuation.

Just a few minutes ago, I asked her and friend B out to study the next day, but friend B said no. So we were going to end up being alone. I pushed further, and asked if she still wanted to study together. She wanted to 'flip a coin' because she can't choose. In the end, she said that she would study alone because she was taking so long to think about it. It was a little 'test' to see how she would react, but I guess, i got the disappointing answer. 

Before all of this, she didn't mind being alone with me. I'd ask if anyone wanted to come study, and she'd say yes, even though there's a chance that we would be alone. When we were in a group, i asked if anybody wanted to go to the convenience store, and she said yes, even though we were going to be alone. 

The problem is, I may be overthinking this, and the person on the confessions page may not even be my friend, since it's anonymous. But the message matches how she would type, in a way. If it is her, is she trying to avoid me, in order to fully get over me? 

**What should I do? I really like her and I think we do have chemistry together. Should I confess before it's too late? I'm scared if I really do confess my feelings, she'll avoid me.**

**Should I just give up? This is the hardest and most painful option, in my opinion. She's in my clique, and she's my classmate. Which means that she will be around a lot. Making it quite hard to get over her. Chances of being in the same group for projects is also high.**

**Or should I just ignore all of this and give it time because I'm being silly? She's falling behind on grades a little, so maybe, she needs to focus and have some alone time?**

I really need help with this, if not, I won't be able to focus on studying. Friend B suggested that we 3 go out for dinner, so it's not as though she's trying to avoid me entirely.  By the way, the dinner is set on the same day which I asked her out to study on. But I only proposed studying together after friend B asked if we wanted to have dinner. 

~~This may seem very disorganised, I'm so sorry about that.~~

192,"Hey guys, I have a bit of a sticky situation here. I've been at my job (college/entry level position) for about a year. I live with my grandparents and am usually taking care of/aiding them. Yesterday, my grandfather passed away and my family started making arrangements for his funeral. I had to request bereavement leave from work, which was granted immediately. My job is very good with attending to their employees, since it is a fairly small division that I work under. 

I was told by my aunt (daughter of paternal grandparents), whom I do not have a good relationship with, that she is acquiring the property of the house and that she is moving my grandmother into a nursing home. She's over 80 and is somewhat senile/deaf. She says I can no longer live there because she is planning to clean the house and most likely sell the property. She's giving me less than a month to get my things and move out, considering I don't have many belongings to begin with. I won't argue with her because the family is small and I don't really have anyone to bargain with at this point (I rarely speak to my father since I grew up with my stepdad). 

Long story short, I am about 100 miles from where I grew up, and have no other option but to move back in with my parents temporarily, so I also have to quit my job. 

I'm wondering how I would handle this situation with work. I already took a week off for bereavement, and now I have to tell them that I am moving. I don't even have time to give them a two week's notice. I'm considering speaking to HR about this but don't know if it will be considered ""acceptable"". What should I do? Any advice is welcome!!

194,"Hi everyone, I recently met a guy in school, let's name him John.  John is annoying, braggy, kind of dumb, kind of an asshole and many other things I won't bother listing. When I met him I became a close friend to him, and I kept it going because he was one of my first friends in my new school. I introduced him to my closest friends. 

Shortly after I realized he was an asshole, and I didn't want to be with him anymore. That decision was also fueled by the fact that my very close group of friends (8 people) started hating him a week after they met him. My friends made it clear that they didn't want to hang out with him, but I ended stuck in the middle, because he was so fond of me, I had some connections with his dad, and I didn't want to be an asshole and make an enemy. 

My course of action was to try and avoid him, and eventually he would pick up that I didn't like him and it would go smoothly. But it didn't. The  guy wants to hang out after school every single fucking day, he constantly sends me messages and wants to be with me. He isn't picking up that if I don't answer to any of his messages, and when I do, I'm always busy, that means I'm avoiding him. 

I want to put an end to this, I'm tired of not answering his calls and avoiding him in school, and if he ends up understanding and confronts me, I have no idea what to tell him without sounding like a supreme asshole. Help me kind redditors (:

Livestream Archives


Original Recordings (Basically everything)


Final Videos


Thumbnails for each video and livestream


Then all the stuff that should be kept, like my logos, banners, thumbnail templates, etc.


I do make montages, funny moments, which requires me to go back on some archives, but should I delete the archives eventually?

203,"A group of volunteers and I make a meal and bring emergency needs to a park known for having a lot people experiencing homelessness. We serve at the same time every two weeks. The goal is to meet the direct emergency needs of the street homeless. Regardless of their lifestyle everyone deserves a meal, a friend, warm clothes and for their rights to be respected without being asked for something in return. I've given a tent, coat, gloves, and hat to an 18 yr old who was kicked out of the local shelter in the middle of winter at night with nothing to keep him warm and no where to go. I've fed people who haven't eatten in days. Given clothes and shoes to people soaking wet. I've seen grown men cry because they lost their home. Sat in disbelief with people who were denied help for their addictions. Cried with women who lost their children. Physically helped move friends camp sites when threatened with an eviction. I've advocated for the rights of my friends who experience homelessness. Speaking up during city council meetings, news interviews. Helped file a lawsuit against the way the city unlawfully throws away personal property without notice during encampment evictions. I do not have any regrets about the help I give my friends.

All these years I've seen and felt beautiful things, but I've also seen evil and death. Last year one the guys I grew close to overdosed and passed away at a nearby park. He just got his apartment, job and things were going good. I never had the delusion that I was saving anyone or ending homelessness. I just want to be a friend and help where I can. At that moment I had to realise that no matter what I do people I love are going to die. I've fed and hugged a man who would end up murdering another friend of mine over skin color. I've seen dirty children. Women prostitute themselves for a place to stay. Threatened by people so high they don't know who they are. Some friends never come back and I can only hope they are alive and well.

Yesterday, during a meal, I was giving clothes from out of my car when people came running to me saying John is getting arrested and said to get me. John just lost his house and his first day of work is tomorrow. I shove everything back into my car and run. I turn around a blind corner and end up directly in front of John in handcuffs resisting arrest. John is screaming my name begging for my help. Cops shout at me to back up while John is yelling that they have no reason to arrest him or go through his things. All I can do is keep telling John to calm down and file a report later. He was terrified and so was I. Then I finally notice paramedics to my right saying they need narcan and that he's blue. Kevin was dying of an overdose right then and there. I was just talking to Kevin about how he's happy to be out of jail and back with his wife. All I could do was sit on my knees with my hands on my head. I couldn't get John out of that squad car, or even calm him down. I'm not even allowed to carry narcan as a civilian let alone stop Kevin from using in the first place. I begin to wonder if I didn't show up today would this have even happened? John left in the back of a squad car. Kevin's color came back and left on a stretcher in an ambulance. I don't even know if any of them are okay today.

I don't take back any of the hugs or conversations that day. I don't even blame anyone in the situation. I get why Kevin wants to get high after getting out of jail where he's been startved of a high for months. That's not how you get clean. I don't condone it but I understand it. I can see John's concern for Kevin and then being offended when the officers pushed him away. I get why an officer would push someone who refused to get back after being told twice to do so. I no longer believe in a utopia where people don't use drugs, cops don't push people, and people aren't afraid of cops. I just want to work towards a world where we have learned to handle these situations better. After seeing friends literally turn blue at your feet any sane person would question if they are helping or enabling.

Through my advocacy for people who live on the streets I've surrounded myself with people who have fought with me. Therefore I can't ask anyone I know personally if I'm still doing the right thing or if I'm making a bad situation worse, they'll just tell me what I want to hear. I'm also venting due to the nightmares I had last night of people calling my name and not being able to save them. I know I help many many people. However I can no longer avoid the fact that I am enabling some in the process.

Should I stop my free meal and giving emergency needs to my friends who live on the streets?

207,"I am a pretty clueless guy on how to talk to girls, it was the start of a new semester, and on the first day (Monday) I happened to sit next to this girl for my first class and for the next class I happened to sit next to the same girl, so we started talking about the coincidence, and then today (Wednesday I grew some ball and got her number under the excuse that I will be missing class (I actually do have a doctors appointment), alright now that I have her number I don't know how to strike up a conversation with her, I don't wanna start with a bad impression of that annoying guy that is alway texting her, maybe I am just overthinking it, so tell me what I should do?",23Aug2017,2

I take a while to trust others. Hopefully I grow out of it but it takes me at least 2 years to start divulging information about myself. I think it's because of me being secretive or things I like that aren't popular. 

I say all this because I don't know how to be social. I played Smash Bros. with my suite-mates and roommate but that was about it. School started two days ago but I've been here for almost a week.

210,"Hey guys, I'm in need of some advice.

My GPA in high school was horrible. I was too busy partying and chasing girls. I barley managed to graduate at all. Well it's been almost 6 years now and I need to make a change for the better for both me and my 3 year old son. As I see it I've got two options.

I go to tech/vocational school and train in welding and try my hand at a wielding career.

I go to college for computer science.

Now before you assume anything I just want to give you guys some background. I didn't pick SC because it was on some ""highest paying jobs"" list. I've always loved computers. Even in high school I wanted to be that l33T h4xor guy. I already know a bit of HTML, CSS, and python. (Yes I know HTML and CSS aren't technically programming languages) I almost feel like it's my calling. I need to turn my life around and really focus on furthering me and my son's lives. I don't talk to my dad much but he's offering to let me stay with him rent free so that I can go to school.

So here's my question..

Is there anyway I could get into college with a major in computer science? I know it's hard, I know there's a lot of math. I just need to know if I could ever get in at all and ill do the rest. Is there anyway to fix my old highschool GPA? Is it too late for me? Should I just suck it up and go for welding?",23Aug2017,8
211,"Hello,

So it is only my second year of college, but I am considered a junior, and I will graduate in two years.  I am between two or three different options for the moment.  I want to be either a veterinarian, a zoology professor, or a medical illustrator.  However, this isn't about that.

I was recently offered a job that I must keep for at least a year.  This job is at the university veterinary hospital. It would mostly be administrative work, but it would definitely provide me with the connections to the doctors (possibly shadowing) in the hospital as well as build my resume in a fantastic way.

 However, the problem is that I must keep it for a year, so I would not get the chance to get an internship during the summer, unless there is a local part-time internship nearby the place of work.  

I am debating this so heavily since I was going to be searching for an internship this summer that would allow me to explore my interests in at least one of the fields that I am interested in.  So I am going to make a Pros and Cons list below:


**Pros**

* Money
* Experience in a veterinary setting
* Possible opportunities to shadow veterinarians
* May be able to take Summer Classes
* May be able to take art classes in order to explore medical illustration
* May be able to get a part-time internship
* May decide that I do not wish to work at a veterinary hospital
* May help me get into vet school if I decide to go there.

**Cons**

* Will not be able to get a full-time internship
* Probably will not be able to get a part-time internship
* The Job is only 20-30 hours a week, every other week.
* Will have to stay in college town (not be able to visit family or friends at home)
* Will be pretty much alone in apartment and college town.
* Only have two summers left for internships

So this is what I have thought of. If you have more, or input of any kind, I would love to hear it. I am only a college student so I do not have a ton of life experience with this kind of stuff. 

I hope everyone can help! I will be able to answer questions as well.

Thank you",23Aug2017,2

220,"I'd just like some life advice from people older and more experienced then I am. I'm a 25 year old male with a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering. 

Back Story: When I graduated, I immediately started working at one of the big aerospace companies. I worked at a job for over a year I didn't enjoy (I was a glorified data analyst, hardly an engineer) but I worked hard and tried to do my best. I finally left the company and went to teach English overseas. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I felt so much more fulfilled than I did at the old job.

Insecurities: I've always been insecure about my abilities to succeed as an engineer. I'm passionate about aerospace but I feel as though I lack several essential qualities to be truly successful. Simply put, I'm not intelligent enough. 

Predicament: I'm back home and have been applying for engineering jobs in force. I have a solid resume but so far all my attempts have fallen on deaf ears. I know it takes time, but I have this dread that I'm going to get into a job again and feel as though I don't measure up, that I don't belong there. On the other hand I could go back overseas and teach again for a pay increase (still pittance compared to engineering salary). 

Question: Should I work on a career I don't feel I'll be good at or take this time to travel more and gain life experience? What's more important in the end? A few of my friends already have houses and are married and I want that, eventually. But I don't have a SO either so it doesn't seem very near.

Disclosure: I realize this a first-world problem but it tears at the very fabric of my being. I'm in constant turmoil over what to do. I'd appreciate any advice.",23Aug2017,2

225,"First a little backstory: 
So my girlfriend got her first job about a month ago, working as a student (We're european). She works in a clothes shop. She was told that she would work for a period of about 14 days and actually worked for about 3 weeks. She was meant to be a stand-in for one of their employees who was vacationing. Her employer was told that she had no prior experience, but took her anyway.

Now on to what happened:

She made a couple of mistakes while working and she's sure that she ""can't do anything right"" because of them:

1. Once she printed the receipt as though the customer payed with a credit card, even though they payed with cash. (Her employer said that she'll handle it and that there's no problem)

2. They have a policy that at the end of the day you put all the profits you made that day into an envelope except for 100€, that stays in the cash register. Once she put all the cash into the envelope by accident. (Her boss picked it up in the morning, put 100€ back into the register and said it was no problem).

I keep telling her that those are normal mistakes, that every human can and probably will make when adjusting to a new job, and that there's nothing to worry about at all, but she's sure she'll get let off, because she's making too many mistakes. (I might be wrong)
So I'm asking you for advice. Do you think she's doing a bad job, or are those just rookie mistakes and she shouldn't worry about them too much.

Thanks for the advice in advance :)",23Aug2017,2

232,"TLDR; stayed at a friend's cousin's house during a road trip to see the solar eclipse, cousin turned out to be a huge creep and fondled me.  How can I move on?

I [26/F] recently went on a road trip with my friend Brian [27/M] to see the total eclipse.  My friend Brian hadn't talked or seen his cousin Don [about 50/M], but arranged for us to camp on their large property.  Don wasn't going to be there that weekend, so his wife greeted us upon arrival and we found there was no reason to be nervous because they were very hospitable.  Don's wife and family that were visiting for the eclipse also, let us stay in their house and fed us instead of camping.

Don arrived after the eclipse finished, as he had business in the next town and we all sat and drank on the porch all night.  Brian, Don, and I were the last ones awake and after Brian fell asleep sitting at the table, I helped put Brian to bed with Don and I and went out on the lower level porch to have a smoke.  Don came down the stairs and we started chatting about his property and he casually said ""Grab your shoes, let's go for a hike."".  I agreed, as it seemed friendly and I was interested in seeing the area at night and shedding my city skin a bit.  At Don's request and my trying to prove myself, I followed Don off the path into the duck blind along the lake shoreline.  It was a beautiful view of the house, but then I felt Don starting to touch me.  It felt like grade school when the awkward boy you agreed to go to the dance with starts to get behind you in attempts to 'grind'.  I quickly moved away and when it continued to happen, I motioned and tried to quickly walk out of the shed.  I slipped and fell in the thorns, falling on the dog beneath me.  The dog yelped and I quickly found my footing, now frantic, got back on the path with the dog doing the same.  Don followed behind me and asked if I was okay.  I assured him I was fine.

I followed 
Don down the path, not wanting to do anything sudden because this person was a stranger,  this place was unfamiliar, it was dark, this person outweighed me, I had no phone and even if I did there was no service, and I was essentially alone.  What felt like forever of me just bullshitting conversation, we were walking back up to the main house.  I walked under the porch light and checked myself for ticks when Don came up and said he would check for me.  Don walked up in front of me and ran his fingers in my hair and then down to my shoulders and started massaging them.  I wasn't looking at him.  I froze.  Writing this now I am completely disappointed in myself for not stopping him.  I like to believe it was the smarter thing to stay calm, but I am sad.  Don then knelled down in front of me and proceeded to run his hands up and down my legs, grazing my buttocks and in between my legs.  Don made a comment saying I was a 'sexy girl'.  I scoffed and walked away.  I went right into the house and into the bed that was made up for me on the ledge near where Brian was now snoring.  The next morning I felt awful and I didn't tell Brian why I was so quiet at breakfast because I was scared of a confrontation.  I told Brian about it on the road and he expressed how sorry he was and I could tell he was very bewildered and angry.  I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore after a few minutes.  

Like I had said, I am writing this with a heavy heart.  Thinking of reasons I am a coward and how I should have bluntly turned down these advances.  Thinking of his wife, thinking I should go back and confront him, thinking of all the other people he has done this to, undoubtedly he has considering I am a stranger.  I think it is noteworthy that I have been sexually abused and I have trouble overcoming moments of confrontation, but I would like advice, thoughts, any help is appreciated.  I don't know who to talk to about this.  I came home and my parents were so worried about me even going on this trip, that I again did not tell them because I am afraid of confrontation.  I am afraid this will be used against me when I want to travel again, I am afraid my father will try to hurt this person. I also hear a voice in my head telling me that I am being dramatic and I really shouldn't be bothered.  Which is right?  Maybe both,, but if it isn't anything to be dramatic over, then my friends and family will tell me so I guess..  I am scared of what they will think of me.  I don't know how I am going to move on from this as I already don't want to be around my boyfriend because I don't want to be touched.  Should I be strong and keep it to myself?

234,"I am married, he's known this from the start.

At first his texts were just innocent conversation. Then he started hinting at something more. I encouraged him to say what he was thinking; my idea was that if he actually came out and said he liked me, I could appropriately shut it down. Well, he took it and ran with it. Started calling me beautiful every chance he got. Invited me to each lunch with him. I told him I was flattered, but that I was married. He said he just wanted a chance to kiss me. I told him I couldn't do that and he needed to stop texting me. He apologized and said okay.

He texted me again the next day, as if nothing had happened. I blocked his number. Then he passed me notes at work. ""Prettier every day"", etc. I unblocked him and told him over text no more notes either. He promised he wouldn't.

He then started following me out to my car every day. The first time was the same day I told him no more notes. I figured he just wanted to talk about it in private. He admitted he's liked me for a long time and he thinks about me every second of every day. He said he'd leave me alone if that's what would make me happy but that he probably wouldn't ever be happy. He said its no problem for me, since I never liked him to start with. I told him I did like him, but that it didn't change anything. I was married and I had no intentions of cheating on my husband.

He started texting me again: ""I like you more every day"" etc. Asking if he can buy me lunch. Asking to meet me somewhere in town. Winking at me every time he came in the office, like it was this secret between us. Saying he wanted to kiss me again. He also started watching which way I turned when leaving work and then would ask me which road I lived on.

I finally told the general manager at work that he was harassing me with texts and following me out to my car, etc. The GM said he would ""handle it"".

The next time me and my coworker were alone in the office after that, he immediately starts questioning why I went to the GM about him. Said if I had just asked him to stop, that he would have stopped. But now the GM is mad at him and he's gonna get in trouble and it's a huge deal.

He then said that he lied to protect me, when the GM came and asked my coworker if I had been texting him too. My coworker said that I hadn't texted him, only he had texted me.

The truth is, I did text him. I even told him I liked him. But I followed that IN THE SAME SENTENCE with a ""it's never gonna happen though."" And I have no problem admitting that to the GM, but my coworker now won't stop begging me not to tell anyone that. Said he'll take the blame and be in trouble for it, but that he doesn't want me to have problems. I told him not to lie to the GM and that I wasn't going to lie either. He kept begging ""please don't tell anyone"" over and over again until another coworker came into the room. Then he also keeps making snide remarks aimed at me in the office, things like ""it's my fault, everything is my fault"" when another coworker brings up a question/problem on something. Very immature.

I'm sooo over this. I'm mad. I did tell him to stop texting. I told him to stop calling me beautiful. I told him he can't buy me lunch and he still kept asking. And now he's acting like it's my fault, that I had no right to complain about him. And that now everyone at work will know about this and be talking.

So, am I wrong here? Is this really my fault or should I not have gone to the GM? I encouraged him to tell me how he felt and I admitted I liked him too. At the beginning, I was flattered that he liked me that much. But I also made it clear we couldn't be more than friends and asked him to stop saying anything outside of the ""friend"" scope and to stop texting altogether. He didn't. But now I feel guilty and a little scared he's gonna retaliate because he's mad and thinks I'm overreacting.",23Aug2017,1

All I know is for him he was devastated he has deep feelings about it and it was terrible for him and for me too..i was mad i couldn't go.

He claims he loves and needs and wants me- it's possible but def not in a healthy way. He's also been doing some really weird things- in interviews- he'll sound like me or write like me- say some phrases that he normally wouldn't. But it's something I would say- like a reference to me..it's really funny. I notice it right away. I also notice in previous interviews and things, he never writes or talks like that.

2. how can you negotiate with them- ive dealt with sociopaths before, but this one he seems to be pretty bad esp being famous he's a narc with greater demands...more narcissistic and more messed up

ive asked him to stop, ease up...to not put me through this- to not do it this much- he just won't stop..its like he does this 24/7...all the time almost...its really crazy...ive tried to negotiate with him, no empathy doesn't care..but he's so deeply upset i didnt go to this event it's like the end of the world...and how he did all this for me and i wasn't there...and he was miserable and the worst day for him...i dont even get the way he thinks anymore...it's too irrational for me...hes obsessed and infatuated but also just a sp who wants to control and a narcissist, and is stalking me and wants to own me and not let me get with other guys but he's married.

No idea how it escalated to this but I am most certain that it's due to my sleep patterns and something else which I will explain in this post.

So I go to sleep around 11:30PM ~ 12:30AM and wake up at around 8AM ~ 10AM , which is a bad habit and I know it but I have no idea how to fix it.. I tried going to sleep earlier like 9PM but all I do is roll around the bed with my eyes closed and still awake, able to hear everything. 

Another thing that could be the issue is that I am mentally and physically tired.. I remember before the summer break that I felt full of energy, excited for summer, full of motivation and confidence, wanting to do so many things. But now, look at me, doing nothing but sit on the computer wishing everyone would leave me alone haha. I just... well, summer changed me really. I feel like during school, I used to train my memory and become smarter and during summer, I sit on the computer playing video games because I literally have nothing else to do which developed me a poor memory and plain stupidity... (Like I can't remember much from what I did the day before) I mean how do I train my memory or how do I keep this ball rolling when school stops? This motivation, this memory, I want to keep that stuff but don't know how. 

During summer i'd play more and more on the computer and slowly ruining my sleeping schedule which resulted me in sleeping debt and now I feel like I am this lazy piece of s[bleep]t that can't do anything :/ I tried getting a part-time job at the start of summer -- Basically this guy promised me a job at his uncle's as a cashier and after I gave him my phone number which was the last day of school and I never heard from him again. 

Last possible issue, I feel like there's no point for no reason...

PS: Sorry for the wall of text, here's a summary:

I think that these link to my problem that I'm having...
-Bad sleeping habits
-Mentally/Physically tired
-Not using my free summer time right
-Feeling like there's no point

I try really hard to improve, I always meet people and put myself out there but it's really hard to improve and I don't know if I will ever be confident with my social skills or if I'll improve enough to make me happy. It really sucks being so awkward. 
Right now not having much of a social life doesn't bother me that much because I'm young and other things in my life keep me interested and happy and I have fun despite not having a social life but I know in the future it will cause me problems. 


I have a physical injury now that might get horrible by old age which is another worry. 

I'm just scared of getting like 65+ because I feel like I'll be completely alone and bored out of my brain. 

What am I supposed to do? Like when I get to 70 do I just off myself or what? I know it's far off but it's going to happen at some stage in my life and I'm the type of person who plans and thinks about my future, and I am terrified for that stage in my life. ",23Aug2017,1
243,"My parents got a divorce almost two years ago. My father used to be the sweetest person and would do anything you ask him for, but he's got issues for as long I can remember:

- Distributing the inheritance after his father died mostly destroyed the relationship between him and his two sisters

- He took care of his mother that suffered from Alzheimers mostly alone and was clearly traumatized 

- He always had little friends

- He's got no hobbies

- Starting from a young age he was always used to be told what to do, but he's got little intrinsic motivation to do ... well anything

- He's got Diabetes and an incurable, agonizing skin disease that put a strain on my parents marriage 

He has gradually become a hermit, takes little care of his appearance and any (social) activities where always initiated by my mother. I do not blame her for the divorce, she couldn't take it anymore (I was a student at this point and didn't grasp what was going on). 

Since the divorce, things have gone downhill even more. He became an alcoholic and doesn't even hide it. He lost a lot of weight, has trouble walking and is generally weak. At social gatherings he often just sits around with his head down low as if he wasn't even there. I mostly meet him for dinner every other week and he's just complaining about everything and everyone. Sometimes I'm not even sure if he cares when I come to see him. 

I've tried to talk him into seeing doctors as well as psychological support but he outright refuses. He's not even 60 yet and is simply a wreck. It's really straining for me as well, because it's only me and a few other family members that still care for him. 

I want to confront him about it and make it clear I'm SERIOUS that I care about him, but that I can't just watch him disintegrating as a human person and the father he used to be. I'm just scared I might drive him to kill himself. He often told me it would all be easier if he was dead and I once found a rope that had a slip knot in it as if he wanted to hang himself (although this could've been lying around in the garage forever for another reason). 

I have no one I could talk to about this and I would really appreciate advice on how I can help him to get back on his feet again. ",23Aug2017,1
244,"Guys I keep on going this way and the worst part about it is the fact that I have no idea how to take action towards this kind of an issue.

Currently I'm discovering myself and what I would like to do as a major life project and concern but the problem is - and thank God I spot it much earlier that - 
I kid you not, I'm 18 years old and I'm so alone in my life as people are when they move to into new city, that wouldn't even be a problem for me that much - but has been almost constant variable in my life so far.
I had acquaintances, I have now only my family (which are just a bit more than acquaintances) - but deep, constant, loving, emotional human connection, friendship, relationship, whatever - never ever in my life. 

And it is funny that if you would look at me in public - I would be the last who you would accuse as socially struggling, isolated person...

And everything seemed to go better now - I love myself for who I am, I'm already confident in terms of work (where I found solace most of the time), I can work hard, be disciplined, driven, ambitious, joyful, laid back, generous, humorous - in summary, all these good things, but man - today I came to a realization that no matter how positive mindset I may have, I'm still just a human and this loneliness is like a disease that just always at the end of the day breaks me down and cripples me, twists my mind and makes a lunatic. 

And I already knew this was a problem I need to start solving as fast as possible - but now I see that this just the only way I can get myself back on feet - to break this isolation, go to the world, and among the people. 
And I don't mean many shallow connections - even the one good, deep and constant friendship is enough for me, the human warmth I never really felt...

That's the only revolution I never conducted in my life - only revolution I need to get me back on track on my mission and life in general.

But till than I just feel so pathetic running around here isolated in my little home...
Like as if I'm not even human engaged in just life and society, my own specie...
Every little anxiety, struggle, fear breaks me and there go all of my endeavors.
I even feel like I just don't know what appropriate life feels like - just living in my own world and fantasies, trying to ""discover myself"".

And I turn to you guys and your advice because I'm just hopeless - this won't be figured out with book, habit, technique or what...
Besides that I think I'm very wrong with people, excellent at meeting them and being ""man for the night"" - but being a good friend, boyfriend or even a son, not at all - like as if was a psychopath without empathy, trust and deeper love towards people. 
Maybe just my scars from the past...
What mindset and approach do I need to adapt? 

And please, I don't want any of those answers like - ""it's only in your head"", ""keep yourself busy &amp; pick a life purpose"", ""pick a skill to master"", ""go to gym"".
Please, I don't want any of that 'murican' self help ideas this time - now it's battling with the common sense and just natural human social need (of a social animal) and basic psychological knowledge of Maslows Hierarchy. 
I have no problem admitting that I'm not this super independent soldier in the field with a clear cut life purpose and no need for anyone's approval - you go fight your nature. 

My social situation is - for long now only with my family members and classmates, both of these areas are ""just good"", but no way I feel less lonely.
And in the past I even had a group of friends like any teenager should have had - but far forgotten (1.5 year) are those people to me, I don't know how am I to them. 
But as I said same with the presence - those connections were ""okay"", don't know if it's worthwhile to be brushing them off. 

Guys, I just want to be fully myself, do my thing - but I'm just too weak for that, this stuff kinda screws you up, when you are and always had been all alone for everything.

I hope I had explained myself clearly. Thanks for any responses and advice.

246,"LONG READ : Right to start off we're going to need a little back story....last year I started college in a well known Irish student city with a housing crisis..my uncle graciously late me stay on his couch until he moved out and gave me his room. This meant I would be living with people not in college (three women 23,24,27) I was 17 but not a problem I'll survive!! The 23 year old was lovely and just a good general house mate who looked out for me eh brought me food shopping each week and the likes and the 24 year old treated me like a little sister ( that's my name in her phone 😂) and was just amazing to me ! The 27 year old at the beginning I felt really close to at the beginning but slowly I began to notice how much of a nut case she is, from the very beginning she hated the 23 year old and tried to get me to hate her as well doing school child games and spreading gossip in the house. Then as I got closer to the 24 year old she started to HATE ME and I mean despise my very being as I was ""stealing her best friend"" I wasn't like I have my own friends she's just being a decent housemate.

It started with things like my stuff going missing and turning up damaged or in different places.then I came home one day to my post opened up and the letters in bin and ripped up. Passive aggressive things happened like she would do everyone's dishes except mine or would make the house tea and not give me a cup just small things that added up ! This went on for months while me and the 24 year old continued to get closer and just generally live together.

It all came crashing down when one night we went out for a house mate bonding night eg let's get really drunk ( I was good at sneaking into places 🙈) when towards the end of the night she started crying to a random guy calling me a whore and a tramp saying she wanted to kill me for stealing her best friend and would he ""take care of me"" like I don't want to die 😂 and then she started having a one sided cat fight with me trying to get me to start fighting....trust me I'm 5ft1 I'm not fighting anyone. After a while the housemates got her to calm down and she left with the guy while we went home...she has since never apologised and continued on like she did before.

I can understand if she feels lonely and wants to hold on to the one good friend she has (she's said before she doesn't talk to anyone from Earlier in her life) but the 24 year old has said multiple times she talks to her because they live together not because they're best friends.

So Reddit I need some advice on how to live the next college year with them as it's not possible to move and I paid rent over the summer (housing crisis and weirdly cheap rent). I'm 18 now so I'm not as limited in my day to day life but I still have to see her everyday !!",23Aug2017,1
247,"     So in early-mid 2016 a girl my age (sophomore in high school) moved in two houses down from me. She seems really cute, and I can only tell this because I saw her outside a few times and from social media. I have never actually met her in person, although my parents met her and her parents before and that's how I got her name (that event happened in November off last year). It is also to be noted that she doesn't go to the same school as me and she is new to the area (she moved in from a different country).
     So last January I got the guts to request to follow her on Instagram. From there, I liked a few of her posts (new ones) over the course of a few months, and time flew by. In February I messaged her on Instagram about her school (in which I was asking questions about it  because I am looking to go to a new school and her school was on my considerations). It went...ok. She sounded very dull and monotone in her texts. It wasn't that bad but I told her I was her neighbor so at least it cleared things up as to who I was. For my junior year, it looks like I actually will be attending the same school she is at, as, the Christian private school I am at is too small and there is little course variety and after-school activities. One worry that I have is that she will think that I am following her on to junior year (which is next year), and that would not be good, and it most certainly is not the truth. But, for now, more with the story.
     I added her on Snapchat a couple of months ago and she added me back. She would view my stories and I would view hers. I then tried to talk to her. I said ""Hey"", and the next day she responded with ""hiii"" and that afternoon I said ""Wyd"". This was the worst mistake I have done in my opinion with her. She ignored that but I could see that it was opened by her.  A month or two later (this is now May or June) her friend added me on Snapchat as well. I thought this was interesting, but I did not take it as such a big deal.
     So, two weeks ago I decided that the long wait was over: I  messaged her again. This time it went well I think. I said at first ""Hey hows your day going"" which you might think is odd and not the smartest thing to say, but she responded a couple hours later by saying... well, what she was doing. Over the course of four days I talked with her, but she would take a ridiculous amount of time to respond. But she still felt comfortable talking to me I could tell, and I eventually started talking about the place that she came from and I started talking about my ""life"" story. On the second day we talked, we ended the really long conversation that lasted four days off with me saying ""hey maybe when you get back from *where  she was on vacation* we could hangout at the pool or something idk"". She said ""Oh well my friends are trying to make plans lol rip"". I then did something I would say that was the second worst mistake I did, and I said ""Oh ok I understand, I have like two friends and they are all lazy so I'm always open lol"" I know that this was super terrible and a bad thing to say about myself and she probably thinks that I am desperate. So shortly after, before she even opened it, I said ""I am at such a small school so it's good to know that there is someone in my neighborhood my age so just let me know when you want to hang"". Literally two days later she opened it, and at  1:30 am she responded with ""Oh ok ill let u know"" And I said ""Ok cool"".
     Two weeks have passed since then. She likes my Instagram photos and views my stories (which I guess isn't such a big deal). The question is: What do I do now? Do I sit and wait for her to message me first? Or do  I try to talk to her again?


ANY help is appreciated. Thank you!

249,"This is quiet peculiar situation. To explain it properly, I need to tell you the whole (Love?)story, so sit back and enjoy.

Some time ago I have joined the organized adventurous hike in the mountains. We were competing against other teams but also against the nature. It was in the mountains, with the steep climbs and also unfavorable weather conditions, that have hit us during the night.

We were group of men and women, who mostly did not know each other before, as we grouped up on the internet. My girlfriend is rather ""city"" kind of person, so did not join me. We are dating over a year and now she is about to move in with me.

Our group of hikers was competitive, we slept only short time and moved quickly. Helping each other overcomming obstacles, bandaging injuries and going through all the hardship together. You can imagine that it was quiet intense experience, one of those that creates strangely strong bonds between the people.

Shortly after we set of we started to getting to know each other. And there she was, pretty young girl, smiling at me as we chat. It turned out that she is about to start studying university, which I am about to finish. As we talked, it turned out that we have a lot in common and in just few seconds I have noticed it.

The way she smiled at me, eyes wide open, playing with her hair... I am no newbie to the flirtation so I saw the signs as clearly as if she was holding a banner shouting: ""I LIKE YOU YOU FOOL!"". She never missed an opportunity to touch me and here is the deal, me neither. Btw. she new I am in the relationship.

To make things more complicated, I became sick. The fever that was torturing me week ago, was comming back. I want to point out that this is wasn´t something that could stop me or slow me down, I just started to feel miserable. But she was always close, cheering me up, until we made it to the overnight camp.

As we entered the camp, we quickly discussed who will sleep where and most importantly, with whom. By the ""sleep"" I mean precisly four hours, before we were to move on. Most of us decided to use the tents. Before I was able to say anything, she looked at me and announced to others, that she will sleep in the nearby wooden shack, as it seem that it will be stormy night (it turned out she was right eventually).

At the moment I knew I am on the crossroads. For a few minutes I pretended to ponder if the tent will be enough for the night, while in reality my heart was racing and mind, slightly numbed by the fever, trying to figure out what to do. And then I told my team mates, that it might be better in the shack and head my way to her.
She has already prepared her sleeping bag and removed shoes, sitting there in the weak light of the torch. I don´t remember exactly the words we exchanged, they were meaningless, until she leaned to me and asked: ""do you know what I want?"". I hesitated only two beets of the heart and then kissed her.

She looked like a gentle girl but it turned out she had a lot of fire inside, as she kissed me wildly. My hands began to explore her body, her head, then back and as I moved to the front she asked me: ""do you want to touch them?"" I just noded and she began to undress. Her elegant, almost cat-like moves in the light of the torch made me burn with lust. And then I touched her...

We slept about two hours, before we had to continue our hike. Suddenly she talked less, but smiled shiley at me now and then. It was difficult to say goodbye, but we couldn´t let others to find out what happened.

Thank you for your patience to read all this through. Now you know the story. I have a girfriend, we are about to move together and now there is this girl, living not very far actually. With the girlfriend we have had a great times, but due to the long distance, our relationship deteriorated slightly. We are hoping to make our relationship great again and the moving is already happening. We are renting a small apartment.

The question (yes there is an actual question): I want to give my current relationship a chance it deserves, wait few months to see, if we will start clicking again. She is a great girl and we went through something together.
But I am 100 % sure, that if I was not in this relationship, I would love to continue my life with the girl from the hike. We have a lot in common and the spark is just there. We are in contact, she seem to have some feelings for me, but understands that I am in the relationship. I told her how I feel, exactly as I explaind here.

I would like to keep in touch with her, but keep the distance this time. She says she is totally fine with it, but I am no fool, in her position she will promise anything not to lose me.

What should I do? I do not want to repell her completely, but I am affraid of the frustration that might grow in her, by being in touch with me but not as close as she wants.",23Aug2017,1
250,"So, me and my friends have a group chat and today I posted asking if anyone wanted to go out tomorrow. One of my friends, let's call her Sarah, replied that she was working tomorrow, but she'd be free Friday. I was like 'Cool, let's go out then.' Another friend, let's say Rachel, then messaged 'I'm not free Friday, but I am free Thursday.' Sarah then said 'just go out when the most people are free.' Then a 3rd person, say Jenny, said 'I'm free both days.' I'm closest to Sarah so I messaged Rachel and Jenny in a private message saying 'hey, let's hang out Thursday', since I'd be pretty comfortable just going out one-on-one with Sarah on Friday, thinking that would make everyone happy. Rachel agreed but Jenny then said that Friday would actually be better for her. So does this now mean that I have to go out with Sarah and Jenny on Friday, as well as just one-on-one with Rachel tomorrow. Rachel and I are not that close, and I'm really not a fan of this idea, but I feel like I can't now cancel without looking like a dick.

255,"I live in a manor home with one neighbor across a stair landing from me. They only moved in about two months ago, but have this dog... 

I believe it is a boxer or boxer mix, female, young but not a puppy. This dog has lunged at me twice in the last two weeks. Both times I opened my door to leave and the dog charged into my apartment. The owner, who seems to have very little control of the dog, only managed to stop the dog on its retractable leash when it was less than 6 inches away from me. 

I've grown up around many dogs and this was definitely NOT a friendly ""I want to sniff/lick/jump on you"" approach. It was so fast and aggressive I froze in place, totally shocked both times. 

Less concerning, but also notable, is that the dog barks quite a bit trough the day. The couple also plays crazy loud music into the night on weekends, while leaving the rug under the outer common door so their friends can come and go. SO MANY FRUSTRATIONS.

258,"Lots of text incoming.

My biggest problem is that I've never really had a plan.

This problem is exacerbated in a way by the following issues:

Essentially, I have no education. 
Because i have no education, I have no tangible or marketable skills.

I was extremely dependent on my father financially, and he passed away this year, so I'm now 27 and living with my stepmother.

I'm about 20,000 in debt because I cosigned (like an idiot) on about 3 car loans.

I was being garnished for my student loans that I took out. (I never went to school, another idiotic/bad choice) Fortunately, I got my payment plan down to 40 a month.

I'm currently paying 400 dollars a month for a vehicle i cant realistically afford since this was another vehicle i cosigned on.

I've worked the same shitty security guard job for going on 7 years and am still making less than 10 dollars an hour.

I've thought about ripping the bandaid off so to speak and becoming homeless/a sort of vagabond in California. I currently live in Ohio.

I know that sounds insane, but I've often thought that being homeless or a ""wanderer"" of sorts in California would be much more liberating or free than serving as a serf to banks for the next 5-10 years. I have no family left, so social or emotional networking isn't an issue for me, for better or worse. And I've always wanted to grow a beard.

My current ""plan"" is to file bankruptcy, but it's unrealistic since I have the financial responsibility of a 4 year old and my lawyer wants 1200 dollars.

The only pros in my situation are that I'm abstinent from drugs/alcohol and I'm of reasonable intelligence. Also, I don't have a negative military record since it was considered an ELS. 

The big negative is that I'm pretty sure I have mental health issues since my mother was a bipolar schizophrenic. 
I don't have hard evidence for this other than going AWOL in boot camp (probably the worst mistake of my life even considering I wanted to join the Air Force but I was pressured to join the National Guard) due to a combination of homesickness and just saying ""fuck it"" ; and being anti-social, which can probably be said of 90% of my generation. That and contemplating suicide relatively seriously. The only thing that keeps me alive is the fact that I have a cat.

He is usually really mellow and even tempered but today he was having a really bad, stressful day. During his ranting he told me that the reason he's so stressed is the last employee whose position I took called him and begged for his job back. He told me he really wanted him back but he couldn't afford to hire him. Then he basically told me I should be grateful for my job and for him. I don't know if he intended it the way it sounded but It made me feel really awkward. I feel like he resents me in some way, like he'd rather have the other person come back than keep me.

I've seriously reevaluated my life, I was incredibly ambitious, but I don't even know what I'm doing now. As a music major? Who's even going to listen to what I write when composers are a dime a dozen and no one even likes this kind of music? Why am I having to suffer like this, can't I have any enjoyment. I don't know. I enjoyed being the martyr.

I'm so anxious I can't even do basic things an adult needs to do like get a haircut (I have to have a relative do it) or go the dentist (I haven't been in 4 years.) 

I just want it to be over. I've had enough of pushing through, attending therapy that doesn't help and I can't figure a damn thing out anyway. My symptoms keep getting worse, I have loud tinnitus that has destroyed my enjoyment of music - my only source of pleasure.

I don't have any kind of freedom with what I wanna take, these classes assign so much pointless homework, and I just want some time to do what I like to do (math, physics, computer science, etc.). I hate all the pressure and expectations too, like if I don't get perfect on all my essays and stuff then I can't even get into a good college for what I like to do. And today I had English and already have an essay that I don't even know how to begin to write, due Friday, and I can't write for crap. It takes me forever, even when I just ""let go"" and freewrite.

By the end of the summer, I called her out on it being inappropriate, cause she was texting him all the time,  talking to me about nothing more than him, using him being nice to her as a way to get at me about what she perceives me as not doing... so, she talks to him, and somehow he ends up confessing his ""best case scenario"" would be her getting a divorce and eventually getting together with him. This being inappropriate, I told her she shouldn't talk to him or hang out with him anymore, and she told him no contact at all for two weeks. Two weeks later,  she said she was pretty sure he just wanted to be friends and she should still be allowed contact.  I told her I don't trust him but I trusted her, so I wouldn't go telling her who and who not to be friends with. Several weeks later, after my wife has had several conversations with me about separating due to issues we had, she confessed she had been developing feelings for him, this was a full blown emotional affair, etc. 

Shortly after that, I went into a spiral, alternating between thinking Everything was my fault for being a bad husband (I have aspergers, and clinical depression, so her accusations of emotional distance from me I accepted on faith) and being super mad about it all and questioning all her blame placing leading up to this- namely,  I realized that all the things she had been complaining I didn't do- asking her on dates, buying her gifts, etc, were all things i had tried doing that she would get mad at me for ""doing them wrong "" and claim ""didn't count"", leading me to feel helpless about actually pleasing her. I realized I had felt this way for years. That's why I was so insecure about what date I planned or if I could cook dinner or anything. If I did something ""the wrong way"" she would get mad at me, but I never knew what would make something be the wrong way. Like,  I gave her flowers within a week of having a fight to say ""I love you"" but since I didn't leave a note, she didn't know whether they were for that or to say ""I'm sorry "". Yelling. Or I plan a date, but I ask her if she liked my plan and I let her suggest something different.  It didn't count because I let her change it. I never plan dates. Then it got dark and I realized she was doing other things, like complaining to me I didn't like her or care about things,  and when I objected,  I was ""making it about me"". Or years ago we tried poly Amory with a friend of mine who suggested it to me with her because she thought I was too depressed to address her needs, and he started trying to convince me not to go to therapy, and she congratulated me on making the right choice. When i told her it was hurtful, I felt pressured and I wanted them to stop,  she berated me for ""making her a cheater "", and after it all ended, she told me it was such a bad idea and she was mad at me for letting her do it and not fighting for her and my family. With that in the past, she is telling me I don't defend her when she needs it, and she would never do that to me (which I feel joining in when my friend tries to steal my life, as it became clear he was doing calls the lie to that)...

Anyway, over the course of this,  we did separate, I had to live on a couch because the room I am renting doesn't open up til the end of the month, and I came back because she was acting borderline suicidal and i was worried about her and our kids. I will be moving out again to this room in a friends house when it is availabke, and driving back every morning to take care of getting the kids to school, etc. We already have days divided, and she keeps waffling on whether she can forgive me for all I have done... Like, she will want to have a conversation where she tells me I am too good foe her she is a horrible cheater, etc, but not until she is done telling me how.mad she is at me for emotionally neglecting her, not defending her from other peopke saying things, not defending her from herself...

So anyway, relationship wise, I know what to do. I need to go to therapy, work on getting better, take care of the kids, be separated, try to ignore her and all that.  Be okay whether or not she tries to make it better. Problem for me is, how can I be Okay? She cheated on me, I still feel like I made it happen a lot of the time, I feel like I might be being gaslighted(I apologized for not noticing her post partum three times, and the third time, she thanked me for finally apologizing, since I hadnt?!). Some of her behavior seems abusive, like yelling at me for absolutely nothing which has only gotten worse since she confessed to her bad behavior. I feel terrible about myself,  what is less manly than a man who is a victim who cant meet his wife's needs? I know that isn't true,  and I would never say it to anyone else other than me, but I feel terrible about myself and I can't take the step to be okay with me now.

My wife had an emotional affair and I'm an emotional wreck. I know I can't make her do anything, so I'm done trying, but what can I do to cope with my feelings?",23Aug2017,5
271,"I (20m) want to be done with gaming, maybe not permanently but in large part I want video games out of my life. I feel like they are the root of a lot of my issues and I use them as a place to hide from my problems. I don't want to become someone who lives for TV though, and I'm worried if I stop gaming I'll just start binge watching shows left and right.

What can I do to make sure I don't just give in and play games? Should I do something dramatic like sell my computer? I still have friends I made through gaming I wouldn't wanna lose, and I'd love to be balanced enough that I could handle gaming on occasion. 

Right now I'm unemployed as I'm in the middle of negotiating a complicated move to a new city, part of which is finding a new job (the timing of all of this isn't ideal, I'm aware, I found a job before quitting my old one, but a lot of complications got in the way, that's not the point of this post). It'll be about a month until the move, and I'll start work immediately so that will help.

Ill start college again next spring, just a few classes, things that interest me or sound like they might in the hopes I can find a passion or something I'd be interested in exploring as a career option. 

And I'd rather not throw myself into books either. I know Im making it hard to suggest things, sorry about that. This post is a hot mess, I hope it still makes some sense and all, thanks!",23Aug2017,2
272,"My dad has contacted me on Facebook, I guess he wants to become a part of my life again. I am 32 and I have never had a normal relationship with him because of his alcoholism and his violence towards my mom (at least as I am told I was too young to remember that when she left him.)  I have become content with the way our relationship is but I do not want to upset him because I feel like being callous by telling him that I don't really care either way.  any advice on how to approach this so I don't crush him. Thanks ",23Aug2017,7

274,"I'm in high school and am a guy, and the year just began. I normally hang out with a small group of friends and my best friend of many years, but I've realized my friends are all assholes who don't care about or support me, and my best friend is the worst out of all of them.

Friends are supposed to be supportive and helpful, right? They're supposed to cheer you up when you feel like shit, right? Every time I spend time with my friends, I leave feeling as though no one likes me. When they're not belittling me, they belittle other people and I'm not ok with that. I've noticed that all of this is exacerbated by the presence of my best friend, Jim (not real name). All of the other friends seem kind and cool when on their own, but together or with Jim they all like to shit on me. When I'm with Jim by himself, he lies to me and tells me about all the people that don't like me and why. When I tell him to stop, he acts offended like he was just making a joke and calls me a pussy. It really is a toxic situation. He loves to play with my emotions and make me feel like shit, seemingly for his own entertainment. The obvious answer would be to stop hanging out with him, but I sit with him at lunch and don't know anyone else. I'm very socially awkward, and not good at making friends. I honestly don't know what to do. Our families are close so I can't just cut all contact, and I really just want to have 1 or 2 close friends who can support me and spend time with me. 

Can anyone help me remove these toxic people from my life, or find new friends?

275,"My half sister and I haven't always been close because I've had problems with my dad, who is our shared parent. Her mom and our dad were together for 10 years &amp; the issues with my dad and I began after they split. So her mom was a very positive person in my life and I have a lot of good memories with her. My sister is now 11, I'm now 19. Yesterday morning, my sister went into her mom's room to wake her up and she found her on the floor. She was obviously hysterical when she couldn't wake her mom, but hasn't talked about it much. She is acting normal but you can tell that she keeps thinking about it. She stares off into space for long periods of time. She won't talk about it, the only thing I've heard her say is that ""her skin looked cold, like it did in the movies"". My heart is fucking BREAKING for her. And now she has no one left but my shitty dad and his trashy girlfriend. What can I do for her? What do I say? This is also the closest loss that I've ever had so I don't have experience with grief",23Aug2017,67
276,"I'm not sure if I'm too young for this subreddit (16) but I can't really tell anyone else so here goes-I'm an absolutely terrible person and a bad friend and I've even comprised a list of why this is so: 

* Complain about problems 
* Complain about problems to other people
* Arrogant 
* Talk about myself too much 
* Awkward 
* Rely on friends too much 
* Complain about being lonely when there are some people 
* can't handle being alone which is really pathetic 
* Don't listen to advice 
* can't form friendships because I'm only interested in people making connections with me instead of vice versa 
* Take my parents for granted 
* boring 
* Insecure 
* I have a hard time reflecting on myself 
* bad at helping people 
* Don't help enough people 
* Deep down I think I'm better than others which is horrible 
* anxious 
* I should be quieter 
* I let my own problems ruin friendships 
* Petty 
* Jealous 
* wasteful 
* can't take criticism 
* love hearing people talk about me 
* Not a good friend 
* Judgmental 
* easily offended but I always make fun of people 

My parents think I'm this great kid but really I'm a huge asshole and what little amount of friends I have always get mad at me because of my dickishness. I wish I could alienate all of them but I don't even have the balls for that. Not sure what else to do anymore or what advice anyone could provide. Really I needed to vent out to the world that I'm despicable.

277,"So my little brother is the type of cringy kid that literally plays only minecraft and roblox, mostly the op prison servers in minecraft and prison break, assassin, and murder mystery on roblox. He doesn't play as much roblox anymore, though, so now it's almost purely that one op prison server in minecraft.

Now for the actual question.

So, I would really like for him to have more variety, because hours of minecraft and no other games is pretty unhealthy in my opinion, and this is coming from a guy that plays games a lot. Do you guys have any suggestions on a game that he might like, so I can try to surprise him with it?",23Aug2017,1
