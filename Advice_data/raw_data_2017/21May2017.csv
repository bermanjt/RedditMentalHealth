3,"Hello everyone,

I'm not quite sure how to write this out, so it might be all over the place and take some deciphering on your part to understand, but here it goes;

My niece is 17, in the past 2 years she has become a handful for her family. Just recently, her mother told me that;

she jumped out of the car while it was moving because she didn't want to go to her dads
 she wakes up at 10 or 11 to go to school, WHEN she goes to school
 she's failing every class she has
they've had arguments that turn into physical fights 
she does whatever she wants
leaves school or doesn't go at all
I travel for work so she's now sneaking into my house while I'm not there
she is extremely manipulative, lies about anything and everything to try and get her way, plays the victim always
and now she has a boyfriend, which she apparently is sneaking into my house now

My sister doesn't know what to do to help her, I was hoping someone here did.

I've talked to my sister about the problems they're having with her but my sister seems completely overwhelmed and out of her league. She has no clue what to do (I'm sad to say it but I don't believe she's a very good parent) 

I was hoping there was someone here who could suggest third party help or programs that. Someone with authority that could intervene because I don't see this being resolved by them on their own.

My concern is that her parents aren't very knowledgeable on what options exist or just don't know how to seek them out ( that's why I'm here, I don't even have a cat) and if that is the case, who knows how bad this will get or where it could lead.

We live in Los Angeles, California

Up above is the original post I wrote a short time ago about how I met and fell in love with the girl who is my best friend and who also lives in another country to me. 
If you want to read it you can. 

I'm here because I have finally gotten my answer on weather she cares for me at all and that answer is a no. See I recently just found out from her that she is most definitely ""Homoromantic"". I have been in love with her for the past few years and as of writing this I am ending my plans to surprise her for her birthday with a trip to see her and taking for a road trip in her own country. 

I have no ill feeling towards her and I'm actually ecstatic that she has found someone she is actually in love with cause even tho I can't be with her... I still want her to live a happy life. 

I must stop beating around the bush now and ask the question I have asked in the heading.

How do I cope with this heartbreak while keeping her in my life?

Now I'm keeping her because I am her best friend and I benefit her life. My emotional pain aside, I will stay in contact with her so that I can keep her happy. I'm a person that is loyal to the bitter end.

Write now I'm writing this with my heart being the one thing I feel the most. It feels like someone has a finger on it and is pressing hard on it. I'm one a short time away from a full breakdown but I'm waiting till I am alone to do so


So, please if anyone has any advice on how I can move on and somehow keep her than lay the advise down. I need help

13,"Here's the deal: I'm currently a freshmen, and my crush (let's just call her... Sarah) is in two of my classes. I've liked her for a while and we are friendly (I wouldn't say good friends but we're on a first name/I'm her backup ""hangout choice"" if none of her main friends are around.). I'm 95% sure that at one point she had a crush on me and maybe she still does I don't know. Anyway, when we traded yearbooks to sign each others, she wrote ""all of my love, (insert name)(insert phone number number) &lt;3"". She kind of avoided eye contact and didn't talk to me the rest of the day after that (I didn't attempt to talk to her). 

Here is some backstory: she is going to a boarding school in Boston next year and it is unlikely I'll see her again unless I get in contact with her. She has a lot of friends whereas I just moved schools so I don't have as many and am a bit more foreign. She may have a boyfriend, she mentioned him at one point but I haven't heard his name or seen anyone acting ""boyfriend-ingly"" with her (although she does have a lot of friends that are guys). School year has ended for me and for all I know (as I said before) I most likely won't see her again.

The advice I'm asking is if I should text her or not. I'm not saying I'm going to ask her out, I'm just wondering if it would be a good idea to just do a little ""hey whatsup"" DM's thing.

20,"Forewarning, this is pretty whiny and long. TLDR at the end. 

I'm currently in my mid-twenties and I'm still living with my parents, unemployed, with no degree, a virgin, and a lack of direction in life.  I am socially awkward and ugly as well, and trying to make a good impression on anyone is virtually impossible.

In High school, I had absolutely abysmal grades since I didn't study and didn't really pay attention in class.  I wasn't a delinquent but I was super socially awkward and shy.  Actually, I still am. 

When I graduated from HS (albeit with really bad grades and I couldn't get into any university), I went right into a social science field to get a diploma from a local college but didn't know what to do with it.  I spent a couple of years just working some odd jobs but decided I needed a degree so I opted to get a business degree since it was the most versatile one.  

Not because I liked it or was good at it, but because I just felt like I had to.  I didn't want to work at a retail job anymore.  The problem was that I failed a couple of key courses there which was completely my fault.  But I was hesitant about going back and completing it since I barely got through the first year.

So instead I'm now prepping to get into a trades program (need some high school credits for math that I didn't do before) after deliberating with a therapist about my situation. 

But I still feel like I won't do well in that program either and I have no faith that I can pass it because of my history.  That and the fact that even at my age, I'm still socially awkward, and I can't relate to any of my peers or friends.  Because of this, I have also been secluding myself from my friends and meeting anyone new and been staying mostly indoors by myself.  

I feel like even I'll never be normal.  Even if I get a trade diploma I'd still be older than most people there, and I'll have less experience than most people my age.  I guess the same can be applied to my dating life.  

I've been thinking about just ending my life as no one would really care and honestly it seems that society would be better off without someone like me.   I try to think about my family and my therapist's words and continue on but my thoughts seem perfectly logical/reasonable to me.

Any advice on my situation?

23,"My dad has been emotionally abusive for most of my life to me and my family. Most recently he called me and yelled for 9 minutes straight and I couldn't get a word in edgewise, not that I would because it just makes it worse. It set me backwards quite a bit in my recovery from severe depression. I spent all night crying and was able to use tips from therapy to work through suicidal ideation. I moved out of the house 2.5 years ago but my family (mom, 2 brothers) still live at home. He text me earlier today and asked if I would have time on Monday to meet with him and the rest of the family at the house so he could talk to us. I know it's going to be more of the same emotional abuse and I don't think I could handle it. But I also feel guilty for leaving my mom and brothers to deal with it and I won't be able to avoid him.

24,"Hi, I'll try and keep this as brief as possible. 


Context about me: female, 5'2, 105 pounds. I'm on my feet all day at my job and my store is in a not so nice area. It's a very nice building and a cannabis dispensary so I feel pretty safe working there. 


Car; Pros: 10 minute commute, safest option, easy to see friends and siblings, peace of mind. Cons; EXPENSIVE! I have a 2005 Honda hybrid and I am always having to take it in. Add gas and insurance on top of that and that's a lot of my minimum wage income out the door. 


Bike; Pros: No need to buy fuel, insurance, or expensive repairs. Good for your health, builds character. Cons: weather, ghetto neighborhoods, hills, on my feet all day at work as it is. Good for short distances only. Much temptation to use Uber. 


Bus/Train; Pros: No need to buy fuel, insurance, or repairs at all. Cons: 40 minute commute plus walking, ghetto neighborhoods and shady people (my store has been open 1 month and we've already had a knife fight in the parking lot, someone was stabbed to death in the taco bell across the street once, hooker motel next to us, that kind of area). Late bus means late to work. 3 hour commute to see siblings and a few friends. Germs. Much temptation to use Uber.

27,"My wife and I were supposed to be in my friend's wedding. We were all good friends and hung out. Her fiance was always a dick(and actually had a felony for doctor shopping and is still a druggy), but one day he really crossed the line.

28,"Hi everyone! I've had a rough day with my feelings on this, so I'm posting here. I'm only 17 and I've been struggling with my social life for around four years now. This may be long, but I feel like I need to explain some things, so people don't just assume I'm a bad person and that's why I don't have any friends. 

I was born and raised in the Midwest, but I moved out west in 2013, after starting Freshman year of high school. Middle school for me was great in the first two years, but 8th grade is where things startes to take a turn. 

As I stated, a majority of middle school was great. I had a lot of friends and did things all the time. Once 8th grade came around, though, I lost all of my friends. I was close friends with people in the large group of friends I had that weren't particularly liked. Not for bad reasons, though. One was just super quiet and nerdy and the other could be super obnoxious. They weren't bad people, though. At the beginning of 8th grade a bunch of people in my friend group took their separate ways to become friends with more popular people. I know this is stupid middle school drama, but it's relevant to my problem. 

After that happened, there were only about four of us. Around this time, I got fairly depressed and super insecure. I didn't understand why people left me, but I was too quiet and shy to speak up, so I guess they must've assumed that I didn't care. The rest of 8th grade was extremely rough for me. I felt like I had nobody left. The other people I were friends with happened to be best friends with each other, so they were a lot closer than with me. I ocasssionaly saw people I was previously friends with, but they pretty much had new friends. 

By the end of 8th grade, I had maybe three ""friends"". I made an extremely awful choice and became close with someone who I shouldn't have. They made very poor decisions and were very disliked by lots of people, including me, but she was the only one willing to be close with me anymore. 

Fast forward to freshman year and I became homeschooled. I was even more depressed, since I had cut everyone I went to school with out of my life. About halfway through freshman year, I moved out west. It took me around two years before I finally built up the courage to move past my bad social anxiety and volunteer someone specifically for teens. 

I still currently volunteer there and I do enjoy it, but I still don't have any close friends. I have a boyfriend, who is great don't get me wrong, but I need friends. I have people from my place of volunteering that I do and can talk to, but I don't have any close friends I can actually go out with and be a typical teenage girl with. Since I've moved out west, I've gone out with friends twice maybe. Twice in three years! I do go to my place of volunteer 3-4 times a week, but it's just not the same as going to a concert, movie, etc. with friends. I've tried making close friends at my place of volunteer, but everyone I know is either moving away for college or already has a friend group within the place, so they don't seem interested in wanting anyone else. 

Along with this, I've had a few jobs. I really struggle, though, because I've yet to find a job where I can meet other people around my age. Everyone I've worked with is older than me. I'm currently looking for a job, but it's becoming difficult. 

As far as college, I'm going to community college for my first two years and then to university to finish up. I haven't made a final decision as to where I'm going and when exactly I'll start, though. 

I'm just stuck. I've been feeling so lonely and bored with life for years now. I still am connected with old friends on social media and I see them having so much fun and being with friends all the time. It makes me feel horrible. How can I fix this? I feel like I've tried everything I can, but nothing is working. 


TL;DR: I've been having a hard time making friends for four years now. I've become extremely lonely. I've tried everything, it feels like, but I've yet to be able to make close friends. I just want to have friends like I feel like every other teenage girl my age does. What can I do? ",21May2017,5
29,"Today I was fast accused of stealing $25 from work. I do not work for a corporation, but a private owned restaraunt - it's a rather large one. I was questioned by the manager at the time as well. 

When I first got there he asked when the last time I worked was. I told him it was Wednesday for a corporate event. He asked when I opened if there was any tips from the night before and I said no. And he said ""do you know there are cameras recording at all times? Let me show you this"". And I said ""yes I know"". So he showed a short clip where I was reaching for a jar with, at the time I believe two $1 bills or $1 bill and a $10 (either way it would not have equaled or looked like $25) above the beer dispenser taps. And I explained ""yeah that was my personal money. The other bartenders explainined sometimes you put a dollar or two in there and to kind of get the tips started"". I explained if he rewound the video and watched when I first opened the bar he would see that the I originally held an empty jar and he would see me put my own money in, and probably clean the jar because it was dirty and gross. 

He said okay, just go do what you need to and I'll come and find you. So I said okay. I went upstairs and about 5 minutes later he pulled me and the bartender I worked with that day to the side, along with another manager and asked how much we made that day. And I said ""we made $5 a piece, $10 total"" and he said okay follow me. So we went down in the kitchen and he handed me the two silver trays for the Robinson's party and said ""follow me again"". So we went outside and he stated ""I'm not firing you for stealing but I'm not going to use you anymore."" And it shocked me because I wasn't expecting that. 

I said ""you really think I stole it?"" And I forgot what he said because at that point I was starting to tear up and I was trying not to start crying. I asked him if he had watched the whole video and he kind of didn't really answer, and I said ""Jack I want to sit down with you and look at the video"" and he just kind of shook his head and started walking away and said ""you should have been honest with me the first time."" And I said ""Jack look I'm sorry I'm getting upset but I really do like this job, and I want to talk about this, I didn't steal that money."" And he goes ""I'm making a judgement call, just get out of here."" And I said ""why can't I sit down and watch that recorded video from that day?"" And he goes ""OH SO NOW YOU WANT TO BE HONEST??"" And I said ""I never lied, I just don't see why I can't watch the video, you will clearly see I did not steal any money"" and he just says ""just GET OUT OF HERE"" and let the door slam behind him. 

The jar was even close enough to the camera that if you took a screenshot or just zoomed in, you would clearly see they were not $20 bills at all. And the clip he kept playing wasnt even me taking any cash, it was like two hours after I had been there, and I was moving the tip jar back down onto a different counter. But he stopped it after that. It seemed like the only portion he could show me was me trying to take the tip jar down, and that was it. I don't think he watched any of the video before that clip or afterwards at all. 

I thought the entire situation was completely unprofessional. Like if was standing there saying I'm willing to watch the video you have because I know I did not steal the money, how are you going to say no and blatantly be rude to me. Why am I not allowed to see this ""said evidence"". And I hate the fact that everyone there thinks I'm a thief now. He put my reputation on the line - and I am not okay with that at all. 

I really think I just got the short end of the stick, and I truly have no idea why.

TDLR; Fired from job because I ""stole"" money, but I'm not allowed to watch the entire video that have of me ""stealing the money"". ",21May2017,1
30,"Hello!

First reddit post so please go easy on me.

TL;DR: 16 yr old girl harassed by 23/24 yr old man for nude pictures, eventually sent partially nude (boobs+stomach). Emotionally abusive and controlling, but this happened 5 years ago. Found contact info, do I leave it alone or is the right thing to do to take action?

When I was a sophomore/junior in high school I started ""dating"" a guy I met online. He was 23/24 and I was 16 during this time. It was my first ""serious"" relationship, and I hadn't really been hit on a lot (reclusive/all girls school/normal awkward teenager) so I knew nothing about how I should be treated. He constantly harassed me for nude pics and made me feel wretched when I said no. Luckily I never sent any fully nude, but eventually I gave in sending pictures only showing stomach/boobs. He would coerce me into having phone sex (in my parent's basement, so awkward ugh) and would send me crude pictures all the time. (I won't lie I wasn't always an unwilling participant in this, but he also didn't take no for an answer). He was emotionally abusive, always giving me shit when I went out with friends that included guys and insisting we stay on the phone all night so he knew what I was doing. I don't want to give too much detail but looking back I was such a fool.

I was cleaning up and came across his information again (he had sent me some gifts so it has his return address) as well as his work information (location, contact info but it was just his words so he could've lied on this point).

My conundrum is this happened 5 years ago so it might be irrelevant, maybe he's changed and I don't want to stir up trouble if it's uncalled for. But the thing that keeps echoing in my head is, if he did this to me, he might've done this to other girls. And he could've done worse, I don't know.

What do you guys think? I need unbiased opinions.

50,"So my boyfriend [22yr] had social media accounts just to look at very sexual accounts and all of that. When I [21yr] found this out, I told him how i felt about these accounts, how I felt hurt by it and all, so he deleted the apps the first time. And then I come to find out a couple of weeks later that he had redownloaded the apps and was looking at them on the daily basis again. So again I told him how I understand that he would look at porn and how i do it sometimes too, but the reason why the accounts hurt me so much was that they have become such a part of his daily life that he would go and check on them without thinking about it. Again his response was to delete the apps and said that he loves me and would not risk of losing me and all of that even if it meant deleting the apps. Today I found out that he has redownloaded the apps and back at it stronger than ever. I don't know how to feel about the whole topic again. I mean I feel hurt not just because it's becoming a daily thing for him, but he just going back to it and acting like nothing had happened. I don't know what to do anymore. Just wondering your guys opinion on the whole thing and sorry for the long post.


UPDATE: He said that the reason why the apps are back is because his system got a update and that update sometimes bring stuff back.  I didn't know if that's true or not,  even if that's true,  how come he didn't deleted right as soon as the update was done because he knows how I feel about them.

I also do have crushes, but so far no mutual interest (I either ask or something happens to make it absolutely obvious. Last one started hooking up with my old best friend). However, I'm extremely shy, sort of unattractive, awkward, and pickier than I should be--I just can't develop interest or feelings often.

-He plays shitty garage band music all day and night long with his crew.

-He has loud parties that never quiet down. He invites a ton of people over, they all get shitfaced, then get in their cars.

-His dad is a retired cop. If the cops get called on him, COPS DO NOT COME. Ever. I have reported noise complaints 4+ times. He is ""untouchable"".

-He and his friends make bonfires on the grass in his yard (can see from my window) and not only is it a hazard to our suburban block with houses very close together, but the smell is unbearable.

-To give you guys a taste of the kind of D-bag this kid is- a few years ago he teepeed my grandmother's house a few days after my grandfather died. He was 18 at the time. My elderly grandmother had to clean it up by herself. We know that he and his family knew about his death too because the neighbors told eachother.

-I have tried contacting him online about his debauchery to no avail.

62,"
Just want to start with apologising for the length and thanking anyone bothering to read through it all. Tbh it felt good just typing this up and letting it out somewhere. 

I'll start by just diving in I guess. 
I don't know what I want to do with my life. Yeah I know it's completely fine to not know and yeah I'm still young but I'm at a crossroad of sorts and I'm so unsure of where to go and I just need some unbiased advice from strangers across the internet. 

Some background info 
Im a 21yo female in Aus, I've always struggled with depression/anxiety and it really affected my studies and grades in high school. I was always afraid to try because trying meant the possibility of failing whereas no effort didn't feel like failing. I didn't do terribly but I didn't do that well either. It was okay though cos I 'knew' I wanted to do nursing and that doesn't require the highest marks. 
I took a year off after school, worked for a couple months and then travelled around Europe. It was the best time ive ever had and the happiest I've ever been. It really helped a lot with my anxiety as I was forced to face so many fears and I came back my best self and honestly I was excited to go to uni (important as I've been accused a lot of going in with a bad attitude and maybe I should just look at it differently). This would be better than high school, I was doing what I love, studying what I want to study and at the end it would get me my degree for the job I've always wanted. This was beginning of last year. 

Unfortunately I didn't take biology into account. I'm not a science person and it was too much for me and I gave up half way through and failed the class. I dropped down to part time and decided I'd do biology this year. It isn't going that much better. I've managed to pass everything so far (most recent test hasn't been graded and I don't have high hopes for it though) and the final exam is in a couple weeks and honestly nothing has stuck with me so I feel like I need to learn an entire semesters worth of work in that time.  

My depression has been getting the better of me this year too. I'm constantly having break downs and I've been having more panic attacks in the past couple months than I have had in the last two years. And I'm sick of it and sick of feeling this way. So I asked myself what is making me the most miserable in my life right now? University. Studying. Working towards a degree that I'm not even sure if I want anymore or if I'm just so used to saying it's what I want. 

Then I asked myself what would make me happy? Travelling. Working over seas. Seeing the world. Even just working full time before then to get the money would be better than what I'm doing now. 
And so I decided, there's no way I'm going back to uni next semester. I came up with a plan, I'll finish this semester, (one week left plus exams) I won't give up on them but I won't let myself stress and panic over what I can't do. Then I'll start looking for more work, hopefully get full time hours (even if it's more than one job) I'll start saving till hopefully no later than March next year. Then I'll travel for the rest of next year, I might possibly also work over seas and stay another year. 
Since coming to this idea I've felt like a weight is off my shoulders and I'm already feeling so much happier. I've started looking into where I'll go and the must dos of the trip, how much money I think I'll spend on this and that and how much I think I'll need, places to stay and possibilities of jobs over there. I've been really enjoying this and it's the first time in a while I can see where I'll be further than one week. 

So the problem then? Is everyone else. Nobody directly says this is a bad idea but they raise their concerns or I can see their judgement. Most my friends didn't take a gap year so are in their second or third years now. Most my friends will finish uni this year or next. They'll be finished before ive even started whatever it is I decide I want to do. Which is what? How can you not know? If you don't know now you probably still won't know when you get back. These opinions and those looks of judgement make me nervous and question if I'm doing the right thing or have any idea what I'm doing with my life. 

The worst is my parents though. I hate saying that because they are honestly the greatest parents ever and they always support what I want to do and their concerns come from the best place. They've said if this is what I want to do then they will support that but I can see they think it's me just quitting and not wanting to try for fear of failure (going back to high school days). My dad also never went to university and had a job he Hated for 15 years and I know his concerns are for me being stuck in the same position. I've raised the point though of just because I finish a three year degree doesn't mean I won't be stuck there anyway. 
They've come up with an alternative plan though: I go to TAFE (like community college I guess) for 12-18 months (just depends which course and how I want to do it) become an enrolled nurse (as opposed to three years and registered nurse), save up money while there and then travel once I've done that. Then when I travel I can work as a nurse and make more money to travel for even longer. Then when I get back I can straight away get a good well paid job, and then I can decide if I want to do another two years and become an RN or go get a different degree or just stay with what I have. 
This isn't a bad idea but I'm just not sure if it's what I want to do. I don't know if I'm in the right head space to study right now and I might struggle with that one just as much with what I'm currently doing (but is that just my fear of failure leading me to not trying?). I'm also unsure if nursing is what I want to do anymore. I work in disability care and I do enjoy my job and I know I won't hate nursing but I'm not sure if I actually want to do it or if I just decided on it years ago and haven't really thought about it since. Or maybe I don't want to because this degree has just put me off it and I'm taking the easy way out. I also just want to go travelling now and I know I'd still be working for at least six months but I don't hate working, I do hate studying (Honestly the days when I'm working I mostly enjoy them, there's not a single part of the uni life I like). And doing this mini degree would still take at least a year plus I'd need to work some more after that so probably couldn't travel till the year after next and that thought puts my mind back in a slump. 
But I am also scared. I'm so scared of being 23/24 and not having a degree and everyone else has their jobs. I'm scared of doing a degree for something I don't want to do. I'm scared to go travelling alone because women can't do that (yeah I've done it before but jeeze some of the looks and warnings I get). Im scared my parents will be disappointed. Im scared I'll come home just as clueless as I am now. I'm scared I'll never know what I want to do. And I'm scared I'll feel as shitty as I've felt this year forever. 

I'm so easily swayed by people's opinions, every time I have a friend say in a tone hardly attempting to hide their judgment 'so you're dropping out?' Or 'you know you'll be at least 26 before you get a degree?' I can't help think that oh they're right what I'm doing is stupid and wasting my time. 

My parents I know will support whatever I decide but I know they're worried about what I'm going to do and I don't want to disappoint them. 

I just want to make the best decision for myself, my mental health and my future but it doesn't seem like I can do them all at once. I want an opinion that isn't hidden behind a face that says 'oh this is just ___ quitting again' while they say 'why don't you stay in uni and just travel for a shorter time in the breaks. I mean, it can't be thaat bad.' Well yes actually for me it is that bad. 

At the moment I guess I'm trying to decide between my parents plan and my plan. But any advice would be welcome. I think I just need some reassurance that quitting is the right thing to do and isn't giving up, or be told that everyone else is right and I'm just scared of failing and I should suck it up. I'm just so scared to make the wrong decision now and be in a position worse off in a year regretting being in uni or not being there.  

Tl;dr should I take the rest of the year off to work then travel for as long as possible next year and figure out what I want to when I get back (while being set behind a few years) or go to TAFE for a year and travel in two years time like everyone in my life suggests. 

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and anyone giving advice &lt;3

63,"So, I've been dating a girl for about 2 years and its turned into straight unconditional and at times obsessive love. Things seem pretty close to perfect at times as well. However, I've felt myself have a massive personality change and its all because of how i want to be for her. I've lost my old values, old character etc. She's an extremely insecure girl and I honestly want the best possible thing for her. The sad thing about this is she describes me as the best thing for her. To an extent i believe this as well, we've pushed through a lot of mentalities together. Sadly in doing this i've gone from aspects of being a mentally strong individual into many aspects of vulnerability. Although, for the past week I haven't stopped thinking about how I could work on myself again to gain back the sense of independence. I can feel myself getting more and more impatient with the relationship but none of this is because of her. My problem is I can't bring myself to even think about leaving her, I know she needs me and quite frankly I feel like I'd be lost without her. Even that in itself is clingy and It's just slowly what I've become. I just need someone else's perspective on this. It's made me feel pretty shitty and upset.",21May2017,0

70,"So yesterday I wanted to talk to our waitress at TGI Fridays. She was my kind of girl and I was very attracted to her. Yet I don't have the courage to do so. Instead I thought I would leave my number on the receipt and see if she would call me. Well this friend of a friend thought he would do it too even though he wasn't interested in her. (He's just a douche)

Now come this morning, I had planned all week on getting a new number as I had moved here a few months ago, and I call Verizon to see how that works. Come to find out I can just get a new number over the phone and within minutes I have new digits. But I was kinda bummed I did it so soon as I would never know if she called me or not. 

Friend of a friend thought found out and thought it would be funny to pose as this girl as I didn't have his number and said that ""she"" had tried my number and it failed so she got it from this other guy since he too left his number. 

It was believable and I was stoked and asked her if she wanted to come to our bonfire. ""She"" says yes and I give all the details.

As we sit there he shows me his phone and how it was him posing as her the whole time. Maybe two hours worth of conversation. I am totally bummed about the whole thing as I haven't been in a relationship in a long time and have recently been dealing with some ex gf drama. I had hoped this was the reason I needed to completely forget about my ex and really move on. I had felt a certain way that I haven't felt in a long time. It hurts to be honest and I want to get him back.  ",21May2017,1
73,"TL;DR - Teammate who sleptover at my house stole $50 from me while I and other friends were asleep, ate my ice cream as well. The other 3 already know about it, not sure how to proceed from here.

So last night (May 19) I hosted a sleepover for my teammates for an event we were all going to tomorrow. I invited 7 of them and 4 showed up, with 2 of them being my friends for more than 4 years and the others having just met the year prior. 

Everything was just fine and we were all having a good time. We slept, went to the event, came back to change to hangout later for a volunteering event we had the same day (or today May 20). After we had gotten ready, one of the friends who I've known since kindergarten (we're freshman in highschool) and the suspect both went out early to the volunteering event. No problem I say, as I and the other 2 are left to fix the bikes.

Not long after I had picked up my wallet for food did I notice that the $20 I always kept was gone. Not only that but also the $30 of quarters I kept on the side of my bed were gone as well. The only other person I had shown was the suspect who had left with my friend of roughly 9 years.

Other than just the money, my friend was also missing his pair of sunglasses and I knew for a fact that I could trust my other friend who was with me at the house.

We know it was him, with too much evidence connecting towards him. Today however, we decided to talk to him about it to only be faced with a lying face and denial expressions. We've always suspected him to be a kleptomaniac, but I had never thought of it to come this far.

At the beginning of the lease I dealt directly with her business partner who shown me around, signed the lease and handed over the keys. He advised that if I they would be flexible with the length of notice ect as they had a lot of interest for this flat in the viewing stages. Which I may need to rely on as the new flat is available before the end of the lease.

90,"so basically my parents want me to go to a school camp and i dont want to go. Heres the reasons for both arguments: 

Mine: 

1. Its on my birthday 

2. only 1 of my friends is going

3. I have various medical issues that make it a hassle to go including but not limited to severe food allergies to alot of common foods (i basically have to bring my own breakfast, lunch and dinner whenever i go to school camps), asthma (which i have to take medication for), depression (which i also have to take medication for)

4. I dont want to go (i know this may sound and like im just being rebellious or whatever. But from my point of view its not going to educationally benefit me much and unless i enjoy it (which i dont think i will, at least not as much as i would if i stayed home) i wouldnt get anything out of it) 
 

My parents arguments:

1. They paid

2. I will meet new friends 

3. It will be a good experience 

4. If i don't go i my friend will not have any friends at camp 


They have not said anything about my arguments so i have no idea what they think of them but here is what i think of their argument:

1. A fair argument, I don't think i have anything good against this one but from my point of view i have a choice on if i should go or not and my arguments outweigh this one (yeah i know, this is a pretty bad counter argument) 

2. I've already been at school for a few years, i know most of the people in my grade already and i like my social group. Like yeah, the more people you know the better, but from my point of view i don't need to know any more people and the people that i get along with are already friends with me (due to the fact the similar people hang out together. e.g there's always a group of ""cool kids"" so if your a cool kid you'll naturally get to know more cool kids by hanging out with your couple of ""cool kid"" friends, sorry if its kinda confusing) 

3. I disagree that this will be a good experience. I am introverted (i prefer to spend time by myself then with other people) and i'm not really an active kid so i won't like the sports and activities 

4. This is not a good point, and since they've brought it up i can technically say that if i go i'll only have 1 friend. Which of course they will reply with i can make new friends which i will say that my friend can also make some new friends (yeah, i'm not the best at being social) and this argument kinda becomes invalid 



So yeah, i mainly just put this here so i can think straight and look at the entire thing in an orderly way. 

But still if you guys have any advice that would be great.

The first one was systems engineering and the second one mechanical engineering. I left both of those just after the first semester.

A bit of backstory:
I've been having depression for almost a decade now I'd say. When I was 10 heavy bullying by class mates and ""friends"" caused me to flee towards the internet. I was alone for a long time until I met a guy who introduced me to his friends and for 3 years my life got better -  I got a lot more confident and I was regularly taking the train to get to their city. But after they grduated and our lifestyles changed I lost contact, the problem being me not being able to change. At that point I was glued at the PC for years now and outside the fun weekends we had occasionally I was just playing games all day after school. Since then has gone even more into the shitter.

At first and even now I didn't know what to do. I thought ""hey, just study systems engineering and programming and you'll be able to do PC stuff"" so I applied for system engineering. Problem was that I met some awesome people during the first two months of uni but failed to let loose of the PC while neglecting studying, which resulted in me not being able to pass required tests 
so I couldn't enter the exams. I gave up because I fucked up.

To not disappoint my parents even further I applied for mech. engineering and got a required internship through my father last summer. I finished the 8 week long internship but my addiction to playing a certain video game's expansion caused me to not even touch the report until january of this year. By that point I had forgotten most of the details and when I was done writing it I realized I failed to do weekly report cards(those are part of the overall internship report). My fear of being declined signatures by the instructors caused me to lie to my father that I already turned the report in  - in truth, it's been here all this time all because I didn't have the guts.

When the time of exams came I failed the first one by now showing up. There were three groups and you'd assume the webpage would list the groups and time in the right order, right? First in the list was group 1 at 8 am, group 3 at 12 pm and group 2 at 10 am. Naturally I missed the ""group 3 at 12 pm"" and thought that group 2(the one I was in) had their exam at 12 pm because I thought those were in the order of the group names. No biggy, I could have just done it at the next appointment.

When the deadline for turning in a crucial, mandatory paper came, I got hit by a kidney stone(4x6mm) and had to stay in the hospital for two days. Those were the days I intended to turn in the paper originally but due to this I was unable to do so. Also, my depression had another surge again(which usually happens around winter/early spring for me) and I was just thinking that everything was over and that this was a sign that I should just stop with mech. engineering. I also didn't like most of the subjects and just chose to do it because I didn't want to disappoint my parents again.

This time I didn't tell anyone that I stopped uni again though. Mainly because I fear the reaction of my parents - I know I am already disappointing enough, I just don't want to see their reactions. I thought, I would be able to quickly get a job and tell my parents when I could pay them back the money they paid for me for university(which was just 600 bucks). 

It's been two months now and I can't get out of the rabbit hole. My mother found out when I accidently dropped a bus ticket(if you're enrolled  you get a permanent ticket that is paid for with the student fee) but agreed to not tell my father. My whole current ""life style"", not just the depression, has been preventing me from getting any job though. I've been looking up countless retail, serving and other odd jobs  and each time it get to the ""send pic, rÃ©sumÃ© and the cover letter"" I'm ducking out because I fear being rejected. I intend to go back to systems engineering because I genuinely enjoyed the subjects. I just failed to study for them and failed because of that. But I don't want to do it by wasting the money of my parents again.

Sorry that I've been dragging this on so much but I don't know where else to write and I can't come clean to anyone in my family and I don't know who to talk to.  I don't know who I can tell all of this and I don't know where I can start to fight my problems. The money my father originally gave me for this semester is down to 200 euros(300 originally) and I still haven't stopped playing WoW because it's probably the only thing that stops me from killing myself. I don't have much time left in regards of keeping all this stuff secret but I my fears prevent me from applying for anything. All the time I'm thinking to myself ""nobody will want someone who has been sitting on his chair at home all the time"" and I can't even take the one internship into the rÃ©sumÃ© because I can't prove I actually did it.

Please, I don't know what to do anymore and I am so sorry for this mess of a text... Where can I start  to change anything? :(",21May2017,1

102,"I am 28 years old currently struggling with what I think is depression. I feel that I have been depressed for my entire adult life and hence failed to achieve my potential. I have also struggled with eating disorders from age 19-to present (much better than what I was). I was considered to be very intelligent at school, an English teacher once described me as a â€˜genius.â€™ (I am not a genius, she was just trying to say I was a good writer). In late school and immediately after I experienced a huge drop in confidence and lost all interest in/enjoyment of pursuing my previous passions. I now work as a nurse.

My childhood:

Age 0-8. - Lived in a tiny community with my mother, father and older brother. Have happy memories of this time, although my parents were always fighting. Dad was a farmer and emotionally distant and could be verbally and physically abusive to my mother. Dad hated leaving the farm and I don't remember going on a family holiday. I remember being very in awe of my mother. The fighting between my parents accelerated and Dad ended up filing for divorce. He also took my mother to family court, presumably to protect his farming assets. He also told my mother he wanted to psychologically break her by attempting to gain custody of us. Mum confided all this in me, which lead me to have a negative although somewhat conflicted view of my father. I don't think Mum could cope with the idea of us liking Dad. The court process was very drawn-out and Mum ended up in $50k of debt from it. She was under huge stress and needed to go on blood pressure tablets. Because Dad was self-employed he could lie about his income and she never received child support. We moved to Hawthorn in Melbourne. I was very upset to be leaving my friends at school, I would still consider them the most genuine friendships I have ever had. It was a huge culture shock and we were predictably bullied as new kids, but eventually made friends. Mum was clearly very unhappy and spent a long time at her new job as a teacher at an elite private school. She had to drive us every second weekend to see Dad, as per the court orders. She would often take her anger out on us by keeping my brother and I at the kitchen table and scream at us for what I remember as hours that we were horrible people and that no-one in her family liked us. She would sometimes be so angry that spit would be flying out of her mouth into our faces and her jaw would crack. She would hit us in an uncontrollable rage. I remember that she would call my brother a pufter (he is not gay, just quiet and shy). I think she would call me a stupid bitch. Our neighbours told us years later that they heard.

age 9- Just as I was settling into school I had to later in the year move to another Melbourne suburb and attend school there. Again I was the weird new girl, but eventually made friends. Mum continued to fly into rages at us. At times she was extremely overbearing, trying to hug us and tell us how much she loved us. But then sometimes I went to her to hug her she would be stiff as a board. She would confide a lot of problems about work and the divorce and I would give her advice.

When I was 11 dad was supposed to pick us up for the weekend but he never came. I never saw him or his family again. He attempted to contact me when I was 21 but I ignored it. A couple of my aunties tried to contact us for a few years but I ignored it. As a child it felt too difficult for to navigate and I also didn't want to hurt my Mum. I still don't know why he did not come or if he is a bad person or not.

age 12- The month before I started high school Mum married a man she had been dating for less than a year. (I had only met him twice before they got engaged). I hated him and was disgusted by the relationship (I now get along very well with him and care a lot about him). I found it very distressing. His daughter came to live with us for a school semester. She was a compulsive liar and spread lies about me at school. Mum was really hard on her and she moved back to live with her own mother.

I went into high school (again changing school). I immediately rose to the challenge of work and gained a great sense of satisfaction and identity from learning and academic success. It was a reasonably happy time in my life, although I did have very low self-esteem. My dream was to get to year 12 and get a brilliant score and go to a great university to be a translator.  I also moved during this time to a really crappy suburb that none of my friends ever wanted to visit, so I became somewhat socially isolated.

I was somewhat hurt after Mum remarried as she started to treat me more like a normal child in the sense that she no longer confided her problems in me, as she had her new husband to do that. This was quite hurtful and I felt angry at being used in this way. I also felt that mum was trying to put on a fake show to my new stepdad about what a normal family we were. I don't remember having much to do with Mum, and she always treated me in a very different way when we were around her work colleagues, etc and I found it abhorrent.

By far the worst thing that happened (I see this as a pivotal moment in my life where everything went catastrophically wrong): when I was at the end of year 10 my parents suddenly told me that they were moving to Singapore and I would have to go with them. I was devastated as I had already started the VCE and it wouldn't be credited. I had also spent the past few years building up relationships with teachers, friends and a routine and the idea that it would all be thrown out before the beginning of what I saw as the two most important years of my life was catastrophic to me. At the time I saw the VCE as something that my whole life had been building towards. I especially loved Japanese and I had an amazing teacher who would have been an enormous help during my studies. The school I transferred to in Singapore was co-ed and I being a shy person I found this very intimidating. It was also a poor quality school that seemed to have a lot of teachers who just wanted to escape Australia. (FYI, Up until this point I had only gone to state schools). Worst of all the school did not offer Japanese, but I was able to do it through distance education organisation. It was a terrible organisation though, and all my work for term 1 was sent in months late, so I had to spend my entire Easter holidays catching up. It was indescribably heartbreaking to me to know that I was not going to achieve the score I wanted in Japanese as this was honestly my biggest passion at the time. I was 17 at the time and I believe that this is when my depression really became apparent. For other more confident and outgoing people this could have been a wonderful experience, but it wasn't for me. I withdrew socially. I managed to get a final overall score of 90 and to top my English subjects, but to me this was nothing to be proud of.

When I came back to Australia after school I had no idea who I was. Mum continued to shout/hit. All my problems started... I studied nursing because I had lost all my personal interests and I needed to quickly become financially independent to get away from my mother. Mum is really nice to me now that we don't live together.

I know that I have not had the hardest life, but I just want to know if it is reasonable for me to be so depressed? I honestly sometimes feel that I have wasted so much potential due to circumstances and that life may not be worth it.",21May2017,0
104,"I was at a fast food place where they had four touch screen devices for kids to play. Only two of them worked properly, one of them barely worked, the other didn't work at all. My children were playing on the two that worked, meanwhile I was sitting on the barely working one, trying to play on it despite the awkward way you had to press on it for it to register input. 

A woman, looking no older that twenty with two children walks in, and her son obviously wants to play. He sits on the broken one, and I immediately let her know that it doesn't work, so I give up my chair and tell her to use that one, but you have to press hard on it. Apparently they weren't having success with it, because when my daughter who was at the working monitor goes back to the table for a minute to grab a French fry and then tries to return, this woman had already ran to the machine my daughter was on with her two children and taken it away.

I stood there, dumbfounded, thinking, ""This is how you repay kindness? I gave up my machine, and the first chance you get, you steal from my children?"" My daughter, luckily, was not upset, and just sat with her brother instead, and we left a couple minutes later. But I couldn't stop thinking about how shitty that woman's action had been. I was so angry at the time, I wasn't thinking straight, and anything I would have said or done would have made it worse, so I am glad I chose not to react.

Having had 24 hours to cool off, I now believe that the best course of action may have been to simply politely say, ""Oh, she wasn't finished with that yet!"" But then considering the character of the woman, what would be the next step if she just blatantly refused to move, or more likely, just ignored my existence? I just don't see a positive way this could have ended, but I hate to think that people like that can just get away with that behavior because the rest of us wish to remain civil. ",21May2017,0

We've been together for a year and live in our own house and things have been looking better lately. He's said on multiple occasions that he wants to reconcile and fix our problems but today I caught him going out with a girl who he used to be in love with. 
Once I confronted him, he told me he was out with her last night (instead of his cousin which is what he told me) getting drunk and going to a party together. He has lied on several occasions about hanging out with her and I feel like a fool.
He claims he hasn't done anything but I'm ready to move out. We were technically on a break but he's always made such a huge deal of speaking to other people and has always accused me of cheating even though I've never given him reason to feel that way.

I'm a 15 year old honor student, who suffers from depression and ADHD.

Sometime around January, we started studying certain philosophies in my AP Euro class(nihilism and existentialism). This would be fine if I took the test and simply moved on.

126,"This is a bit of a long scenario but I hope you get a feeling of what is my issue. 

I have moved around a lot. I was never the most popular person but it varied from school to school on where I stood on the social ladder. Some schools I was bullied and had no friends. Other schools I felt like the most loved person in my social group. Secretly I have always loved being the centre of attention. I also hate the knowledge of anyone disliking me. 

After I finished my final school (where I had few friends and was bullied) I moved on to work and then university. I was very unpopular at work but then when university (or rather my second uni because the first was a failure) came I felt part of a good social group. This collapsed after a few years though and I started to be all alone again. I am friends with them all separately but they do their own thing now mostly so I am mostly alone. 

I have a partner though. He is wonderful and charming and super intelligent. He is also possibly the most popular person i know. Everyone loves him! I see people socially because of him but none of them are interested in being my friend. I am a bit intimidated to be their friend anyway as they are far more attractive/funnier/informed/intelligent than me. But his popularity and their lack of acceptance of me just makes me feel more alone. And that I'm weird and not going to go far in this world. 

What used to be a solace to me was my academics. I was a smart kid. But then depression and laziness came (and lets face it things got harder anyway) and now I am possibly failing my degree and it is too late to turn it round now.

129,"Hello, I'm a 18f and I've been interested in a full time summer job since last year. I've looked and had been offered numerous jobs so it's not that I haven't found any. It's just that my mom gets upset when I tell her about it.
  
She's a big procrastinator and always makes excuses so I haven't been able to drive to get my full license. Even if I DID get it she wouldn't even let me touch her car to take it to work. My friends mom's have even offered to teach me how to drive while her daughter was also learning but she just said ""if shes going to teach you how to drive then why don't you just live with them.""

But in the 6 months shes been in shes only made 200 dollars. In fact she hasn't even made. She's LOST 1,300+. All during marching band she would tell me I'm the reason she wasn't going out getting customers. She never drove me to it, my friend did.

I had worked for several companies before this. I hated the structure, the feeling of being trapped, but I miss the camaraderie and friendship. I felt like I really belonged in all of these companies.  

I'm sad to say, but as a person who tends to self-impose isolation, I've made 95% of my good friends through work or school. I do have external hobbies, rock climbing, hiking, cooking, etc. but I don't really go to any meetups or do many group activities.

I am really looking for an alternative to this. I mesh well with other techies but I don't find I'm able to bond with people at random networking events, it takes me months to really connect with people.

142,"I have been suffering from mass amounts of guilt for who knows how long. Basically, if I do something that disappoints someone else I will feel guilt for hours on end. So, just now my dad asked me to drive my mom to my grandparents which is about and hour there and back, and I didn't feel like doing that so i said no.. my dad acted mad about it but my mom told me it was fine and she would drive herself. I now feel guilty that she left, and that it will be my fault if she gets in a car crash on the way there because I didn't take her. This happens very often to me and it's tiring. If I get into a small disagreement with my parents (or anyone) before they leave I will regret it for the rest of the day and constantly worry about if they are okay, and feel guilt.
I know something is wrong, but I would like to know opinions on why I may feel this way/how do I stop.

Thank you",21May2017,31
143,"So i am very old-fashioned in the way i think and it's affecting my relationship mainly(i'm in high school btw). My girlfriend is my first girlfriend but thing's about her past which are really stupid bother me. 2 years before me she liked a guy who she thought liked her back. She would let him touch her tits and ass and they would make out. That was as far as it went. This was during a summer and the guy realized that he would never get to sleep with her so he literally kicked her out of his life and hooked up with her best friend. It's more of a sad thing but i don't know why it bothers me so much that she did those things. It's not even that big of a deal but it bothers me. In my head i say that it's stupid things and i'm the first guy she actually loved, but i have a heavy feeling in my heart. It's not really affecting my relationship too much but i still want this part of me to change. Because honestly, you guys who are reading this are probably thinking how petty of guy i am. I was raised in a very traditional family and so it's hard for me. The fact that she and that guy did things on the same sofa that she sits on with me bothers me. What she has done is really nothing big and it's a part of the past but a heavy unpleasant feeling arises in my heart and i don't know why. I seriously want to change this part of me because it's so stupid that i'm being bothered by her being tricked by a guy who was a total piece of shit. She's told me how much she regrets ever letting that guy into her life and that she sees that as a lesson before she got to meet me. But even so, i can't be 100% comfortable. Please give me some advice or tell me something so that i can change. I really need help for this as this girl is so amazing and it would be honestly fucking stupid if i ended up ruining this relationship because of things that happened 2 years ago.",21May2017,1

146,"It's kind of turned into a thing with my circle and I'm not sure where this is headed.

So I have a friend and he's married.  I usually only saw them but they had a BBQ once and I met all their married friends.  Over time it feels like the wives have become increasingly flirtatious with me.  They do it right in front of their husbands and they give me no ill will, I've done projects with them and stuff as well so I don't feel they're ostracizing me for their wives behavior.

Since it's summer there was another BBQ yesterday.  They were asking me what they thought of their outfits, kicking my feet, touching my arm, comparing me favorably to their husbands.  Again all right in front of them, and not *a* wife, all of them.  When I went to throw my plate out one of the wives very obviously dragged the front of her hand along my groin and went ""Oooo"" and most of the wives laughed, one of them scolded her for being inappropriate but then started flirting with me as well.  I was so hot in the face from this but no one, not even any of the husbands said anything, the ball just kept rolling.

I don't have other friends so I don't know if this is unusual or not.  I don't mind the attention at all.  And again their husbands don't seem remotely upset by it.  I'm just curious if this is normal for the single men in the group.  I have nowhere else to ask.",21May2017,1
148,"My butt is ace sensitive, so to speed up the process of wiping (so I don't leave the bathroom crying) I wet the toilet paper using the sink nearby. The problem is, I'm going to be staying with my girlfriend's family for a while in a few weeks, and they do not have a sink in their bathroom.  

I've previously stayed in hotels without sinks in their bathrooms and simply filled up a cup with water and took it with me, so I could dip the toilet paper in it and wet it. However, I don't think that that is an applicable solution when I'm staying with the family because how very, very odd that is.

For the past year my only social interaction other than my family is my cousin, who is more of a friend figure. We've been through a lot and he depends on me and all that but I think it may be time to cut ties. I always say this but this time it needs to happen. I always drink when I'm with him and feel like even if I'm trying to be sober he pushes me into drinking for entertainment. I've done bad things while under the influence (nothing criminal but still mean) and this person always has alcohol available. It's not all that though. I could say no I'm not drinking or whatever but without that I find myself bored. Then this person will say ""drinking isn't a big deal."" Like how can you have such a dumb, singular world view just based on yourself?  I really do feel like it's on me and not just him, but I always succumb to my own desires and the other persons.

That's only one part of it. Since I had no other friends, this person was my only friend and feel like he holds me back. Not on purpose, but just the things we do. He lives in another state and I wait for him to come home to be social. I know I can have other friends and have people that actually want to hang out with me. I think I'm stuck on this one friend for: because they are family and there are other people around this person, such as females I like (they don't like me and that's a whole different story.)

158,"This is a throwaway and the name is because I know that I'm kind of a terrible person for all the things written here. We are both 19, so yeah, this is one of those immature relationships where young people don't really know what they're doing, right? Anyways.

To start, my ex [X] and I began dating in 2015 and dated for a little over a year. We broke up six months ago. He broke it off with me, because he felt like the connection wasn't there anymore. A month after breaking up with me, he tried to get back together with me. I told him no, because I thought it would be for the best for us both to move on. But I never stopped having feelings. Maybe a month after trying to get back together with me he started dating a new girl, Y. I didn't find out about it until about a month later, well after New Year's, which upset me because we both attended a New Year's party and he was acting very flirtatious. He isn't a flirtatious guy, and doesn't interact with girls like that unless he likes them. I KNOW this.

So I found out he was dating Y in January. But when I asked different people about it, I got conflicting answers for a little bit. No one was sure. The two didn't act like they were dating. When they were around each other, X didn't act very interested in Y. But, he continued messaging me almost every day and flirting heavily with me, and I continued hoping that he would ask to get back together, and that he WASN'T dating Y, they were just talking.

Well I eventually learned that they were, in fact, official, but still couldn't get a straight answer on how LONG they'd been official. He's not the type to post any relationship stuff to social media, so I couldn't even sneakily find out that way.

But we continue interacting very affectionately. He messages me all the time. He even hangs out with just me a few times (nothing sexual happens though) but he is almost assuredly emotionally cheating on Y. I feel guilty, but I am also still deeply in love with X, so I don't try to stop what's happening.

Then X and Y break up, about three weeks ago. The DAY after they break up, he comes over to my apartment, and we hook up. For two days neither of us acknowledge what happened. But I want to talk about it, and maybe try and see what he thinks. So I invite him over to my place again for lunch but he doesn't act affectionately like he had been, and when I try hugging him when he leaves, it's a dead hug, like he doesn't really want to touch me. I wasn't brave enough to talk to him in person so I ended up just texting him about it.

I asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't really know. He admitted that he had some feelings for me, but that he thinks they are mostly ""sexual"" and that he doesn't want us getting back together because he thinks he'll just hurt me again. Then he says he wants some time to himself, so he can fix himself, because he doesn't want us to get caught in a cycle. So I agree and we are both supposed to leave each other alone.

That lasted four days. We hang out at a party (we are in the same friend group) and he drives me home, acting friendly again, and drops me off. He doesn't come inside, but after that night began talking to me daily again. The conversations aren't always long in depth, but they still happen, so. We also keep our ritual of sending each other cute pictures, not of us of course, but of silly gifs or cats or something like that.

Last week, a group of us went out bowling, and X drove me there and back to my house. He came inside to hang out for a little bit. We just watched a little bit of TV and YouTube, but he did eventually end up cuddling with me. 

People at this point are starting to ask if we're dating again because of how we act around each other. I keep having to say no, which hurts A LOT, because I fucking wish we were but I don't really know what's happening.

This week, a couple days ago, I went over to his house after work so his dad could look at my car, and then X said I could come back over later tonight to play video games because he's getting a new TV. It's like 10 at night when he finally texts me that I can come over. So I do, and we do actually play video games, and end up cuddling in the same chair, then the same bed. And I initiate the hookup, because... well, I don't really know why I did, I just still have feelings for him and am attracted to him, so...

It's been a few days since then. And I got asked again by our co-workers (yeah, he now works at the same place I do, this goes in really deep) if we were dating. But no... we aren't.

Part of me keeps trying to rationalize his actions. ""Oh, he JUST broke up with Y not even a month ago, so he doesn't want to hurt anyone by immediately getting back together with me after their breakup, but he can't tell me that because it'll hurt me (he never ever ever talked about his relationship with Y in front of me and in fact even seemed like he was trying to hide it), so he said he has feelings towards me so I would wait for him because he wants a more appropriate time to get back together!"" But how can I think that when three weeks ago he SAID he didn't want to get back together? Although he of course had to add that it was because he didn't want to hurt me and he does in fact have SOME feelings for me. But how can I know if he was trying to lessen the blow, or if he is really scared of hurting me again?

And anyways, I already feel like a shitty person because I KNOW Y. I am not friends with her, but I am familiar with her, and I feel like the way X and I interacted was entirely inappropriate, especially since if he ever acted like that with another girl when we were dating I would have been heartbroken. 

**TLDR; I just don't know what my ex wants from me, as he acts affectionate and even gets sexual with me at times, but three weeks ago stated he didn't want to get back together as he feels as though he would hurt me again. But he did also state he still has feelings for me. And he knows I have feelings for him. I'm still really in love with him, and I want him back, but I don't understand what exactly he wants from me.**",21May2017,0

I have no idea how I can properly salvage or save the friendship that I have seemingly ruined. I met someone lately online that is the only person I've connected with in my life. We'd talk for hours on anything and everything. It was the greatest friendship I'd had. We shared numerous similarities on the way we were treated in our past and how we reflected on it in the future. The problem lies in the fact that my insecurity got the best of me. I asked her something that was paranoid and unrealistic. I asked her whether she had feelings for some random guy online that she clearly had little or no feelings for. After that she was incredibly ""different"" and wouldn't react the same way. I eventually asked her, tired of the mind games, on what is going on. She said that she dislikes drama between friends and that ""we both know why I asked something like that.""
I freaked the fuck out. I panicked, I went full damage control. I literally spewed out all the feelings that accumulated over time for her. 
&gt;It's been a week since then and she's ignored me. She sent me one message saying that she still respects me as a friend, but this clearly isn't the case. She doesn't respond to my snaps, she doesn't respond to my messages, anything. I feel like this is some high school tier shit I'm dealing with but I have no idea what to do. I don't want her to think that my feelings means we cannot be friends. I value her friendship more than anything right now. Words cannot describe the regret I feel for expressing my feelings. At this point I haven't messaged her for a few days, but her lack of response and the clarity of the fact she's ignoring me makes me want to just send her a message saying that if she wants to stop being friends, that's fine, just tell me so, rather than ignoring me. I don't know what the fuck to do.
tl;dr how do I salvage a friendship I ruined by trying to pursue a relationship, where said person is now ignoring me

I found myself having to block her on social media and stepping away from it myself to try to numb the pain, but even to this day it makes me sad to think about. Reason for the breakup was my own self esteem. I always assumed she'd leave me for someone better, in fact that's what she ended up doing.

164,"So first thing's first, I'm a 17 year old who is going to college in the fall. I currently work at Kroger as a courtesy clerk (bagging, collecting carts, garbage, etc.) I just started working here 3 weeks ago, and at first it was nice, but as time went by, it got bad.

1. On my first week, I worked 3 days. When I get paid the following week, I only got paid  for 2 days. I asked my assistant manager why this happened, and she said ""Did you clock in?"" And yes, I did click in the day, and I told her so, and she tells me ""Maybe you didn't clock in. Remember to always click in"" and on my next pay day, I did get paid for the missed day, but I find it very sour that they basically told me that it's my fault that I didn't get paid correctly 

2. I was told that in my first 90 days starting off, I should most likely work between 15-18 hours a week, which I agreed to. However, after the first week, I was getting assigned 19-22 hours a week, and this, once again, upsets me because it just seems that they brushed me off and didn't care for what I said

3. I requested for a day off in advance in order to take placement exams for the college I'm attending in the fall. My management told me I could take the day off, however, I saw my schedule for the week, and they assigned me the day that I requested off. I called my HR and told them the situation and they gave me the day off after talking. And again, this upsets me because it just seems that they brush me off.

4. I was officially ""put into the system"" this week. Although there is a schedule to check online, my management tells me to not pay attention to it because the physical schedule is more accurate. I was told that my hours are on the physical schedule, but I go check and cannot find my hours. I ask my supervisor if she could show me my hours for my week, and she does. However, she gave me my work schedule for the week after, not this current week, and I didn't know this. I talked to the supervisor about the situation and, just like in point 1, she told me that it was basically my fault that this happened. 

So those are my ""four strikes"" for my work. Overall, my work is boring as hell too. I stand in the same area for 4-8 hours bagging, and occasionally, I go out to do the trash or collect carts. 

What should I do? I asked my mom and my uncle, and in a summary, they told me ""suck it up, there is worse jobs out there""",21May2017,1

I have a huge problem with motivation. Previously I have been doing fine, but the past months have been a hell. I am currently in the last year of something that could be compared with the american high school. Ever since 2 months I have not been able of doing almost anything constructive. Every moment I am not entertaining myself someway; watching youtube(probably my worst problem) playing videogames(sometimes I do not have the energy for that even) or being with my girlfriend, is almost painful. If someone like my family talks to me I just want them to go away and homework, even though it might be fun, never gets done. On top of this is the fact that I am abnormaly intellegent (I know it sounds bad when you say it and I am not trying to be a douche but it is true). This results in me recieving almost exclusively A's even though I never study. Which adds to my already terrible motivation.

168,"I've got several mental illnesses. The main two are schizophrenia and anxiety. I've had probably 5 jobs in my lifetime. The only one I was able to do well without getting confused and making mistakes is pushing carts at Walmart.

I kind of want to get an entry level job and worked my way up until I'm considered skilled labor. I want to do something that's not too complicated like irrigation or painting.

If I were to go to school, I wouldn't have any pressure as far as learning the job fast. The problem is, they only teach the really complicated stuff at the local trade school. Such as Electrician and Plumbing. I want to do something easier than that.

I really don't know what they're going to expect out of me as entry level labor. The irrigation jobs say that there's a lot of digging and that type of thing mixed in with the training. I'm in great shape physically so this would be ideal.

Personally, I am really bad with learning jobs. My first job was at a Taco Bell and I was completely incompetent. Recently I had a pizza delivery job, and I kept forgetting food at the restaurant.

I have to take really strong meds which make me kind of stupid, and I think that's the main problem.

172,"Some backstory: Tuesday night I returned to my parents house for the summer home from college. This is my first time living here in about 2 years. Most of the time when I visit I stay on the couch, but since I'm living here I've been sleeping in my bedroom most nights. 

Tuesday night I woke up around 3 am to the sound of footsteps a few feet away from me on my bedroom floor. My floor was terribly messy with barely any room to walk. I figured the footsteps belonged to my cat, so I called her over to the bed. She didn't come, so I sat up and turned the light on. She wasn't in the room, and I went downstairs and saw that she was asleep in the bathroom. 

The following night I slept on the couch. Thursday night I don't remember anything too eventful happening. I believe I went to bed around midnight and woke up around 6 with no interruptions. Friday night, however, I was woken up around 5 am (yesterday morning) because my arm started to hurt. After seeing it was only 5:00, I fought the urge browse the internet because I knew it would wake me up. Just as I was about to drift off to sleep at about 5:30, I heard very loud footsteps moving across my floor. I was absolutely terrified. I laid there and listened to these footsteps sound like they were starting right outside my door and progress into my room several times in a row.

I got some sense into me and went downstairs at 6:00. I immediately opened all of our windows and checked the CO alarm to make sure it was working. Luckily it was, but I still was not convinced that the footsteps were real (I have had hallucinations in the past).

I told my parents about it, and I said I'd call my dad upstairs the following night (last night) if I heard it again. Last night, my friend wound up staying over. I had told him all about this as it was happening real time at 5:30 yesterday morning. All was pretty uneventful, and we were both asleep when at around 2:30 I heard the footsteps start. I shook my friend and he said he heard it too and realized that I hadn't been exaggerating about how much it sounds like human footsteps and how clearly they are on the floor of my bedroom and not in the crawl space above. Several times, every 5 minutes or so, we heard the footsteps make the exact same pattern of noise. Several times we would turn the light on, but we didn't see anything. I cleaned my room yesterday, so now the floor was completely empty. 

Finally, at about 4:15 am we were able to turn the light on in enough time to spot a *tiny* black mouse on the floor, trying unsuccessfully to open up my friend's diner takeout tray. The mouse was about 2 inches in length and 1 inch in diameter and froze for a couple of minutes. We probably could have picked it up if we tried. Anywho, after seeing the mouse, we both find it extremely hard to believe that such a small mouse could have been making such a big noise and in such a repetitive manner. My only theory is that it was squeezing itself through a hole in my closet and that the pressure from squeezing caused those creaks to occur. I have attached the link to a video of the noise. Does it sound like a mouse is the only thing living in my house?

There is this dude I had an on and off competition with since back in they day in the 7th grade.  He and I did not get along very well, he always used to tease me or do stuff in lessons and I would reply with provocative action as well.  Over the years he turned into a sociopathic kinda guy.  He has lied to people around me about things I do which i don't, has turned old friends against me, some of them never want to talk to me again.  He has backstabbed me on multiple occasions.  Even now on social media after making a new friend, the person asked him about me, he told them a story of the past which was a fib in reality, however he emphasized it greatly turning them against me.  What can I do? I've lost most of my old friends, I still have some really close ones which are for life.  But I don't know what to do.  I had the kid, i hate his guts and don't want to have to deal with him ever in my life again.  I've removed him from all social media.  What does one do in this situation?  he has a reputation for himself and is one of the popular kids which means I can't do much.  Most people just take his word for it through their thick skulls, not once did anyone even ask me or question him I assume.  He is the worst manipulator I know and I want revenge.  How would you guys go about it? In all honesty, if i had never ever met him, if he never existed, my life would be much better and I think I would have been a different person all together, since this kinda stuff changes you, losing friends from primary school and having enemies you've never even met before.",21May2017,3

basically that i make her life shitty. 

ever since then i've just felt so awful. i've faced a lot of problems already, including an eating disorder, a few suicide attempts, and depression, and i'm still seeing a therapist. i don't have many friends so i always thought i'd have my family, but nope, apparently they hate me too.

I can't react or respond in the normal way I'm supposed to. It's comparable to getting so stoned that you can't function, and then trying to start up a conversation. It's the worst with people I'm crushing on.

I'm fine around people I know well, and I've known well for years (siblings)- but when it comes to strangers, friends, or acquaintances- I'm just a stuttering/non-responding mess.

I can't get therapy yet because I'm in high school and my parents reject any idea of it, although I am starting my job in the summer which would provide money for that sort of thing, although my parents are in charge of my bank account. 
At one point, I was always in a negative, depressive state (although not extreme) and I was constantly crying about my mom's shittiness. Is this a common thing to cry everytime you're alone? It's kind of  distracting when I'm trying to do school work or read or anything.

A little background of myself, I'm a recent college graduate with a business related bachelor degree and had a fair amount of experience throughout college.  About 5 months ago I started my first full time position at a massive finance corporation.  This position only pays around 33k a year and the hours are brutal for how much it pays.  It was suppose to be a 9-5 but after working here for a few months it's more of a 8am-7pm since management frowns upon those who show up and leave ""on time"".  Not to mention it's almost mandatory to eat in front of the computer screen and can't leave for more than 15 minutes or else I might miss sudden deadlines. I really don't want to sound like I'm just a lazy new grad whining about working but I've never felt this stressed in my life.  Most of my friends who graduated with me seem to have much better hours and are paid way higher.

My question is, how bad will it look on my resume that I leave a job before the 1 year benchmark?

Hello all. I would like some advice for my life. I'm a 24yoF, married, and we own a house. I have two art degrees from a community college and I haven't been able to keep a job for longer than a year and a half. I slowly become unable to tolerate the job, whether it be the management, customers, or schedule. I lost my last job almost a month ago and I desperately do not want to go through the process of having another job that I can do until it drives me insane. 

I don't know what else I can do. The only thing I can think of is to go back to college, but all the programs I would be interested in aren't offered at my local state college. My mom keep insisting I should get an MIS degree and go into IT (I'm good at math and numbers, I just don't like it), but I'm afraid of getting a degree in something and then finding out I don't like that field, in addition to being in student loan debt as well. I like animals (especially dogs and people), I like people(I'm really good at customer service), I like art though I've lost a lot of my passion for it (my specialty in college was 3D modeling and animation, but there aren't any jobs in that field in my area). Beyond that, I have minor interests in the legal system, paleontology, detective work, and film history. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, but I'm desperate for an answer that isn't what my family keeps insisting (go into IT or move somewhere else). Sometimes I think about suicide, but I would never go through with it.

I moved to Scotland to get my education here, because I am a dual citizen, but that requires me to establish residency for three years.

This weekend I attended a wedding of my girlfriend's cousin. The Friday night of the rehearsal dinner, I got a little too wasted in front of my girlfriend's family and did not make the best impression on them. We have been dating for 2 1/2 years and are madly in love, however she needs some time to think and re-evaluate our relationship.

I've personally apologized to her family members through individual hand-written notes, but I literally do not know what to do with myself. I told my girlfriend I will go cold turkey when it comes to drinking. I love this girl more than anything in the entire world and do not know what I would do if I lost her. If there is anyone out there that can lead me in the right direction to fully expressing my regret for my behavior in such a way that could bring me some peace of mind, I would appreciate it more than you know.

209,"There's probably too much to include in a single post, so I'll try to keep to my primary issues. I'm 25 years old and I'm still just as useless as when I was a child.

 I've been medicated for depression, anxiety, ocd, and insomnia since I was 13 and despite 12 years of medication, I haven't made any progress. I'm just as obsessed with suicide as I was when I was diagnosed, and self harm is still the only thing that really calms me down. I'm still on a slew of medications (venlafaxine, clonazepam, mirtazepene and ambien), and the dosages just keep going up.

 I've never been able to be self reliant for more than a few months, every few years. I can't hold a job - hell, most days I can't even make it out the front door, or out of my bedroom. People scare the hell out of me, even my friends and family. Just hearing people yell or argue is enough to set off a panic attack. I can't even hear it on television without feeling nervous. I was living on social assistance for a few years, with financial help from my parents, but after hitting rock bottom with an opiate and alcohol problem six months ago (I'm still clean, 5 months in), I'm living in an apartment by myself, paid for by them.

I feel so defective and ashamed of not being able to just pull myself together despite all of the privileges, that could have gone to somebody else who wouldn't have wasted them. I still want nothing more than to die, but suicide isn't an option. Where do I turn? I made my psychiatrist cry during my last visit. She said she doesn't know what to tell me anymore.

Like I dont want to make them pay for it even though it was caused by their fucking stupidity trying to drown themselves in the ocean while their friends are here trying to have a good time on prom night, like I just don't get how they could be that selfish

Adam is cool when it is just the two of us, we hang out and play games and are pretty chill.
But when Sarah is with us, be it in school, my place or even through the internet, Adam always (without fail) tries to come between us and if we are talking about something he doesn't understand he wants us to explain this to him.

Of course this wouldn't be a problem if he would do the same thing to me. When Sarah and Adam are talking, I can never join the conversation because I don't want to be pushy or annoying like he is. 
Also in class Adam tries his best to separate me and Sarah by sitting in-between us, and turns his back on me to talk to Sarah, which leaves me completely ignored for the rest of the class.
I confronted him about this, and he told me he has a crush on Sarah (big surprise) and that he will correct his ways. 

This lasted for 2 days, and he was back at it again.

Also every time I say something in our group chat that is meant for Sarah, Adam always answers to it first, no matter how stupid of an answer it is. 

What should I do about Adam? I don't want to lose Sarah because of Adams foolish actions. I am at a loss what to do.

Sarah doesn't seem to mind, but honestly, I don't know what she is thinking. Should I just try to hang out with her behind Adams back or what?

She is extremely clingy and refuses to give me space. If I do something wrong everyone has to know! 

I'm sorry if I'm just rambling on and not organizing this post very well. 

In conclusion, I've been putting up with this for 3 years now. And about 6 months ago I've been having major doubts with us. I'm never happy anymore. The only expression she shows me is either anger, depression, or a mundane attitude. I really have lost happiness and really don't think it will work out. I want to have a happy partner, not someone who only gets mad at me every day. We've been through so much that I finally told her it was over. (Note I've tried leaving several times before but keep finding myself crawling back to her). This time is different. I want out of this relationship. But I find myself up at night regreting my decision. Is it because I have nobody to talk to? Do I miss the feeling of someone caring? Its difficult and she cries and begs for me back but I keep saying no. Which honestly hurts so bad because I know I fell in love with her, and I know I want someone that cares for me, but I can't put up with a depressing relationship.

Also, note I'm really really good friends with her brother and like him a lot. Its hard to see him though because I don't want to see her and accidentally come crawling back to the same old depression relationship.

If anyone out there has dealt with this please give me advice. Will I eventually feel good? Am I making the right choice? What do you think?

Thanks.",21May2017,8
