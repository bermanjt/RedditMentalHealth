2,"So for some context here. She cheated on me about 4 months ago. It happened once, and after that they remained friends (though flirted) for month and nothing else before one or both of them broke it off (either the other guy or both, that's part remains unclear). I guess they had some connection a long time ago, and recently came back into contact and I guess it resulted in that. They were both very high when it happened (my gf rarely drinks or smokes), and never told me about it, though she said she planned to. A close friend of hers ending up telling me.

It really hurts because I didn't think she was capable of doing something like that to me, and it's hard for it to not change the way I view her in some ways. On top of that, she's my first girlfriend and we just passed our 1 year. Before I met her I was an emotional mess, highly socially anxious and depressed. The more time I spent with her though, the more confident and well adjusted I became. One of my biggest issues before I met her though, was that I felt like I wasn't worthy of being loved. She made me realize that I am worth it and that I'm not just a piece of shit. To be clear, I'm not saying that I'm putting all my emotional baggage on her and that if she left me I would be in shambles again. No, I still feel like a stronger person than I was before I met her, and I think I still would be if this relationship were to end. That said though, while I still feel worthy of love, I feel a bit less worthy now, not massively and not like before, but I do a little bit. 

 I found out about a week about and everyday is an emotional rollercoaster, and by the end I'm always emotionally drained and depressed. Sometimes it hurts really bad, other times it okay and I can move past it. Sometime I feel love for her, sometimes I can't. And it really sucks, wanting to love someone, but not feeling any love for them in that moment. I hope I can move past this I do. But right now I'm not sure.

I guess I'd just like to know, if you've been cheated on, did the relationship ever work out? Is cheating at all common? Can you learn to trust your SO again? I'm just looking for some clarity here. Is how I'm feeling normal and okay?",08Oct2017,3
3,"I'm part of a niche hobby community online. I'm 22 and a big part of my life is devoted to this. A bunch of people recently found my personal blog after a big ordeal involving people accusing me of not having Asperger's, when I have seen multiple people to get diagnosed. 

They are now accusing me of faking my illnesses - of which I have many - as my personal blog is sort of a chronicle of that. See, this would be normal, if it wasn't for them figuring out where I lived based on clues in personal photos, and for them finding out my deadname from... I have no idea. I'm transgender FTM and a deadname is your birth name that you no longer use as that ""you"" is no longer. I have tried deleting my stuff but they've already submitted it to web archiving services so I can't get rid of it, ever.

My disabilities and problems are Asperger's, ADHD, fibromyalgia, delayed sleep phase disorder, dyscalculia, light sensitivity, memory problems, paranoid anxiety, trauma-related stress problems, an unnamed hormone disorder, auditory processing disorder, major depressive disorder, psoriasis, chronic migraines, etc. 

I have been seeing a team of doctors and nurses for most of my life and apparently I've been ""tricking them"" for attention and they're going to ""expose me"" on some website for ""calling out"" people just looking for attention, including personal information. They have been leaving fake reviews as me, on the website of the medical centre that I go to, which they found out via a geotag I did not know that Instagram automatically put on my photo. I have been cornered by a nurse asking what the hell is going on.

This is scaring me. The site the hatred is hosted on is in Russia. Most of these people are completely shielded via anonymity. I am Canadian. They won't help me because they want to uphold free speech and do not bend to my country's authorities/laws. Any advice on how to get all of this removed? ",08Oct2017,9
6,I’ve recently met this guy and we’ve been getting to know each other pretty well. The problem is he seems to be taking things really fast and I feel like he’s more into me than I am to him. He’s really cool and we get along really well and we did click very quickly at the beginning. I also just don’t feel physically attracted to him at all but at the same time his personality makes him a lot more attractive. I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable and if it’s better to end things or if I should just go with it.

11,"So I've known my friend for a year, and for a number of reasons we really didn’t get close, even though I sort of wanted to.  We always get lumped together because we always seem to be together.  But for the past few months excluding the time we were completely apart we haven't spent that much time together, aside from school.  I even mentioned to her at one point that we haven't talked all that much, and she just said you're so busy its difficult to do anything.

She always seems to set the terms when we meet up; she asks me to dinner, she asks me to do something...the one or two times I tried to ask her to do something she sort of turned me down but then immediately asked me to do something incredibly similar with her.  It's weird, at least I feel it is.  Maybe I wasn't clear enough or she wants me to straight up ask her out but anyways....since we haven’t spent anytime together I thought I'd plan a special night out just to celebrate us getting through a few things.  Take her to a restaurant we've talked about, show her around like she's shown me around.  Either way it goes I'll be happy, but is it normal in a friendship, where there is a bit of tension, for the guy to suggest something.

TL;DR:  I haven't spent a lot of time with my friend, and we won't always be able to spend time together.  I'm feeling that I should make the most of the time we have left together.  Would it be really weird for me to take her out...just because I like spending time with her?                                                 ",08Oct2017,1

15,"So I met a girl on tinder and I actually thought she was really fun to hang with. She was a bit different then most girls I've hung out with before. After a few times getting lunch I asked her to my fraternities date party. She said yes. Basically to sum it up we got drunk and she got touchy and stuff, grinding, grabbing, and we  made out for a bit. (No sex tho. Cause I respect women). We were both drunk (she was a lot more drunk then I was) so I understood the sudden burst of ""fun"" we had. So the next day she wanted to hang out so we got lunch. We talked and laughed about all the dumb stuff we did that night and stupid videos and photos we took. I started to kinda (like very little) to get some feelings for her, and she asked me to go to a bar with her tonight. So I ended up going and I regret it. Couldn't get alcohol for either of us, it was packed and it's a smaller bar, and I hate country music (sue me). She kept going around to different guys she knew and hugged n stuff. Now I didn't really care cause we're not dating or anything, but it just kinda felt like she didn't care I was there. She got some alcohol from her friends and got drunk. Towards the end when I was considering leaving she moved away from me to some random dude and started dancing on him. At that point I was thought to just leave it at that and probs not really talk to her anymore cause that's not really my type. I texted her saying I was gonna go, but she needed a ride. So I waited outside the bar for her cause I wanted to make sure she got home safe. But she had left already and I didn't see her leave. So she didn't text me till she was back saying ""I already got a ride home with my friend"". The next day she sent me texts saying she was really sick. And then a Snapchat saying ""hey you're probably mad at me I'm really sorry"". And I just replied ""nah don't worry it's fine"".

19,"Hello. I have been having unexplained GI issues (nausea heartburn) mainly but among infrequent others. I'm 17 male and have been healthy all my life. I was on vacation last year (Sept. 14th) in Yellowstone and developed C Diff after taking medicine to get rid of strep throat. After that I fought with C Diff up until around June of this year (2017) when I saw a bit of improvement. I still feel sick but not as bad as when I had C Diff. But recently the severe nausea has come back and I'm at a loss. I have been to too many doctors to count and none of them have told me anything. My family has a history of gallbladder problems, but I had a HIDA scan and it came back negative. I am so stressed out about all of this. I am homeschooled and was finishing up with that when I got sick, but I haven't been able to start back and graduate. I have tried but the anxiety that I might start feeling sick or throw up has made me so paranoid that I can't even focus or concentrate on school. I was planning on going to college and becoming an IT technician, but seeing how stressed out my sister is in college I don't know if I could even handle that. And if I could, it could trigger all of this again and then I'm right back where I started. I can't even keep up my social life either. I tried to go see some movies, but I would leave the house and start feeling sick so I gave up on that. I've also tried playing video games with my friends online. But here recently I haven't been able too because I stress out about what to do if I'm in the middle of a mission and get sick and have to back out on all of my friends. All I do right now is sit at home all day and sleep in a recliner at night (to help acid reflux) I know that there are people out there that have it worse than me (cancer) but I don't really know that to do. My family isn't the best at listening and usually give my the same ""don't think about it, it'll be fine"" routine.

My parents own the house next door and said that I could rent, but I don't know what to do about paying rent and supporting myself.

22,"A bit of an explanation to my situation: I'm an 18 yr old female and just over a month ago I got hired as a meat cutter at my local grocery store. Right off the bat I know I didn't quite enjoy it, but it pays well so I cannot complain.

The thing is, I'm taking this year off before I start up college next year. I kind wanted to have a chill year until I started school again and worked doing a job I would somewhat enjoy. At this same grocery store I applied for overnight stocking (I love putting things away, cleaning, working odd late night hours) I managed to land an interview only for them to tell me that the job I applied for wasn't available (and that someone had already taken that position before me) so I had three options: bakery, meat market, and cashiering. I chose the meat market and immediately began training. I met the manager and she seemed super cool and all. 

Literally not even a couple days after training I was looking online and saw that they were hiring for overnight stocking, leaving me to believe that they lied to me about there being no openings in stocking because they just desperately needed someone in one of their departments. 

I waited out this job a bit and tested out the waters and literally had someone else in my family who called the grocery store and asked if there were any openings for overnight stocking and they said they desperately needed someone for it, literally when they told me the position was filled.

I called the store about switching departments, and about a couple days later I guess the word that I wanted to switch got around to my department's manager and her demeanor changed. She was cool in the beginning but got annoyed and snippy with me during training because I asked a lot of questions and kept making mistakes that I didn't realize were mistakes. I became kind of intimidated by her after she yelled at me for some mistakes I made at the counter. After word got around that I wanted to leave, she became overly nice to me and kept complimenting me on my hard work. She even pulled me aside a couple of times and asked me what was wrong, what can she do to help, not to give up, etc. 

I went to the head manager and told her I wanted to change departments TWICE and she was hesitant about me leaving my department because I know she doesn't want me to leave because they are short on people and no one is willing to work there. She told me to think my decision over twice now after visiting her office multiple times. She is trying to talk me out of switching but I already made my decision. Between her and my department manager trying to guilt-trip me, I became confused as to what to do.

I'm starting to understand and get good at my job, and everyone (even my department manager and head manager) recognize my hard work. They think I'm valuable to the meat department which is why they don't want me to leave, which I fully understand their reasoning. But I truly would like to stock overnight, even if it means less pay/hours. I may be good at the job I'm doing now but I'm just not happy but my managers are trying to guilt-trip and make me second guess my decisions. What should I do?",08Oct2017,1

I'm a 21 year old skilled tradesmen in the Midwest. I'm a total virgin, never held hands, kissed or anything like that. Pretty much my whole life I've been overweight, well morbidly obese actually. That paired with the fact I'm not exactly outgoing is why I find myself in my current situation. I know it's my fault and I have no one to blame but myself.

Over the last 8 months I've been working on improving my life, trimmed my duck dynasty like beard down and started eating better and taking better care of myself. I currently weigh 230 (I'm 5'11) down from 350+. When I was really heavy I pretty much accepted the fact I would be single forever without much thought. Since I've been losing weight I thought I'd wait until I hit my goal weight (of 170) and was at a healthy weight to try to meet a girl. This all changed last week when I had some friends over for a bonfire and the topic of me being single came up. They all encouraged me to try dating now, and for the last week it's been all I can think about.

Now my problem is that I'm never actually around girls my age. Most of my friends meet their girlfriends at school or work. I didn't go to college and work in steel mills and other heavy industrialized areas- 99% or more male. I don't really have any contact outside of work either. Same routine every week- gas station and grocery store every payday and hanging out with some buddies and their gfs once a week, usually just a bonfire or video games and beers. I also go to a lot of car shows but once again... almost all males.

As for me, I own a newer car and my own house. Average looks wise and average height. I'm not looking for a supermodel, and realize that the fact I'm still overweight will be unattractive to women, I have no problem with overweight women. My friends suggested I try tinder, but I thought that was a hookup app. I'm scared shitless of moving fast in a relationship, I have no idea what to do haha.

So what can I do to try and meet a girl? Any dating sites you would recommend for a 21 year old in my situation?",08Oct2017,7

Then we came back to the States, and we continued to find excuses for me to end up in his dorm. After awhile I started to catch feelings so I cut it off. A couple months later, I came clean to my boyfriend, we broke up. 3 years later and we're okay, rarely talk, but no hard feelings.

We live close to each other so we used to walk home and stuff but now she has work and private school after school almost every day or she gets driven home. I've noticed that she doesn't really make an effort to hang out with me, especially during the school year, although we do see each other at school and we started doing the same after school program together, which is fun i guess. 
when we do have a text conversation or something, i always initiate and she has told me that she is depressed but she doesnt tell people about it. this is due to stress that her mom puts on her. i always offer my help and ask if she wants to talk, etc. 
Okay, so she's very busy and aiming to get good marks and is very stressed out. i'm just upset because i have been the only one reaching out and asking to hang out and she hasnt agreed to hang out cuz she's busy ever since school started.

i dont have many friends, except the ones i talk to at school, but i guess i'm weird in that we dont share things in common or we dont have 'friend' chemistry so it feels forced to hang out. 
my friend often does things that are inconsiderate i find, which arent blatantly mean, but it doesnt take into account my feelings,  so what do you suggest i do?

 So one thing I struggle with is building friendships with people I barely know like coworkers or classmates. I think the biggest thing stopping me is the fact that I suck at holding a conversation.

45,"I'm 41 years old.  Before you start laughing, let me try and explain that my parents are successful, have taken care of me when I was in need and love me very much.  But they have ALWAYS, and continue to, lecture me about situations, choices, etc.  They think they know it all and I'm pretty sure it's because they have a distinct inability to empathize with people.  This means that they cannot understand or agree with people or situations that may be unfamiliar or unconventional to them until it has been proven successful or acceptable.  I'm not sure if a lot of people are like this or not.  I see it in myself sometimes and feel it's a bit natural, so when I get the lecture from my parents, I tend to listen....until today.

I'm dating a 24 yr old.  Tonight, during a discussion, my father indicated that, although my parents like this woman, they can't see how it will last.  He said that once she becomes infatuated with a guy her own age, I'll be old news.  He then proceeded to ask what will happen when she is 40 and I'm pushing 60.  Also, I have children (young) from another relationship and they are concerned with me I bringing my girlfriend around them because it may confuse the kids and their belief is that children shouldn't meet the girlfriend until it's very serious. So it's not that they disapprove of her, I guess they just disapprove of the relationship.

We've been dating for 8 months.  We have both said 'I love you' to each other.  I know that I mean it and can only speak for myself.  We've had a bunch of serious discussions about us and if this is serious and where it's going and it all seems like we are both serious, want a long term relationship and are committed to making it work.  We've also talked about the age difference.  It's tough to think about it objectively when you're in love.  Im been bummed in the past thinking that, yeah, I'll be 60 in twenty years and she'll only be 44.  I don't know exactly what to think about that.  I can only say that now I'm completely in love and very happy.  There's no talk of marriage or kids or anything  like that at all.  But we're past the dating phase.  So, after my parents threw this curveball tonight, I'm shaken.  I have to admit, up until now I have been thinking long term with this woman; she's honestly the one I think is for me. I've never totally disregarded my parents' advice before but there's a first for everything.  But, I'm the back of my head I'm concerned now...

Any positive advice? Or similar situations with happy endings?!!?

47,"A little background: The condominium complex I live in has had issues with homeless people and druggies trespassing lately. There are ""Private Property - No Trespassing"" signs up all around. We are right by the freeway and there is a hole in the fence behind the dumpster at the end of the parking lot. Shady characters like to walk through the hole and hang out on the other side. Sheriff has been called several times and by other residents, but not much has been done. We were advised to warn them that they were trespassing on private property and that the police would be called.

So this literally just happened. My boyfriend and I were out walking our dog and a shady guy came walking down the parking lot toward aforementioned dumpster and freeway hole. My boyfriend tells him that he is trespassing and that he needs to leave and that he was calling the cops. He refused and started approaching us. He begins threatening us and my boyfriend pulls out his knife and tells him to leave. He dares my boyfriend to stab him and says that he would find his friends and shoot us.

At this point, I'm nervous and just wanting to get to a safe place and call the cops. We walk away with him heading to the dumpster and still tossing threats at us. We call 911 and the cops arrive a few minutes later just as the guy is exiting the property. We go inside and a few minutes late, the sheriff comes to the door to speak with us. We let him know that it is a recurring issue and that something needs to be done.

I'm still shaking. He knows our faces and I'm worried that he will harass us, or worse. I'm not sure what to do at this point and I don't feel safe. I could use some advice on how to deal with this ...

50,"so first off, I just moved into a strange part of town. it is a larger, urban, US city that has high crime and poverty rates. the street that I moved to is just right outside of downtown, so it's like a weird transition area that blends residential and industrial (warehouses). there is a large, public university nearby so there are lots of younger, college students; however there are also two large homeless shelters nearby too, so also tons of vagrants aimlessly roaming around and loitering at all hours of the day and night.

the particular street that I moved onto has only a handful of houses (maybe 5) then several warehouses. it is a short, side street that runs between two main streets. the vagrants hang out on the warehouse stoupes, also wander around the street as well as hang out in the alley and empty lot next to my house. they are pretty much there 24/7 and they are very loud. they are constantly yelling, fighting, etc., even at very late hours of the night. not to mention they litter so much. the whole street is filled with empty malt liquor cans, brown paper bags, empty chips bags, etc. they always walk around with a can of malt liquor too; drinking openly, while they sit around and loiter, even in broad daylight. they literally dont give a fuck. just today, I also watched a group of them smoke a crack pipe in broad daylight, across the street from my home. shortly after, watched several more homeless folks do a blatant, hand to hand drug deal. I can't even leave the house either without at least one person stopping me to ask for money. the real kicker is, I've only been here for one week and have already seen this much action!

one night, I come home from grabbing some food and there are two vagrants literally hanging out on my god damn front porch! like wtf??? mind you, there are bars on the lower floor windows, a big yellow sign posted on the front of the house that says ""no trespassing, etc."", and a damn chain going across the steps, to keep people out! as I'm pulling into my driveway, I roll down my windows and ask them ""is there something I can help you with?"" they reply with ""my bad, we're just sitting down here...."" then I'm just like okaaaay... I immediately head inside and call the police, they got there surprisingly quick! they had both of them cuffed and hauled off to jail. I later did a little research to find out what they were charged with and one of them had a warrant out for a several charge indictment including ""armed robbery"", ""theft"", and ""kidnapping"". the other person was charged with drug possession (go figure). there are alot of bad apples constantly around here and I don't know how much longer I can last here. its only been one week and I'm already stressed to the max about all this.

what can I do to get this problem solved? I understand that the understaffed police department have their hands full and might not be able to help. I also fear that these people will learn that I am the one calling the cops on them and that they will somehow try to retaliate against me. My house is pretty damn isolated with an empty field on one side and warehouses on nearly every other point; I stick out like a sore thumb I suppose. I made a mistake moving here, but I was on a time crunch, I'm also a felon, so it was difficult finding a spot ASAP; plus it's very close to school..... somebody please help me!

I also already contacted my councilman, but they never get back to you.... they're worthless scumbags IMO.

I landed exactly where I aimed.  Immediately out of college, I scored a comfy and fairly well paying job doing IT work for a major corporation.  I worked there for 4 years, clocking in and out doing the 9-5.  I didn't feel like I was being challenged and my skills didn't progress.  If anything I felt more valuable in the workforce prior to starting work than after I started.  

During my time there I met a girl.  We seemed to click and have been on the track to getting married.  She took a job that involves traveling to a new city every 3 months or so.  I decided to take a sabbatical and follow her.  

CAREER:
It's been a couple months and I've had a lot of time to myself.  It forced me to quickly address those questions of 'what would you do if you didn't have to work'?  ...I feel like I should learn more programming / development skills so that I can get a job that challenges me more, but I’m not convinced that I actually like programming.  I don’t want to get some other corporate job and end up in the same place I was at.  I’ve always been a little more sociable than a typical engineer, but not attractive enough to work in sales.  My current degree is a mix of business and tech.

RELATIONSHIPS:
I also struggle to understand if the typical family-starting path is for me or not.  I've always been the guy who dated girls for a long time.  Most girls that I dated, I dated with the intent to eventually marry.  Maybe its popular media, but the general consensus seems to be that most married guys with families are miserable / trapped.  Is this something people experience?  Things between my gf and I haven’t been going particularly well, but I’ve been devoted to making things work and things seem to be turning around recently.  

On the other hand, my lack of casual sex in my life has me sort of thinking it would be a good idea to get that out of my system.  Obviously, this would involve leaving my current SO.  Although it’s been rough lately, I still love her and I’m not immediately seeking to leave.  Things just seem like they would be easier if I didn’t have to factor in her situation for every decision I made.  I guess that’s a part of being in a relationship though.  What is the default response to that?  Are all people in relationships completely happy with losing that bit of freedom?

Sorry for the poorly structured request, but I’m looking for any help / advice that I can get.  Is there a better subreddit for these types of questions?

73,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a while now. About a year ago before she was dating me she had some shit happen with her step-brother. I won't go into details, but basically it ended with her getting a restraining order against him. I think since then (maybe this started before, but it wasn't nearly as prevalent) she's had problems struggling with depression, anxiety, as well as some PTSD according to her therapist.

Her step-brother and her were pretty close before all this happened, so now she has this tendency to become afraid that something's going to happen with anyone she's close with and she'll lose them, and because of this she'll ask me stuff like ""Are we okay?"", ""Do you hate me now?"" etc.

Now she's said she really knows I love her, and I absolutely do. We were best friends before, and it's only gotten better since we started dating. She's generally comfortable telling me anything that's bugging her, or if she's really feeling shitty that day, and I'm glad that she can. But the issue is, she usually won't tell anyone else besides me and a couple of her closer friends. But she isn't able to tell her therapist, probably the person who could help her deal with it best.

The therapist she had before was awful from what I heard, but I haven't heard her complain about this new one like she did with the first one. She just refuses to tell her the really big shit that's bothering her and let her help.

76,"If there is a better subreddit for this type of question please let me know.

On to my problem. I apologize for the length of the post but there needs to be a little backstory to make my problem a little bit more clear.

Through several years of research, I have uncovered some rather unsettling things about my father's side of the family. The only people who know the answers are deceased and have been for decades. 

My paternal great grandmother was first married at 18 in 1912 (my father was a surprise baby born in 1950. His siblings were all adults when he was born.) Four and half months after this marriage took place she gave birth to baby boy (my paternal grandfather). 

Ferdinand, my grandmas husband, swore up and down that the baby wasn't his and he wasn't aware that she was pregnant (corsets were still a thing and hiding a baby bump was much easier). He never had sex with her and she carried to term.

They divorced in 1920 when my grandfather was 8 years old. Ferdinand had run off while still married to my great grandma and married another woman (therefore comminting bigamy).

Between October 1920 (when the divorce was granted) and the birth of Harold (her second so ) in August of 192, Hannah (my great grandma) married her second husband. Unfortunalty, this marriage did not take place in Iowa where they both lived because there was no marriage certificate to be found by the public records office. Which leaves 47 possible other states (Alaska and Hawaii not becoming stated until the 1950s) where they could have been married, or Canada. 

I know that Alfred (Hannah's first son) is my paternal grandfather. This is not in question. 

My father is unsure who his mother is. At first growing up he thought is was one woman, then he was told he was someone else. However, the second woman who was found in the census reports says she was married to my dads uncle Harold, and that she didn't have a son by my fathers name. 

So. Two questions.

Can I by some miracle figure out who my biological great grandfather is? 

Can I find out who my biological paternal grandmother is?

Reasons why this may be impossible:

My great grandmother Hannah was born in 1894, meaning she would be 123 today. She passed long before I was born and took her secret to her grave. 

Her first husband was very abusive and a drunk and is also deceased, though I doubt if he knew the child's origin.

My grandfather and supposed grandmother are also deceased, my grandfather passing a month after my own birth. 

Is there a way, without locating grave sites and exhuming them for a DNA test (which is extremely costly and time consuming, not to mention the red tape) that I could find any clues to my actual origins?

77,"My former coworker, who left our job abruptly several months ago (in the middle of his shift), has been posting some very odd things on his Facebook page and on the page of a fellow coworker. Looking at his page, it seems his long-time girlfriend has just left him and he's very upset about it.

He was always a pretty decent guy when I talked to him at work, but I'd say we were really just acquaintances. He was having a rough time when he left too, as his aunt had just died and he was being written up for some bullshit reason I can't recall at the moment. I haven't spoken to him since he left, but we remained Facebook friends.

The problem is, he's been asking several of my female coworkers, all at least 15-20 years younger than him, if they would be willing to go out with him. At least one of these requests has been posted publicly on a female coworker's Facebook page. When she politely refused his advances, he said the following (posted about 2 hours ago):

""I was always to shy but if you ask around asked always about you that's why I always made those little comments to you. But they were just friend comments. I also asked Artemis7797. I'm just trying to gain friends . It's been lonely since My loss. But seriously you were different I always pass by there and want to stop and visit but not sure how every one feels about me since I walked out. But nevermind guess no one believes me so I'll leave you all alone and go back to my dark hole sorry to bother you.""

I don't remember him asking me out at all, either in person or online. His ex-girlfriend has also made some public accusations against him (again on Facebook), claiming he was controlling and was also a registered sex offender. 

I really don't know the guy that well. On one hand, if he is manipulative and controlling, I don't want to turn his attention on me. On the other hand, he was always quite nice and funny at work, and if he's really struggling I don't want to sit here and do nothing.

78,"Part 1

For the past year, I've been hating going to work. I miss a lot of days at work just because I don't feel like going. The thought of going to work there has been making me feel sad recently and I feel that I'm no longer challenged and have plateaued as a person. My job is very goal driven, yet I've maximized the efficiency of production a person can possibly output, yet half the job and it's results are in large part influenced by factors that i can't control. With that in mind, there's weeks we don't hit our goals despite clearing every possible task. If there's not enough flow of product coming in, you can't just pull production out of your ass. The higher ups in the company don't seem to understand this. Me and my coworkers can't turn water into wine, so to speak. This is a big part of what makes me dislike working this job.

I recently finished university and the job I currently work is not related to what I study. However, I found a work opportunity that is also not related to what I studied, but will allow me to spread my wings (so to speak) and thrust me into new experiences. The trade off is that this potential opportunity pays less per hour than my current job, but the potential job is full time, whereas my current job is part time. I eventually plan to find something related to my degree and ultimately go back to university or college for a masters or post grad diploma, but I want to make money and experience new things for a bit.

What should I do?

TLDR; 
Part 1: job makes me unhappy
Part 2: finished university, unhappy job (part time) isn't related to my degree. Another job I'm looking at is also not related to my degree, but is full time and will let me experience new things. The new job pays less per hour. Plan to go back to school in future.

What do you think I should do?",08Oct2017,9

I don't like the arts, I mean I spend time drawing etc, but I don't imagine making a career out of it.
Not interested in political science, psychology, economics, business, English arts... you name it I've taken the class. And I haven't put 1/10th of an effort in all those classes combined than I do my mathematics classes. It's just like.... I like doing math. I like solving the puzzles. I like knowing I can do it. But I don't exactly see what I can with math all day. I'd like to apply it like with engineering...but...Just because I'm good with the math doesn't mean I'd be good with the engineering right?
And then I really love my biology classes. Anything science related I just love. I can read about it all day I just don't know if i can make a decent career from it.

82,"I’m a freshman in college. The other day I was chilling with a couple friends and a girl in my dorm. All my friends had left and I was just with this girl watching a movie. I’m not attracted to this girl and didn’t want to do anything with her so while the movie was going on I was hoping the girl would leave or say she wants to go home. But she didn’t. She stayed and eventually she decided to sleep over. 

Now I had the option at sleeping at a friends dorm but I thought it would weird to leave this girl in my room alone so I decided to just try and get a nights sleep. Throughout the night, I couldn’t tell if she was just asleep and shifting around or if she wanted something to happen because she kept trying to get really close to me and cuddle or something. 

I’m a virgin and have never been in a relationship with a girl or anything so I wasn’t sure what it was to “make a move.” I had a feeling she wanted to do something because of how close she kept getting to me so I started rubbing her leg. After a bit she rolled over and I tried to start fingering her, but it was extremely awkward and I felt like I wasn’t doing anything. She rolled over and I got super embarrassed so I turned my back to her and spent the rest of the night trying to catch some sleep.

To be honest I’m retarded and I don’t know if I made an attempt to make a move and she wasn’t in the mood or if I sexually assaulted her. I want to right my wrongs and I think I made a mistake, so it’s really been bothering me if I fucked up.

Edit: I appreciate all the comments. I realize I fucked up really bad and I’ve felt a lot of pressure to get with girls so that probably played a part. I wasn’t thinking straight but this is really something that I learned from.",08Oct2017,4

121,"So I need some help figuring out my life, in a very broad sense. I am probably the luckiest person I know, to be alive that is. I've made a lot of poor impulsive decisions, and quite frankly it's bizarre that I'm still here, and that my brain still functions well. I want to live a full, happy life, and I feel as if I'd be smacking god (I'm not religious) in the face if I didn't. Let me explain why.

Some background information: I'm a 22 year old male, about 6 ft 140lb, pretty normal looking. I have two parents who arguably did a poor job of raising and loving me as a kid, but who support me now, allow me to live in their house, fund schooling, don't charge me rent, etc. I have plenty of great, honest, caring friends back in New Jersey, as well as a girlfriend who shows me more love than I knew was possible, but my older brother moved out this past November and I havnt heard from him. I have half the credits needed for my bachelors degree, I've been out of school for a year, and I have little to no money. I'm currently staying with my childhood best friend down in Florida. I've been here for a month now and I'll be heading home fairly soon. The whole point of this trip was to get out of bad habits, away from bad influences, and essentially start over, mentally. Ideally I'd come home a new man; I'd come home excited and ready to start making good decisions.

On to the specifics. First and foremost, I have been in the midst of a crippling substance abuse problem on and off (mostly on) since I was 17. I dabbled in drugs starting when I was 15, but it didn't become a problem til my senior year in high school. Halfway through the year, my first ever girlfriend (who I thought was utterly perfect in every way possible) broke up with me. It was rough, especially considering she broke up with me 2 weeks beforehand, but begged for me back the next day, swearing on her LIFE that she'd never leave my side again. ""I swear on my life even if you don't take me back I'll never touch anyone else as long as I live""... Two weeks later it was ""I don't love you anymore""...she denied it no matter how much I begged for brutal honesty; she didn't tell me she had cheated until a year later. My emotions were already way out of wack from all the speed, so, naturally, I took more speed to cope. I swear, I could go from ""fuck this I'm making sure I die tonight"" to ""everything is going to be fine. She'll be happy, I'm happy"". Once I got to college and had access to money and no encounters with my parents, things started getting out of hand. 5 nights a week id snort sleeping pills and take double digit shots til I couldn't walk, blow coke and molly til I could, then drink again til I couldn't. Then more lines until it was light out. Somehow I was still working out and running, in the best shape of my life, super fit, and my grades, even as a CS major, were great. Still, I was really depressed. The people at that school were sickening, I hated the world and most of the people in it, myself included, and I missed my ex like hell. Then came second semester.

As it happened, the two biggest dealers from my home town went to the same college as I did, and lived on the floor below me. In addition to that, I met a girl down the hall who was OBSESSED with me and had a whole drawer full of prescriptions. It was INSANE how many pills she had. Hundreds, maybe even thousands, all prescribed over the years. I told her that because I was still hung up on my ex, I couldn't touch her unless I was blacked out. Somehow, she was cool with that, and it only motivated her to dish me more pills. This was when I first got into xanax, and went on my first bender. I ate disgusting amounts of both xanax and adderall/vyvanse/Concerta (speedy add medications). I took so much everyday I wouldn't sleep OR remember anything. When I finally ran out, I had no idea what I was in for. Cold turkeying 10-20mg xanax/day is horrifying, painful, and deadly. I had more than one seizure. It felt like I was on 20 grams of molly I had so much energy, in a terrible way. At one point I was convinced I was dead for about half an hour. Once my friend signed off skype I got into bed, and what came next was like nothing I've ever experienced. I looked up to check the time, it was 7:12am. Then, I heard a loud ""zapping"" noise, and my whole body shook. I felt it start in my feet, travel up my whole body and into my brain. It was so painful, like I was being electrocuted inside my head. Then another one came. I tried to catch my breath. Another. And another. I was exhausted, it had been too much for too long. I looked up at the digital clock on my roomate's nightstand. 7:13am. My eyes filled with tears. I was going to die, and I knew it. I gave up.

I honestly don't remember anything after that, I didn't regain consciousness til around 2pm. Maybe I blacked out, maybe I slept. Either way the next few weeks sucked. I was awake for the first 6 days straight. I had to leave school mid semester cause I was losing my shit and borderline suicidal. 

Sophomore year first semester, day 1: My dealer shows up to my room with all his products. ""I'm pledging this semester and they say I can't sell. You're gonna be my proxy. Pay me back $1600 when you have it"" and gave me everything. I'm apparently a pretty trustworthy guy, or at least likable. Shit went down pretty much the same way, only worse. I was taking so much adderall I was hallucinating, and so much xanax I hardly remembered shit. At one point I accidentally took 2.65g of molly and got seratonin syndrome, and I also got pretty deep into painkillers, all at the same time. Once again, I had to leave school early.

Since then, I've taken classes at local schools, experienced similar issues on and off while at home, and eventually transferred to Rutgers. Things didn't go any better there. I reconnected with a girl from high school who I knew my whole life and we started dating. It was really great but I couldn't stay off drugs, nor could I be honest with her about it. I did poorly my first semester, broke up with her, fucked around with another girl over winter break (another drug related DISASTER, she ended up fucking one of my friends cause I told him to when I was blacked out and he told her I was cool with it so she was salty), and then went back for my second semester, single. I stayed clean for the first month, but after that things quickly went down hill. I was selling and using a LOT and having sex with strangers on the reg. I was seeing a substance abuse counselor who eventually called my parents because she was concerned I might die. When my mom arrived she saw me and yelled ""WHO ARE YOU?!! YOURE NOT MY SON!!! WHO ARE YOU??!!"". Not the right thing to say, but in her defense I was at about 115lb, and again, I'm 6 ft tall and somewhat muscular. Then, it was summer time.

Naturally, I continued selling over the summer. I finally had the perfect connects and customer base, so shit lit up fast. Before I knew it, I had plenty of money, an excess of weed and pills, and I was even being moderately responsible about it. Only 1-4mg xanax/day on the weekdays (I told myself I was tapering off from the previous semester cause during finals week I hit an all time high of 50mg/day). One day, my dealer hit me up practically BEGGING me to buy something called ""fentynal"". I looked it up and, for the money, it was a decent deal, but I said no. He kept pushing and sweetening the deal until I couldn't say no. I asked a friend (who routinely bought oxy in the hood) to sell them for me there. He said fuck no that stuff will only kill people I'm not going to jail. So I set out to prove him wrong. I took some speed and some xanax, and decided to give the fentynal a try. Just for reference, fentynal is 50+ times stronger than heroin. Dealers who cut their heroin with fentynal are notorious for killing people. Once that shit went up my nose it had my soul. Nothing else mattered. 24 hours later, I did one too many lines. I was sitting there typing on my phone as I am now, and all of a sudden my message read ""Llllllllllll"". I deleted and tried again. Halfway through the message, I blink, and ""mmmmmmmmmnnnn"". Then I'm sitting on the couch, staring at the back of someone's head. Long, curly brown hair, like both my ex's. I reach out to grab her, but she's too far away. I can't reach her, but I keep trying. Next thing I know, I'm lying on my back looking up at some gorgeous paramedic, higher than I've ever been in my life. I had died, but only for a minute at most. I was taken to the hospital, where I saw my parents. Everyone I knew was mortified. People don't do that shit in my town, overdoses around here just don't happen. The cops got all the fentynal, plenty of weed, wax, and xanax, but I wasn't charged because it was an overdose. I decided that night that I was finished with drugs besides weed, even that I wanted to use less of. I stopped taking xanax, felt pretty okay, and spent the next 2 days hiking and going for walks with my friend. I was happy, confident, and excited to live life sober. 

On the third day, I was walking home for dinner, about a quarter mile from home, when everything disappeared. I had lost consciousness, I was having a seizure. I fell six feet down to the pavement face first, and proceeded to beat the shit out of the hot pavement in a cheese grader like fashion. Luckily, some random woman saw me flopping around and called 911. By the time they arrived, I was dead. One of the paramedics was someone I knew, and while I don't remember this, he told me after being zapped twice my heart started up again, and I tried to punch him in the face cause he wouldn't tell me what my name was. I was dead for 4 minutes. At this point, staying off drugs clearly wasn't safe enough so I went to rehab. It was fucking wack. Those places are for alcohol and opioids, they don't know shit about benzos.

Six months later I overdosed again and had to be rushed off to the hospital. I went to rehab again. After that, I had 4 months clean and a job, but then I went on a nasty meth bender and had to be hospitalized again where my heart rate dropped to 30 beats/minute. My girl wrote her number down before they shipped me off to the psych ward, but when she handed it to me I ate it because I thought it was xanax. They shoved a catheter up my dick just to wake me up and it didn't work. Since then, I've been hospitalized once, and had a stroke/overdose a few months ago that I didn't go to the hospital for. That all happened this summer. Since I clearly couldn't stop, I decided to take this trip out to Florida in order to get my shit back together. I've been working, exercising, and staying clean, but I'm going back home soon.

WHAT CAN I DO to help make sure I don't repeat my mistakes? I have nothing I'm passionate about, and I do try to do new things all the time. Maybe I just need to go back to school? But school makes me feel like I need adderall or meth. Weed helps me stay clean but it hurts my productivity and motivation. I feel like the reason I relapse is usually that I get sick of life and become so depressed and miserable that even my LIFE isn't worth not doing drugs for. I NEED to get it right and keep it right this time, otherwise I fear my friends, family, and my girlfriend will give up on me, and I'll have nobody, homeless. This is a very real fear, no one is going to support a drug addict forever. 

Sorry this was so long, I wasn't planning on writing it like this but I kind of got carried away, plus I want to provide details to help me get more precise and helpful responses, from those who actually read it.
This was my vacation where I'm supposed to reinvent/fix myself but obviously I don't feel much different. How do you guys get out of bed everyday knowing the one thing you want most is the one thing you can't have? I feel like I need other things to get addicted to, like that's my only hope. Any recommendations for stuff that's easy to get really into? Like running, working out, basketball, soccer, Reddit, runescape. Any and all advice is welcomed and much appreciated.

Thanks

126,"Story time. So I'm still living with my family at 27 years old. Reason being that I live in NYC and renting isn't exactly cheap. I didn't go straight to college after HS. I stayed to help my family survive by working dead end job after dead end job. we're stable now (3 siblings, two with jobs, one pregnant and jobless) and I want to move out. Problem is that:



- One brother is lacking motivation to go get his GED so he can move up from his Bi-weekly minimum wage job.





- The other brother is paid weekly but has irregular hours and so isn't always sure of the total and is also paid minimum wage. He's also 20 years old and irresponsible with his money. Also needs to get his GED.





- My pregnant 26 year old sister (whose man is immature and has left her) has not worked in 4 years. She swears she'll get a job after the baby is born but I still worry. She also has attitude problems.





- Mother is on SSI, unable to work after getting hurt on the job years ago.





I've put off dating until I move out (Stupid early 20's me) and focused on keeping them afloat, but now I've become depressed.  My siblings don't want to advance in life. They tell me I'm looking down on them when I tell them what they need to do. They'd rather work shit jobs forever. Right now, I could leave, but I always worry that one of them will get laid off or mom will die and I won't be able to help them. I'm stuck mentally. I've begun to turn to escapism with my hobbies (Gaming, anime figure collecting).






Overtime at work has been increasing and so I can't even get back to studying C++ and when I do try, I always get bored and return to my hobbies.

What this means is my house is two stories, but my room is literally the entire second story. At the top of our stairs (no landing) is a door and that leads directly to my room. For this reason, all of the heat in the house logically goes to my room, and it stays there. Because of this my room is usually 3-4, maybe 5 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. I've tried my best to keep it cool (window open when it's lower 70s out, keep the thermostat as low as possible, etc.) but nothing really helps. As we speak the thermostat is at 71 and I'm sweating balls. What can I do? My mom doesn't want to get any sort of window unit because apparently they're pretty expensive to run, and the attic doesn't really vent fast enough to pull air from my room.

Lately I've been having an uneasy feeling she could be losing feelings for me and hiding things. Sex is rare for us...its been rare for 3 years, so I guess it has just become normal for us. We used to not be able to keep our hands off eachother though. There is a person at her work we always argue about. He was first known as the company flirt, being inappropriate in the mostly female workplace. After some time of course they became close. She says its 'strictly proffessional' But I've noticed over this year or so she's been deleting text messages and being very secretive with this person (who is also married). I've told her my frustration before and she just thinks I'm overreacting and as a result becomes more secretive. My gut feeling keeps me awake at night and its always in the back of my mind that they are closer than coworkers should be. I dont know what to do. Married women shouldn't have to delete things unless they're hiding something and that's just a fact. I am loyal, I am strong, and I will always become better than the person i was yesterday.

So I have started my masters of architecture part time while have started working as a sole trader part time in the residential design part of the architecture/ drafting industry. I went into this thinking I can handle it all and I still think I defineatly after ehat I have learnt from the experience these last 4 months.


However, i have a design unit which I have fallen behind on as well as another due to client projects which i needed to do (it pays the bills) where i did around 35 hours per week over the last 2 weeks which i dont usually do (usually 25 per week).


I am/ feel i am so far behind and dont think it is physically possible for me to get any good marks in the next assignment due on the 16th of this month for design (we have to come up with concept design for a city block and 350m high office and hotel tower. Due that same week is another assignment for another unit but i can defineatly do that one on time and well, but in doing so it will eat up into the time left for work and the design assignment. 


I am very afraid i will fail the unit and it will be put onto my uni record permanetly which may affect chance of me getting scholarships/ study abroad oppprtunities and many more in the future. Prior to this, I have never failed a university unit in my life and its taking a huge toll on me. 


Lesson learnt though, i bit off more than i could chew and from now on will be sticking with smaller or medium scale design studios. Whats any advice or coping advice? Am i going to be ok?

137,"My brother (16) has autism, if that helps. I don't have much of a relationship with him. I haven't had an actual conversation with him since we were little kids. No, before you ask/ call me out, the reason I don't have a good relationship with him is because he treats me like shit, not because he's autistic.

Recently, my brother has started abusing one of my cats. He would chase her around, pick her up and shake, and squeeze her. He would hit the cat. He one time hit the cat for sitting on his jersey. The cat is terrified of him. She has always been an anxious cat, and ever since this started it got worse. She barely even leaves my room! I asked my brother many times why he didn't like my cat. He refused to tell me, but eventually told me he didn't like the cat because it didn't have a tail.)

I really don't want to rehome my cat. She's a very anxious kitty and only feels truly safe when she's around me. I thought about moving her to my dad's house with my other two cats, but the other cat here at my mom's will become to stressed.

My brother doesn't listen to me. I tried to get my mom to help, but she doesn't do anything because she thinks him being autistic justifies his actions (wtf mom).

140,"My best friend has been in a relationship for around 4 years now, the relationship has always been strange, sometimes he’s a really nice person but if they get into arguments it gets abusive (emotionally). He calls her stupid and you can see over the years now he’s ruined any amount of self esteem she once had. Any arguments they have he twists it so she’s made to feel guilty and as though it’s all her fault. 

Anyway, recently he’s decided that he’s not sure if he wants to be with her anymore/doesn’t see a future. This has naturally effected my friend a lot, she’s very sad about it and is trying to make it work. So they’re still together (kind of) now but in the space of a month he’s: cheated, lied, ignored, physically and emotionally abused her. 

I’ve told her to just let him go, he doesn’t want to be with her and she needs to accept it, but she just won’t listen. After all of this she’s still hoping that it’s going to fix itself and they’ll be fine and that if they break up she’ll “never get over it”. 

Does anyone have any tips so I can make her see sense? I feel like I’ve tried everything.

My partner (?) of two years mom has recently been diagnosed with advance cancer, she starts her treatment soon. I live almost 3 hours away from my partner, she is obviously heart broken. I want to be there for her support her and I know she knows this, however she is so drained that she doesn't even want to talk seemingly at all, she doesn't want to talk about her mom or how she herself is feeling. Nor does she want to talk about her day or trivial small talk, she says she has no energy for both. I completely get it and I understand, I just don't really know what to do.

Which leads on to my next port for advice, I have a job interview in my partners town soon and the job is ideal, decent enough pay, room for growth, the kind of job I can see myself really enjoying. I have also just secured a job in my home town, but the pay is bad, no room for growth, something I don't really want to do, not linked to my college degree at all. 

Prior to my partners mothers diagnosis about 4 months ago my partner and I broke up, we have kind of got back together, but she says she sees no future with me, I feel like the situation that we've fallen into (we don't really acknowledge anything thats going on between us any more) is more than likely going to come to an end soon as I know my partner can't balance it all. Plus I'm slowly becoming more and more down about the fact that I'm in a farce of a ""relationship"" with someone who I adore, but doesn't love me back and has the ability to make me feel like shit.

What should I do if I get the job? My support is in my hometown, my family, I don't really have too many friends so that's not really an issue, the comforts that come with home. I do however know a few people in the town that the job interview is in, so I won't be completely alone.

What should I do about my relationship, about my partner? She is my best friend I just feel like I'm close to not being able to handle it anymore, I want to feel like she can let me in. I know it sounds pathetic and needy and the situation she is in should not be about me at all. I know she worried about my mental health, she is also worried that if I get the job that I'm going to think that everything between us will work out. I don't I just want to secure myself a career.

Something has changed and he has snapped. He brought a bag of weapons to work with him and showed how he wanted to “cut people up”and told stories about murders and the most bizarre claims you can imagine.
He has stalked several women and one male co worker who reported him for his odd behaviour. He has described how he has killed people in great detail “when I was in the xxx (insert various special forces)”


It was so dreadful that in the morning there was an emergency meeting with HR and he was told he had to take time off. He now says he is in “killer mood” and “will kill on instinct”.


He is paranoid and said he never takes the same route twice when leaving the house. He thinks people are out to get him.
He will most likely be fired, and I am afraid of what that will do to his already disturbed mental state.
The boss felt it would be mean to make him turn his keys in, so he still got compelte access to the workplace. He feels betrayed and is losing the job, the only thing that was normal in his life, his only break from isolation.

Now she has friends and is sometimes having fun on her own etc which should be okay with me but I'm always worried about something. Not really that she is cheating on me but that she smokes for example or drinks too much. I have an irrational hate for smoking (cigarettes) and I just can't stand it even if she just smokes 1 cigarette a month. 

Yesterday a (male) friend of her was here and at first everything was fine but then we grabbed something to eat and for some reason, I constantly made some spiteful comments about them drinking after school 2 bottles of wine because they did a few weeks ago and that made me mad. (And I still feel like that was pretty shitty of her. She did not tell me anything and suddenly came home drunk right after school because they sat at the river here drinking wine - but it should not make me that mad)

A day later her friend texted her that he should not see her until we fix our problems and that this seemed ""too much"" and that he realized how happy he can be with his relationship compared to ours. Now she's obviously very sad and I'm super sad and mad at myself because she might lose a very good friend because I'm such an asshole.

Btw she is 24 and I'm 26. This guy I just talked about is 28 and they go to class together.

In my heart, I feel like I'm a very good person but this anger and all my frustration just kills me inside. I really want to change that but I just don't know how. I'm on medication since years already and have gone through 3 therapies already but nothing seems to help. 

I'm not sure what else I could write. I feel like I'm jealous of here for having friends and doing stuff while I'm always sitting at home alone. I want to go outside but .. then not really. When I'm outside I wanna go back home, when I'm home I'm sad because I'm always just at home. It's so stupid. 

Oh I also sometimes can't handle her past because she was sexual ""very active"" and had threesomes etc while she is the only girl I ever slepped with. It goes so far that I can't even watch porn with 3 people in it without thinking about it. This was gone for a while but now with all the problems, we are currently facing it popped up again.",08Oct2017,2

171,"TLDR at bottom

So my neighbors have two kids. One of them tried to stomp on my cat Max last month(happened on my side of the yard if that matters). Just this morning as I was getting into my car for work I saw the other kid out with his B.B. Gun and figured he was just shooting at trees until I saw him aim it at Max and shoot. Luckily I ran towards my cat so he ran off and didn't get hit but the kid showed absolutely no remorse and denied even pointing the gun towards my cat despite me seeing him do it.

I've talked to their parents before when I saw one of them try and stomp on my cat but I got the ""my kid would never do that!"" Reaction from them. I'm going to confront their parents when I get home from work (they had already left for their jobs when I saw it happen) in hopes that they do something about it but I don't think it'll do any good. I'm wondering if filing a police report would help? Maybe get the parents to realize I'm serious about the situation?

Boyfriend and I are getting a camera installed for that side of the house after this morning's incident so we can have 100% evidence that these kids are actively trying to hurt Max the next time it happens (god knows what they're doing when we aren't home). A kid trying to stomp my cat while he's taking a nap in our yard already crosses the line but you don't point a gun, even if it's just plastic pellets, at my cat and expect me to sit back and do nothing if I have the ability to do something about it. 

TLDR; neighbors kids have tried to stomp on my cat and have now tried to shoot him with a BB gun. Parents think the kids are innocent but I saw both instances with my own eyes as it happened. I'm wondering if I should file a police report if talking to the parents doesn't work again.",08Oct2017,43

179,"I want to arrange a meeting with my boss. I don't think that in itself will seem too strange because we are supposed to have one to one meetings at least twice a year and I haven't had one since this time last year. I have not been happy at work for some time and there are 2 major issues that I see as the reason why: 1. I have social anxiety and I struggle to make decisions/feel anxious very often, and 2. My boss is not a supportive person and is very critical of me. What I want from the meeting is to essentially ask for help - explain that there have been some specific times where I have felt unsupported and it is affecting my well being/job performance. But I don't want it to become confrontational. My boss has been off a lot this year - in her words she has 'had a year from hell' but I am of the opinion that she has been overly dramatic in taking the time off and neglected her work (and her staff) in the process. I don't want to let my feelings about this spill out though, I want to keep it professional. I'm afraid that it either will become confrontational or I will get upset. Has anyone got any experience of speaking to managers about problems at work? Should I mention the social anxiety (I was on medication for a while for this, now off it. I did have an appointment with a therapist that had been cancelled because of staff shortages (including my boss being off)). I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for some one to one feedback - but are there any managers out there who would offer an perspective on an employee doing this? I am going to go for promotion soon (elsewhere in the company) so I suppose on the one hand I could just ride it out until then, but then on the other I think my work performance would improve if I spoke out and this would give me a better chance at the promotion.

I don't really know how to write this, but I feel I'm on my own so this seems to be my only choice. 

I'm currently in my third year of university, living in a city away from my uni, so I have to commute 15 minutes via train, but I moved here with my girlfriend and live in a student house so have three other housemates But around 2 weeks ago myself and my girlfriend decided to call it quits, but still remain friends. Prior to this I got a job around a month and a half ago at a local supermarket but I chose a 4am-8am shift which is seriously starting to effect my anxiety. With uni starting up last week work is seriously taking it's tole, as In I'm struggling to wake up at 3am for work so I've been missing days of work and can't bring myself to mention it to any managers and I'm really lost.

Also doesn't help that my ex-girlfriend is a seeing a guy and he's been coming over alot and now staying over which when it comes to go to sleep my anxiety is going overboard and I'm literally a shaking mess with every creak of a bed or every voice I hear and I hate it so much.

I just really need some help, some advice, anything. I've never felt so worthless, and although I don't feel suicidal, I have felt 'what if' I just disappeared without a trace. I really don't feel myself, and the crippling thought of work and the possibility of not having any money is adding to the pile. I don't know what to do, I can't bring to tell my parents or anything, i'm 21 by the way, and I don't know how I can bring it up with anyone, all I do is keep it locked up inside of me and I'm really starting to not care anymore.

183,"I am a 16 year old boy currently in grade 11. Last year in grade 10 i used to be depressed and was reluctant to go to school as i didn't have many friends and was constantly bullied. Fast forward to grade 11 in the beginning i was one of the ""cool kids"" of the class and used to hang out with the cool ones. I had many friends (even a group). After that a girl (not part of the group) put allegations on me that i harrassed her and even cried during class. That was one of the turning points. Nobody supported me. Except one. Later it was found out that she cried due to other reasons and just to cover her up she put my name. Then i had a spat with one of my mates in the group (she was kinda the closest to me).. But this time i was at fault and apologized. There's also one heck of a long story which ruined my friend circle. Here's i put it up. One of my closest friends was having issues in his relationship. I didn't listen to his side. Instead went on to support the girl. Which eventually ended the 2 year relationship. THIS HAS GREATLY AFFECTED ME. But then i came in a relationship with one of the new girls in my school and almost forgot my friends.. Gave her all the priorities. This also was one of the factor.

186,"Like the title says. I'm a 19 year old guy from Holland. I come from the big city, but simultaneously I grew up on the countryside in the mountains. That tore me apart into two very different persons. After I finished high school I went to study Computer Science at a prestigious Dutch uni. Worst decision of my life.

I was always quiet. Had little friends. I was diagnosed with autism at a younger age. I refused professional help for that. As of last year, I think I've mostly grown out of that. But it's only in my mind. I have one weird complex where I refuse to show my family and friends that I've changed. And I have changed, big time. I was the computer nerd in school. Spent days playing games. Picked up programming at age 12. I had halflong hair. I didn't hadn't had my hair cut for almost a year at some point. I didn't do any kind of sports. Took no care of my body in general (well, except for showering). I didn't get braces when I had the chance so I've got to live with messed up teeth for now. I never joined social clubs or socialized in any way. The picture should be pretty clear by now. But I'm done and done being that person. I still barely have friends. At best, they're acquaintances. Friends from high school. I've never had a deep conversation with any of them. I long for a real friendship, a real connection with someone. I want to meet new people, socialize, join clubs, do sports, make music. And most of all, I want to make a difference in the world. Even if I can just make a difference for one person on this ball of dirt and water, I'll feel like I have accomplished something. I want to travel. Meet different cultures, their people, their architecture, their art, their nature. I've learned how to feel emotions, and it changed me completely.

I studied Computer Science for one year and decided to quit. Now I have a year off. I'm working a job that I don't like to get some money so I can leave. I haven't told anyone explicitly that I'm not planning to come back. Still, some part of me wants to plan it all out. Deep inside I don't want that. I just want to go along and follow whatever surprises the universe has in store for me. There's only one thing I'm absolutely sure of: I want to help people. Maybe just one someone or, if I can, everyone. 

Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this city. There's no room here for me to do the things I want. Literally, and psychologically. I feel like there's no room for me to grow anymore in this place. And I know that I can't go mountainbiking on miles of flat asphalt. Now, this post could just as easily have been an OffMyChest post, were it not that I'm desperately crying for help. I think I'm falling deeper into depression with each day. I can't keep emotionally torturing myself by binging TV shows and crying for days afterwards because I can't have what the characters have.

188,"I work in a prison. Not metaphorically. I am a corrections officer and have been for a couple of years now. The things I have seen and been a part of have taken tolls on me in some of the worst ways I can imagine. There's mandatory overtime, the job is 12 hours a day and I have worked weeks without breaks. There is no camraderie between the people I work with. It is the most racist environment I've ever been in and that goes more for the people I work with than the inmates.

It's not safe. The people I work with keep getting fired for either having sex with inmates or bringing in drugs. There is no trust. I'm constantly wondering if today is going to be the day that I get hurt or someone dies. I'm also not taken seriously because of my age. I'm in my early twenties and most of the people I work with are 50+ The people that I see that have been there for 10 or more years are some of the most miserable people I've ever met in my life. They are angry, cynical and it's like they've lost touch with basic morality. Every man that's married talks about how they've cheated on their wives. I don't know why that part bothers me but it does. Not one person says they enjoy this job, everyone admits they hate it but they keep coming. 

 I'm not myself anymore. I used to be happy. I use to work out and see friends and not think of death every day. I used to be optimistic and I was fun to be around. Most days now I sleep and feel miserable when I wake up. I'm irritable. I'm turning into those people and it's not the life I want.

190,"Apologies in advance for the length of this, I am quite distressed and could really use some guidance.

I (28 hetero male) have recently started dating my girlfriend (22 bisexual female) after months of being clients, then friends, then more than friends.

I have been cheated on in the past and that was brutal, but also have fears of abandonment, always have. I believe that this combination contributes to me having unfounded (or perhaps overblown) feelings that I  am/will be cheated on, or that in general my relationship is doomed. Lots of people get cheated on so I know it's not as remote as an unfounded fear of getting struck by lightning, but dwelling on it is hurting me.

Although cheating is a trigger for me, I've always hidden these feelings with partners (in fact I act the opposite) because I know jealousy/cheating paranoia is one of the least attractive and most toxic elements a relationship can have (I've been on the other end of this), in this most recent relationship my cheating fears are magnified for several reasons and I don't like what it's doing to me. 

Besides being triggered from prior partner infidelity, the reason for my increased fears are as follows: 

(1) my girlfriend is significantly younger than myself, although mature, I have doubts about the ability of someone that age to be faithful; 

(2) my girlfriend was in a polyamorous relationship when we met (and open, as ours is detailed below, prior to that) and I have doubts about her ability to not wander to someone else or be unable to commit. I also tend to view it as a warning sign when someone as young as her has had numerous open relationships, although this is probably irrational;

(3) my girlfriend openly calls herself a slut (more so that she was), says she was known as a slut in high school, lost her virginity early, has had many more sexual partners than I at a much younger age (including multiple LTR's, which means the many partners happened over an even shorter period of time), has had sex with her teachers in high school (she was of age) and college and had multiple simultaneous sexual partners when we met. I feel terrible mentally holding a double standard because I've done all of those things, but I can't help but worry that her nature is incompatible with commitment.

(4) The vast majority of her friends are guys. I get that she's bi so attraction occurs for both, but in my experience more often than not this is a warning sign. She makes friends everywhere and doesn't think it's weird to take guys numbers if I'm there or not just on the basis of friendship, and even when it's obvious that they are only looking for sex. She hangs out with ex boyfriends and flings as friends, when they clearly are more interested in sex than friendship. She doesn't recognize any of this behavior as disrespectful to me. She clearly loves attention from the opposite sex. Once again, I feel like I'm enforcing a double standard, but at the same time I would have been much more respectful to her in similar situations.

(5) I have caught her lying about a few things unrelated to cheating, mostly minor and explainable because she wanted to protect me (other partners because she didn't want to scare me off when we were falling for each other, where she was a time she killed my car battery and had to fix it), but it makes me wonder about what else she's hiding. 

(6) she's confided in me that she has fantasies of being gang banged. I'm sure this is more common than some would think, but it doesn't exactly make me feel security about the possibility of infidelity or pushing the full open relationship envelope.

(7) This one is a MAJOR issue that is pending discussion until after a wedding this weekend. When we became official my girlfriend told me that a deal breaker for her was the ability to have casual sex with women on the side because it's something I can't give her and she proposed that I be the only emotional connection and only male (a one penis policy, as the poly community calls it). I told her that I would support her preference but that in order to avoid resentment, I need to be able to see women outside of the relationship as well. She agreed, told me this arrangement worked for her and assured me that it would meet her needs.  A little over a month later we were getting to know each other better and having a great conversation when the topic of threesomes came up. I told her that I was certainly down but that I usually forego this opportunity with partners because due to my own preferences I have to be the only man (which she proposed so I obviously thought this was OK) and want to be even to avoid resentment. Long story short, through exploring that convo she basically admitted that she: (1) isn't comfortable with our arrangement because I can see the opposite sex; (2) will eventually want to be open to casual sex with men (repeatedly said ""when that time comes we'll talk about it""); and (3) couldn't pursue women without pursuing men. I obviously take offense to this because it is a complete contradiction of the groundwork we later for our relationship. This makes me think that if she compromises her needs in order to keep me (I would rather her leave and be happy) she'll eventually get complacent and cheat.

Some of these concerns are reasonable and some unfounded and illogical, but together I don't feel as if I'm totally unjustified at having a higher alert level - I just know that living with that paranoia is not healthy.

I've snooped on my girlfriends phone several times only to find that she is seemingly being completely loyal and up front with me. Every time I do it I hate myself for days and feel so guilty. After last night I told myself it was the last time and I want to make an effort to deal with these feelings and keep that promise to myself. 

This is really embarrassing to admit, but I want to get help and am hoping you guys can help me cope or maybe talk over my concerns (maybe I'm right to be worried!). I know our discussion about #4 may break us up due to incompatibility (better now than later, I love her and want her to be happy) but in the event that we can get past that (I want to) I genuinely love wth this girl and our connection, relationship and closeness is otherwise a dream, so I'd like to learn how to deal with these feelings in a healthy way.

Thank you more than you know. I have nobody I can talk about this with because I want my friends and family to like her.

TLDR: How can I work on trusting my partner when I've been cheated on in the past and am feeling more paranoid than ever (perhaps justifiably)?

2) On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and sank or damaged much of the United States Pacific Fleet. Describe and analyze the sequence of events, strategic thinking, and foreign policy goals that led to the Japanese to attack. Focus particularly on the period after 1929. Considering the strategic situation facing Japan and its governments refusal to withdraw from China and Manchuria and seek a negotiated settlement, was attacking Pearl Harbor a logical strategic decision? Was there a better course Japan could have pursued to achieve its foreign policy goals through military means?

198,"The past 16 hours in my head have been really weird. 

But first a little backstory. We'll call my best friend H. His sister W. And a mutual friend of ours D. Well D, H and I were good friends throughout highschool. We all always saw W as the little sister, never really conversed much, but I mean they live together and we were all in the same school so we all saw each other a lot. Well D decided to go out with W. The only reason anyone really had a problem with it, wasn't age related, as she's only 2 years younger than us, it was more the fact that she was H's little sister. Anyways, they had a year and a half relationship, mutual breakup.

Now fast forward about six months. I got invited to a wedding last night with H and W. We danced in a group for most of the evening, with they're cousin mixed in to it as well. I couldn't help but notice that W and I locked eyes a few times. It was great fun. And near the end before a few of us left, I took her hand and we had a dance between just us, thought it would be the gentlemanly thing to do. But I ended up enjoying that dance quite a bit more than I thought I would. And she had this beautiful dress on, and looked absolutely stunning. I had a great time at this wedding.

We all went home after that. My friend H dropped me off. But since last night I can't get her off my mind. So yeah in short, I fell for my best friend's sister.

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't even know if she has had a thought in her head about me at all. I don't know how to tell anyone, little alone my best friend. Or do you think I should just forget about it altogether? And I don't know if this makes me kind of a hypocrite, for not really supporting the relationship between W and D in the past because it was H's sister. Just kinda lost at the moment.

I know that girl about 6 months, because she is my colleague and every day we are chatting on our company communicator going for a coffee together or with other colleagues and also going for lunch and chatting a lot while doing that. She break up with her boyfriend few months ago and as I know she don't have any boyfriend. 2 months ago we have been for a walk with her dog near her home, we chatted a lot, but nothing special, because we didn't went nowhere to eat or to drink coffee just very casual walk with her dog. So then maybe few weeks later I called to her and asked if she would like to go eat on Saturday and she said yes, but when Saturday came she said she can't go and don't want to go anywhere because she left her phone in office she don't like when she is without phone :) So basically it was rejection :)

Now I still thinking to invite her somewhere, but I wondering how to invite and where to go? Also most importantly I am thinking how to invite her to go out that she will think that is NOT friendly go out, but a normal date (because now I am friendzoned as a colleague) :)

ps I am a bit shy guy especially if I need to do first movement, for example to kiss a girl.",08Oct2017,1
200,"i have known this person for ten years and i used to really get along with them so excuse me if this is really long i just need someone opinion cause i dont know what to do anymore. i will call the person oi am having the main problem with Jim, and my other friend Stewart.

Jim is a person who is really egotistical and thinks he is always right to the point where you tell him hes wrong he will not talk to you for several days or even weeks and during the argument will continue to say your wrong even though he knows he is wrong going as far as pretending that he is trolling after he yells in a very angry tone that we are dumb or rude for telling him that he was wrong yet does the same to us on a far worse level. he refuses to see anyone else point of view and thinks everyone is beneath him.

Stewart is a guy who i dont even consider a friend anymore he called my sister a cunt when she was 7. i wont get into any of his personal issues on here but will say he is an addict and is a very dysfunctional person that has no problem leaving the chaos he creates to be cleaned up by someone else only to come back days later to ask for money.  

a few months ago was the real eye opener for me i had offered o run a dnd 5e campaign for the group since we had been wanting to do one forever but i had to dm which is something i barely knew how to do and Jim and Stewart both have experience with it, but they said i should do it since i had time. which i really dont but i agreed i read a bit of the books and spent 4 hours on a map and story for a small 2 hour campaign. upon starting they immedatly gave me a hard time and insulted me and my work i laughed it off and offered to hand it off to jim he denied but has physical copies of the books and has read them most of the time 

so i found a freind of mine named hal who has gm'd 20 times and currently was running a campaign for a group of his friends he accepted the offer but said he would use his current groups story and map we all agreed that was a good idea and set up a date and time that works for hal since he lives in england and we can only do late games. we then started that game after building new characters and introduction Stewart and Jim immediately began with the same thing only this time sending texts to each of our phones and arguing with him over enemy's and insulting him hal of course at this point after 30 minutes of arguing and being called retarded and other such words politely said he was going to bed and would not be returning. they continued to insult him and

 said i should dm again since i had more experince then hal which is untrue i foolishly agreed so i built upon the old campaign and put more work into it. this game went further then the last two but i later found out they were badmouthing me and the rest of the party i confronted them about and they acted like i was the one who was acting rude.

we didn't talk for a few weeks after that and i really saw the relationship as being burnt but was scared to end it since most of my other friends are connected to Jim and Stewart. 

so after awhile we begin to talk again once we started playing pubg but this was short lived since all jim and stewart could say to me was i was horrible and my skill level was not on their par which is true perhaps but its not my fault when one person is making a joke and runs outside only to be shot and killed. i was then yelled at because i didn't run outside and try to pick him up. after this i stopped playing the game serious but continued to play with other people. but a few weeks ago it really was the final nail for me i am a very nice person but i can be mean ill admit it everyone can be but after our fights even if im wrong i apologize and if im right i still have to apologize i am always the one to reach out  and initiate conversation but i stopped doing that after dnd and pubg and we are now at the point where noone is talking i refuse to reach out since i have done it many times before and they refuse do it because i truly believe they see what they have been doing is perfectly normal and right and maybe it is i dk all i know is i stay up think about this its become all i think about and i just don't know what to do anymore i could reach out and start the same cycle or end it and lose most of my friends. any advice would be great ",08Oct2017,1

At the minute I'm making enough money to have a disposable ~£320 ($420) per week after all my bills being paid. I'm not sure what the best thing I could do with this money is that would help to set me up for the future.

203,"So I realize that my username doesn’t help the situation, but I didn’t want to use my other accounts because I don’t want them linked to my personal life. Last night an old interest called me up to go and see him, which I ended up doing. He mentioned he had a few drinks but he wasn’t acting nor talking nor was there anything pointing to him having been hammered. We made out, one thing led to another, and we ended up having sex. I texted him earlier to check up on him and he said he was ok, but didn’t remember much. I was taken aback and asked if what we had done was ok and he asked what we did, which then fired off huge alarms in my head. I let him know we had sex, and he was shocked.

I am horrified at the situation because I am so very much about consensual sex and always making sure there’s consent from both sides. During sex I asked him multiple times if what we were doing was fine and he said yes. But now knowing he doesn’t remember anything negates any consent he might have given. I am seriously having anxiety with even the possibility that I may have unconsciously had non-consensual sex with this person....

What should I do? Should I try to talk to him more about this? He didn’t really reply after I told him and then apologized.",08Oct2017,2
206,"Hello, 
    Before I begin, yes I am an idiot and no I will never do this again. 
    I purchased a 200 dollar LG G5 phone from a Facebook swap. I repeatedly asked if it was unlocked. She said yes multiple times. I met up with her, made sure the phone was working, no damage, etc. Got home and tried to activate it with Straight Talk (which she said she was on after Verizon). Straight Talk said that I might have to activate it with Verizon. So I said okay and drove to the Verizon store. They scanned the IMEI and said that it was on a ""No Pay"" list. That means that the installments on the phone have not been paid off yet and the phone cannot be used until the payments have been made. I contacted the seller and explained the issue, here is what she said:
Me:
Hey I thought this phone was unlocked? I'm trying to activate it and it says it is still under contract or has payments that needs to be made

Seller: 
No its unlocked I promise I Used it on Verizon then straight talk then att

Me
It's not letting me activate it?

Seller:
Do you currently use straight talk

Me:
Yes

Seller:
Just put your sim card in it and log into your Google account

Me:
It did not work 😞

Seller:
Call straight talk cause it was used on their service lol

Me:
Wil do

Me:
Straight talk would not let me activate it. So I called Verizon to see if it it was compatible. They said it was. Now I'm at Verizon store trying to activate it.

Me:
Verizon said it is not done paying it off. There are still payments remaining

Me:
Can you please find out what is going on

Seller:
Do you have the Sim card in
2. Did you sign into your Google account

Me:
Yes to both

Me:
Like the sim card won't even activate with any carrier. It says there are still payments on the phone.

Seller:
There are no payments due on the phone go get a straight talk byop you probably need a new SIM card

Me:
i did and it didn't work. i'm sorry to keep bugging you, i feel awful. i just want a working phone

Seller:
It's ok I understand are you busy tomorrow

Me:
nope

Seller:
Ok I am actually heading to work right now. If you want I can meet up with you tomorrow and activate it for you I have had to activate every phone for myself and my husband and stepdaughter

Me:
that would be super awsome
i have the BOYP thing from straight talk

Seller:
I am more than willing to do that for you
Ok sounds good just keep everything together and I will help you tomorrow

Me:
Are we still going to meet up
SAT 3:06PM

Me:
Please get back to me. It has been 48 hours. I do not want to have. To do anything.


I have the screen shots of how everything went down, now my question is - What do I do next? I think it is obvious that I've been scammed. I want my money back or a working phone (I really don't care which at this point.) I don't have 200 dollars to throw around to an asshole. 


What is my next step?

Thank you. 

Edit: I know her name, her husband's name, have her pictures, know what city she lives in (its like 1000 people.) So I can definitely ID her to the cops/court/etc if I can do that option.

Neither me nor my roommate had any bites or found any on our clothes, the mattress, etc. At the end of our stay we did find one in the corner of the room.

I just had a backpack of clothes that I can't dry, a laptop, book, and shoes. The clothes and shoes I am going to put in a chest freezer at -6°F and the backpack is getting pitched. I've never experienced this so I have a few questions on protocol:

• What should I do about the book? I need it for school tomorrow  
• What should I do about the laptop?  
• How likely is it that the 40min of my backpack on the back seat of my car got my car infested?

Like I said, we found no bugs on our stuff and no bites have turned up yet. My biggest worry is that my stuff is infested with eggs that are spreading to anything they touch. And I don't know what I should do to nip this in the bud so I don't end up with a huge problem.

Looking for a perspective and some words of kindness and wisdom.

Here's my story,
I live in Northern California, im a university drop out, I don't have steady income, I have a lot of debt, my girlfriend just broke up with me, I've moved 4 times this year and have to move again in 3 months, I can't rely on family, I have few to no friends I can confide or trust, I am filled with sadness, angst, dread, fear, anxiety.

211,"Ok so i am trying to compress this story and make it as short as possible, i met this girl 3 weeks ago in school and i REALLY like her... she asked for my name but since she is 3 years younger than me i thought it would be weird to give my name to her, she told me her name though. Later that day when i got home i thought hey i know her name lets just add her on instagram.... because she didnt know my name she declined, next day in the hallway i said hey i added you on instagram accept me, she told me sure and so she did. We started dm'ing and all out of the sudden she blocked me... she just blocked me without saying anything. I was sad as fuck. Next day i asked here why she blocked me but didnt give me a  reason so i walked on. Just this week my friend made an instagram groupchat wich he added me and the girl i like in... we had a conversation in there and then i said 'wait u still have me blocked?' Then she replied wait i will deblock you so she finally did....

Here it gets interesting, i tried to get into conversations with her a lot via the instagram group and slowly she started acting nicer anf developing more interest in me... then all out the sudden she asked me hey whats ur snapchat , i told her i didnt know my snapchat name from my head so just give me yours... she replied saying ""no tell me yours haha"" so i searched it up and gave her my snapchat. This made me think that maybe she didnt want to give her her snapchat name because my friend was also in the groupchat and she didnt want him to add her... we send snapchats a lot and she seems to reply to most of my snapchats sith just plain snaps of her face and sometimes text... just yesterday we were snapping and i was trying to send a video but it didnt work and after some tries she said 'just send it via whatsapp' and she gave me her number! 

In school when i walk outside to go and smoke (yes i know what u think, smoking is bad) she followed me once outside, basically leaving her friends to go and talk to me and we had a chat outside. Next day she followed me again but waited in front of the door, i gave her a strange look (the 'wtf u doing' look) and she turned around just to find her staring at me from behind the glass and laughing.

Like i said, i really like her! But would she like me? I was trying to think like her, if i would not like a girl i would not ask for her snapchat nor give her my number so maybe she does like me. Even on chat she sometimes sends kissing emojis and stuff like that wich is also another thing i would not do if i did not like someone.

One quick thing i should note is that she does not want to talk to me when im with my friends, we have a large friend group in school and whenever she walks by and im with all my friends she seems really shy and keeps on walking, she 13 though so i wont blame her.

What do you think? I need advice on this situation. Yes im pretty sure she likes me but why block me at first? Seems pretty strange right? Please help me with this!

Thank You, sorry for the bad english.

212,"I've only had three people in my room since I moved in. None of them would have done this and I asked. I said ""I won't be mad. I'd just assume it was a joke."" They said no, obviously. I believe them.

The strange thing is I've also come into my room to find my computer shut off a couple times now. I really don't want to believe it was my roommate, but it couldn't have been anyone else... He has a creepy 4-6 year old son (peeks under my door and used to open it randomly). My roommate works nights so he often spends the day time sleeping while his son chills out in the living room, alone (makes me so sad, but that's another issue in itself). Anyway, despite all that I HIGHLY DOUBT a kid would have done this because this is a very specific thing to do that I child probably wouldn't understand. Also, a kid would've poked holes in shit ton of other stuff.

So that leads back to one of my two roommates. I doubt it was the other one (who doesn't have a kid), as he's never here and hardly knows me anyway. 

So I asked my roommate:

Hey do you know anything about this? *shows condom*

Yeah we have a lot of those.

Yeah but this one has holes in it.

Oh...maybe *girl roommate who lived here before me* was trying to trick her bf into getting her pregnant.

No, man this is MY condom that's been sitting by my desk for weeks. *His son* wouldn't have done this right?

No, I don't let him into your room.

Would *other roommate* have done this?

Nah he doesn't give a shit about anything. (Weird because what does he mean by give a shit?)

So who would have done this?

Idk. We're not secretly plotting to have you get some girl pregnant.

No I'm not saying that. I'm just trying to figure out who did this.

Idk what to tell you *walks off*

So idk. What should I do? I feel kinda creeped out now. And before anyone says ""its just a prank"". No. They would've come out and said it then. Besides, we don't know eachother like that. Idk man...this makes me queasy for some reason. 

Tl;Dr: I don't know who poked holes in a condom in my room...

Talked to my roommate again. Told him I was creeped out. He reiterated that roommate wouldn't have done it cause he's not like that at all and ""Coming from someone who has a kid, that's no laughing matter"". Said his son wouldn't have done it because it would've just been rip to shreds if that was the case. Said ""I'm going to get a smoothie, want a smoothie?"". Ha..idfk",08Oct2017,3

I am a recently graduated male living with my parents. One month ago I started work with a company that directly influences my future, while also being my major source of financial income as I've put my other jobs on semi-hiatus to have better hours. Work with this company has been going well, however, there is no guarantee for work and more often than not I find myself with no work and a ton of free time. To me, this free time is a blessing as it gives me more time to spend with my girlfriend and enjoy some leisure time. On the other hand, my parents are viewing this extremely negatively (I understand their point to a degree). This is where my issues begin, despite my best efforts - (taking as many shifts from my other jobs as I can to suppliment my lack of work, repeatedly contacting the new company to inquire about work, using my free time to do chores / errands, as well as research into my future schooling) - my parents are not happy. Every single thing I do, good or bad, becomes another conflict. My girlfriend even remarked that it seems every conversation I have with them turns into an argument, and she's right because that's exactly what happens. It's really taking a toll on my mentality and I've noticed I'm becoming  incredibly defeatist and irritated.

223,"I already asked r/relationships, but if you've ever spent some time over there, they're a little one sided in terms of how to handle breakups and exes.

My ex has tried to get a hold of me, twice, since he broke up with me on Sept. 20. He said that he didn't love me anymore and was honestly really mean about it, he practically yelled it at me. I know there probably isn't a nice way to confess your non-romance to someone, but I would have really appreciated it if he had said some bullshit line like, ""I can't love you like you deserve.""

His lack of sensitivity makes me feel betrayed. I'm not upset that he fell out of love with me, it's not his fault and it's not my fault either, people fall in and out of love with people everyday, it just wasn't meant to be and I've accepted that. I'm having a hard time accepting, however, that this man that I trusted with my heart could be so brutal toward me. I don't want to see this in a black and white way because, obviously I was with him, I thought he was great and compassionate and caring. I think he's a good person. But I'm having trouble forgiving him for this. And it's not just the hurtful I don't love you anymore. He also did and said some other tasteless things in the same night that caused me to lose respect for him. 

My conflict comes with talking to him. My first reaction is no, I don't want to talk to him, he hurt me and I think every time I talk to him I will think about how he doesn't love me anymore. But. I don't want to make decisions out of hate - I want to make them out of love. I want to forgive people and see their good side and be able to let things go and love without loving back. I want to appreciate everything and be grateful for everything. But I don't want it to come at the expense of myself and my self worth and my boundaries. I want to have a backbone, to care about myself before others, and to show myself the same love that my ex was not able to accept. I don't want to be petty. I don't want to be a mean ex, I want to handle this as maturely as possible but I honestly feel like I can't talk to him while still caring about myself, if that makes sense.

My long-time girlfriend, we were both each other's first loves, dumped me over a month and a half ago, and ever since my life has been a complete mess. We met through a mutual friend during my senior year of high school, and she went to a different high school in the area and was a year younger than me. I was reluctant to give this girl any chance with me, basically because of my fear of rejection or heartbreak down the line. She did all of the dirty work; getting my phone number, arranging our first date, and basically initiating the chase. Skeptical of her interest because of my prior history with girls, I played along, but very carefully. After 3 or so dates, she got me to open up to her, and the rest was history.

Our relationship started off as something I didn't think I would ever experience and thought was only from the movies. Constant affection, attention, and fun with this girl. This ""honeymoon"" period probably lasted around 6-8 months. We were both each other's first everything, so the sexual and romantic curiosity was intense. Limited to no disagreements, and we basically saw each other every day we could. During this time, there were certainly huge red flags  that anyone more experienced with this stuff would have caught on, but I didn't mind. She was needy, very emotional and basically just needed my attention every second of my life. I didn't mind at the time, in fact I kind of liked it.

After we first had sex (maybe 6 months in?), I noticed she slowly started to change. She went from constantly sweet and happy all of the time to slowly becoming more and more needy and controlling. Her mood would swing constantly. When I started at college, I decided to attend a university close to home so I could commute to school and stay near her (Dumb decision). My freshman year of college was busy, but it was fulfilling and impressive. My grade point average was a B+, and I was making connections with powerful players in my industry as a freshman at a small state university. My ex was supportive at first, but I noticed that the maturity gap began to take its toll. The neediness got worse, and I now realize she didn't understand that I had adult responsibilities I had to attend to. I worked full time, and she constantly accused me of forgetting about her since I wasn't giving her the attention I once was able to.

Despite all of the above, I was still able to see her every single day, and tried my hardest to keep her happy. She would often have huge extremes of affection and sweetness towards me, then I would do something minor to tick her off and she would go cold. She was unable to have adult conversations with me about things, and honestly stressed me out a lot. I think that eventually this began to take its toll on me, because I went from pursuing my own hobbies to just focusing on trying to make her happy in the last few months.

The break-up was sudden because I didn't think it would happen. I went to a event with her (male) friends, she said I could, and I came home to her breaking up with me at the very early hours of the morning. It was clear she was jealous of the situation, and it was a triggering point of the break up. The timing was terrible, as we were going on vacation soon and just about to start school. (She now goes to the same university as me). I treated this girl like royalty, even when she treated me like shit over the past 3 months. Her actual reasoning was that ""she lost feelings for me as a boyfriend"", but her confusing actions after the breakup make that answer more confusing. She told me she didn't know what she wanted, kept going back and forth for a few weeks, went from sexually interested to cold (after the breakup), and would go from acting like a girlfriend to a bitch in a matter of seconds. Eventually, she did stop talking to me, once the first day of classes started. I tried to talk to her twice after that , once in school, but both conversations did nothing for me except made me more confused (because of her mixed messages). I also had the misfortune of bumping into her at school multiple times, and seeing her happy with her new male friends (or interests, I don't know). So I stopped talking to her, and I am now on 3 weeks of no contact. I also have to go completely insane when I have classes to avoid running into her because I know it will bring me into a very depressive state.

Why would I be so upset over a girl who treated me the way I described? Well this girl was the funniest, and the most loving girl I have ever met, and the good times happened just as much as the bad. She was seemingly obsessed with me throughout the whole relationship. Her friends became my friends, my friends became her friends, and when the breakup happened, MY friends were even starting to become friends with HER friends. It was a complete shock to everyone involved. My friends seemed to be happy about it, as they didn't view her positively, but her friends were shocked. This girl left me after I helped her get her job, picked her major, and basically had to help her make any important decision she ever had to make. I did everything for this girl, and as more time passes, I realize that in the final 3 months, it seems like it was all about her.

Her family loved me, and I was happily grateful and nice to them all of the time, even in times when I shouldn't have been. Her family was strange, but I appreciated it. Her sister and mom (conspiracy types) would hold a grudge against me because of my political leanings (center-right on the spectrum), and I also dealt with a lot of new and strange experiences I wasn't used to. I took most of them in stride, but sometimes it would get tiring, particularly when I couldn't say no to attending every single family event I was invited to. 

Apparently her sister and her best friend (who said a few days before I was ""one of her best friends"") talked her into the breakup. The sister is whatever (I was incredibly nice to her), but her best friend's advice particularly hurts me. She was also one of my best friends, we became very close, and the fact she would tell her to dump me over such a small and childish circumstance hurts me. I know that the fact she was ""going to meet new people in college"" was a motivator, but if she behaves how she did with me, will she ever truly be happy with anyone?

The relationship took up so much of the time, that I am left with no female friends, limited amount of male friends (friends from high school are gone, and I commute to school), and also no hobbies. My family situation sucks; my dad is an alcoholic  and my mom battles mental illness, while my sister does not have any direction in her life (and arguably is showing symptoms of my mom's mental illness). I realize my ex was an escape from this stuff. I have been at the same part-time job since my Junior year of high school (currently in my 2nd year of college), and I have seen a lot of turn over. That place has become a miserable mess. 

Positive things: I have been severely underweight all of my life, which I have tied to genetics, and I have been going to the gym ever since the break-up. Despite not having much of an appetite until recently, I have been able to gain 5 pounds over the past month. My grades are still looking good, and I am planning to transfer to a school outside of my area in order to get away from my childhood friends and to split off from the family situation. My family is supportive behind that.

I guess my issue is that I feel like I am in an awkward transitional phase in my life. This girl kept me in my childhood throughout my freshman year of college, and now she gets to experience her new and shiny life (not that new, she commutes to the same school I go to) while I am stuck doing the same routine (just without her in it). I am fearful of stagnating socially, and I also have no clue what I want to do with my career. The break-up also confuses me. As she was so up and down with me throughout the relationship. I also lost some of my best friends as a result of that. I spent 85% of my days with this girl throughout the relationship (she needed it that way), and now is she able to move on happily with her life. The only explanation that I've seen that makes sense is the ""Grass Is Greener Syndrome"". I know she is young, and I've seen stuff happen to mutual friends that were similar.

I am unsure if I did the situation justice, but I basically just feel lost with life right now. I am unsure if this girl (who was once my best friend and the love of my life --- I still love her) will ever be in my life again (apart of the hot and cold was keeping doors open for future because she ""loves me but this is what she wants right now""), I have no emotional support circle, and I am the type of person that cannot be sitting at home all of the time, particularly at this age. The last time I was single, I was in high school, now I am back to living life as a high school student as a college sophomore. My high school friends that attend my university hold me back from meeting new friends, and my self-confidence is at an all time low to be able to talk to girls to form new relationships (which is why I am planning on transferring away).

The only self-destructive behavior I've recently engaged in is using apps like Tinder and Bumble, and also occasionally keeping tabs with her on social media. I call using those apps self destructive because I haven't gotten anywhere using them, and it seems like most of the girls on there aren't my type. It's also just not the type of person I am, but I guess I am just desperate at this stage for any kind of attention. I also just want to meet new people. 

All I am asking for is for any words of wisdom. Maybe being able to make sense of the breakup and the way she acted towards me, and also just good stories that came out of similar situations.

Thank you everyone!",08Oct2017,1
238,"I've applied to two universities and been accepted into both for next year and now I have to decide which one I want to go to within the next week or so. Prefferably less. The options are thus.

* **A:** Overall cheaper, mainly due to accomodation costs and being closer to home. More access to nature and outgoing lifestyle and a lot of potential for overseas travel.

* **B:** In a larger city and probably has better professors. Almost definitely has a better social scene and more to do. 

On paper, A is an obvious choice for me for all sorts of logistical and lifestyle reasons. Both are highly regarded, quality schools and both can give me the education I want as well as most of the extracurriculars. But A is cheaper, closer to home and will enable me to travel and see the world.

But idk. There's something holding me back. For some reason I just can't bring myself to commit myself to that decision. I know in my mind that **A** is the right choice but I keep telling people ""I just need to make absolutely sure that **B** doesn't have anything I haven't thought of,"" and putting off the decision.

My instint seems to be trying to force be to study at **B** and I have no idea why. But this is the same instinct that has literally saved my life before so I don't want to dismiss it until I understand what's prompting that responce. Does anyone know any tricks to try and get to the bottom of this stuff? To organize my thoughts and feelings and understand them better? Because I don't want to make a decision I'll regret, especially if it's something I should't regret, when it comes to things of this calibre.

Thanks guys!",08Oct2017,3

240,"Hey strangers,

I'm a young actor in a medium-sized city. Over the summer, I got involved with an up-and-coming local theatre company; I played one of the leading roles in their show in our Fringe theatre festival, which was quite successful. For the most part, I enjoyed working with the producer and I think it's a great company.

A few weeks ago, the producer (who is also the founder of the company) asked me to be a part of the board of directors she's forming for the company. I realize this all sounds extremely formal, but it really isn't; we're all in our twenties, and ""board meetings"" will consist of four of us sitting in a room talking about our ideas for the theatrical productions we'll be putting on.

There are two problems:

1) The next show that the company is producing features a black character, who's race is important to the narrative. No people of color auditioned for the show, so the founder (who's also directing the show) cast a white person. She has decided to make the character queer instead in order to, I assume, fulfill the need for the character to be slightly ""different"", or an outsider. I'm not completely comfortable with this; I think white-washing in theatre is a real issue, at least where I live, and if she wants to comment on gender by having a queer character in her show, why not have the character be queer AND black? Also, it changes the flavour of the show and doesn't necessarily line up with the playwright's intentions. I know there can be a bit of an anti-SJW mentality on reddit, and you might think my issue with this is overly PC. That's fine, you don't have to agree with me. I'm just wondering if there's a way I can bring up my disagreement with this decision with the founder in a diplomatic and respectful way, and not have her think that I'm trying to take the reins or tell her she's doing an awful job. She's great, but I find she can be insecure and take things very personally. I also hesitate to take part in mounting a show that has made a casting decision that I don't agree with.

2) The second problem is the other members of the board. The other two members, aside from the founder, are the two people I got along with the least from the previous production. One is my ex-girlfriend. We're only fairly good terms, mostly for professionalism's sake (we're both actors in the same town and end up working together pretty frequently), but we can sometimes get prickly and our personalities don't mesh super well. The other I just don't get along with; she's the type of person to be unnecessarily rude to serving staff, homeless people, etc. I worry about having to hash out ideas with these people that I don't feel super comfortable around.

Despite this, I love the company in general and I think coming on board would be a great career move and a learning experience. It's a tough call.

I'm meeting the founder for coffee next week so she can bring me up to speed on what's been happening so far (the other two board members have been part of the company for a few weeks without me already). Should I join the board? If so, how do I bring up my issue with the casting?

Thanks guys.",08Oct2017,1
242,"So basically I have a group of friends, and we went out a couple of weeks ago clubbing, and they brought this girl (one of their friends) and like she was super cute, and such a laugh. I knew when I first saw her that she was my type, looks wise, and then I got to know her. As soon as she sat down, my friends girlfriend whispers to me, ""so what do you think of Gemma"" (not her real name, but giving her a name makes it easier to tell) and I was the awkward idiot I am, and was like ""she's alright"" trying not to react and just act like I wasn't desperate and interested in her. But something about her that night made me act differently to normal, normally I would try and be really flirty with the end goal of trying to get off with her. But I guess really didn't want to come off like a fuck boy, or a sleazy so I didn't I was kinda flirty, but if anything was going to happen she was going to start it. So basically I went to get a drink, and when I came back she had gotten off with this guy. I was gutted obviously, but I knew that I would have other chances to talk and get to know her and stuff like that. So the night ends, we make a group chat, I get her snapchat and we start talking and its nice, and then she puts in the group chat that she is going on a date with this guy that she got off with, and my heart just sunk. Anyway she goes on the date and she's really happy with the date, and then the guy has a party and she stays round, and nothing happens, which she loves. So this is over the space of 3 weeks, with me and her talking constantly, Snapchatting all day, and so in starting to get to know the girl, loving her personality and everything. But after she said about the date and staying over I kinda guessed that I should leave it, and be her friend. Which I have been doing, but then we went out last night as a group, and it was so fun, and me and her were close and dancing together and just being drunk and flirty really. After a while the girl who originally asked me what I thought of ""Gemma"" came up to me and said ""you should get off with (kiss for people who aren't from London 😂) Gemma"" and I replied ""But she has the other guy"" to which she says ""I've seen her all night with you, she's flirty, she likes you, it's clear"" but I was still really cautious cause I didn't want to ruin anything between us. The night continued and I got extremely drunk, I lost her and the rest of my friends for about an hour and when I found them, I was badly drunk and they were getting ready to leave. So I go home and I wake up with messages from ex's and stuff that I have been drunk messaging. This would be fine cause I can deal with that, but I also messaged ""Gemma"" saying ""I should of got off with you"" and I feel like shit.
We talked and then she said "" but I'm all Daniel's"" (the 'guy' who she got off with) and now we haven't talked all day and I'm freaking out and overthinking everything. Can anyone  offer me any advice or anything on what to do or how to go about this? I know it's probably an overreaction but Im just overthinking the whole thing and making it worse. ",08Oct2017,1
243,"So I need some advice on what I should do. I moved far away from my home for a year for my job training. I booked a flight instead of driving because my car is a very old car (late 90s) and I was worried it was going to break down. At my job they're paying for my rental, but they will only do it for a month.

I was wondering if its best to buy a used car or transport my very old car from home? With a used car I would have to add insurance, go through the whole process... Seems like a huge investment for me. My other route would be to transport my car, but if I am not sure if thats the safest decision because its very old and the place I live will be very cold and snowy. I am not too sure if my Japanese car will be able to handle it and might be a headache. What would you guys do if you were in my situation?",08Oct2017,1
