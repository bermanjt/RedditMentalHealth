0,"I have been going out with my boyfriend for over a year and a half now and I love him so much. He treats me really well, tells me he loves me and wants to spend all his time with me. He is 9 years older than me and I am 24 but we get along so well and I think I'm quite mature for my age. The only problem is my parents don't approve of him, especially my father. He won't even agree to meet him. My mother has met him once and she said she thought he was nice but she still would rather me with someone else. Both my parents are very old fashioned. The main reasons they don't want me with him is because he's from the town and we live in the country, he's from an estate which would contain people from rough backgrounds but his family are lovely and I don't believe anyone should be judged on where they come from. He doesn't drive and I do which can be frustrating sometimes but I am trying to get him to learn. Also, he isn't as highly educated as me. I have a degree and a masters and he didnt finish secondary school. We both earn the same amount of money and still live at home but as he has to travel to work by bus he spends the majority of his wages travelling so he hasnt got much money. My mam said that i have to think about my future and how can i be with someone who doesn't earn that much money but to me it sounds so materialistic. I wont lie that i do think about our future a lot and how we will manage to afford things but im still young and i kept hoping that by the time we do settle down and marry that we'll both have better jobs. My dad would barely speak to me about my boyfriend and most of the stuff I have heard back from my mam. I honestly don't know what to do. My mam said she's happy to have him over to meet him again but I'll have to say it to my dad and he is so stubborn that I know it will start a screaming match. The thought of ending things with him because of my parents really breaks my heart and I know he would be devastated. He has told me so many times that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. Can anyone please give me advise? Or has anyone been in a similar situation? Thank you.",19Jan2017,1
2,"So, Im currently in the back seat of the truck, parents are in the front. I've got my headphones in but turned way down and they're talking about an appointment my mother went to the other day. Apparently, they called her back with results and mom has quite a few cancerous tumors in her uterus and she's also been having bladder problems. What do I do? I'm terrified for my mother and of losing her, because she also said she refused to get a hysterectomy. I'm afraid it might be in her bladder and it could move other places. I'm too young to lose my mom and I don't want her to be sick, and I really don't want her to be in pain at all. Also, I don't understand why they're hiding this from me? I'm really fucking terrified because I lost another family member to cancer a few years ago and can't go through this again. ",19Jan2017,2
4,"We are, give or take, $20,000 CAD in debt (Which I know is not even that much - but so much of our income goes toward paying this off). I clear about $600 CAD per week working a full time teaching position. My husband is a full time SAHD. We receive $530 in child tax benefits every month. 


Here's the thing. We have no savings. We are renting a super cheap house at the moment that is liable to be up for sale next year. Since we live in a university town, landlords jack prices up like crazy. We got really lucky with this house - we are paying what many university students are paying for a single room in a house. We have a whole house to ourselves. Obviously we need our own space as a couple with a 1.5 year old. I'm worried that we won't have this place for much longer and that we will be forced to pay double the rent for the next place.


My husband, who is a former touring musician, wants to go to school now. He is 37 years old, has not completed a university degree. He wants to do an online program perhaps; a general BA with maybe a major in psychology. He's not 100% convinced this is the right program for him, but he's been struggling with what to do for so long now that it's time for action. And it is. He has had a career in music but doesn't want to be away from home anymore, having a family now. He still does music occasionally but only if it's local, and there's not too much happening locally. We live in a small town. So about his going-back-to-school idea: I worry about two things:

1. Paying for his schooling. While I realize this is a good investment for the future, I'm not sure he'll qualify for a student loan, having defaulted on one in the past. This might mean I'll have to take out a line of credit, which means high interest, and paying as you go. We barely have a couple hundred bucks left in our accounts at the end of the month these days, how will we make those payments? He's also opposed to getting a job, which is of great annoyance to me. Some part time shift at the gas station/local pub would help so much, but he's convinced he won't have the time being a FT SAHD and FT student. Maybe he's right. I seemed to have pulled it off back in my university days, but I can juggle a lot of busy-ness, whereas he seems to need more down time.  

2. I'm also worried that after more debt he won't like the career he chose for himself, or not want to pursue it. He is the type of person who must be happy doing his job, or else he won't do it. 


I just need direction. What makes the most sense right now for us? On top of it all, I want another kid. I would prefer not to wait 10 years. Luckily I'm younger than my husband and only 24, so I could technically wait 10 years if that's what it takes to sort all of this out..... 

What would you do? Any advice appreciated. Thank you. ",19Jan2017,1
6,"So back in October it was extremely cold one weekend and we let a friendly stray cat into our basement. She had kittens during her stay but basically abandoned them and would not have anything to do with them. So we put the stray back outside and hand raised the kittens ourselves. Fast forward a few months and the kittens are growing just fine. However, the cat we have had for over ten years HATES these kittens. She won't even go near them without hissing and swatting at them. She's also an outside cat. Sometimes she will be outside the glass patio door and see a kitten inside. She will hiss and swipe at the glass door to try and hit the kitten. This always happens. We have to keep the kittens in the basement while we let our other cat come inside at night to eat and sleep and during the day we put the cat outside and let the kittens roam the house.Â  Is there anyway to make my cat at least get along with the kittens? Also, my older cat would go into my room and make a corner of the room her litter box so now she is banned from my room. Why would she decide to do this?

7,"If I am having a conversation with someone where they are asking me for advice on a certain situation and I find that person is being a certain way, how can I tell them how they are acting without offending them?

If they are being positive or are behaving in a positive way in a certain situation, I try to reinforce, encourage, and acknowledge that.

I'm mainly trying to focus on how to tell someone how they're being, especially if they are being negative, without sounding mean or offending them. i.e. if they are being selfish, I'll say something along the lines of ""Hey, I think you're being selfish in this situation."" 

IMO, I'm making an observation, like ""That's an apple."" and telling them that observation. I'll never say something such as, ""Hey I think you're being a fucking selflish piece of shit."" That doesn't do anything.

Maybe I am though? Maybe there is a more effective and nice way to say something that I am not aware of? I'm not even sure if I am articulating myself correctly in this post, but hopefully you guys understand what I'm attempting to say. I would really appreciate some feedback from you wise folks on here if I am in the wrong because I don't want to offend people or seem like I'm being mean, but I would like to keep being honest with people.

15,"  Hey guys I guess I'll just post this here since idk where else to. So a school shooting happened in my city, Monterrey, Mexico (you guys can look it up). I heard about the news during class everyone started sending the video where the 15 year old kid shoot his teacher and classmates. I felt horrible when I watched it and almost threw up. The whole school was kinda tense and in shock because of the happening and someone even knew one of the kids that was killed.

  I've been in shock and feeling sad/paranoid all day it's a really bad feeling and things like this just make me question the amount of good in the world. Another thing that made me feel sad and angry was that some people in my school and on twitter started making JOKES of the shooting. I felt like I lost all hope in humanity I just want to live in a community where everyone is at peace and loves each other theres so much hate and sadness in this world. 

  I'm even kind of nervous to go to school tomorrow because stuff like this can happen anytime anywhere and it's just so scary. I can't get the images of the video outside of my head and I just keep thinking about the victims. Life is the most precious thing in this world and to se someone's taken away in just a second is frightening, especially when they where just kids thinking it's just another day in school.

18,"Okay, so it all started one day with my friend T, we were friends at one point but he started becoming very inappropriate and rude. He had harassed girls, asked a 8 year old for a nude, liked to fat shame my friend M, called my African American friend, an exotic animal, a thing, and said that rice makes an Asian stupid (me). 
So I told him, ""are you asking to get punched?""
He said ""go ahead"" 
He also then asked M, ""would you be mad if I punched J? (me)
So I was ready to punch him in the face, was tempted, but he just sat there while I tried to get him to talk to me, so with a bit of ""ifeelbad"", I only punched him in the arm.

I live in the state of NJ where bullying laws are very serious, he filed a report, I didn't get into much trouble, and he was ""asked to leave"", (basically kicked out). I found out what school he was going to and told my friends there of what happened, I got in trouble and it restarted everything. I told everyone not to hurt him, unless provoked, and to just not talk to him. Things died down, then BAM, he's trying to sue me.

When we have time to do things, she does nothing. In addition our store got a call and someone was saying that she charged him 3x. I cannot depend on this girl especially in times when I need her. If we have issues, like when we were backed up on orders, she just stood there while I did everything. This manager and the regional manager know but no action has been taken.

My girlfriend is facing some issues in her university classroom. She's one of the brightest people I know and can tackle any problem without issues, but she does have ADHD so test taking has to be done outside the classroom in a private room. In order to get teacher's approvals, she has to personally hand them a letter stating this. As a result, she gets an obvious biased reflection instilled upon her from the teachers, ranging from ""She's dumb and incapable"" or ""(because she is bright and active in the classroom) She must just be using this to her advantage."" She says the difference in the teacher's attitudes apparent upon receiving the letter.

What's the best way to appease this, and perhaps make her feel better about it all?

 I'm suggesting, because she's intelligent, that she can disprove the teacher's biases throughout the semester and the issue would lessen as time goes on.",19Jan2017,1

30,"This post runs the risk of becoming a long winded. I'll try to keep it short.

Background:
32YO couple.  I'm in the process of completing medical specialty in a city where my wife couldn't find a job in her area of expertise. As a result, we have been living in different cities for the past 2 years, but that is coming to an end within the next two months!

The other day I suspected something was going on and probed a bit.  My wife eventually explained she was on a conference call interview.  Later, when I realized a first contact interview wouldn't be a conference call she said it was her second interview with the company and that she was in week 3 of the process. I also found out the position requires her to travel to another city 6x/year for multiple weeks at a time. Had I not asked specific questions I don't think she would have told me anything.

She said she didn't want to tell me until it was 100% certain she has the job as she was afraid of disappointing herself and me if she didn't get the position.

I've been nothing but supportive throughout our relationship so I took this as quite poorly.  I feel information such as this would be something worth sharing, but she disagrees as its a ""little thing"".  I've been pondering the other ""little things"" and it's driving me a bit mad.  I've never had any reason not to trust her, and I genuinely do not feel she didn't do this to be deceptive.  

Can anyone give some advice on how to improve communication in a situation such as this, or what may be considered important enough to share?

33,"Here's the story:

My ex (J) and I have had a rocky relationship. I met her when I had feelings for somebody else, didn't expect to meet her, but met her and thought she was somebody I could love. I made some decisions (never cheated) that caused her trust to waver. Next thing I know, she's breaking into my phone, wondering why it takes me thirty minutes to get home when it should take x amount, so on and so forth. That distrust led me to lying about things I shouldn't have. Just talking. Having a drink with a female coworker after work to talk about the day. So on and so forth. Wishing an ex happy birthday on Facebook turned into WWIII. Things were a mess. But we loved each other so we kept fighting through even though everybody but us seemed to know it was wrong.

The other day I went over to her place. We smoked, talked. Had broken up recently but were trying to see where we were going. I'm thinking about moving home. Like I said. A mess. I let her use my phone to check some schoolwork. I go home. 

After work, an ex (V) who had tried to get a hold of me for a while to see how I am - I don't know what her motivations were - texted me and I messaged back. Had a good convo. Kept things civil. Maybe talked too much about my personal life, but never hit on her, defended J when I thought it was appropriate, told her I hoped she was doing well, and stopped texting. Five minutes later, J calls and says she had a dream V and I talked. I was so caught off guard I didn't know what to say.

Turns out, J had installed spyware on my phone. Something called DDI. I found it while I was talking to her because I refused to believe a dream told her this. I asked her what DDI was. She asked me what Planned Parenthood was. Tells me I'm pregnant. Realized she missed her period two days before, took the test, tada. I told her I wanted her to take a test and she FREAKED.

Turns out I'm a horrible person for asking and not believing her. Showed up at her place asking for her to take a test I bought, and she threatened to call the cops. Got a lot of how could I ever think she was capable of lying about something like that? I'll never know. I'm not part of it. It's her body and she has to go through it alone. How lucky for me that I can go out and have fun and talk to my exes and not deal with it. I told her I'm here for her, that it's not about us anymore and she said yes it is. She's in school, she's doing good things with her life.

She won't take the test (said she took a bunch). She won't tell me when she's going to Planned Parenthood. She said I just want to know so I can put myself at ease, that it's all about me just like always. Said we can meet up at a later time and maybe she can pee in front of me. Said it's just a bunch of cells she can piss out, that it's not anything to worry about.

37,"I work at an university as a writer. I live in DC, and my salary is around $40k. $40k is probably average/good elsewhere, but for DC, it's really low, especially given the high cost of living...even $50k isn't really enough to make it, especially if you want to live in a convenient location and by yourself. I'm in my 30s now, so it's time for me to step up and find my own place.

Anyway, the core of my frustration is the job itself. I'm getting bombarded with requests everyday, and we're very understaffed in our department, but so much is expected out of us (we're public relations, so basically we work kinda one or two levels under the president). I have to manage our daily email listing, write stories, write stuff for other departments, help organize social media, etc... in addition to having recently been assigned to help out at the university's alumni office. Basically, half of the day, I work at the alumni office, scanning old photos, helping out with their event planning, answering questions and giving people tours of the building...then the second half of the day, write and take care of our daily email, and other obligations at the public relations office. It's been quite overwhelming for me, and the alumni office part wasn't part of the original job description, but according to my supervisor, they're understaffed too and really need help, and their office is under the same ""umbrella"" as our office. My supervisor said they picked me because I'm really good with people. 

As for my supervisor, she tries, she's new, but she's hard to talk to because she often looks annoyed all the time and has a blank look on her face. She's also wishy-washy and doesn't seem very confident taking a stand, so I can't really rely on her to stand up for me if needed. People throw work at me and I'm basically expected to do it without complaint. I mean, I understand that's the nature of my job, but it really feels like it's too much. I feel like I can't breathe, and my hands/body feel sore after working so hard all day. I have to put up with people complaining over every little thing, a lot of back-and-forths, etc. In short, I feel helpless and like I have to keep working and say yes to everyone. It really is one thing after another.

My morale is very low because I found out I was the lowest paid staff member in my office (yay?). I work so hard and really put my effort into everything, but I feel so under-appreciated. Things keep piling up. I have like 5 different projects to lead/work on right now, and it's eating at me. I just want to go in, relax, have fun, do some writing. Not this. Not for a measly $40k. I mean, the place I live at right now is $550 a month, I'm lucky, I was grandfathered in, but it closes June and I'll need to find a place. I can't afford that, plus student loans, on top of everything. 

I can talk to my supervisor about the stress level, but the original job description DID specify that I must be able to manage deadline-driven multiple projects in a fast-paced environment and to handle stress. I'm just afraid she'll throw it back at me. I did get so much accomplished, but I'm really feeling worn out and just tired. I can find another job, but working at the university is special to me because it's my alma mater and I do love the people overall.

What's worse is that it's looking like I'll be back later, so will be visibly exhausted from the whole ordeal and I'm certain there will be questions. So what the hell do I say?

39,"Alright, so here's the story, people. At my high school, there are 4 computer programming classes, each teaching a ""new"" language: CP I (Visual Basic 6.0), CP II (Visual Basic Net), CP III (C++), and AP CS (JavaScript). I am trying to credit flex, or essentially skip, the first two classes, but my school's computer programming teacher is... a bit difficult.

Yesterday at the grocery store, some guy accosted me about the pack.  1) He knew I didn't have the day bag that attaches to it.  2) He knew *roughly* when it was found

His claim is that around halloween his car was robbed and this pack was stolen full of shoes and clothes.

I took his number down and told him I had to talk to my friend, but it seemed reasonable to me to return the pack to him seeing that he was able to immediately furnish the day bag that goes with it.

My friend understand me wanting to do the right thing, but also feels like she owns the pack since it has been so many months and she found it abandoned and cleaned it up real good and would prefer to have it.

If it was me, I would see a guy who lost a pack, and give him the one I didn't pay anything for and be happy about my day, but I seem to be stuck in between two people who feel like they own something I'm using but its up to me to make a choice about what to do with it.  She claims that there isn't any way to know that is really his pack, and that she found it earlier in October than halloween. 

Here's what I've been able to come up with
1: Return the pack to the guy, tell my friend sorry
2: Return the pack to my friend, tell the guy sorry
3: Request a fee for the most attached party to pay to the least attached party.

I'm wondering ethically what seems to be the right thing to do.  Also, I suppose legally since this guy is very intimidating and knows where I work and definitely implied he'd be seeing me there if I didn't call him.  If I give the pack back to my friend I want a leg to stand on, and if i give the pack to him I want to be sure I didn't screw my friend.

Thoughts?

I am 20 Years Old turning 21 in a few months.

I struggled with social anxiety and bullying during high school and dropped out after Grade 9. I got my GED in 2015 and my Drivers Permit in 2016. I live in a town of about 500 people with the nearest 'big' city being about 15 miles away. 

I live with my parents who are both employed and support me but I know that something needs to change. I'm not sure how I can look for a job while not being able to drive there or how I can get to a place where I can raise my education level.

49,"Posting on a throwaway account...

My husband's family is in a difficult situation right now. My husband (26) is the oldest of three boys and all are grown up (22 &amp; 24). My husband and I live in the same house as his parents and one of his brothers. Their father is chronic gambler to the point where people come to our house looking for him because he owes them money. Apparently this isn't new, but I had recently just gotten back from living in another country for over a year. Before leaving the country, we lived 400 miles away.  

My mother-in-law was wise to divorce him early in their marriage but kept enabling him to gamble by buying him a truck and letting him stay at the house (house is in her name). He only works just so he can gamble all of his money away. His parents (husband's grandparents) have clearly done a stellar job of raising their kids as my aunt-in-law also has a chronic gambling problem and they enable her to do the same.  

So tonight I get a text from my husband that my father in law hasn't paid someone again and that the person has been camped outside the house this afternoon so they could get it back. The first time this happened, I didn't want to leave the house because I thought we were going to get robbed. I told my mother-in -aw this and she promised that she would kick him out if it happened again. 

They've tried everything to help his gambling problem but he doesn't want to help himself. Everyone is tired of his bullshit. They tried for 25 years and want him out. My brother in law refuses to speak to him--he has ruined family relationships and my mother in law's friendships! I canât even begin to describe the full extent of what he doesâ¦ He has lied and manipulated long enoughâ¦

My mother-in-law confided with me that she hasn't kicked him out because she's worried he will do something violent. 

So! My three questions are:

1. How do we evict him? Should my mother in law serve him eviction papers? She tried asking him for rent but he never paid her AT ALL.

2. How do we make sure he isn't violent towards us? 

3. She also outright owns the truck his uses to work as well. (It's under her name!) She wants to sell that as well. He is gone now and probably won't come back for a week. (He does that often.)

**For reference, we live in California, USA.**

Any advice/help would be appreciatedâ¦

Now that we had another person Mariana had permission to go. This morning I texted Mariana and this is how our conversation went, iirc

Me: How are you?

Mariana: sad, my bff is mad at me

Me: Why is she mad?

Mariana: She invited me to the beach but I said I can't go cuz I'm going to the movie with you

Me: If you want to go to the beach, I guess

Mariana: No no no. It is okay. She needs to learn that not everything will go her way.

I was kinda happy that she turned down an invitation form her bff to be with me, it made me feel special.

I'm sure they'll tell me if I ask. But I'm not sure if there will be any spots in the lot to begin with, or if it would be appropriate to park there if there are any available.

Here comes my dilemma: 
I can't park for shit. The first time I ever drove I crashed and I've sorta had trauma ever since driving. I'm finally working up the nerve 5 years later to drive since it's really necessary to be an independent adult.

I really can't park. I never learned how to properly parallel park. If I can't park in the lot, the only option is parking on the street. I am terrified. If people park around me, there is no way I can get out. I have never actually parked between real cars before. I'm losing my shit over this. I should've thought it through earlier.

95,"I was recently diagnosed, but suspected I had it for a couple of years. It's called Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). It's rare and hits around the age of 50. You get weaker, trouble swallowing, falling, eyelids droop, &amp; fatigue. Then eventually have trouble walking (wheelchair sometimes) and can only drink food. It's hereditary. Children of carriers have 50% chance of getting it. My father and most his siblings had it. And I'm the 4th (and youngest) out of 8 kids diagnosed with it. Every persons symptoms are different. I am at the stage I can't swallow foods unless they are so soft they're almost liquid. And have falling issues. Older siblings are farther advanced in disease. And father died of heart failure. Yes heart is affected muscle. So the thing is I have 2 kids. 1 is 29 yrs old (boy), 1 is 27 yrs old (girl). We are all going to a specialist to discuss my prognosis. So do I get them tested now, even though symptoms don't show up until later in life? So they can prepare? Or will this just put stress on them knowing what's to come. Plus it might affect pre-existing medical insurance and maybe life insurance. Also if they are carriers, there's that chance they could pass it to future children. They say it's up to me. I hate that I might be to blame for making one or both sick. I'm struggling physically &amp; emotionally with everyday life. And it's only gonna get worse. I just don't know what to do.

My mom has told me multiple times that it's a bad idea to quit a job without getting a new one first, though

105,"Ever since I was in the third grade I've been socially anxious/awkward. When around others I generally feel as though I can't open my mouth and my mind turn into static noise.

 I've only had four people (who weren't family) that I felt comfortable with and over the years I've lost all but one, due to varying circumstances. The only one that remains has never been trustworthy with anything private and has recently married into a family with kids. Due to these things, I don't interfere with her life.

I have a part-time job in retail sales and am going to college (online courses only for right now, since the campus is too far away to commute daily.) but I sincerely struggle to socialize with others and if I do say something, I usually end up talking about the weather or ""old lady talk"" as my mother describes it.

I have spoken (if going to them once and being incredibly vague can count as speaking) with a therapist about my social anxiety. I know that not being open with a therapist won't help and will end in frustration for both parties, but...is there anything else that I can do other than speak with a therapist??",19Jan2017,1

""I don't want to bring peoples hopes up. Because what if something happens to them in the future, and they remember what I've said?
For all I know, their loved one could've passed away, or their best friend moved to another state. And while theyre all in their sad thoughts they could remember that one person who brought their hopes up in the middle of nowhere. 
What if they think I'm a lier? Because of all those words I've said, that only sounded motivational, it only sounded like it was just because I didn't want them to be sad to them, or to make them believe that being sad is selfish. Or, to put it into their perspective when they're not thinking right: make them think theyre a loser.
And don't get me wrong, I think being sad is a normal thing. What's wrong with some people today is that they force positivity towards people who are sad. This is bias but being sad, crying for fuck sake, that shit is normal. And if anyone tells you to stop crying in the middle of your heart break then... Leave.""

he got into a bad snowboarding accident a year back, now he's not working because his confidence has just disintegrated. he was such an active person- always fit, healthy, and thrived off of this. now he has limited mobility... he can walk...but can't work a job on his feet constantly.
he's searching for a job but... there's a catch (actually a few)....
1) he doesn't have a car
2) he doesn't have a degree
3)limited mobility
4)issues with keeping a job (probably better if he's the leader)
5)doesn't seem like he wants to work full-time
so i need help! if you have any job ideas as to what he could do to make a living on his own then i would be forever grateful! i'm going to compose an email for him. he's come to me for advice/help and i just...don't know how i can help him. i'm sad for him, but also just want to be his sister.
here are some of his interests/ things he has going for him:
1)snowboarding
2)skateboarding
3)art
4)music
5)entrepreneurship
6) animals (dogs in particular)
7)video games
8)people person (very charming guy)

110,"Hello Reddit!

First off I'd like to give you some background information about myself, I will try to be brief.

I am 17. I grew up with very unfortunate circumstances, no father and my mother is disabled. My mother is very nomadic and would move us several times each year, though she makes less than $10K/year. Between evictions and sexually/physically abusive households I never had a stable environment. My mother was very dependent on me to take care of her and my autistic brother. She is not good with money, things could have been better. Seeing as I was already juggling adult responsibilities, I understood that I could make a better living for myself by moving out and living my own life. I dropped out of school and will have my GED within the next few months (I can get my first degree by the time it would take me to graduate, moving makes school fucky.) and I moved across the US. I have two housemates and I barely make enough to survive (rent, food, etc) but soon I will be making more money, living on my own is not an issue. 

All of my family is dirt poor, homeless, or in prison with the exception of my uncle, we'll call him Sam. Sam works for one of the biggest corporations in existence, and he makes more money than I'd know what to do with. He and I are very close. He's always had faith that I would be the one person in my immediate family to make it and by moving out I showed him that I am willing to make uncomfortable and hard decisions necessary to succeed, that I won't let anything get in my way, even my own mother. He gave me a deal. I live with him or in a dorm when I am 18, and as long as I focus on school or I am working, he will give me a full ride to college, both school funds and living expenses. According to our current agreement, he will fund my schooling until I earn my Doctorate, I want to get as much free education as opportunity will allow. I won't have to pay a dime. I am thinking community college first seeing as I will have a GED and then university/med school.

I have great interest in the medical/psych field. My hopes right now are to become a private practice psychologist or clinical psychiatrist, but a surgeon or other type of doctor would be great. I have three goals in mind, I want to help people as my uncle has helped me although medically/mentally, I want to become as smart and humble as humanly possible, and I want to be making at least $250K/year. 

Here is my question to you, Reddit. What fields/specific jobs would be in my line of interest that make a lot of money, and what suggestions do you have to maximize my earnings, both capitally and mentally? What would YOU do given this opportunity? I want to make my first million by the time I am in my late 20s or early 30s. I am very good with money and I don't spend much, a quality baked into my lifestyle stemming from my childhood. ",19Jan2017,2
111,"Let me start off by saying that I THINK this is an addiction problem. However, I do not know so please don't judge me on this. I am explaining myself in detail as I feel it may help some of you give appropriate advice. I apologize if I have broken any rules. And yes, there is a question at the end.

I'll be 24 in a couple of months, I'm married with a wonderful wife, we're both in college, have an apartment and are broke. My wife has severe bipolar disorder for which she has medicine, but it isn't good enough. Her insurance will not cover anything else. Her bipolar disorder causes her to have terrible anxiety and she isn't able to hold a job very long, if at all, but that isn't the problem. I am. I made some pretty bad decisions when I was 18. They were less than admirable ones being as young and impressionable as I was. I got a part time job in a tattoo shop as the front desk boy who made the appointments, answered the phone, and scared off junkies. Needless to say I became covered because of free tattoos. Only my arms and hands though. Nothing vulgar, simply Norse mythology as it is an interest of mine. By covered I mean one full sleeve, one half sleeve, and knuckle tattoos. This probably wouldn't be a problem if I didn't live in the Bible Belt amd it didn't help that my father only most recently stopped drinking and wants something to do with me. My mother simply believes that anything I liked/like to do is stupid or weird if she doesn't understand it and questions why I would every enjoy said hobby or occupation or overall interest. Otherwise she means well. I've been religious my whole life, mostly on my own, though I don't like the word religious. And I don't want a lecture on how religion is bad. Nondenominational Christian fundamentals helped get me through hell.

When I was little, I had a less than preferable childhood. There was always fighting, screaming, drinking, etc between whatever person my mom or dad was with at the time. I had no idea how to get away other than lock myself in my room and play video games. That is my addiction. Video games. I don't go out and spend money on games that we don't have, however I try to find ways to do so. I'm always thinking of what I want to do on Minecraft or Skyrim and how bad I want to play EVE or WoW even though my wife said I can't because I spent too much time playing them when I did. Now I have student loans from the government because I can't get a job and I have the most insane amount of college work I've ever had. All I want to do is play video games because the school work causes stress, trying to make sure my wife isn't struggling causes stress, being scared about not getting a job when I graduate in two years to pay off loans causes stress, not having a job now and living on loans causes stress, and knowing all I want to do is get up at 2:15am and play video games is causing me stress. And to handle all of that stress, I get depressed and play video games. I have so much work to do and I need to practice my art (Interactive media design major) and buy a laptop and pay for Adobe cloud, but all I want to do is play fucking video games! I want to stop cold turkey, but I can't. Maybe limit myself to an hour a day? I don't know. I simply feel that I have a terrible quality of life and the only things that make me happy are my wife and video games. I'm depressed a good 75% of the time I think and I often THINK about suicide, but I'm not suicidal. 

So after all of that and knowing that it's not drugs or alcohol, but freaking video games, I hope you'll take this seriously as it is my life, and it means something to me.

What should I do?

112,"I've been with my girlfriend for over five years, and she's wonderful. Together we are wonderful. We both go to the same university, which - though easier than a long distance relationship - it's not so easy some times. I can confidently say I trust her intentions and I trust that she loves me and wants a life with me, but she's such a sweet girl. She doesn't know how to turn down, say, someone asking for her number. But she'll immediately block them and tell me. Sometimes she isn't so open with me, however. Sometimes she finds herself in situations (innocent ones, basically just doing something she knows would upset me) where she's too genuine to keep herself from the situation and she knows it would upset me so she just keeps it from me. If I confront her about whatever she comes clean, never lies. I honestly believe she's just afraid of me blowing up and her losing me - she tries to find a way to make everyone happy. 

I love her more than anything, but we hit a bump in the road. Like I said, I trust her intentions but I can't fully trust her actions. I know she would never cheat, but I guess my biggest fear is these good intentions and somewhat innocent actions will one day lead her to be secretive, and all of this will evolve into a lying relationship, or maybe through her good intentions she might meet someone new. I can't control her obviously, but we both want to spend our lives together and have had a wonderful 5 years together which I would never trade for the world.

115,"My first post on Reddit!! Anyways, please help me out here I'm not sure what I should do or which idea is better.

About two days ago, I was involved in a really bad car accident on the freeway. My car is currently waiting to be looked at to see how bad the damage is, but the airbags deployed and practically impaled me and it wouldn't drive so it might be totaled. My boyfriend lives about an hour and a half away from my parents, and my college is about 20-30 minutes away from my parents and I have classes 2 days a week. I live at my parents about half the week and at my boyfriend's the other half, so I relied greatly on my car to get me back and forth.

This is all if my car does turn out to be totaled, I have yet to hear from my insurance company about it. 

Currently, I am at my parents and am having to beg them to take me and pick me up from my classes. I should also mention that I am not currently working, but am in desperate need of a job since I just left mine about 2 weeks ago. They already told me they would most likely not always be able to drive me to a job if it interferes with their schedule. This is shitty since I also have no close friends in this town anymore that I could ask to take me if I payed up. And due to my boyfriend's new work and school schedule (he has weekend class on Saturday and works Sunday-Wednesday) , he would only be able to come out and see me about a day a week, realistically, on Friday since I don't get out of class till 10 p.m. on Thursdays. 

I am unsure if I should keep living with my parents while going to those classes as often as they'll drive me, and try to get a job while seeing my boyfriend once a week, or if I should maybe move in with my boyfriend full time and drop this current semester, work full time down there using one of his old cars that can drive locally, and try to save up for a new car if it's totaled and for some summer classes. We've talked about moving in together many times before and he already said he wouldn't mind this one bit if I do decide to come live with him. (I must say I would miss my dogs at my parents house greatly though). We are very close and serious in our relationship and have even discussed the possibility of getting married this year, which is why it would drive me crazy and break my heart if I could hardly see him. I know that sounds a little dramatic because people do actual long distance relationships all the time, I tried it once and it was too hard for me. 

Anyways, it might seem like I'm thinking too far ahead as I don't even know for sure the current status of my car, but I always like to feel like I have a plan at hand just in case.
What would you guys do? What do you feel to be the better option?

I should also mention that the drive between my parents and his house is too expensive to uber, and my parents won't take me themselves which I don't really blame them for since it's a bit of a drive, or I would've done that already! Thanks guys in advance :-))",19Jan2017,1
116,"I'm in desperate need of advice.

I'm being referred for eye surgery. At this point, I'm very nearly blind. I'm at the 'how many fingers am I holding up' phase of optometry and the answer is usually 'I don't know.'

The thing is, this surgery has around a 50% chance of blinding me completely in each eye that is operated on. I could lose what little vision I have or, worse, I could see for a couple months and THEN lose my vision.

What do I do, y'all? I know on paper surgery seems like the only viable option. I'm having a hard time reading even. It makes it really hard for me to work or do homework, and taking care of my two young kids is pretty tough. But the odds of winding up blind in both eyes is around 25% and I think if that happened I might not survive it.

117,"One of my closest friends, who is 15, is seriously going to fuck up his life if he continues the way hes going.

We both agree that we need to wait until I graduate. I think we should have the baby straight after university; I'll take a year off, then I can start my new career with no interruptions. He thinks I should get a job first, wait six months or so, and then get pregnant so I get maternity pay.

I think it's skeevy, because I'm going into a job knowing that as soon as my probation period is up I'll be leaving them in the lurch, which is particularly difficult for schools to cover.

127,"Just wanted to start this off by saying that I'm not good with girls at all. I'm getting better but there are still things that will take some time.

One of those things will be on how to make my next move or just the next move in general. 

This is going to be a long one so get comfy. 

I'm 18 years young, 6'4 and about 315lbs a pretty big man if you will. 

I live out on my own. A couple months ago now the roommate I had did some shit and we had a big altercation and I left. And moved back home with my mom and her boyfriend. Then my grandpa went to the hospital because he had fallen. So my mom and I took a trip back up to visit. We took 2 cars because I planned to visit some friends during the trip. I ended up doing that and this one girl who I was sorta into but I didn't think she thought the same way as me, I hung out with her for about 3 or 4 days. 

A couple friends were there and we were smoking some dope and having a good time. 

They all left and it was just me and her. I asked her if her and a friend that was there if they had something going on and she flat out told me no.

About 5 minutes after asking her this. Her dog who was cuddling with me had jumped down. And it took some serious balls for me (like I was proud of myself for just asking because I'm usually that nervous around girls.) I said ""I just lost my cuddle buddy. Would you like to be my new one?""

And to my fucking surprise it worked. And that low key made my year. We cuddled all night, talked and we wereÂ  watching a lot of Netflix and then we cuddled in her bed. Me being the virgin that I am I really didn't do much else except lay with her there but I was okay with it. 

Side note. Actually the best night of my life. 

Anyways the next morning I woke up and she had already been awake and lying on the couch. I go to lay next to her and then she sorta pushes me away. I say sorta because if I would have pressured it it seemed she may have actually given in.Â  Me being the nice guy I respected that. I asked her if something was up. And she didn't even have the common courtesy to tell me. She took out her phone and texted me. 

She told me that her and the kid I questioned her about the night before had an ""extremely low key thing."" 

So right away I didn't really know what to think. Except for a little bit of guilt because I felt bad if they had a thing and I did that with her. 

Anyways she turned me away and I wasn't really cool with that. It kinda hurt. Later that day she texted me saying that she had chosen him over me. And I guess right on. He looks a lot better than I do. So good for her. 

I went back to the state I came from and it was all iffy. I didn't really like living there so I got my job back where I used to work and I moved back to where I used to live. Just different house. 

I hang out with this girl almost every day. About 5 days a week. Of course I haven't given up hopes of being with her. Although I should.

It's been like 2 months sense I've been back and things are okay. She broke up with the friend that she rejected me for a little over a week ago.  And I thought sorta a perfect time to try my luck again. 

I stayed over at her house when we got drunk and it was just us and I made some shit up like ""The dog spilled pretzels on the couch. Can I come bunk with you?"" And then she pulled the ""I think of you like a brother."" Card. 

That really hurt. But at the same time I didn't think it was serious. I haven't tried anything sense that night. At the same time I think she is low key flirting with me sometimes when we're in the car and what not. I'm awful at reading women so I actually have no idea. 

I don't know why I like her so much but I just do. I just don't think she feels the same way but I want to make 100% sure because Idk. To me she's something worth fighting for. I guess also making this long ass post for. 

I just want a clear answer. I want her to say yes there's a chance or no not at all. Unfortunately I get attached a little to easily so that's my biggest downfall and I hate it the most about me.Â  

Should I just ask her if there's a chance? Or should I just take the Brother Card as a clear no.

I would do anything in the world for this girl idk man. Like she asks me late at night if I could give her a ride or something. I'm there.

Â Idk why but I feel like I should distance myself from her and see if she comes to me. 

At the same time when I do try that she does come to me. Like I was gonna give it a week without messaging her first or anything. Then she shows up at my job which is a 3rd shift job and she just was bored she said and we sat in her car and talked. I liked that. It made me believe that she actually cared about me or something ya know? She even came up here tonight to bring me something and then we chilled for about 45 minutes before I had to get back to work. 

I'm just so lost and I want a clear answer. Should I ask her if there's a chance or should I take the Brother Card as a clear no?Â  I can't get her off my mind and it's low key killing me.

I am sure that like many other people that have had their flight cancelled a simple refund of the cost of the flights will not suffice.

129,"**NOTE: I posted this in Life Advice but it's dead, no replies on anything recent and I could do with some help**

So I'm not usually the type of lad to just post stuff online, I'm not gunna go on Twitter and post subliminal's hoping that they'll pick up on it so I thought I'd put it on here, where I know they're just not going to be.

Basically, I have this one mate who I'd class as my best mate but I just know it's not both ways, he's the type of guy to class basically all of his mates that he talks to as best mates, even people he talks about behind there backs. I don't want to make this too long so I'll try explain it in an overview but It will most definitely be long. (I'm just gunna call him M to make it easier.)

Basically, I've known him since the summer holidays going into year 7, we was kinda close, I went off and was kind of a sheep to some other lads that were dicks but I was still good mates with M, comes to college and it was me, M and another lad who I've known since primary school. I realised then basically that M wasn't a dick and kind of annoying like my other mates and we became closer in a way (thats what I think anyway) year later, left college, me, M and a few others got apprenticeships so we all get paid and go out more, sometimes to the pub where we can get served because its just chill. One night at the pub we were absolutely hammered and he basically ask me what I said about him (M) to this bird I was speaking to because he knew I said something, I basically said to her that he was just being 'fucking annoying and sarcastic' which he was (this event that we talked about happened like a month prior to the pub so it'd been and gone) and thats when we basically started kind of talking heart to hear without sounding gay, but don't tell me it doesn't happen when you're pissed. 

Anyway, what happens is, we talk when we're pissed, he acts like we're best mates for like 2/3 days and after that it goes back to shit like speaking to one of them mates you know but you don't really speak to them, you've just known them a while. Now this has happened a few times, got pissed, talked shit, chill for a few days, back to shit, etc. Last time It happened I basically said ""We say all this shit now but in a few days, it'll just all be back to shit and awkard"" and M's like ""nah it wont, etc (not gunna get to far into it)"" and that night we was actually proper chill, like speaking to each other like we was actually best mates (I only say this because the best mate he has now which is 100% like his actual best mate - M was speaking to me like he speaks to him basically - We'll call the 100% best mate 'J') and I was like, thank fuck its finally chill. Obviously, few days later, back to normal. And its not like major shit, its just annoying shit, and it sounds gay but you'll be in like a PS4 party and he'll just blank you, or you'll tell him shit and he just wont listen but he does with his J. The other week he was talking shit about me behind my back so I was obviously pissed and messaged him about it, we talked for a bit and both apologised in the end, after that he was chill again then back to shit...

We get on the same bus every Thursday because he goes to college on that day and I always try start a conversation but he just kills it every time (baring in mind we spoke about this before when we were pissed) so this morning I just didn't speak to see if he'd actual start a conversation. Not anything apart from a 2 second:
M: ""are you gunna be late?"" (bus was 10 mins late) Me: ""Yeah"" M: ""Has it been like this all week?"" Me: ""Yeah, its shit, inconsistent, we have to get in a taxi when we get to TOWN NAME most days to try get to work on time""
and that was it. He does the same on messenger as well, just deads every conversation and I have to start everyone.

Basically, I just want to tell him that I cant be arsed with all this fake friend shit but I just can't, I don't know what the fuck to do anymore It just pisses me off so much but then I'll just forgive him in my head because I think hes my best mate.",19Jan2017,1

131,"Essentially she will:
constantly interrupt you to change the topic back to her studies or her boyfriend
make small comments about how everyone in the house is doing a shit major (compared to premed for her) 
Consistently imply that we are shallow or vapid and less intelligent than her because we don't want to discuss anatomy with her
Once walked in on a breakup I was having and changed the topic to how hard it was to be in a long distance relationship with someone she loves SO MUCH
Basically is a narcissist who cannot comprehend people not being interested in her topics. For fairness, also very kind person who will do what she can to help you if you are in actual need, ie horrendously drunk, slightly short on cash at the register etc

We stopped hanging out with her last year as much because we always left the conversation feeling worse about ourselves. She has now accused us of isolating her and treating her awfully. We have no wanted to hang out much but have been chatting to her as normal when we see her. I eventually explained our reasoning for not seeing her as much, figured I'd be honest. I agreed to try to include her in more stuff, for the last week I have been popping into her room for a chat, sending her videos and stuff, eating dinner with her.... 

She has just had a call with her parents essentially saying we're awful bullies, noone deserves to be treated the way we treat her (ie, not wanting to listen to lectures on anatomy and so avoiding her a bit) and that she wants nothing more to do with us. Except she then wants to hang out because she's lonely. She has told all of her friends how awful we all are... I just.... I have no idea how to handle this. I was really putting in an effort and it's clearly gone to nothing. 

I havent seen her since I overheard the phone call, but I have pretty much decided she's now not worth my time if she is making me out to be a bitch when I've done nothing wrong and have gone above and beyond to make her feel included. 

Anyone been in a similar situation? How do I deal with this, do I blank her? Do I just be civil and no more? I honestly want the least amount of contact possible right now. She doesnt know I overheard the call. 

TL;DR flatmate with pretty much no empathy is convinced we're bullying her, has told everyone she knows that I am a bitch, still wants to be on friendly terms and hang out. What do I do?",19Jan2017,3
132,"When I go out, I'm always paranoid - worrying people are following me or staring at me.
I've started to become really worried about terrorism and where it'll happen next. I have the dream of travel. It's the only thing keeping me going.
 Especially travelling Europe. If terrorism happens as constantly, I lose that dream. It feels like more and more countries aren't safe to visit, which is a massive shame.

I'm preoccupied with worries about it and have been increasingly depressed as there seems to be no end to terrorism. It's not the fear of dying in an attack, it's the fear of losing what makes Europe special - such as landmarks, culture, celebrations, dreading where it'll strike next and being scared to go places. I don't want to lose Europe. I've tried to explain what I mean on here, but I don't think people understand what I mean or maybe don't really care. I can't speak to anyone about it because - there's not much they can do - plus it may sound selfish that I'm only worried about it because I want to travel. I worry how I'll come across when talking about it.

I also get intrusive thoughts and I try to stop them from happening by arguing against them.  Which is exhausting.

It's been this way for a while. I'm worried I'm heading for a breakdown or something and that I'll end up in the streets, an alcoholic, schizophrenic and  homeless.

It's out of control. My cats been ill and I've been driving myself mad. Constant anxiety. 

I have depression too. Do I need to go back to the doctors for more tablets, whilst also trying to get therapy?",19Jan2017,1

134,"**Preface:**
I am currently 30 years old and 13k in credit card debt. After I ended an unhealthy relationship with my ex-girl friend towards the end of 2015, I moved into a small studio apartment by myself and spent 90% of 2016 working 7 days a week (one full-time office job during the week and a part-time job doing food deliveries on the weekends.) I didnât really go out much, barely focused on dating, and pretty much kept myself in isolation. 

I have been living in Florida for over 10 years now, but I donât feel as accomplished I think I should be at my age. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and my dream is to become a digital nomad traveling the world while working remotely as a freelancer, business owner, or even working for a company that permits location independence. 

I have been teaching myself front-end development, but I barely have the energy or the time to learn effectively due to the limited hours in my day along with the mental exhaustion and laziness from working 2 jobs. I have told myself that I do not want 2017 to be a replica of the past year where Iâm just working dead-end jobs, overexerting myself, and not truly focusing on my passion. Below are the following paths and opportunities I have currently.

**1.) Remain in Florida:**
I literally just paid off my car this month. Thatâs $278 extra I will have available. I could continue working both my full-time and part-time jobs and apply that surplus of income towards my credit card payment. Subsequently, if I choose this route I will remain âcomfortableâ in the sense that I enjoy living and being in Florida, but I will still feel as if I havenât progressed much and will continue learning code at a slower pace. 

**2.) Teach in Vietnam:**
This option has been extremely heavy on my mind and I have been doing the most research on this path. I have watched many vlogs, joined FB groups, and read Reddit posts pertaining to teaching in Vietnam. My overall plan was to get TEFL certificate by flying over to VN and doing an in-class TEFL course while there, where you get experience working directly with the students. After you receive your certification the school guarantees you a job. 

This option seems very appealing to me for multiple reasons: I have always wanted to travel to Asia, I enjoy working with kids, Iâd work part-time hours (15-25 per week), and I can supposedly can make anywhere from $1,500-$2,000 per month. I would use the additional hours off (that Iâd normally spend working at my full-time job) to immerse myself in studying code. I would also be to focus on productive activities as a whole to help clear my mind and help refine my skill set so that I will be able to be employable to work for a web development company or freelance on my own. 

As much as I want to take this option I have been weighing the pros and cons. First, I do not have a bachelor's degree (or any college degree for that matter.) In order to get work visa in Vietnam, this is a requirement. I have read about and âinterviewedâ a few people who claim there are people without degrees who are still able to teach English in Vietnam, but they have to do âvisa runsâ and exit the country and come back every 3 months.

The program Iâm trying to go through (which guarantees me a job at the end of the course), claims they shouldnât have a problem finding me a job, but they cannot confirm exactly how much money I will be making and stated I most likely will be working in the rural parts of VN and not in the city such as Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi which Iâd much prefer.

This presents a problem to me in a financial sense. If I were to quit my job, break my lease, sell my furniture, and go to Vietnam, I would still have a $300mo credit card payment, my $111mo cellphone bill, and pay a monthly storage fee of over $100 to keep my car in Florida (I do want to keep my vehicle--just in case.) Without a concrete idea of how much Iâll be making as a TEFL certified, college degree-less teacher on a tourist visa, Iâm understandably apprehensive as I might be going from a bad situation to worse if I cannot sustain myself in Vietnam while paying any bills back home in the states.

**3.) Move to Texas:**

The âsafestâ and most logical option would be to move to Texas. I have a cousin who is very intelligent and connected with the right people who has the ability to get me a scholarship for free at any college in TX (and possibly here in Florida). She emphasizes the importance of a college degree and understands the rut that I am in. Her offer is for me to move to Dallas Fort Worth, live with her in her house with her husband rent-free, work for her business part-time for 15-20 per week, and the rest of the time go to college to get my bachelor degree in any major I want.

I know the majority will say this is the obvious way to go, but as a 30 year old man who values his independence and prefers to teach himself code (I have seen many instances where people have landed web development jobs by learning on their own or attending short-term bootcamps and without a CS degree--although the CS degrees helps a lot!) I prefer not to invest the next 4-5 years studying in college not doing what Iâm passionate about. This opportunity will allow me to save money and help me get out of debt, but I have this overwhelming sense of unfulfillment by living under someone elseâs roof in Texas (where Iâm not quite sure I would even enjoy living).

My heart is set on Vietnam the most because I am still young, no kids, no girlfriend, and have no attachments other than my âdebt.â  I feel as if I donât travel now, I wonât do it as I get older. I would like to see the world and wouldnât mind isolating myself away from the distractions and hustle and bustle of Western life to focus on myself and gain mental clarity. ",19Jan2017,1
135,"I broke up with my ex after 4 months of being together around the end of October 2016 and for the past 3 months they have not left me alone. At first they would keep messaging me and talking about me on social media indirectly. Then it escalated and they sent a package to my house with 'memories' of us. Recently I discovered that they were impersonating other people though their phones to talk to me. Today their mother had messaged me saying that my ex has been trying to contact me and that they are worried about my 'well being' and I think I am going to lose it soon.

I feel so claustrophobic that this will not end. My ex told me once that they didn't get over their last relationship (who was with them for a shorter time than I was, and they cheated on my ex several times) for *9 months* and I am starting to feel that was not an exaggeration.

After several blocks, silent treatments, explanations on why they need to leave me alone and recently intervention from my friends, I feel this is getting nowhere. I would really appreciate some internet guidance.",19Jan2017,2

143,"Long background story sorry...My sister's 22, he's 34. Age is not really a factor here, except she's not a very mature 22 year old. They started dating less than 2 weeks ago and they work together. My sister knew he went to prison and has three kids, and can't see his two oldest daughters who are preteens. He got out of prison this past August. She wouldn't tell my mom or myself what he did, only this information. She told me I had to hear the story from him.. I wouldn't believe how corrupt our justice system is because he's of course innocent. She told us he treats her like a queen. He was living with his parents because his dad was sick. He moved in with her a week after they started dating while ""looking for his own place"". Only my sister-in-law and I knew he was living there. My mom did a background check on him after my sister told her everything. She didn't believe he was wrongfully accused and wanted more information, plus she's always been very protective, sometimes too much. I don't think she was out of line this time. My mom found 27 total charges in his past, some guilty some not, dating back to 2000. The charges included theft, theft from elderly, felony burglary, receiving stolen property, disrupting public service, obstruction, resisting arrest, stealing identities, misuse of credit cards, drug stuff including trafficking, domestic abuse, violating a protection order.. multiple times. And the reason he went to prison? Raping, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, of a young teenage girl. She says he was innocent and wasn't even there. But he was convicted by a jury there had to have been some evidence. My mom then told my sister in law and myself about everything and my sister in law then told my mom he was living there. My parents drove down to her apartment, since they pay for it while she's in college, and kicked him out. They told my sister everything. They told her they would give her the money she needs so she can quit her job for now. But she doesn't seem to get it. He's a smooth talker and he's played this game for years. He's charming her socks off. She has now stopped talking to everyone about it. And deleted her social media. So my question is.. is there even a remote possibility he could have changed like she claims? Without therapy or a sudden change in religion? Could he possibly have had a change in mindset? Should I really give him a chance? Or should I fight for her to stay away from him? And how do I do that without upsetting her more? Are we worrying too much? I can't believe a couple years in prison suddenly gave him integrity and changed him to the point that there's no possibility of the domestic abuse or worse happening again. I know she's an adult and 22. But I feel like she's being so nonsensical and stupid about this. I feel like she should run. Now. Before he shows his true colors with her and hurts her or even our family. I'm just at a loss as to what to do. Or not do.

He told me all that we had was fake, he didnt intentionally do it but he realizes now that all the moments where I thought we ""connected"" were just games he played with me. He wanted me to end things with Anna, fall for him, then he could have a shot at Anna. My best friend did this to me.

158,"So a bit of backstory I recently moved into a house along with 2 colleagues, we're all software engineers aged between 18 and 19. It's not a great town but we have moved into a seemingly very posh area.

We'd introduced ourselves to this neighbour on the day we moved in, it was a brief chat, maybe 30 seconds and he felt the need to point out his BMW, a weird thing but something we just laughed at later.

Anyway I was having my bed redelivered today after a mix-up at the weekend. So I went home from work at lunch to receive it and had to wait a while longer than I thought initially but that wasn't too big an issue.

Anyway when the delivery guys arrive they parked half over the neighbours driveway, it's not ideal but there's nowhere to park that doesn't block a drive and it's only a quick delivery. Anyway first I help them carry in the two bits of the base of the bed.

Then they go to grab the mattress and notice my neighbour waiting to pull onto the drive so one says I believe exactly these words ""sorry mate, do you need us to move?""

My neighbour then replied ""what are you doing you fucking twat?""

The delivery guys seemed genuinely shocked at this, apologised again and went to move the van.

My neighbour swore at them again out of the window of his car and one of the guys replied ""Alright sorry mate, calm down.""

My neighbour then made the ridiculously up his own arse remark of ""Don't speak to me like that!""

This time one of the delivery guys snapped and said ""Where were we supposed to park? It's driveways all along this road!""

He followed it up with ""No response because you know I'm right."" Admittedly not a smart move.

They moved back, my neighbour parked. They took my mattress inside and apologised if they'd caused any issues with my neighbour and I said not to worry because they hadn't done anything wrong from what I had seen. I apologised to them for my neighbour saying that.

After they left I quickly grabbed my coat and as I was about to get into my car my neighbour shouted at me. I can't actually remember word for word what he said at this point but what he said was something to the effect of:

""What was that?""

I apologised to try and keep things civil.

He then ranted about the delivery drivers and told me not to do it again... Fuck knows what he meant by that.

He then claimed the drivers had noted his precious BMW's number plate as they left and said he would hold me responsible if something happened to it. Again... wtf.

Finally he demanded their names, their company and contact details. I said I needed to get back to work so I'd put them through his door later. I don't want to though because the drivers did nothing wrong and actually seemed very nice.

He then made what seemed like a subtle threat of ""This isn't how this relationship needs to be, but if it is so be it.""

I was almost speechless in both shock and rage. I just drove off and now I'm at work. I ranted to my dad and told my housemates what happened.

We were wondering if it would be a good idea to contact the estate agents etc? I just want to know what to do because the temptation will be to hit him if he does the same shit again and knowing the smart move will be calming.",19Jan2017,2

I stupidly picked 3 consecutive days (tues, weds, thurs). The biggest problem is that I sometimes come home by 9;30-10, I dont have time for my homework, and my mom makes a big deal because she feels bad for me. Another issue with the job is that its hard to take days off because the boss only hired the exact amount of people she needs (meaning no extra people just in case) so they make a huge deal if i take off. This week i took two days off cause i was sick and there is a huge problem with one of he bosses, but its not my fault I got sick!

So I don't know what to do..Should i quit? should i change my days?

I don't want to seem like a quitter to my mom. 

Please, any advice would be helpful! ",19Jan2017,1
168,"I graduate HS in May, and I am absolutely stressed. I don't have a clear idea of what I want to do with my life. I have so many aspirations, that I don't know what I want to become.

I can't be the only one freaking out about real life right? How have you all gotten past this stage?

169,"I'm only kinda asking for relationship advice, I'd given up on a relationship with her and was just trying to be friends when the shit hit the fan.

I created this throwaway a month ago to ask about this person ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5fzdsp/should_i_say_whats_on_my_mind_to_someone_who/)). I decided to not say shit to her. Recently, I asked a mutual friend about it all, and as it turns out she was just more defensive than I thought, apparently she'd done shit like this before to other people and still managed to be on good terms with them, but not as extreme as calling them stalkers. So, since I acted shitty to her afterward, the fact we now hate each other is solely my fault.

I feel like absolute shit about it. I didn't think I could get lonelier, but here I am. As much as I want to clear the air, I'm fairly sure after how I acted towards he she doesn't want to be on good terms anymore and she probably realizes it's best for her if she keeps me really far away.

I know we're not gonna ever be together, I knew that before all of this went down. We'd be the death of each other. I just want to know how to make myself feel better about it all.

170,"Good afternoon, I have two problems I'd like some advice on.

Not really used to posting messages on reddit but I really need some advice. First of all: I'm currently working a data entry job at a bank and have been considered a ""Temp"" for 2 and a half years. By temp I do everything that the guy before me did but for less pay (11 an hour) and no benefits. However I am annoyed I am not using my Computer Science degree. I learned some coding but nothing major enough to land me a job (its also in Python which no one seems to be hiring for). I've been branching out and looking for Help Desk and QA/Tester jobs but I've been denied or never heard anything back. I've had temp agencies tell me my Resume looks great but again I've never heard anything. The closest I've gotten to a job was the first month out of college for a QA Tester, something I had never done or heard about. The interviewers seemed to like me but I don't think I did well on any of the parts. I also got the C++ question wrong but it was so long ago I don't remember what confused me. 

The second part of my problem is I live at home and the parent I live with lost their job recently (within the past 3 days). I am trying to relocate with my girlfriend to NJ (I live in PA) where she currently has a stable job (she just got hired the beginning of this month). I feel like the worlds biggest burden, if I could just move out my parent would be able to move to Texas with her boyfriend. Not only am I not skilled enough, no one wants to hire someone from another state. I have been working on courses via CodeAcademy but I am not sure that really is going to help me. I am sorry if this comes off as whining but I am truly trying to figure out what all I can do to try and not have others crash and burn with me. ",19Jan2017,4
171,"Hello people of Reddit, I have a question about these damn telemarketers. 

How do I get them to STOP CALLING MY HOUSE?! 
For as long as I can remember, they've always called. We've had them take our number off their calling lists, but then they'll call back literally an hour or two later! 

We normally just hit the ignore button, but this has gone on for far too long. I was in the bathroom, so I can't just walk out and hit the ignore button on the house phone, and they rang the damn phone about 20 something times before stopping. I was ready to punch a hole in the wall. 

So, does anyone have any advice? 
Also, I thought it was illegal for them to continue calling my house once I had them remove my number? I doubt I can escape them annoying fucks, but, if knows something, I'll listen. Thanks in advance.  ",19Jan2017,1

I kinda like this guy and he's hinted that he likes me too and all that. But I can't help doubting if my feelings and even his feelings are genuine. 

I've said a lot of stuff to him, stuff I wouldn't usually say. I have major trust and anxiety issues, so that's kinda a big thing for me. But I know I'm being irrational and I feel as though I can't break that cycle.

174,"When I say this, I don't mean screaming out ""this job sucks!"" as I think that's pretty unprofessional. What I mean is the job is becoming more work with less pay off.

When I was hired, 30-35 hours was promised, but after being hired everyone on the shift except supervisors are getting 10-17 hours a week. The job is very chaotic, which is fine,  but they try to stretch that dollar to an absolute limit. I know corporate has a budget and all, but really? Having only two people on black friday, Christmas eve and weekends? One of them being a manager? It just doesn't work at a place like the mall. It's extremely stressful for such a low income.

I originally had 100% open availability when I started in september, but seeing how it was December, I had a completely open schedule all that time but was only being worked again, 10-17 hours max a week. So I picked up a second job and changed my availability to split between the two jobs. They weren't very happy with this but I don't see it as something rude, I saw it as something like ""I need to eat and make money."" I didn't say it like that, but I did say there just wasn't enough hours as intended so I picked up a second job. Idk haha what do you think?",19Jan2017,1
175,"I'm 24, M, and I just feel like I've screwed up my life.  I am intelligent, and I want to become an engineer.  I will likely  be accepted into a University electrical engineering degree next year.  I don't have a lot of money but no debt.  Financially, this option is open to me.

Right now, I'm completing a community college diploma which I kind of hate.  I started this diploma program after I failed to get into Uni the first time (a couple of credits short).  

I thought that I should just accept my failure and try to find a financially stable job.  While I've been here though I've realized that I am smart enough to become a real engineer, and I've met a woman whom I love and will support me no matter what. 

Anyway, although I want to follow my dream, I know that its sort of a gamble.  I could probably get a stable ""technologist"" position (though I would have to move).  Ultimately, I want a good life with a house and kids and all that, but I'd like to do what I want in terms of a career too.  

I just feel weird about going back to school and graduating at like 29.  I know I shouldn't feel this way but I think about how much farther ahead I could be, about the people who have ""done it right"" and now have something to show for it. Sometimes it feels like I'm just running in circles.

Although I did regularize my sleep schedule by forcing myself to stay awake until 9 at night, I still have a lot of sleep debt. No matter how long I've stayed awake, the maximum hours of sleep I can get seems to be 6-7. I want to sleep more, but I just cannot. I can feel the fatigue and the fogginess in my brain since I have accrued a lot of debt, but I just cannot sleep. In fact, I went to bed at 11 last night and I woke up at 5AM.

I have started going to the scouts the explorers(14 to 18 years old) last Friday and on this Saturday they are going on a hike and and they said that I can come along if I want to(keep in mind I have not officially joined as a scout member yet). ð

I enjoyed it the 1st time meeting the scout members last Friday night and I would like to go this Saturday the hike because the thing is that there will be a lot more time get to know them better and maybe make new friends and the hike starts at about 10:15, 10:30am(before that we all have to meet at the train station to get a train to the area near Hastings that we are going to hike) in the morning and the hike finishes at 3PM in the afternoon and the hike is about 5/6 miles and all soo we are going to have lunch while hiking and the area that we are going to hike will be quite muddy as well.

But on the other hand that I have only met them once last Friday night and I just thinking that especially at 1st when I arrived there, I am going to feel nervous, I am sure the feeling nervous will go away once I start talking and being there with them after a while and the another thing that I might not go is that I might get left out for some of it(most probably will because I am the new member). ðð

If the hike was the 1st ever time that I am going meet the scout members then I definitely would not go but since I have met them once now last week then I feel it is a bit different. 

My mom said she would not go and my dad said he would go to the hike if they was in my shoes.

Anyway if I don't go to this hike, They will be plenty of more hikes that I am going do in the future and plus I would of definitely got to know them a lot and made new friends. ð

And all so if I don't go to this hike, I will see them(scouts) again next Friday night anyway. ð

So I really need some help everyone!!

Would you go to the hike if you was in my shoes since it is only your 2nd time meeting them?? Or would you give it a miss and see them next week???? Is there any advice/help you can give me if I do go to this hike?? ð¤ð¤

184,"Alright. This could take a while.
So my BF (24M) and I (23F) have been dating three years and going strong. My family loves him like their own and his mom has always treated me the same.
However, BF's dad and stepmother are another story. His dad cheated back in the 90's when the kids were little with said ""stepmom"" and he's been with her ever since. Never remarried, just living common-law. Stepmonster is known for being just that...a crotchety old bitch. She never had any kids of her own yet has always overstepped her boundaries with BF and his siblings. She constantly finds ways to tear people down and get her 2 cents in when it is not asked. She also claims to be an expert on behaviour since she works with special needs kids, yet cannot see that she herself has some major behaviour issues. I'm talkin her throwing food at BF's mother at a family gathering and calling her a ""deadbeat"" and making loud comments about my family's skin colour. (Were Indian, and BF's family is white)
I have tolerated it until now. BF and I are both in University and are saving for our first home. BF's father is supportive of this and allows me to spend the night once in a while at their house as long as we stay in separate rooms. Okay, fair enough. (Stepmom has given us grief about it in the past about how its inappropriate for an unmarried couple to have sleepovers. LOL)
Last night however, was a particularly snowy night and BF felt it was unsafe for me to make the 45 min drive home. I agreed, and slept in the guest room as I usually would. 
This morning when I got up to go home, there was a note on my car that said ""innapropriate""
Now...I don't know how to react. Do I say something to stepmother/dad on this or just keep my distance? BF is fuming and says he is going to confront stepmom. I am unsure...because at the end of the day it is not my house or my rules. 

Any thoughts?

She has changed a lot of her mannerisms while she's around me and it all happened while I was in my first semester in college, she's a senior in high school. She doesn't talk to me like she used to, she doesn't talk to me as much as she used to, she doesn't like kissing me anymore and her idea of cuddling is sitting next to each other (probably a matter of opinion, but that's not cuddling to me imo) Whenever I bring this up to her she says that we got used to each other and are no longer in that exciting part of our relationship. What I don't get is how we could have entered this phase, without my knowledge or participation, while I was away at college with little face to face contact with her, for four months. I simply don't understand. If someone could maybe try and show me her point of view please try and explain it to me.

Anyway. I can't take it much anymore. I'm in a way, giving her an ultimatum. But here's where it gets shitty.

187,"So I'm a freshman at a university in New York, currently studying journalism with a minor in music.

Ever since I was little, I've been enamored by the idea of traveling the world, and I recently went on my first solo backpacking trip around Italy, and had an amazing time and met amazing people.

I realize now that I'm capable of navigating foreign places and making friends along the way - and I feel inspired to spend the rest of my life traveling.

But the issue is, I need a degree that will make it possible for me to find work anywhere on relatively short notice.  A field that is in high demand, but also offers a great degree of flexibility.

Journalism has potential, as I could write about my experiences and sell my writing - but ultimately, journalism is an oversaturated field, and I worry that I might struggle to find work for long periods of time, which is not conducive to my goals.

Music of course permits me to make money busking and doing local gigs, but it's not totally reliable either.  This would mostly amount to a side gig, unless I'm lucky enough to make it big in the next few years, which I'm obviously not counting on at all.

So any thoughts?  I was thinking maybe some sort of foreign language program, so I could work as a translator/teacher wherever I am?

I (24m) have pretty bad anxiety (including but not exclusively social). This has resulted in me driving away pretty much all social interactions all my life. I live alone with my dog and spend most nights drinking beer/tequila and watching Netflix, or shitposting on Reddit.

I do cool things when I have vacation days, but my day-in-day-out grind makes me want to kill myself.

I finally have my career, education, and health straightened out, and in 2017 I'm trying to focus on fixing the mess I've made in my social life. I want to make friends, and go out and do things after work...but I'm a solid half hour from downtown. It's a very different world from what I'm used to, and my anxiety ALWAYS wins. I always bitch out. It doesn't help that I'm completely exhausted after work as well.

My idea is that, if I move downtown, it'll be much easier (logistically and emotionally) to get out more often.

The complicating factors:

1. There are a lot of wooded trails where I live now, and I use them daily for cycling and walking my dog. I've never had a dog in a wholly urban area, and I don't know how she or I will handle it. Im also terrified that losing easy access to traffic-free trails will kill my interest in cycling.

2. I don't know whether moving downtown will help cure my anxiety/loneliness, or just break me. What if I just can't handle it and snap? Or what if I still end up spending all my time alone? Its not like they give you a free bag of friends at the door. **Is this just one big, dumb escapist fantasy?**

My mother and I have had referrals sent over to a drug testing agency to test us for marijuana.  I do not sell weed. No way to prove it to anyone but whatever. My mother and I do smoke.

Alexa broke up with me in such a gnarly fashion that it spun me into a deep dark depression that made me unable to attend or do well in class. She also has a court case against me because I texted her while we had a no contact order (allegedly).

Only reason why I keep sending them money is because I love mom(she loves them too) and they keep phoning my mom every month asking for ""rent"" money and that they're poor even though they all have minimum wage jobs in their country. I have no problems sending them a couple hundreds every month but they're really annoying me lately. So, most of you might know, Chinese Lunar New Year is coming up in Asia countries and the so-called ""aunts"" and ""uncles"" just called my mom and yelled at her for not sending them the money in time for the Chinese Lunar New Year and that they don't have any money to celebrate it over there themselves. My mom was working overtime lately thus she didn't have enough time to go to the bank to send them money and they got mad at her. She asked me if I could send them her part of the money and mine asap and I replied ""this is enough, I'm tired of your siblings"" and didn't send them anything. They later called me and said I was a bad, ungrateful nephew and so on. My mom just called me today and said she just sent her part of the money today and her siblings received it and spent it all in 2 days, wow. She sent them $700. She asked me if I sent mine part yet and I said not yet, I'll decide later. Now, should I send them money or not? They're blood family afterall but I feel that they don't deserve it.",19Jan2017,1

So I'm in quite a predicament here. My ex-fiancÃ©, who moved out a little over a month ago, has blocked my phone number and my Facebook Account.

However, she still has access and actively uses my subscriptions, like Spotify and Netflix. I even tried to kick her out of them and change all the passwords, but she practically guilted me back into letting her use them.

Meanwhile, she immediately moved on to another guy within days of leaving me. 

Is this weird at all? Should I stand up for myself and force her to use whatever her boyfriend will provide her? Or should I just not care? I still love her and still want to be with her, but it's still weird right now.",19Jan2017,1
214,"I'll just launch right into the situation I am facing ATM -- I have a stalker who is a man, late 30's (I am 24F) I met, seemed nice, then would not stop calling my cell, house, emailing -- calling my house phone &amp; talking to my parents. I cut all contact and made it very clear I wanted nothing to do with him. I changed my cell, email and blocked him via house phone. A few weeks later he called my local police (he lives a few counties away) and told them I ""in danger"" -- policeman shows up and tells me to file restraining order. Nothing for a few months and then he shows up at my residence (which I share w/ my parents) at midnight. Called cops and immediately filed restraining order (my mistake was not doing this RIGHT AWAY. Huge regret). Nothing for a few months until he gets a friend to call my house on NYE asking if I was ""okay"". Called police for breach of protection order. As of now, I am not sure the prosecutor will file charges because it wasn't ""him"" calling directly. Talked to the police a few days ago &amp; he said the offender showed up at the station a few months ago (this is a long drive for him) -- but would not elaborate on what he wanted. If he was asking about me, is this a violation of the order? 



I am writing to you all to ask your advice. At this point, I have done all I can do. I have pepper spray with me and am on constant alert for his car in or around my home. His parents are wishy washy but I heard via the police that they want to make him a ward of the state. He apparently had a welfare check &amp; barricaded himself inside his residence and then attacked the police who entered. Is there any way I could convince him I have moved?

219,"Hi folks,
Here is my situation. I work for a small company and part of my job includes SEO optimization for the website. I correspond regularly with a coworker who writes content for the site. 

A couple of weeks ago, after seeing her latest post that wasn't optimized I sent her an email gently reminding her to please use heading tags for article headings rather than normal text set to bold, as this is part of SEO optimization. We also have an SEO plugin that shows alerts of possible SEO problems when users write content. We had discussed the importance of using these things before and she agreed.

The email was no replied to, which I thought was a bit strange since she always responds to all emails usually very quickly. After getting no response for about a week, I sent a follow-up email and 2 days later still no response even though she is replying to all my other emails since before and after this one.
I suspect she is not replying because she is miffed or put out by me pointing out something she isn't doing that she should be.

 The issues I'm asking her about are actually pretty insignificant in of themselves, but I have to admit its bothering me that she is simply choosing to ignore me when I'm being very polite and professional about it.

I considered going over her head and bringing the issue to her supervisor but that seems like an over the top dick move. Any advice would be much appreciated.",19Jan2017,1

223,"For the purpose of the story lets call my sister in law ""Kelly"" and her new boyfriend ""Randy"". Kelly is a 22 year old college student, she works part time at a local restaurant hostessing. Her boyfriend Randy is a kitchen manager at the restaurant and that's how they met. 

So, last week Kelly decides to stop by my house to introduce my husband (her brother) and I to her new boyfriend. I welcomed him into our home with open arms and I can honestly say I was willing to get to know him despite my weird feelings about the 12 year age gap. Randy seems nice enough, no complaints with him at this point. So the next day, I am texting my husband's other sister ""Krystal"" and she tells me Kelly confided in her that Randy has gone to jail and he also has two kids (12 and 9 F) that he isn't allowed to see. For reasons we do not know yet. 

Let's jump to Monday night I get a call from my hubby's mom. She's in tears and frantic. She tells me that Krystal told her about Kelly's new boyfriend and that hes been in jail.. so my MIL takes it upon herself to pay for a background check on Randy... It sounds crazy, but at this point I'm glad she did... What my MIL found was 27 different charges from 2000 to present. Including, but not limited to... burglary, theft from elderly, misuse of credit cards, drug trafficking and possession, receiving stolen property... and the most concerning, rape and sexual misconduct with a minor. Some of these charges were dropped but the rape and sexual misconduct charge he was found guilty for, and he was just released from prison in August. Oh and the victim was a 15 year old girl when he was 28 (I'm seeing a pattern here)

With this information in hand, my MIL decides to talk to Kelly. Only to find out she KNEW the whole time!! She argued with her mom that ""Randy is innocent"" and ""you have to hear the whole story from him"". Oh she also told us this guy has been living with her because ""he's in between houses"". Of course my MIL flipped out, and things have been spiraling out from there. 

So I have a few questions here...

A) are we all being too over protective?? She has been defending his actions every step of the way, could it be possible he has really ""turned over a new leaf"" like Kelly thinks?

B) Since the conversation with her mom, Kelly claims she broke up with Randy... but then she deleted all of her social media and has been pulling away from family. What can we do to show her support without pushing her away even more?

C) Finally, my husband's family is pretty well off (one reason I think Randy targeted Kelly) what can we all do to protect ourselves if this does go south? My husband is already freaking out that he's been in our house and is refusing to leave me home alone.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all of that!!! I would appreciate ANY advice we can get right now!!

So my family have already booked a holiday to the same location as the past 10 years, (I don't mean to sound stubborn about it, sorry), and I've already said I don't want to go, because I want to focus on my body and the gym, but they can always book me a flight with them.

The problem is, I was bored last year when we went, (I don't mean to sound snobbish or anything),  there is not the greatest deal of things to do there, and we have a similar routine each day where we go the pool, get out and sun bathe for a while. It's nice and relaxing. However, there is not much else to do for the rest of the day, and that is where the problem lies... 

The holiday is great an all, it's just I get bored after a few days. I am really into video games, but I am not playing as much and concentrating on school, (I have GCSEs in 5/4 months so I am revising for them). 

In addition to this, I would also really like to lose some weight and gain some muscle. I want to feel more confident about myself. I would really like to have a flatter stomach and not weigh as much. I will be finishing school mid June, and will have up to September to focus on the gym. 

Now, do I spend 2 weeks on holiday, being lazy, relaxed, or do I do what I want to do and get to the gym and focus on making myself look better and feeling more confident? I feel as if I have to go on holiday, but my mum said ""don't feel as if you have to go, if you don't, then that's fine."" But it's a holiday after all, and it'll be 2 weeks. But I'm thinking 2 weeks could help a lot in the gym.

253,"My partner and I were adopted a good few months ago by an apparently stray cat. For ages we thought he belonged to someone nearby but now we are fairly sure he doesnât, following asking around, etc. and I searched online to see if anyone had advertised him as missing but found nothing. Heâs a wonderful cat, and my partner and I both love him to bits.

So we basically took him on. But one thing that occurred to me the other day is that we never thought of checking him for a chip. He's not neutered and a friend of mine said that she thinks itâs therefore unlikely. I donât know. I had a good feel around his neck and shoulders and couldnât feel anything, but I know that doesnât mean he definitely doesnât. 

I want to get him checked for a chip, (well, I don't WANT to, if you get me) I just feel that we really have to, and that we cannot just keep hold of him without ever checking. Plus there is the fact that many vets now scan new pets on registration to make sure the owners are who they say they are, so I donât feel itâs something we can avoid. I dearly love the cat, and desperately donât want to lose him, but I am so scared of doing this. This is made so much harder by the fact that my other half doesn't agree with me, and says that the cat is ours, that his previous owners couldn't be bothered to neuter him so they are clearly irresponsible (I agree there), and that no-one seems to be obviously looking for him, so we shouldn't bother getting him scanned for a chip. He just doesn't see it as a problem. I spoke to a couple of volunteers for a pet rescue charity at a stall at a local town fayre and they said it sounded like he was probably adopted as a kitten, and then dumped, that they had loads of cats come in lately who had just been abandoned by owners, and that he had obviously chosen us. I asked about checking him for a chip and they just said ""he won't have one"". 

What do I do reddit? I love this cat, and would be gutted if we lost him, but I just donât know what to do. Thinking of asking the in-laws to take him to their vet or asking a friend to take me with them? I canât drive, so I canât go alone (and Iâd want someone else there for support). Iâm not comfortable with not knowing, but at the same time terrified of finding out. If he doesnât have one, itâll put my mind at rest, but if he does, we could lose him and my other half and I will be devastated. Anyone else ever been in this situation? I live in the UK.

Microsoft Surface

So I got a Surface Pro 3, and I was super disappointed.  It got REALLY hot, like the fans were turning so fast that I could hear it screaming about how hot it was (this was in mid December so the ambient temperature was not an issue).  I returned it and am now debating between a Surface Pro 4 OR PS4/Nintendo Switch.

Surface Pro 4 is ~$800 while getting both a PS4 and Nintendo Switch would be about the same price (excluding games). So... please Reddit help me decide between work/fun versus just purely for fun/I was definitely planning on getting a PS4 but I will hold off on getting it if I get the Surface Pro 4 but I don't know if I really NEED a Surface Pro 4 and I might as well get a PS4 now and maybe even the Nintendo Switch since the Surface Pro 4 is so much more expensive and I'm kind of saving money by not buying it but not really/ maybe I'll just get a PS4 and games and say goodbye to the outside world for a while now as opposed to how I planned to do so later.

tldr; I'm bad at making choices.  I just want Reddit to tell me to buy the PS4 now because of all the awesome games and maybe even the Nintendo Switch.

258,"I donât even know how to begin this, so please bare with me. 
I live with my mom and my grandma at the moment. Iâm only 20 and having a lot of medical problems going on and trying to get it straightened out. But, this post isnât about me. Itâs about my mom and my grandma.

My mother is blamed for everything by my grandma. My grandma gave birth to my mother, but she did not raise her. My motherâs grandma (My great grandma) raised her. She took care of her. 

My grandmother was never around for my mom. 
My grandmother told me she left to go work so she could better care for my mother. My mother, on the other hand, denies it completely. She told me that her grandmother took care of her most of her life. She was 16 before she ended up moving out. 

She also told me that my grandma left to go be with my grandfather (Come to find out many years later that he wasnât actually my grandpa, not biologically anyway.) Who was an alcoholic, and drug abuser. 

My grandmother got beat by him regularly, but she never said why she got beat by him. Later on my when I got older my mother told me the real story.
My grandmother got beat by my non-biological grandfather because she snuck around trying to sleep with her step-son. (her husbands son) who was also only 17 at the time. 

Well, one weekend my grandma went to pick up my mother when she was younger (about 7 or 8 I believe) so she could come stay with her for a couple days. 

My grandma, the stepson, and my mother were all going to be there. When they arrived at the house there were drugs everywhere. My grandma just let this go on. My grandpa was out working, Iâm not sure for how long, but I know he wasnât there. 

She doesnât remember the detail of the drugs exactly, she was very young so of course she wouldnât know. I canât piece together the in between time this next part happened. I donât want to ask my mother either because it was a very traumatizing experience. 

I donât want to bring anything up with her that would make her uncomfortable. Sheâs only talked about this with me a couple times. She was with her mother and her stepbrother in the house one evening, and her mother let her stepson molest my mother. She knew it was happening, and she didnât do anything about it. 

She just let it happen. She never went into detail with what happened, but there doesnât need to be any detail. Itâs fucked up that your mother would let something like that happen to you. 
The same time she was there, the swat team busted in to catch the stepson who was selling drugs. The door was kicked down, they came in with guns. 

The grandmother tried to help the stepson out by trying to get him out of the house before they found him. My motherâs grandma came and got her. She wasnât going to let her stay in that situation. I do not know if my mother ever told her what happened that day. She lived with my grandmother and didnât see her mother for a very long time after that. 

She moved out when she was 16 because she wanted to take on her own life. Fast forward to me being born.

My mother wasnât supposed to be able to have children, so she was very grateful for me. My mom and dad got a divorce, but there was a lot of mental stuff going on with my father at the time so I believe it was best. 

Well, Iâm about 7 years old and we live in a small apartment just me and her. We get a knock on the door, so she gets up off of the couch to go open it. I walk into my room to go do something or get something I donât remember. 

I walk back into the living room not long after and thereâs some man grabbing my mother. I couldnât tell what he was trying to do. When I walked in he saw me and dropped her and left. 

That person was the man that molested her. My grandmother told him where we lived and he wanted to stop by and see her. She told me later on when I got older that he was trying to rape her. He ended up breaking her ribs from where she tried to get away. My grandmother let him go to the house (where she lived with my grandpa). 

My grandpa was settled down and very sweet and cared for my mom, me, my father, and not so much my grandmother. Well, he caught my grandma and his son in the bed with each other. He was so furious that he pulled a knife on both of them. He didnât hurt anyone. They bolted out. 

And this is where my grandfather started having heart problems, and leg problems. My grandmother left with her stepson. My mother didnât know this and we had went up to the house to see my grandma and grandpa (my mother wasnât going to not let me see them no matter how she felt.) 

We get up there, maybe a week later, and all the doors are open to the house. My grandpa has let stray animals in. Itâs a complete mess, and my grandpa was not okay. He hadnât had his medicine, he hadnât eaten properly. 

This is when my mom learned that my grandma was off with her stepson. We got my grandpas medicine, helped him, and got the house cleaned up. Fast forward to a couple weeks later. My grandmother called because she wanted us to come see her, she said she was staying in a hotel and no one would be there. We go there, and sheâs staying with her stepson. 

He walked up to me and tried to hug me and I didnât know him. I wouldnât even look at him. I remember him saying âYou wonât give me a hug or a kiss?â I shook my head no, and thatâs when my mother grabbed me and we rushed out of the hotel room. Years later she told me.
âI was never going to let what happened to me, happen to you.â

Fast forward through the years. I lost my grandpa not long after that. He was in the hospital and we would always go see him. I couldnât look at him though, I couldnât make myself go up to him. But I knew he was always watching me. One day I went straight into the room and I went up to my grandpa that was looking at me straight in the eyes.

 I hugged him and I told him I loved him. He just stared at me but I knew that he said it back. The next morning my mom woke me up and told me that he had passed away. I remember as soon as she told me I responded with.

âI know.â And laid back down.

Fast forward again some years and my grandmother had her leg amputated. We move in with her to help take care of her. Despite everything she has put my mom through, she was gonna take care of her. 

Fast forward again to the present. My mother and I help my grandma do everything. We take her to the doctor, help her get in the shower, get her medication, the list goes on. She is wheelchair bound, so we lift a lot. My mother has went to the doctor to help get her mind right. 

They diagnosed her with Bi-polar OCD. And since my mother has been getting better, my grandma treats her like dirt. She throws up the money that she uses, she throws up if my mom buys anything. She told my mother she doesnât pay any of the bills, when they go in on it. Gas to go to the doctor. She acts like my mother doesnât do anything right. 

Mom told me that she has a lot of anger towards her, and she said most of it is the fact that she wonât admit what happened to my mother growing up. She denies her molestation, she denies her grandmother taking care of her, she denies sleeping with her stepson, she denies anything and everything about my mother. 

She blames her for everything. She makes excuses like âOh, well I better clean up the house so your mom doesnât bitch at me.â Mom doesnât do that. She makes excuses for the things she wants to do, or thinks she has to. Iâve heard her tell people my mom was gonna try to poison her, I heard her tell people that she wasnât being taken care of. 

We even had DHR coming up here because of my grandmother. She constantly slurs her. I told her myself.

âWhy canât you say youâre proud of her? Sheâs come so far from how she used to be, why canâtyou just be happy?â She told me that she is proud of her. I told her Iâve never heard her ever say it. Sheâll cut her down at the slightest mishap that happens. Iâve even gotten onto my grandmother and told her that she needs help because she shouldnât blame her for everything. 

She said she doesnât blame her, thatâs just how she takes it. Iâm in the middle of this, even tho I donât have to be. I love my mother, and I love my grandma. But, things are changing, and as Iâm seeing how  things really are as Iâve gotten older she gets angry with me more often. This was supposed to be a short text to put on reddit for some advice on maybe why she is the way she is, but it ended up turning into a venting of it all. 

Iâm just at a loss. I hate seeing my mother so unhappy, but I also hate thinking that our family just canât get along. Why canât she face up to what happened and admit it, instead of blaming my mother and saying that she âEnticedâ her stepbrother into molesting her. All my mother wants is for her to admit what happened. She says those things didnât happen, or she doesnât remember it like that. 

If you took the time to read this, thank you. I just want any advice on anything to do. Thank you.
