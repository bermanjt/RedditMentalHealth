1,"2 days ago I went to the IMAX to watch TLJ. I had a nice central seat, about 1 position away from the centre. 

So I go in, get my seat. A few minutes later 2 guys go to the seats to my right and sit down. A few minutes after that a couple sit to my left. 

Just after sitting down the woman in the couple asks if I can swap with her husband, who is 2 seats to my left. Saying that they are with the people to the right. I wanted to say no, Mainly because I didn’t believe their story, and I also wanted to keep my middle seat. But in the end I decided that if I was wrong, I would have 4 people surrounding me who would be less open to manners. So I switched seats. 

Should I have told them I wasn’t interested?, What did they have to gain from having my seat?

2,"To first put this into context, my mother(Who is the only parent I live with) is a toxic parent, absurdly controlling, racist, *""her way or the highway"" type person, a full blown narcissist on top. If you want better details, I made a post a short while ago about her titled after what I put the asterisk next to.

Anyway, I cannot stand to live with her anymore, yet I'm only 16 so I can't exactly move out, yet. Living with her drives me bananas and I cannot see myself making it another few years. 

Now to the main topic, I need advice on how to get out of here and thrive on my own, preferably without her knowing, or else she may track me down. The sooner I can get out, the better.

For further information on what kind of position I'm in so you have more information to work with: 

I'm getting good grades in advanced classes, average 5.07 weighted GPA, so that may make getting into a college easier.

Ideally I do indeed want to go to college as well as law school to become a prosecutor. However something else related to criminal justice would work too.

I have two decently strong connections with friends at my school. Also I have some much stronger connections with several friends that live in different states, but most of us still live on the east coast, and usually only one or two states away. So if possible I could split an apartment bill with any of them to get things sorted out on my end.",17Dec2017,1

6,"(Note: I go to an online school so it's a lot harder for me to talk to a teacher/counsellor without my parents getting involved)

Finals are coming up and I have an F in math, have all year. All throughout school I excelled in reading but was placed in adv. math 3 different times. One of those I was kicked out, one I finished with a C average, and one I failed the entire year. I've averaged F's in math for the past 3 years and am so far behind the teacher I have now hasn't been able to help me. The last thing she recommended to me was to practice multiplication and use a times table, but in her help sessions, she reviews quizzes and problems from the lesson, not general math help.

I've been kind of worried that I might have [Dyscalculia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia) because I relate to a lot of the signs/symptoms. My parents don't want me switching to an easier class because the one I'm in now (Algebra 2) is required for graduation but they also don't listen to me when I try to explain how far behind I am or how much I'm struggling to pass. 

Some friends have been trying to help me out since the tutoring building near me is insanely expensive, but they're either struggling or in a different class with different material. I really feel like I'm out of options, but I have to pass this class this year 1. So I can get my credits (otherwise I'd have to do a summer school program or credit recovery) and 2.

8,"I am at a crossroads in my life. It is the end of the first semester of my sophomore year, and I am pretty much out of required courses to take. This is significant as I have to start taking actual 300 level courses for my major(History), but I am getting second thoughts about majoring in it. I originally wanted to major in it because I thought I could get a good GPA in it, which would get me into a great law school. I chose this path as I believed it would catapult me to eventually being rich. Recently though I've found a liking to science and math as I took a basic physics course and especially liked the math side to it. I know the math taught there is basic, but I really think there is a chance that I could get a good GPA by majoring in it. By doing this, I would hope to go into actuarial math or something else that is finance or business related for the same reason I wanted to be a lawyer. So in short, would you make this jump, or keep taking history courses and eventually go to law school? I find both history and finance interesting, but definitely find less lucrative things like astronomy and psychiatry to be far more interesting. I've tried to make this as clear as possible, but my mind is a tangled ball right now, so I apologize for how messy my post is.",17Dec2017,4

No matter where I go, there's dander. Even if my room is completely shut off to the rest of the house, I'm eventually exposed to it anyway.

I'm taking anti-histamines daily, but even with the strongest I can get, I need to take 3x the listed dose to feel any difference at all, and it still wears off really quickly.

I met this girl. We have a lot in common. We hung out together. Talked much. I never really showed any signs of interest even though I have a crush on her. I'm scared as hell. One night we're out for a drive. She told me that people were speculating that we were together (small town), then she said we were just friends. I meant to tell there what I felt. But something came up and she had to leave in a hurry. Later that night I texted her how I felt. Bad idea. I dumped everything out of the blue. Put her in a bit of a shock. A couple of days later she tells me that she just wants to be friends. I say fine and apologize for the text. We meet once again and then I go silent. Couldn't be around her. Was hurt. First love and all that bullshit. Then yesterday I meet her at a gas station with another friend of mine. They ask me to hang out and I say yes. Was feeling better about her. Thought I got over it. We go to her place. Watch a movie, friend leaves. I stay. We watch a few more movies, just the two of us. Looking at each other. I think she came on to me. Took her jacket off one shoulder and got closer to me. I tell her that she's cute. She asks how and tells me ""that's my opinion"". We finish the last movie. I tell her that I had a good time, she says the same. I leave.

I removed the parts I could but one side of the pouch seemed to be wrapped completely around the bottom set of rollers and there was no way I was able to unravel that off (although I didn’t try with the laminator heated, I was worried this would make things worse). I told my line manager without being entirely forthcoming with details and said “I can’t get it to work”, expressing I was rather worried it was jammed and didn’t know what to do.

So it just kind of happened one night and we woke up the next day like... what did we just do? So we talked about it and were fine but decided we shouldn't do it again. A couple nights later we did it again. We talked and just didn't know what or how to feel.

She left town for a few days to take some time to herself, and the night before she came back she called me almost in tears asking me to be her boyfriend. Obviously I was a little caught off guard. We talked on the phone for a couple of hours and after she assured me this was what she wanted, I agreed.

We dated for a couple weeks and it was going great we were having a great time together. Then she went to the doctor to have some blood work done and found out she was pregnant. Its really a miracle because she was not  supposed to be able to have kids. So she took a couple days to think again, and decided she didn't want to continue a romantic relationship because she didn't think she could spend the rest of her life with a man. I understand that agree that for the twins its best to nip this in the butt now and resume and nurture a happy healthy friendship so those two can grow up with two amazing loving parents who get along and love each other.

58,"Hey, so I'm a pretty introverted guy - and like most introverts, I have never been particularly interested in small talk. And it shows in my body language and facial expressions and tone of voice. Big time.

When I meet new people, I really enjoy getting to the midway part of the conversation where we can talk about things we're both interested in, whether that's sports or politics or even wacky shit like aliens, if that's where the conversation happens to take us.

But those first five minutes and last five minutes are PAINFUL and awkward, whenever I'm involved. Like tonight, for example, when somebody was saying goodbye to me, they were smiling and sounded chipper and said, ""Chris it was SO nice to meet you. Good luck with your programming and have fun at the wedding next week."" And it sounded natural and warm. But all I could manage was a super monotone voice where I said, ""Oh, thank you, yeah it was nice to meet you too. See you later."" 

It sounded fake and like I was forcing it, and this kind of thing happens all the time.

Any ideas on how to get better?",17Dec2017,3

Cutting it short, I have a big crush on a girl I have been friends with since I was five.

71,"Guys, I don't know what to do anymore. I am by no means a mediocre student, but I just can't seem to find the reason why is this happening. For instance, all the science classes I took so far, I've had A in the lab section, but for lecture I get a C at best. I can't keep up with homework no matter what. Also struggle to study for a quiz or test. I understand the material, and everything makes sense, but I just can't bring myself to prepare for it.

For the first two semesters I ended up stop attending all of my classes. Third semester I took 10 credits, and got an A, C, and a D, respectively. For the fourth semester I ended up withdrawing from one class, and got a D for lecture, and A for lab section with an overall C grade.

I was allowed back in school after the suspension re-appeal due to the circumstances I have been going through.

During this time I helped my friend who is doing entrepreneurship successfully start his business. I literally gave him my idea, and helped him set everything up. Why? Because he had the money to make it happen, and I desperately needed money to pay my bills. Also I started working at the warehouse at $9 per hour, they loved my innovative ideas so much, and offered me to work for them at $15 an hour. I am also making good money doing day trading. Point is I paid all of my tuition, and dues without ever loaning money from anyone.

I really want to major in Applied Physics, and Mathematics, and I understand these subjects very well. Is school over for me? Is there anything I can do, because I'm sitting at an 0.77 GPA (cumulative)? I have attempted 57 credits, while have only around 18 being credited.

Earning more money is not an issue, but I really want to study more, it's more of a passion for me. I'd appreciate a good feedback, and plan my next move accordingly. Thank you, if you made it this far!

Specially when CeCe is just a teen who's going through hormones and maybe even pressure and stress to look a certain way because he keeps stressing about her pimples and shit.
And one time he fucking brought his fingers up to her forehead and touched her pimple. I... I couldn't believe my eyes I was literally like wtf. But I didn't want to make a scene or say anything at his brother graduation party.
During work when I visited them (since they work close together), he said ""you and CeCe have acne problems"" and then later he said to me ""oh hey there's something on your face no like right here"" - while moving his hands on his face brushing his cheeks. So I had thought oh maybe it's spray paint. I checked from my phone and I just knew what he meant. Under my cheekbones I supposedly have discoloration it's darker than my natural skin tone and I really don't know why.

So I'm not angry at this point because I'm just so damn tired today. So I was like whatever man.

84,"Ok, so I have a couple problems with my new job. My first problem is that it is my first job, I am getting paid $9/hour and am working some pretty crazy hours. They have me working overtime a lot. And they are having me work late nights during the week when I have school the next morning. I need the money so I don't want to quit but they don't seem to respect my time and I value my time and energy at more than $9/hour but they say that I can't get a raise until after working there for a year and even then the raise would only be $0.25 more. Since I don't have any other work experience I can't really imagine another job offering to pay me more so I feel kind of stuck. My second problem is that, I have a feeling that if things keep up the way they are then I might either be fired for some reason or I might quit, I don't know why but I just have a strong feeling of one of those two things happening. In the event that I am fired/I quit, will I still get my Paycheck for the work I had previously done in the week and on that day? 

Edit: I want to make a few clarifications really quick before any hate starts rolling in about me just being spoiled. Firstly, when I say they don't respect my time what I mean is that I could be working a 10 or 11 hour shift and they would still only give me (1) 20 minute break... That is it, so If I were working from 11:30 am to 10:30 pm they would only give me (1) 20 minute break... So I would basically be forced to choose between using my break for lunch or using my break for dinner. They also don't respect my time because the first week I began working there they gave me a schedule which said I was working till 11:00 pm. So, (since I didn't have a license at the time) that is when I told my dad to come and pick me up. Well by the time 10:30 pm rolls around while I was at work, I started helping them pack some stuff up and was about to leave when a manager came over and told me I had to stay until close, and with all the ridiculous amounts of cleaning and work to be done then, I didn't get out until almost 1:00 am and my dad had been sitting out front in his car the entire time.

90,"I'm 17, almost 18, and I'm pretty sure I have anxiety. I wouldn't really have known because I didn't have anyone to talk to about this stuff till recently. Whenever I remember a memory that make me uncomfortable (there's a lot of them) I twitch a lot and when I'm alone sometimes I'll verbally tell myself to stop, as in to just stop thinking about it. I didn't really know what a panic attack was until I saw some people on reddit describing them and i have two specific memories where I'm pretty sure I'm having them. I twitch a lot in general when I'm in uncomfortable situations, which I feel like I'm in a lot even around my family. At both of my moms and dads houses sound travels far, so whenever I talk it feels like everyone in the house can hear me. I don't really talk with my family but sometimes they want me to interact with them but I just can't or don't want to or whatever. So it feels like I can't speak at all in my house, over the phone or whatever because everyone can hear me and want to hear me because I'm not a part of their lives at all. Maybe I'm just paranoid but it feels like I have no privacy. I absolutely hate it when there are people standing behind me while I'm sitting down, at home, school, or whatever, it makes me super uncomfortable.

I don't have very many friends but I met a girl who has become somewhat of a friend who used to have bad anxiety and eventually got help around sophomore year (we're both seniors), and I was telling her about some of the stuff I've been feeling . I told her that at night I pull my hair, and she was really concerned all of a sudden and I was like oh nah I mean just tugging my hair, not like pulling it, because it freaked me out how worried she was. I do pull my hair pretty hard at night and I usually have a hard time falling asleep.

I never really verbalized my problems with anyone and they do sound kinda bad when I actually hear/read them. Sometimes it's not that bad sometimes it seems pretty bad. I think before I met this girl it didn't feel like I really had anyone for a really long time so I just got used to feeling lonely. But now that I actually have a friend who I am really happy around, when I'm not around them the other 90% of  the time I realize how unhappy I am.

I have parents and I know they love me and if I told them I think I needed help they would probably provide that to me, but the idea of talking to them at all about anything is sorta uncomfortable to me, and talking about emotional problems is extremely uncomfortable to me. I'm going to be getting eagle scout soon and I'm not even sure if I want to do the ceremony for it because it means my parents would be involved. ",17Dec2017,2

7 months into our relationship he left for basic training for Army infantry. He recently graduated two weeks ago. And it definitely has been the hardest two weeks of our relationship. At his graduation he seemed distant. But I played it off that he was around all his family and that he was just overwhelmed by all the sudden attention. I still was trying to reassure him along the way that I was there still caring about him. 

Before he left, things were perfect. We talked about building a life together. And all through the 3 months of his training things were pretty well too. We reassured each other always that we would stick together. Just like we planned. These past two weeks he’s had phone access and I’ve never felt farther away from him. He suddenly was very distant. We would text but the conversation would fall flat. And then I wouldn’t hear from him the rest of the day. Any time I tried to show him affection, he ignored it. I was becoming very hurt so I told him I wanted to talk on the phone sometime. He never gave me a call, so that’s when I decided to go out of my way to call him. 

Sigh. Over this call, he was telling me how he’s been thinking about what to do with our relationship. He’s going on to be ranger and knows the unexpected will happen (deployment for long periods of time, no communication). And in this short call, he mentioned that he didn’t think it’d be fair to both of us to be in a relationship at this time.

I need major help. I love him very much. And we promised each other we would work through everything long before he left and all through the time he was away.

102,"I'm very friendly. I like to talk to people. I like making friends. I try to make people feel good. So, when I see people on Reddit talking about how they are lonely or want to talk to someone, I reach out to them and talk to them...whether they're male or female, doesn't matter to me.

Also, I have a boyfriend...who I love very much and who loves me. I would never want to hurt him...that's the last thing I want. I just want to make him happy.

But I feel like I betrayed him tonight. I didn't mean to but it happened.

So, I frequent this sub called CasualConversation, where you can casually converse with anyone about almost anything. It's fun. I've met some awesome people there. I've also talked about my life a bit on that sub. I've definitely talked about my boyfriend, just casual tidbits and shit.

I was talking with the OP in this one thread about something random and unrelated...then they said ""hey, not to be a creep but I skimmed your post history and it seems like we'd be good friends. PM me if you want.""

So, I messaged them, because I like to make friends. I didn't know whether they were a guy or a girl. We talked a bit, he said that he's a guy and asked for my gender, then he asked for my kik because ""reddit pm is shitty."" On kik, I made the mistake of sending him a picture of myself when he asked. Just a picture of my face, not anything inappropriate. After that he started to get really flirty and even sexual. Instead of saying ""hey I have a boyfriend"" I just blocked him because I got scared. I'm oblivious so I didn't realize that he was going that route. I thought he just wanted to be friends.

But wait...it happened again...tonight. Some other person made a post about how they have no one to talk to and they're cynical and depressed, so I messaged them. We had a relatively normal conversation at first, just were joking around, and then they made a sexual comment. Instead of ending it right then, I continued messaging them for a bit but just kind of made a joke about the comment they made. I didn't send them any pictures. Then they said something else that was even worse so I blocked them.

Yeah...now I just feel terrible. I feel like I cheated on my boyfriend. I didn't mean to. That was never my intention. I do love him. This isn't the first time this has happened to me...it seems like every time a guy PMs me, he wants something from me.

I don't understand why people can have that much hatred for a religion and why that same hatred continues in the 21st century when America is supposed to be the most progressive country in the world... Even though I've read countless articles on why antisemitism is stupid etc I can't get it out of my head.

It's gotten to the point where I can't concentrate well on assignments (I'm a student). I think it may be because I think every human is good and has something valid to contribute to the world, and maybe that has something to do with it.

111,"How does anyone make it through this. Is there anyone who can relate and has made it through?

I have an 18mo daughter and she is the light of my life. My partner of 2+ years left me in September, moved two hours away, taken my daughter, and brought in solicitors. I have had access to my daughter denied so many times. 

It's now been 3 weeks since I last saw her, and due to many factors I won't likely see her again till late January. Around the same time I need to find a new home as the house I'm renting has sold. 

My partner was abusive and horrible in so many ways, and still is, and is going out of her way to hurt me the only way she still can, denying me my daughter. 

I'm currently fighting for her, for what's best for her, and it feels like nobody is on my side, not even my solicitor. 

I don't know how I can carry on, every night is torture alone in this house.

114,"First of all, its important to note that I am Asexual. I do not want, nor do I need a sexual relationship, especially not at the age I am now. Secondly, I think it to be of interest that I am a big boi, kinda chubby, and I am also a loner, and I am constantly bullied.

Now then, onto the problem. A week ago, I was approached by one of my few friends in school, and we began to talk. Once we were nearing the end of our conversation, she leans close to me, jabs a thumb behind her back, and says: ""X likes you. I mean, she really likes you.""

Immediately, I call this as bullshit. Anyone with working eyes would probably want to stand as far away from me as physically possible. People have done this in the past, acting like they have an interest in me, then laughing at how ""desperate"" I am when I question their sincerity. So, right away, my guard is up.

After she said this, I ask her how legitimate her statement was, and she ensures me its 100% true.

I'm not sure if she's telling the truth, or if she's been lying about being my friend the whole time. But that's not what I'm here to ask about.

My question is: how do I lightly let X down, if she is serious about liking me? I don't want to go and break somebody's heart, but at the same time, I really don't want to be obligated to start a relationship, just because someone has a most-likely non-existent crush.",17Dec2017,3

120,"First off I’d like to say that this is my first time cheating on an any assignment or test. I was having a difficult week emotionally and I fucked up. Anyways heres the abbreviated story. 
After finding the full project on github, I ended up spending a ton of time trying to change the code. But like the idiot I am, only tonight — 5 days after I submitted it — did I test it for plagiarism, and it scored a 40/100. That is high enough to be suspect, and once the code is reviewed I am sure I will be caught. The project hasnt been graded yet, but it will probably be coming back this week. 

Now heres where the shit hits the fan. I have a huge final on Monday and three more on Tuesday. But I cant focus, I cant even sleep, thinking about this. I need to get this off of my chest and just come clean to everyone I’ve let down, both my professor and my parents who are putting me through college. Tomorrow is so important for me to be focused, but here I am at 5:30AM just lying here feeling my world collapse. I’m already struggling to find a job, if I get an F for this class thats just about it for me. If I could come clean and apologize to my professor in person maybe he’d let me off with a 0 for the project, instead of failing me and reporting me to the dean. But tomorrow is Sunday, so the only option is email. And if I have to wait until Monday before I can get this off of my chest Ill be screwed, definately for the finals and perhaps even moreso if I get caught for plagiarism by then.

Seemed like a fun and chill guy, but I barely ever saw him. We had one really good conversation one night so I would have considered us friends but not close at all. 

Tonight, my boyfriend and a few of our friends are hanging out and my boyfriend tries to have small talk with this guy I mentioned before and guy says, “Lets get this straight. I don’t much like you. You and me, we’re from different worlds, and I think you know it too. I also think you’re full of yourself and hella condescending.” He added a line about how he doesn’t know why such good people fall for him, hinting at me. 

My boyfriend was taken aback, but he’s not the type of person to make a scene. He said something along the lines of “lmao ok man” and said we should all go back to having a good time and left it at that. 

But I was pretty surprised and annoyed. I was going to stand up for my boyfriend of course because he’s a fucking sweetheart and my best friend so I shot guy a “what the fuck is wrong with you look” walked over and wrapped myself around my boyfriend and ignored guy for the rest of the night. I made it obvious I was giving him the cold shoulder because of what he said. 

He told one of our mutual friend that he was “maybe wrong about me” or that my boyfriend was manipulating me or some kind of bullshit like that, but honestly I’m just loyal and I’m not going to let someone say some shit like that to someone I love and continue talking to them like things are going wonderful.

122,"- I play World of Warcraft, an online game (particularly, a private server of an older version of the game, so the player demographics are skewed). I'm female. I do not ever mention my gender (if you're a girl who's ever played computer games online, you'd know why).

- I meet a person in-game who plays off of my sense of humor. We become friends right away and talk often online.

- He starts telling me intimate details about his life (still in love with ex-gf but broke up with her due to long distance, has a current gf, feels guilty about both women; also minor drug problems and trying hard in school) because he needs someone to talk to (he also has a therapist, but doesn't see them often due to scheduling reasons). I give him relationship advice sometimes.

- He doesn't know my gender. Usually we talk about him or make dumb jokes, so I've revealed very little of my personal life. One day he thanks me for being there to talk to him, and I say/joke ""no problem, just don't get emotionally dependent on me."" He replies, ""nah I wouldn't, because you're not a girl - if you were a girl, I probably would be."" (in WoW, especially on the particular private server I play on, it's common to assume everyone is male by default. I've also adopted male mannerisms to hide my gender.) I brush it off. He's previously also brought up connecting on Facebook, and I told him (without thinking too much) I'd be okay with it someday if one of us quits the game. I regret saying this now, because I thought he would be mature enough to not care about my gender even if he found out.

I think I should continue to hide my gender from him, but I feel like that would be being dishonest now that he's made the assumption I'm a guy and I haven't corrected him. (It's also ""work"" to hide it - I constantly refer to my boyfriend in real life as my ""SO"".) I don't want to reveal my gender and change the dynamic of our friendship, but now it feels like I'm hiding something. Maybe I'm overthinking this; we both have SOs in real life, and my gender reveal wouldn't be that big of a deal after the initial surprise. Or perhaps this is an unhealthy friendship altogether, and I shouldn't be his pseudo-therapist anyway. I like that I can be there to help him when he's going through hard times, and I enjoy talking to him, but I wouldn't consider myself emotionally attached myself.

tl;dr: online friend who confides in me suggests he would probably become emotionally dependent on me if I were a girl, but he currently (by default) assumes I am male. Should I be upfront and tell him I'm female, hide my gender while continuing to talk to him, or slowly stop talking to him?

I'm sad to say that I have few friends (I lack a good portion of social skills) and out of these few most are tied up in a small friendgroup which is where we met. They have always been a very assertive person taking every opportunity to argue and often end up winning with their own case of logic. If you attempt to dispute them because you have a problem with it, they break your own words down into a vague definition that makes me look like either a hippocrat or an idiot. Other people in our group often agree with them simply to avoid conflict, or maybe because I am always wrong, a hippocrat, and an idiot. I would've left earlier but I have one friend in the group which I've known since preschool. The time I left they took this as a farewell too.

134,"My best friend can be a gigantic pain in the ass, lol. And completely and totally in love with me. 

Let me start with this, we met in college. I was 19 and by the way he acted I assumed he was the same age or a year younger. (Turns out he was 6 years my senior) We met in Computer Information Science. He describes the way he first saw me walk into class in quite detail if i ask even 7 years later.

I wanted to bullshit and make friends so i walked over to a group of new class mates (including him) and started bsing about programming and gaming as I was an avid gamer -like give up my life to be an elite- style gamer. Turns out he needed a ride home. I gave him one even tho he epically failed at closing one of my back doors in the car and nearly lost both our equipment. On his way to his house he went on to say 'just so you know i'm not easy and i'm not about that' which you'd think should've been my like considering i was just helping out a potential friend. It made me laugh and shake my head cause it was so silly because it was never what i was about -total honesty was still a virgin at the time, I know I know tmi but it's important- we spent a few days later a night of gaming in his room and i met the family on pizza night and they were testing the waters as was I them. He went on and on about how awful they were and how they never approved of any of his friends. Turns out I was the exception to the rule. 

Fast forward. There were plenty of fights including removing myself from his presence because I already had known he was in love with me. (That lasted maybe a month. Idk if it was that i felt bad or that he kept saying that was cause he admitted his love even when it wasn't.)

I was even brutal in the friendship at one point, saying even if he was the last man on earth he wouldn't be the right match for me. It was harsh but he was nagging and persistent and i was fed up. Due to is behavior it was necessary. 

He has been in love with me for years and it's an obvious true love like would give up anything and everything for me. - even without sex - never was about getting in my pants - And if we fought we'd usually end it with a unison fuck it this is stupid lets go get a beer or food.

The hardest time was when he became obsessive/stalkerish needing to know where i was. What I was doing. Who i was with. -Including a confrontation about a fb post where he had thought i'd lost my v card- He was basically insane when I was in any sort of relationship for a while. Even tried to turn to 'i'm in a relationship' himself to make me react or get jealous but I never would. (I'll be honest I'm unfamiliar to that emotion. Not sure why but hasn't really been part of my spectrum of emotions) He's gotten better over the years but still. 

He's absolutely in love with me even when i persisted -at one point- he doesn't need another person to be whole and himself and he has learned some of it. 

My goal has never been to change who he his. Maybe make him mature and seem from other perspectives but never force things upon him. I care about him, love him even but i don't think my love for him is the same he has for me. I don't think I feel the same way for him as he does me but even as many times as i've blocked and ignored him I've also unblocked and unignored him ( partially out of he'll call people i know sometimes rarely ) but not out of desperation. It's because I do worry about him and for him.

He's boneheaded sometimes - a lot of the time, when i voice what i feel or how he is making me feel  but that's not really new. I have rebuffed his feelings for years. 

He is my best friend in the world and I love him and care about him but I don't think what I feel matches his feelings. I don't know if I could ever feel that way intimately towards him -and intimate doesn't hold sway on what i feel but we all know in the long run every relationship still has a degree of at least 1% intimacy- and I know it's probably just me. (I'm a demisexual so having a strong emotional bond usually does it but i also know you can't choose the people you love or in what way you love them. -Demisexual means having a strong emotional bond with an individual before feeling intimately/sexually attracted to them; to put it vaguely-) 

I've given him a chance finally but am I just giving him false hope? I'm afraid if at the end I don't feel the same toward him we won't be the same sort of friends ever again. And he always went on about how i never gave him a chance. Well he sometimes deals in extremes worse than some i know, this is a rational fear. 

I treasure his friendship. It is priceless, even when he makes me want to tear my hair out. I don't honestly know how to handle the scenario. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?
Am I giving him false hope in granting his wish for a chance if it doesn't change anything?
Is it the wrong thing considering I've never led him on ever?
What do you do when someone close to you loves you in that way truly for years? 
What are you experiences?

145,"Hello,

I am in a long distance relationship with a good friend. We've met a bunch of times but didn't confess that we liked each other until last month online. We haven't done anything physical. 

My issue is that we both have trust issues, her ex treated her very badly and just generally had trust issues throughout her life because of bad shit.

I've had OCD, social anxiety and depression most of my life. I've had a dysfunctional family with domestic violence where my dad would verbally abuse my mum and some times hit her. I was neglected a lot especially during the worst times during my OCD years. I was spat on by my dad and called demon possessed by my mum. I went to a children's hospital for mental health to help this. But I feel like afterwards I wasn't given then support to integrate back into society. So I fell deep into depression a lot of the times. Pushed everyone away and lost all my friends. I had a girlfriend 7 years ago who was 10 years older and she cheated on me and that really destroyed me as I had no support because I pushed everyone away. I was young and naive. 

As such my self-esteem and self confidence took a beating. I feel like it's a cycle, when I get close to put I would push people away. 

As such I have issues with fully trusting people. 

Cue one month ago, my girlfriend and I were talking about her ex boyfriend and how she was questioning why she was such a saint and didn't cheat on him, because He cheated on her and misused her. I took this seriously and I got triggered and thought she wanted to cheat. I had an anxiety attack. I had no idea I had this kind of trigger and thought I was over it. It was 7 years ago. Before that I was feeling the emotional high people do when they start a relationship but since then it's been an emotional rollercoaster of me battling my thoughts and anxieties. A lot of things trigger me. 

I've been open and honest to her about it but she isn't my therapist. 

One of the biggest things I'm struggling with is the feeling itself. I feel like at times I really like her but then I start thinking negative thoughts and I become emotionally numb. I feel like this isn't normal especially at the start of a relationship. I'm terrified this feeling won't ever go away and it makes me question whether I can love or am I ready? I'm committed to battle through this and see a therapist. I told her about what I'm going through and about whether I am capable of loving and it triggered her as her ex boyfriend said the same thing at the start of their relationship and for years...he never did, or show any empathy or feelings to her (He was a psychopath). As such, I feel terrible and I'm afraid. 

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for here. Maybe some reassurance from people that have been through something similar or some advice. ",17Dec2017,2
146,"It's currently 6:13 am and it feels like I should be writing this on r/nosleep. I have no idea what to do. Almost exactly a week ago I woke up to my dresser pulled out and everything on top of it broken/smashed on the floor. My entire room looked ransacked but all my stuff including a big stack of cash was still there so I brushed it off as sleep walking (it's my last week of college, stress is insanely high, I did it when I was young). Well last night I got this weird vibe that stuff was going to break again so I moved my (replacement) bong and guitar and other fragile things away and locked my door so if I was sleep walking I wouldn't wander, but instead I was woken up by the sound of someone trying to open my door, but it was locked. I have 3 roommates, I couldn't possibly imagine any of them doing it. I'm so scared right now. I don't even know my roommates well enough to go about bringing this up to them. I feel like they're all going to dismiss me and say I'm crazy and it's just all of the stress from finals but I have never woken up out of my sleep like that to such a quiet sound. I usually sleep like a pile of bricks and I'm literally in bed crying wondering what to do. That really didn't feel right.

What am I supposed to do? How do I help her? I don't know how to approach her about this. ",17Dec2017,4

149,"Little bit of background- my husband and I have been married two and a half years. We are not quite ready at this moment to start a family, we have just talked about it. We currently live about four hours from both of our families (from the same hometown) and have plans in mid 2018 to move north, which will end up being approximately 12 hours from everyone. The move is to pursue a degree at a well-renowned college and an experience that I want my husband to have. We’re looking at a minimum of 5 years to be moved and are unsure if we will return to our hometown. One of the big qualities in our situation is that we come from a very small hometown that people don’t generally move from, so we are the first in many generations to move away from home.

We are both incredibly excited to move and experience new things, but we have also talked about the possibility of children in our foreseeable future.  I’m an only child and he is the only son, so our families are really looking forward to grandchildren. Should we feel guilty for wanting to have children and being so far from family?

I would love to hear from someone that has a similar experience. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated.

tl;dr - Moving 12 hours from home and want children, having feelings of guilt since our families will be so far away.",17Dec2017,3

But they said that it was important to them to celebrate it also with alone with them. Now I'm realy sad to hurt their feelings but on the other hand I don't really see why it is such a big deal?

In it, he has a student get into a tank of water to measure how much water is displaced, and it's always a girl. Not just that, but afterwards he has the girls change into dry clothes in his office, and while he's not present, at least two girls have said that there was a camera in there while he was changing.

156,"Realizing something is easy. Taking corrective measures is hard. I tend to overly react sometimes and my fuse is rather short. I've improved \_much\_ over the years but I never really eliminated this trait. Instead, I learned to stay silent and be more tolerant but I still have a threashold that once I'm driven beyond I instantly heat up in flames or just assume the worst about the person. The world isn't black and white. I  usually immediately regret my actions. Sometimes I take the other extreme and keep seeing the good in that other person while I constantly keep getting backstabbed. In other words, I often let my emotions lead me. How can I establish a method where I can keep myself in check and just not think with my feelings? I found out that taking time off for myself every week helps keep me off the edge.

157,"I like to know what you think about my situation.

When I was on holiday last year I tinder-matched a girl, but never met her. We kept talking over the phone, messaging and Facebook. Now I feel I've fallen in love with her, and she's with me. But the fact that we never met scares me, and it's hard to meet soon ( technically possible to fly there some day, but I don't know if I should). While I take it just as seriously as she does, she doesn't seem as daunted by the fact we never met and she thinks ""love finds a way if it's real"". She says she can't fly here because of monetary issues. 

Now when we text, it feels like she wants to know from me if we have a future. A future where we meet and probably become a real relationship. This scares me though. I feel like I want to keep everything as it is, but I can't say for sure that I will fly there, and that we'll have a relationship. 

I never did have a girlfriend, (im 23 years old) and I'm even a bit scared that I'm just fallen in love because this is the first time a girl tells me she has feeling for me. My friends were not interested to talking about it when I first mentioned her, and that I worry about her and us. My friend basically told me "" she's just a screen on your phone"", ""don't let yourself get played with"".

I'm interested in advice on any part of my situation, or if anyone has experienced something related I'd also like to know. Most pressing to me right now is to figure out if I tell her I can't do it, or that I do go for it and "" promise"" we'll meet within a few months (either I get tickets for her, or I fly there).

165,"So there are these two schools, right?

Once of them is a thirty minute walk from my house. It's close to a smoothie place, just in case I want to get one on the way home. My girlfriend and most of my friends are going there. It's a normal public school, and if the Google reviews are anything to go by, there is a lot of bullying there.

The other one is a ten minute car ride in the downtown area of my city. Since it's in a bad neighborhood and it's so far from my house, I can't walk home. There's a dress code though (I think you have to wear khakis.) However, it's not a public school. Also it's a STEM school. Now, I'm not all THAT interested in STEM, but here's the interesting part:

On it's website, it's pretty much saying you can learn at your own pace AND on top of that in the Junior and senior years apparently you can take college classes. My brother goes there and he likes it. And because of that, I could have an easier time getting admitted. My best friend's mom said that her cousins used to go to the public school and then went to the STEM school. She said that they don't want to go back to the old one.

Everything at the STEM school is done on a MacBook as well and apparently you don't have to ask to use the bathroom, so I guess that can be handy.

Now, the thing is that I want to be with my friends and my girlfriend. I want to be able to walk home from school. But I'm not sure if I should ditch this opportunity which can help me get a headstart in life.

You guys might have some experience in this. Should I go to the STEM school or go to the public school?

173,"Alright, here's a brief summary of what got me to this point. I met a girl in college's anime club in August. I eventually like the girl and tell her that. She says she likes me back. In the beginning of last month, I asked her to go on a date with me(like I used the word date, she knew it wasn't just friends this time). She tells me she has fun with me and likes my company. Which I don't doubt because she wants to be around me a lot. She took initiative when it came to setting up follow up dates. However she would never touch me. I been dating her almost two months now and I haven't touched her and she hasn't touched me. That made me feel undesired. So I ended up posting on reddit yesterday morning about this. I get two general responses back. One response was to just kiss her, which isn't something I would do, and to take the contact stuff slow. Well I tried to hug her yesterday when I picked her up for a movie. She completely shrugged me off. I went for it again when ""the moment seemed right"" and was completely shrugged off again. So I think to myself, well it looks like some of those redditors are right. She doesn't like me at all. If she liked me she wouldn't of reacted that way to me hugging her. So I tell her this, tell her that I'll still be her friend but it's obvious we're not a romantic match. I figured she'd be relieved, I was starting to wonder if she was dating just for my sake. I think she's an incredible woman but I don't think she think I'm an incredible guy.
Well she didn't take it like I thought she would. She seems pretty mad about it. She's swearing up and down that she has romantic feelings with me. She claims that the hugs were because she wasn't expecting it. She says I'm not just a friend, but it sure as hell feels that way.
I really like this girl, I think she's great. But I just don't know if I can do this anymore. I want a girl that wants me just as much as I want her. She says she wants me like that, but it doesn't feel that way. I want a girl to snuggle with me, hug me, kiss me, and have sex with. Don't think I'll get those things from this girl.",17Dec2017,1

Last night I had an awakening, an epiphany of sorts I suppose. Nursing is only something I am interested in for job security, financial gain and I have a load of experience which would work in my benefit. However, upon evaluating my likes/dislikes and what I want to do in life I just simply don't see myself as a nurse. 

I decided that maybe I will go with my initial gut to do cosmetology. I'm not the ""girly girl"" necessarily but I love art and I love to do makeup and hair on other people. I definitely don't take nearly enough time out to do it for myself but that's another conversation in Its self. If not cosmetology, tattooing.

We broke up back in March after I realized he was not the one for me. He suddenly started insulting my appearance, manners, dared to insult my career choices and, well, you get the picture. He basically said our relationship is not going the way he wanted it to go as we were closing to a year of being together, because I wasn't good enough for him.

It ended badly, the break up itself was happening for a month. He begged me for a second chance when I was breaking up with him and somehow he starting treating me even worse after that.

Overtime, there was a lot of emotional abuse, insults, manipulation, suicide threats and such blunt phylosophical statements(all him) on why I am emotionally disabled in some way, unable to compromise and stuff like that. Eventually I removed him from facebook and blocked him. He started sending me messages through viber.

Its always super bipolar. He insults me, pointing out how I am beneath him and have no room in his life, then somehow he mentions that he still loves me, then adding that I however, do not have a clue what that means. 
Today he actually messaged me with threats that no lawyer will ever save me if I dont send him back a Star Wars t-shirt that I custom made for him for his birthday. Like, he went with this super cruel discourse. 

I think since we broke up he has been sleeping around, however from what I understand he has sworn off relationships, as one of the things he wrote to me was that he doesn't need one now as his happiness no longer depends on anyone other than himself. 

What I am asking is - should I be afraid of him? What could be the explanation of this strange behaviour? I feel really scared now that I blocked him on Viber too that next time he feels like insulting me he is just gonna come over my house. And his cruel and aggresive behaviour actually made me tell him that I will send him his t-shirt back.

Is he mentally ill or is it me? I just want to move on in peace, I have been so happy in my life recently, I've been in this place where I feel like I've learned so much and that I am finally able to find someone to have a grown up relationship with... But he appears and scares me.

197,"I've posted on here a couple of times asking for help with a struggling marriage and I got some good advice, but I think I am at my wits end.

It's hard to describe this situation without a novel, but to make this as short as I can, my wife and I are both mentally ill. We had an extremely happy and healthy marriage all the way up to around August of this year or so. My wife has bipolar II disorder, chronic depression, and PTSD (childhood abuse). As for me, I'm autistic. This has caused a few struggles, especially early on in the marriage but we quickly got used to each other and learned how to cope healthily.

As for where it went wrong, Well, it's hard to say. Around August my wife started to heavily get into role play (she still is) but sometimes she took these rps too far. She admitted this to me and of course I was upset. She started behaving recklessly in person as well (drinking, smoking, etc.). To make matters a million times worse, during this time she was raped by our close friend. This in itself is the main reason I'm trying to stay strong and by her side. I don't know how she feels so I try to understand her actions more.

My wife has brought up divorce more times than I can even count. She has talked about being unhappy with me, saying she pities me and that's why she is even with me, but on the other hand has said things like she wants to work things out with us and she wants to go back to how we were. I know that may never happen, but I would give anything for it to. My wife is the type of person that needs constant attention and validation; this has also put a strain on things. She is overly flirtatious with guys and has even gone pretty far with what she will say and do with some of them. She has sent nude photos to guys twice (that I know of) and done countless sexual rps.

I do everything for this woman, I take care of her, I buy her things, I give her all of my love, she never has to worry about me ever. Meanwhile with her I'm constantly worrying about who she is talking to and what they're doing. I've snooped a few times but ive decided not to ever again as to avoid being hurt again from what I read.

My main point in this isn't to make you hate my wife. I love my wife. I would die for my wife. I would do just about anything for her. There's a reason I married her in the first place. The thing is though, I'm so constantly worried, and I fear she will always be this way. I don't know if the rape has made her feel like this, but my theory is that she mildly felt this and what happened dialed it up to 1000. 

I understand if my wife is changed forever. I can deal with that. What is getting increasingly difficult to deal with, however, is the uncertainty of things. The worry and fears. I don't think she'd leave me for another guy but it is NOT ok for her to be so overly flirty with everyone. She has sort of always been this way, but her love for me always balanced it out. I.e. guys would be super flirty with her and she would flirt back but also at the same time mention how much she loves her husband. She used to constantly post about me on Facebook, and I mean as often as at least once a day. Now, she'll tag me in the occasional thing but nothing ever love or relationship related. 

The way I put it best is the person being so flirty and hurtful towards me isn't actually my wife. She is someone else. And sometimes I see my wife come out and I see love in the way she looks at me and holding her feels like heaven etc. But 80% of the time she is distant and getting attention from guys that aren't me.

Also, I know people will suggest therapy, but I've tried convincing her and I don't think she wants to. I'm willing, but she isn't. She mentioned being up for it one time but hasn't mentioned it since then.",17Dec2017,5

So i never looked to pursue anything, still she's a cool person to have as a work friend. We've been working together for just over a year by this point and nothing has really happened to suggest anything else would happen. I guess however over the past few weeks I've maybe developed a crush (didn't think that still happened in your late 20's). We recently had a work Christmas party the other week. It was a great night at the bar that the company had rented for the event. As the night went on small groups of people left and went to a nightclub. A few of us decided to move on to somewhere else and Jane was part of that group. The night continued and everyone was having a good time, we decided to check out another club but by this time i suppose i must have been pretty far gone because i got refused at the door. I mean i didn't think i was that bad but in hindsight, yeah, probably a good call. Everyone else went in but Jane didn't and stayed with me. Since it's December it's also fucking cold, we decided we'd head back to my place since it wasn't far. Thinking back i don't think it was my idea but whatever. Anyway we get back to my place and just start talking. You know the kind of deep/personal talking drunk people get to at 4am. Anyway i go to the bathroom and come back and she's in my bed. Before i knew it we were actually doing this. Afterwards i let her know i needed to leave pretty early so she opted not to stay and i walked her to a taxi. Aaand that was that. I've been on leave from work over the holidays since so we've not spoken since. I just, i guess i made things worse for myself in my head from how i was feeling before that happened. We both work full time, we both do the same role and pretty damn near each other everyday so professionally that can't happen. Still, i don't know. On one hand, hell yeah i would, but on the other hand i also don't want to fuck things up at work or make things worse or weird or awkward. On the other-other hand though, i will probably beat myself up about it if that's just left like that and it all goes back to normal. I'm just not sure what i should be trying to do next.

So basically there's this guy at work who I grew to like, and I thought they liked me back genuinely, due to various things that happened i'd rather not bore you with. Anyway he's part of a group I have lunch with at work and the other day at work I saw him flirting with this other girl in the group which just confirms that they never liked me in the first place. 
- Someone who liked me wouldn't flirt with another girl in front of me. -
- even if they liked me now that's just a put off.

211,"I will try to make this as TLDR as possible. 

I'm 32, married and have a 9 year old child. I have been with my wife for about 13 years (4 married). We met when I was 20 and moved in together within 3 months. In the time we've been together we have gone through really bad times, and good. I feel like I was forced into my marriage a little bit. Before I proposed to her she had left me for someone else, completely out of the blue. I have always thought she did it as a way to force my hand in marriage (I never planned to.). Fast forward to now we've made a decent life with each other but I just always have kind of had that thought in the back of my head of what if I didn't give in and sent her packing when she cheated on me.


Now comes the part where I may be a piece of shit. I suffer from depression and I can go into these dark places. A little while ago I was in one of these dark places and reached out to someone I hadn't spoke to in over 12 years. To me she was the one that got away. Her and I had never dated before (teenagers with teenage problems.) But we both cared for each other greatly. We lost contact and shortly after is when I met my wife. She is someone that has always been on my mind. When her and I started talking again we hit it off so amazingly, like we had never stopped talking in the first place. She explained to me how much she cared about me when we were younger and how she, like me, always thought about me.

Now I'm sitting here today asking myself what to do. I love my wife, and I have never once cheated or strayed from our relationship. On the same hand I truly believe that I love this other woman too. I don't want to blow up my life for something that may not be anything more then nostalgia, but I also don't want to pass on something that I've wanted since I was a teenager. She knows my current situation and is very accepting of it. I just don't know what I should do. I need an outside opinion. I understand that what I'm doing can be considered a very bad thing, but I am accepting that and I do feel guilt. I just don't know.

Edit: I would like to throw in my wife has been very distant recently ( all prior to my reaching out the the other woman). No matter how much I try to talk to her or listen, she never tells me what's wrong. I kind of just have to let it be and hope she gets through it.",17Dec2017,2
212,"This is actually for a buddy of mine.

I’ve met his roommate a few times, he’s very strange and a bit awkward, but he’s also very rude. When I first met him, I said hello and asked how he was doing. He ignored me and walked passed me then stopped and said, “forewarning, I’m going to need these tables tonight to play board games.”
I thought it was rude considering I wasn’t even playing on his table it was my friend’s table but didn’t want to argue so I got up and moved my stuff.

Now the real beef we have with this guy..

My friend, his girlfriend and their roommate have 2 cats who both share a litter box. And because their roommates cat uses the litter box they all agreed they would clean the litter box on certain days, the roommates day to clean is Wednesday. Well he didn’t clean the litter box, so my friend asked him on Thursday if he was going to clean it, to which the roommate replied “I’ll get to it tomorrow.” Friday rolls around and it still hasn’t been cleaned, so my friend asks him again “Hey are you going to clean the litter box?” then his roommate called him “needy” and said he’d get around to it. My friend told him it’s starting to stink in the apartment and that he needs to do it soon. The roommate then complained and argued that “you have two people living here” (my buddy and his girlfriend, it’s a two bedroom apartment so they share a room and the roommate has his own room and this was discussed prior to moving in and they had an agreement it wouldn’t be an issue). Eventually the roommate cleaned out the damn litter box. Later that day my friend went to work and when he came back that night the front office stopped by to tell them that my friend’s girlfriend has to leave the apartment due to her name not being on the lease she she’s not allowed to live there. They were also informed that they have a cat that’s not allowed to be in the apartment either and the cat would have to go as well. Well it just so happens that their roommates cat is nowhere to be found while all this is happening and he’s claiming innocence as if he never had a cat. So now my friend’s girlfriend has to leave the apartment which is right on campus and her family lives about 4 hours away so she’s not sure where she’s going to go. Their roommate just left to go on Christmas break and visit his family, but left a note for my friend and his girlfriend before he left.

[Roommate’s Note](https://imgur.com/gallery/wjSeU) 

The note reads,

“Have a lovely break. Be sure that the illegal resident has vacated the premises by the time I return. Completely gone. Don’t make this any more difficult than it needs to be for yourselves.”

Written in the most serial killer handwriting you’ve ever seen.

Needless to say my friend is pissed and I’m pissed for him and we want revenge for his childishness. The fact that he did all this because he was too damn lazy to clean the litter box on his day to clean the litter box is frustrating as hell. Also being hypocritical by ratting out my friend for having a cat when he has a cat himself that he doesn’t take care of and kicks around when it gets in the way pisses me off. And rather than use her name in the letter because they’ve been living together for several months, he calls her “the illegal resident”. Really my friend doesn’t know what to do. This is his 2nd time moving to a new apartment and he doesn’t want to move again but we don’t know how you could live that person after all that shit.

Any advice on what to do moving forward or any subtle revenge tips would be great.

TLDR: Friend’s jackass roommate got friend’s girlfriend kicked out of the apartment. Proceeded to leave note demanding she be gone by the time he returns from break.",17Dec2017,8

214,"Background info:
 I am a pretty sensitive person, I have only been in 2 fights in my life and I was outnumbered in both. One being 5 v 1 and the other was around 10 v 2, in the first fight it was mistaken identity and I just covered my head and took the beating. The second fight was a group of guys who started beating on my friend so I jumped in and tried to help him. 

2 nights ago:
My cousin and I were waiting for our tram when a drunk guy shoved me while I was buying a ticket, we left it because his female friend said he was drunk and was pleading with us not to worry about it. Moments later he starts walking towards my cousin with a real sinister look on his face so I reacted out of impulse when he got too close and I pushed him. Immediately after, 3 of his friends come around the corner and start trying to engage the fight, the biggest one tried to coax us into going for a walk with him, calling us his brothers and saying he wanted to talk in an attempt to make us think that he didn’t want any trouble when in reality he wanted us to go to where there were no cameras so he could deal with us. At this point my legs are complete jelly but I recognised what he was doing straight away and just kept saying that we were all good and weren’t going for the walk. After a minute or two he gave up and we went on our way but for the next 45 minutes I was beyond anxious that they were following us or that something bad was going to happen. 

Tonight: 
(We live a short walk away from the city; clubs, pubs, shops, fast food.)  3am and i’m hungry so my cousin and I decide to go for a walk into the city to get some food. I had fears that something was going to happen even though it was unlikely. On the way there a man about 30 metres behind us yelled out at my cousin “Is that my shirt?”, we responded with no but he kept repeating himself in what seemed like an effort to start us. We started power walking to get away, once around a corner I felt the urge to run and not stop running until we were back home. I ended up not getting food as I was afraid somebody else would try and confront us. The entire walk home I was afraid that he was either following us, we were going to run into him again or that somebody else was going to confront us. I even contemplated getting us a cab home. 

I have always been taught that a man should stick up for himself and not be afraid in those sorts of situations but I can’t help but be deathly afraid every time. Tonight’s incident has made me feel like less of a man and that I am weak. Please any advice at all will help. I’m sorry that this post is so long but I am just so lost, I feel worthless.

219,"They’re driving me crazy. I suffer from a disability, which has me mostly bedridden, and at home almost all of the time. Even with my windows closed, the chimes drive me bonkers. Now that the windy season has arrived, the chimes are chiming almost perpetually.

I use a white noise machine, when I sleep — but when I’m awake, both the chimes and the white noise machine make it hard for me to concentrate or relax, even inside, with the windows closed (trying to enjoy fresh air, with the windows open — or by going outside, in the yard — is even worse). Unfortunately, I can’t stand wearing ear plugs.

I am conflict-avoidant and introverted, by nature. Therefore, instead of knocking on their door, I’ve been leaving anonymous, friendly notes, under their doormat. The first explained that the chimes are driving me crazy, and humbly asked them whether they’d please consider removing them. Unfortunately, the chimes remained. A few days later, I left another friendly note, humbly asking them to please consider a compromise: moving the chimes to the other side of their property. Once again, the chimes remained.

Context: I moved into this house, to live with my adult family (due to my disability), about six months ago. I don’t recall hearing the chimes, when I moved in. I recall starting to hear them only a few weeks ago. I don’t know whether they just installed the chimes, or whether I just didn’t notice them, since the wind didn’t pick up until the last few weeks. I have not discussed this with my family, and would rather not discuss it with my family, because I don’t want to create any drama.

I live in an extremely small town, and don’t wish to make any enemies. My family would be upset with me, if I did. My county does have a noise ordinance, but I don’t know whether these chimes violate it (I’d have to measure the decibel output per hour, in order to know) — and even if they did, I have no desire to call the sheriff, or threaten to sue the neighbors, because I’m trying to keep the peace.

Note that I live in a rural, upper-middle-class, retirement/vacation-home community, a couple of blocks from the central California coast. I’ve seen the neighbors with the wind chimes, in person, only once, that I can recall — and I’ve never spoken to them. All I remember is a woman who looked to be in her fifties or sixties, speaking with family members, outside her house. They have a Toyota, in their garage; Christmas lights on the front of their house; and a well-maintained front yard. Their home does not appear to be a vacation home. Based on their lights turning on and off regularly, they appear to live there full-time. Their house is next door to the house that is directly across the street from mine. 

I’m not willing to do anything illegal (e.g., removing the chimes, in the middle of the night), I’m not interested in speaking to them in person (as I said, I’m conflict-avoidant, introverted, and trying to avoid drama), and I’m not willing to do anything litigious.

Installing insulation or multiple-paned windows is not a realistic/affordable solution — and besides, it wouldn’t help when the windows are open, or I want to enjoy my yard.

I realize that my options are limited, due to all of the above limitations, which is why I’m turning to you all, to help me think outside the box. 

The best solution I can think of, at this point, is to keep leaving anonymous, friendly notes, on their doorstep, each with a slightly different angle. In the next note, for example, I’m thinking of mentioning that I suffer from a disability, which has me home all day, and that the white noise machine helps when I sleep, but not when I’m awake — and begging them to move the chimes to the other side of their house, out of the goodness of their heart. Other than appealing to their natural, human empathy, I’m afraid I can’t think of anything else.

I would very much appreciate your well-meaning, earnest suggestions. If you could please refrain from comments like, “it’s a free country; get over it”, “stop being so sensitive,” “man up and knock on their door,” or “suck it up and wear ear plugs,” I’d appreciate that, as well.",17Dec2017,2

I don’t want to go into too much detail about her but I’ll just let you all know she is the outgoing, flirty type and sometimes she does some weird shit that would not fly if I wasn’t attracted to her. And I mean WEIRD shit (If anyone wants to know specifics for further context I’ll explain if you ask).

But anyways, the reason I’m asking here rather than r/dating_advice or some other thread is because I just need advice in keeping a good friendship with her. She has a boyfriend who lives an hour away and I have no intention of being that guy who tries to ruin another relationship. I just want to her friend at the moment and believe people can be mature enough to do that. 

We left on a shaky note though. So on the last day before our break her and I were working and she asked me to hangout at her place to make cookies or something like that. We only hung at once before on campus where we had lunch and she’s always has a playful, joking nature so I didn’t take her seriously and I played along with unenthusiastic remarks. Eventually she asked me where I lived and we found out we live quite close she said we should either go to her’s or my house to make the cookies. I was taken back by this and again I reluctantly agreed to hangout before she jokingly says “I get it you don’t want to make cookies with me and you secretly hate me” to which I replied “You know that’s not true” . This joke has been ongoing where she thinks I don’t like her because I’m quiet and don’t want to come off as a clingy, desperate person. She then left saying “Guess I’ll see you tomorrow because you don’t want to make cookies” I felt like an asshole because she obviously wanted to hangout. So I text her later saying how I felt shitty and that if she was serious I’d love to make cookies. We rarely text unless it’s work related so she was surprised by this. She sent laughing emojis, told me not to worry about it, and that she’d let me know but that she was hanging out with a girl friend of her’s. The next day I worked, she wasn’t, but she was on campus and didn’t come say good buy to me before our break officially started. I think she thought I was much more upset than I actually portrayed myself to be through the text and she wanted to avoid any awkward shit with me. (Mind you this is a girl who runs up and gives me amazing hugs when she sees me, so this isn’t like her)

I would play it off and pretend like nothing happened but I feel that she would think I’m still upset with her or that I “hate” her like she claims I do. I also was considering seriously talking to her about it but I feel like it really isn’t a big deal to her as I might make it seem. So what should I say that will be expressed in a playful, joking manner to show I’m not really upset or too serious but that will also show her I care about her and that I value our friendship?",17Dec2017,1

226,"Howdy. So I moved to a new major city around seven months ago. I spent the first few months looking for work, finally found a temporary job in October, and now that that’s coming to an end, I found a new, permanent position in an office I think I’m really going to like. 

I am incredibly happy about this new position and the people seem wonderful. I ultimately want to do a really great job for my bosses and I want my coworkers to know they can depend on me. I also want to make strong. lasting connections with everyone, and I want to simply enjoy going into work every morning. Is this asking for too much?

Anyways, my problem is that I’m nervous about this new position. The office has an open floor plan so everyone essentially works next to everyone.

227,"So, a couple of months ago my fiancé broke up with me and I went into a depressive episode and lost about 13 pounds in two weeks. 
At the moment I’m sitting around 122 pounds. 
I’ve started working out consistently and eating relatively well (I think? I eat a lot of vegetables and don’t go out to eat often. I eat lean meats usually. Not a lot of fish though) 
However, I’m still stuck at 122 pounds which is underweight for me. 
I can see some muscle growth, particularly in my abs and arms. But id like to gain some weight so that I can improve my muscle growth and also stop looking like a twig. 

Any advice?

Edit: one last random question. When I do squats when I try to get lower I feel something (Tendon? Vein?) in the back of my knee get pinched then snap to the side of my knee. 
It isn’t quite painful, but it feels like it could be painful if I keep doing it. 
Anyone know how I can correct it. ",17Dec2017,3

231,"So- my boyfriend, now 21, has recently come out as bi-sexual and has just told me something he's never told anyone, ever. He and his younger brother used to commit incest around the age of 8/9. I didn't press for details so don't much of the dynamic. But, he burst into tears as he explained at some point it went from touching each-other to him attempting anal penetration to the younger brother. He then broke down saying he has always carried around this guilt that he raped his younger brother. - now the lines are unclear here as I didn't ask the exact nature of the relationship- whether my boyfriend felt he was a rapist because it was un-consensual or whether he felt that way because of the one year age difference and abuse of power. I also didn't ask how long this continued or whether it was a single event as obviously this was a very hard thing for him even to admit to this level as usually he struggles talking about emotional topics- no doubt as a result of this and his difficult upbringing.

Himself and his brother were both born out of incest (mother and father are cousins- another fact he has told noone). I don't know if this effects anything or statistically makes this more common but thought it was worth a mention.  

Now I'm sure this makes the family seem very strange and odd, they did have a difficult upbringing with multiple divorces and since the age of 12 no contact with his father. However, the families mother is incredibly loving and dedicated to her children's health and wellbeing and the entire family get on brilliantly, aside from the younger brother who is very much an outcast, and to an extent my boyfriend has given him a hard time, associating his guilt and negative feelings towards him - which - I've always noticed, and commented and asked for it to stop, even before knowing this history of incest. 

My boyfriend is however, one of the kindest and most sincere people you could meet. A large reason I got into a relationship with him is how kind and understanding he was when I lost my virginity to him- any other male sexual interaction had somehow not been completely consensual and I always felt obliged to do things not understanding how to say no. But, without me even having to say no my boyfriend is always able to detect my unease, and never cruel or petty about having to stop- which from my sexual history I have found rare in men to do. Despite his now considerate and caring understanding of consent and emotions, it has always been clear to me he had some self-hatred within him, he doesnt allow himself good jobs, ambitions, hope or real freindships, and although he's now explained the cause of this I want to know how best to help him, and of course his brother and their relationship without scaring them both off to repress it. 

I know as a society getting men to talk about anything on an emotional level and to open up is difficult from what society holds against them- and I don't want to push the help in anyway that either will feel overwhelmed and do something stupid. 

So my question is how do I help? See a therapist with my boyfriend? Tell him to write a letter to his brother apologising, I know he wants to. Make him write an open letter and burn it? talk about it more? Or repress it back down? I really don't know whats best for everyone involved and how common this issue is. So please if you know any helplines or anything I could do let me know",17Dec2017,1
232,"Here's my situation:
I will be moving to Japan for work in the new year. I've lived in the same small town for close to 11 years and am at my breaking point. I'm terribly unhappy and the work I can find either pays really low and/or is just really stressful (I am qualified to work in education). 
I would prefer to move in March when it's hiring season but between now and then, I need to make some income (or I could just sell some of my stuff and would probably make the same amount of money).  That's only a little less than two months of work.
OR I can leave in May/June and pick up a  current job opening that would pay somewhat decently (although it's not guaranteed, I have worked at this school before and feel maybe I would have an in).  Only thing is, it would be a bit stressful (the position is working with more troublesome students) and I would be prolonging my stay in this town. 

Both sides have their pros and cons. Of course saving up more money seems like the obvious choice but I know I would simply be working, not going out and I would be miserable.  The idea of leaving in March is so attractive because it's so much closer.  I think one of my main issues is that typically once I've made a decision (I've already applied to a ton of jobs with the expectation that I would be available starting March), it's hard to convince myself to change course.",17Dec2017,1

236,"So, this is going to be a long thread as I been keeping this in for a long time and I just need some guidance, as I'm beginning to doubt my ability to reason. Thanks in advance for reading.

I lived in Germany since I was 13. When I turned 16, I came out to my family and their reaction was really bad, to the point where they told me I was going to rot in the pits of hell, that along with bullying and other things I had bottled in, made me go into a deep depression where I had to be internalized on a mental hospital for about two weeks.

While I was there, my family only visited me once and it was to tell me I was an ungrateful brat and even told the doctors I was doing it to manipulate them, that to me was a blow on the gut and something in me snapped, I decided to show them that I can be great without them, or some shit, can't exactly remember right now. 

When I got out, I was sent to the country where I was born, I knew it was a trick but for some reason I went with it. They wouldn't let me go back to Germany, where I had my friends who cared for me, who accepted me. Some people actually cared for me, for the first time in my life and they took it from me.

Here, I met a guy and we became best-friends. Like 7 months into the friendship, we had a strong argument because he said that I didn't pay attention to him and that when he came to visit me, I played video games. In this, he had a point but at the time I didn't see it like that. To get my attention, or I don't know why, he started to taunt me until the point where I snapped. In the time we didn't talk, he told another guy, he met like 3 weeks before telling him, something that I held deeply in and valued.

Time passed, we started talking again. When he came to my home, I paid more attention to him and didn't play as much and we actually hanged out. Months after, I had a depression crisis, it's hard for me to talk about my feelings, so it took me a while to reach to him while I was basically dying inside, we were out that day and I had to leave early while he stayed hanging with some friends. I told him, before leaving, that if he could go home early, because I really needed to talk to him and he said yes, I asked him again and he said yes. That day, I waited and waited, he never showed up.

The next day, he brought his boyfriend to school and asked me to meet him, I was pissed because of what happened the day before and because we had a project and he was leaving all the work to me. I said no. He said ok and left, next time he came he asked me again and I told him that he was leaving me to do all the work, and that I really needed to talk to him, that I was falling apart. He flipped me off and left, didn't talk to me for months, just because I didn't want to meet his new boyfriend, which didn't even last a month, like I estimated.

We started talking again after sometime and somewhere after that we had an argument and he used my depression against me, something among the lines: ""Are you tired of insulting yourself in the mirror that you come here?"" Which was the last straw and caused me to end things permanently.

After that my S/O stopped talking to me, since they were friends first or I don't know why, and weeks after, what do you know? They're together, which was a fucking blow to my gut, once again.

Now, I know I should have done it way before but my stupid self, couldn't. I explained what happened to my friends and they we're like, he is such an ass and whatever, yet now they're always hanging out. Now, I'm not trying to say they shouldn't talk to him, since we don't talk to each other but I still feel uneasy about it, if they support me, why do they hang out like it's nothing? Also, we have a Whatsapp group, and they added him yesterday which really pissed me off, although I said nothing yet. It's like they wiped their ass with how I feel, lol.

Now the question is, I'm I being unreasonable? I feel like I'm not, so perhaps grabbing advice from other people can help. What, and I'll never say this out loud, hurt me the most is that they showed me how easy to replace I am, I mean I'm an introvert to the core while he is one of those people's person.

**tl;dr**
Friend broke my trust, abandoned me on my darkest moment than uses my depression against me. Friends say the support me, yet it seems like they support him. We have a group together, that was only meant for us 5 as family and they added him. I feel cheated on, for some reason and wanted some advice.",17Dec2017,1

My questions are how would I go about starting this, what, if any, legal issues arise from this decision, and what else should I consider before doing this.

241,"Hello all,
I have been married for almost 10 years and I am a father of 4. In the last few years I have struggled, but been honest, about the fact that my wife doesn't show any desire or want for me in any way. 

I have asked every question I can think of that may help me make changes personally to fix the problem, only to hear that it is her not me. She said she has zero sex drive and little feeling other than pain after having our last child. 

She is willing (sometimes) to 'let me' have sex with her, but that's not what I want from life. I don't want to 'use' her... I want to feel wanted. Before it comes up I want to assure you she is not cheating on me. She is genuine and she does love me and I love her. 

I am happy with my life in most every aspect but this one. I have a decent job making decent money, we are buying a house, have decent vehicles and the lights are always on. I just can't find happiness in everything else because I feel unwanted. I have talked with very close friends and the only response I usually get is ""you're in a really rough situation man"" or similar responses. 

I really don't know what to do. I have offered to take her to see her OB/GYN about the pain, but the desire still will not be there. I feel like I am a complete asshole because I have so much but I am focusing on this. 

I have a hard time holding her in bed these days because should I myself be aroused and she 'allows' me to have sex, it's not worth it, it feels like I am using her. 

I understand counseling is an option, but how does that create a physical desire by discussing it with a third party? Maybe I am missing something...

Now, here's the twist... Over dinner the other day, my wife and I were talking about Christmas, and she tells me her parents have bought her a watch, and by the sounds of it a more expensive and probably all-round higher quality watch. 

Now, perhaps I should've checked with her parents beforehand to see what they were buying her for Christmas, but now I'm stuck - do I return the watch I'd thought about and bought for my wife, or do I stick with it knowing she will then open two watches on Christmas Day, and wondering if mine will look like the inferior of the two?

I'm married to his younger brother Joe(41) and Sophia is a person I respect and love very much. 
Anyhow today I was over for coffee, and they are arguing like an old married couple(they have been for months) He is a neat freak and cleans the house every day.  He won't stop jammering about the fact that she has had company and that the floor is not perfectly clean. I keep my mouth shut. 

Then he starts in on her about a guest she has invited to their christmas party. At which point Sophia tells him; It's my house, I decide. This goes on and on. Finaly I say ""it's Sophias house, it may not be my business, but I completely agree with her""
Bob then flips out and screams at me:""You are making me angry! I've had it up to here with you! I'm so mad right now!""

I have 3 kids, they grew out of these kind of outbursts at age 5, so I don't know how the hell to respond to that. The man is over 50! And a Fire Chief. Wtf?

After he screamed at me, Sophia slams her  fist on the table and rips into him(they both go apeshit) 

I get up to leave and they both go back to ""normal"" for a moment. I'm pretty sure they continue after I leave. 

Now the fun starts; my sister in-law Lisa(50) calls to tell me what a horrible person I am for agreeing with their mother about the guest. And every other thing in the world that make me the anti-christ. 

Bob and Lisa are spoiled assholes who treat their younger brother like shit(long story) and also their own mother. 

I made a promise to myself 15 years ago I would keep the peace as long as my mother in-law was still alive. Out of respect for her, I have kept my mouth shut too many times. 

I don't care that they don't like me, I don't care that they don't know their own nieces and nephews(I used to) I don't care about anyhing they say or do. 

Do I countinue to keep the peace or can I officially tell them I do not want to anything to do with them? I don't want to hurt Sophia, but the woman is a rock, she could live to be 110 years old. (And I'll snap if I have another 15 years of this)

I have a good friend who lives in the same apartments and when she first moved in he began to go over to her apartment to smoke weed. I was fine with this because they kept it on the low and none of my other family members seemed to care either.

I never really liked Adan from the get go and looking back now I should've never have let this progress as much as it has, anyways Adan began to go over to my moms constantly, I mean like practically every waking moment he could, and this is because he could smoke weed there very easily. Adan began to break stuff in my moms apartment, steal her money, steal her weed, and so on. Sometimes if she wouldn't answer (which she usually would answer the door for them because she has a hard time saying no.) he would climb in through the window. Adan began to bring his friends who I've never met over as well. One particular instance Adan brought a good friend of his (who I'll call Perry) over so that Perry could take my mom on a walk around the apartment complex in her wheelchair so that Adan could have sex in my moms bed with yet another person I've never met. At one point he even had a key to the place so he could go there when my mom was visiting with family on the weekends. There's plenty of other details that is too much to get into on here but I'll start explaining the main incident that led to where I'm at now. Just the other day I went to my moms to have a good time with friends that I personally know and invited over, Bryan even told Adan not to come over on Snapchat and Adan agreed. It was me, Bryan, my mom, and two other friends of mine when we get a knock on the door, I look through the peep hole and of course it was Adan and Perry. I open the door to see yet another person who was around 60 years old along with Adan and Perry. I told them to fuck off and asked why they're bringing over crackheads now, Perry pushed me and told me that it was his dad and they all felt very entitled into coming in at this point. That's when Bryan rushed passed me and confronted Adan to leave and they began to square up and were about to fight but thankfully they left. Bryan and I went back inside and locked the place up. About 30 minutes later we hear kicking at the door and so I look through the peephole only to see Adan and Perry with about five other people all attacking the door. The door actually broke and my mom had maintenance fix it which is going to cost her a lot. Anyways, this goes on for a while until they began to throw rocks at the window and that's when I decided to call the police. I think they saw me on the phone because that's when they all left for good that night, the officer told me to call again if they came back to which I agreed. Me and my friends slept over and the next day I told my mom to call the cops if they came back to which she agrees. My friends go home and eventually I go back to my dads as well. Later that day however, Bryan tells me that he went to check on my mom only to see Adan and Perry at my moms once again because my mom opened the door for them. They blocked me and Bryan on everything. Now I'm here writing this and what I'm thinking is this, Adan is a dropout and spends most of his time at my moms so I was going to get Adan's mom's Phone number and text my mom's address to her and tell her to cover the peephole when she knocks so that Adan opens the door up to his enraged mother. (His mom will be furious at this and will bitch out my mom but she wont go to the cops.) Perry however goes to my school and sometimes even takes my bus. I was already thinking about going to an alternative school where my best friend goes to make up my missing credits. So I was considering just punching him in the back of his head and having an all out fight at school, this way he'll get kicked off the basketball team and suspended and I'll go to the alternative school and wont have to deal with them for a while. I just cant let them get off the hook so easily for taking advantage and disrespecting me and my mom and I feel so stupid that I didn't do anything a long time ago to prevent this. At this point I don't want to go down without a fight and this will get them both equally as bad. Sorry If I jump around too much while writing this and Its hard to read and understand (this is my first time posting to reddit). Tell me what you would do if you were me and please don't say to just tell the office or anything like that, I'm telling his mom because this will prevent him from going over there so much and normally I wouldn't snitch. Just let me know what you would do and any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",17Dec2017,1

She knew I was planning on getting a uhaul to get all my stuff out of the house so I could put it in storage untill I got the keys to my new place. She filed a protection order making crazy claims that i had threatened to kill her and beat my children in front of her, and that i had stalked my ex wife for the past 2 years (my wife and I had only been split up for a year). I currently have a court date at the end of the month. 
What should I do? I want nothing to do with her, other than getting my belongings from the house, I have no intention of ever having anything to do with her again. I am at risk of facing charges on these ridiculous claims? I have spoken to my ex-wife and she is going to come to the court date.

271,"So my friend and I have gone to Graduate together for a little over a year and I didn’t intend to develop feelings for her but it happened.  I told myself not to, and thought that I could work with her and be her friend, but needless to say I’ve had a number of bombshells dropped on me over the past couple weeks.

But our ‘relationship’ if you can call it that for the past year was mostly school going out to lunch a lot, having coffee at her place, but nothing more than that.  But near the end of the semester she started to want to go out to dinner with me more often and at one point said she wanted to spend more time together.  This was the time that I started to develop stronger feelings for her.  

Tell me whether or not I missed anything (there were red flags which made me reticent to act but we’ll get to those later).

The last time we went ‘out’ (we’ve never said one way or their other what we do is a date, this trend just started) she said she wanted to take me as a thank you for something I did.  We went to dinner and then 5 minutes into dinner she asked me if I wanted to get drinks after, even though we had already had a bottle of wine and a cocktail between the two of us.  Then after making me take a picture with her, told me I should date more.  We then went out to a bar where she insisted that we site together on the couches.  I kept asking her if she wanted to leave as the time moved towards 2 am but she wanted to stay.  At one point she kicked me in the leg and said she was happy I came with her.  We were drunk so I thought better of it.  Then we didn’t see each other for two months and it was really awkward when we met up again.  This past semester I’ve been so busy that we never really did much together aside from professional things....I never pushed anything with her because she seemed to be focused elsewhere, and when you see someone professionally 20 hrs a week, why would she want to spend more time outside of school/!

The over the course of the last month she kept bringing up how I should do the final thesis at the same place she was.  So we both went to sit on the interview panel just to voice our interest in the opportunity and see what the college could offer.  But what I didn’t realize was that she wanted to work one on one.  When the head interviewer asked if we “came as a package” or could we both do different topics,  my friend sprouted out ‘yes were working together’.  Not wanting to contradict her I let it slide but now I’m having second thoughts.

This past Friday I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner to celebrate the end of the semester.  She said yes of course ( I was surprised).  So I ended up taking her to one of my favourite restaurants, it was dead the, food was great and not much else.  

The entire night on the way up and several times during dinner she was texting people (which she made a point of never doing when we went out before), I thought it really rude.  Then at one point when we were talking about stuff she just randomly added that she likes to have threesomes with this one couple (I don’t know how to react to that)...and then talked about one of her tinder dates and the fact that she’d want to bring the other person here for a weekend (which is okay, but why tell me?, even as a friend I wouldn’t mention this to someone).  I for the most part knew she was polyamorous, but we never talked about her sex-life before...I took it as off limits, and I kept my relationships with other people from her ( I consider my private life private, at lease when I’m not serious with anyone). 

I feel wrong because I want more than this friendship is providing now, and it feels wrong to continue just to save face.  There’s a lot more than this which has happened between us I’m just trying to get a grip on things.

I’m seriously considering just telling her I don’t want to do the project with her anymore...but I don’t know if I’m being immature.  I will give her this, she’s made me more open minded, and take a lot of chances I never would’ve in the past.  I do thank her for that.

TL;DR:  I’m trying to make a decision as to a number of things, given recent events.  Why would she act like this anyways, when I thought we were at least good friends.    Should I continue to be friends with this woman?  Should I work with her on this thesis given that she’s shown a lot of interest in partnering with me?  Should I even tell her I have feelings for her so I can move on?  I just need help, I wish I didn’t have feelings for her and would rather feel empty, than wanting to spend time with her.",17Dec2017,1
272,"I need advice on how to resolve this as it's been going on for a while now and I'm sick of it. 

A couple of months ago,  i (33 f) mentioned in passing to my boyfriend (35 m) that I really liked the iPhone x and was planning to get it as my next phone. 

My boyfriend told me that he would buy it for my birthday, sim free. 

Well, my birthday was in November and I saw him about 4 days before it. He was using an iPhone x. I assumed he'd got one for himself as well and thought no more of it (we didn't have much time together). 

Fast forward to my birthday and he stands me up at the last minute. He embarrassed me in front of family and I ended up alone all evening.  We have a god-awful row by phone and split up for a couple of days after. My family hate him and want me to end our relationship. 

During the row it came out that it is actually ""my iphone' which he has been using all this time, but for some reason has chosen not to give it to me and instead use it for himself. He later says he will give it to me at christmas when he has unlocked it. 

This is kind of beside the point but I'm going away for Christmas and won't see him for a few weeks. He's just told me he has bought another (older) iPhone for himself and will give me ""my"" iPhone in a few days. 

I've told him several times now that I don't want the phone anymore. Not only does it have all his stuff on there, but he also doesn't take care of his phones and I am certain it's already covered in scratches etc. I am in a very stressful and intensive job and do not have the time to mess around with wiping phone,  transferring photos, apps etc from apple to android. I also cannot get my head around the concept of buying a present for someone then using it for a few months before giving it to them second hand.

I've been really clear I don't want the phone and he should keep it. But he is being stubborn about this and insisting he will give it to me as soon as he gets it unlocked. 

Short of breaking up with him for good, does anyone have any advice on making him understand I don't want this? Also can you give any insight as to why he would behave this way? (He's Indian and working class if that helps).

We were on rly good terms before I came to visit.

So far he has paid for my hotel, driven me places, picked me up from the airport, bought me food and first day texted me a lot. Second day he was dismissive, rude, took away my alcohol, not-talkative, tried to talk to him in the night when we were in the same room- he was rude, hurt my feelings and ignored me completely.

We planned on going to do sport tomorrow and the day after, the plans are still on but I can't get over the tension and the heartache. I thought I was over him but it kills me.

276,"This is a long one but I feel like I need to explain the entire situation here. I am currently 19 and have been trying to get my drivers license/Permit for 3 years now but needed SSN card and other documents but my mom never got around to doing it despite me asking. Later, I found out that she lost my SSN card and that's why she wouldnt take me to get my license. After finding this out, she took me to get another card but it turns out you need an ID to get one and that's where I run into another problem; I have no ID. I was moved to cyber school at around 6th grade and was never issued an ID and never got a state ID either. I was told that a doctors/hospital record would also work but I also havent went to the doctor in over 5 years due to reasons I will not mention so I was dropped as a client/patient or whatever.

So my situation is this, I am trying to get a job, but I need an ID to get one. To get an ID, I need a SSN card. To get a SSN card, I need an ID/Doctor Records but I havent seen my doctor in a long time and was dropped as a client so don't have access to records. What do I do now?

I am not that well informed on this so forgive my ignorance or if I missed explaining anything.

**TL;DR** Trying to get job, need SSN card and ID. Dont have SSN card or ID. Having issues getting SSN card and ID.

282,"So before I go into the meat and potatoes of what I need help with I feel like it’s important to mention that recently my dad’s brother (my uncle) passed away this past week and it hit my family pretty hard and made my dad want my brother and I to work on our relationship since we don’t really talk to each other despite living together. 
When we were younger we had a pretty good relationship up until I was about 13 when I turned into a typical shit head teenager who didn’t care about anything. Our age gap is pretty small, im 18 and he’s 14 so the things that we are into are fairly similar. Hockey, video games, the typical things that most boys are into.
But the problem with our relationship is, well, it pretty much doesn’t really exist. We don’t really talk to each other unless one of us needs something or if one of our parents texted something to tell the other sibling. And through most of my teens I didn’t really care about our lack of communication but now that i’m older I want to work on creating a better connection.
But, things feel awkward on my part. I’m not sure if I should just walk into his room and say “what’s up” or if I should slowly ease into it. He spends most his time either playing video games with his friends or watching YouTube on his iPad. So, what can I do to bring back our relationship that we once had when we were younger.

A lot of the friendships and relationships I've had have ended because of this pure fear that they either hate me or soon will.

And so you can imagine texts like ""Well it's because I hate you duh"" or ""I mean I don't really want to hang out but I guess"" can really set off some red alerts.

Now from context clues (I won't share the whole texts) it's clear she's joking, but the irrational part of me still freaks out and honestly it makes me feel like complete shit. I ask her if we're good almost weekly and she always says yeah but each time I receive a jokey text like that it just makes me feel even worse.

297,"I was out drinking with some friends last weekend, and in my drunken state, I did something stupid and accidentally spilled half a pint of beer on our table. The puddle of beer spread and came into contact with a friend of a friend's phone. They reacted angrily, attempting to hurriedly dry it off and suggested that I pay for their tab. My friend was away from the table at the time, so they weren't there to be a moderator between this (essential) stranger and I. I wasn't really sure what to do in the situation other than apologize for the accident, as it had essentially happened because I was drunk and careless. No dispute there from me.

Fast forward to today, and they message me to tell me that their phone stopped working and that they had to replace it and it cost them over $300 to do so (over $200 for the phone and over $100 for an activation fees and taxes) and they want me to cover the costs.

In my head, I've sort of been treating the whole situation like I would an auto accident: there's an incident in which one party is at fault for financial damages, the other party gets a repair quote either from their insurance company or a mechanic, then they pass this financial estimation back to the liable party and they pay the repair bill.

So with that process in mind, I ask them if they got a work order or something from a repair shop that says the phone was unable to be fixed. In response they say:

&gt; My friend said my phone was useless to fix. The cheapest thing to do was to add another line. I have a month to pay it off so I won't get a receipt unless its paid...My friend who works for Verizon [not sure if this is the same friend who said it was useless to fix] hooked me up there and this was the only way to do it.

Ultimately, I'm wondering how to approach the situation. I don't know this person and it's not that I don't trust them, but I have no basis to substantiate what it is they're telling me. I don't know what kind of phone they had, or what kind of phone they bought to replace it. And all of the technical information they've been given has seemingly been from friends. So I've got a few questions.

1) Am I correct in my ""auto repair claim"" analogy mindset? Believing that an impartial 3rd party should be responsible for determining the financial cost of this repair/replacement?

2) If I *am* correct in my analogy, should I require some hard proof of repair/replacement evidence other than hearsay from an impartial 3rd party, their friends) before I send them any money?

3) The carrier I have doesn't have any activation fees, so I'm not really sure how that process works with them. But a quick Google seemingly shows that no US phone carrier has a $100 activation fee

4) Is there anything else I should be considering or thinking about in this whole process?",17Dec2017,1

I have some family out there so I won't be completely alone and I see myself having a career in Non-profit.

I guess my big question is ""would moving to a city with no friends and basically no family be an adventure worth having?""

He treated me like shit growing up but he had no problem charming and manipulating my parents into thinking he was a great son and brother. That's probably why my mom wants me to ""get over it"" essentially, she wants to go back to that perfect image. And I'm scared that when she talks to him, he's going to use those skills of manipulation to convince her that he didn't do anything bad. And she'll let him because she wants to believe that. Should I be there when she confronts him? I'm so scared of confronting him which is why I'm letting her talk to him first, he's never lashed out violently towards her but he has towards me. But I fear he'll change her mind and I'll be alone in this fight. How should I go about doing This? I'm so nervous. Any advice is appreciated. ",17Dec2017,8

305,"So finals grades came in, and I only have two more homework assignments to submit online (weird situation, bear with me). Anyway, I did the math and even if I did my homework perfectly, I would still end up failing that class. I can’t talk to my professor anymore, since I am no longer in state. Should I even bother with the homework at this point?",17Dec2017,1
