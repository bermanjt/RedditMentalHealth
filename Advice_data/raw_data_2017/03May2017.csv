5,"Its kind of a long story, I'll keep it concise as possible

I'm XC captain at my school. There are 2 guys captains, 4 girls captains (girl captain D being in a relationship, so out of the question for prom asking), so for prom purposes, theres girl A B and C. I'm gay, and A) dont have any dudes to ask and B) dont want to ask a guy anyways because its kinda weird at school dances (based on past experience).

I had it set that i would ask girl captain A, and my straight male best friend (who is kinda shy around girls, but weve been friends like 17 years and we wanted to ask together) was gonna ask girl captain B, and it would be a nice prom group. We make corny tshirts (mine says 'PR' his says 'OM?' and the shirts say the respective names), and after a month of talking about it, we finally decided to just get it over with last thursday (5 days ago).

This entire time, I assumed that the other boys captain (who obviously is a good friend of mine) would be asking girl captain C (I had good reason to believe this, but its irrelevant). So 10th period of that day, the only class i have with him, I ask if I should go through with my plan to ask girl captain A, and show him my shirt. He basically replies 'No, dont ask her, I was gonna ask her, please dont ask her', and I'm just like 'FUCK ok i have to call my friend.'

I ask to leave 10th period and spend about 30 minutes talking to my friend, who is also wearing his shirt, and girl captain D, the only other person who knew about our plans to ask A and B. We then get boy captain B to come to the hall and all 4 of us talked about the scenario.

In the end, we kinda sorta but not really came to an agreement that my friend would ask today, but I would hide the name of girl captain A on my shirt, leaving the 'PR' (i just had to fold the shirt a certain way, not that hard). 

About 20 minutes later, I go to the north gym of my school, which is where we were gonna ask, and a decent amount of my friends, as well as girl captain A and B's friends are there, which I didn't expect. During this time, they ALL peer pressured me into asking girl captain A, despite me KNOWING that the other male captain wanted to ask her. I was gonna bail on the plan, but my best friend, along with everyone else around, convinced me that she wants to go with me, not him, and that I should just do it.

In the end, I ended up asking, alongside my friend, and girl captain A and B both quickly said yes. The other guy captain, who very rarely shows emotion, texts me 'Fuck you.' and blocks my number. Since that day, I've felt really really bad, and I dont know how I can remedy this situation at all. I'm pretty sure girl captain A actually really wants to go with me, but I still feel extremely bad for the other boy captain because I knowingly and willingly stole his prom date out of pure impulse.

Ideally I would just say 'sorry A i cant take you to prom' and no questions asked she would say 'ok,' but I'm basically positive she wants to go with me and not him. I just don't see any possible solution to this situation where everyones happy.

***TLDR*** - I impulsively asked a straight female to prom, despite knowing that my good friend wanted to ask her, even though I myself am a homosexual male. Idk if sexuality is relevant or not but its gonna be prom with no romantic aspect. Any advice on how to un-fuck this up would be wonderful, since I made my friend really upset and I feel terrible about the whole thing.",03May2017,3

So I work as a counselor for a girls after school hang out center, for girls aged 14-16. We just kinda hang out with them and play games and stuff. 

So we have a little theme day coming up and the girls voted and decided on baby day. (Not sure why. Strange choice in my opinion, but whatever I guess) So they are all coming dressed as babies and the other counselors and I are the babysitters.

11,"So throw away account for obvious reasons but I currently work in a pet shop, I live in a pretty poor run down area of the country, jobs are not easy to come by and unemployment is high. I originally started working at this pet shop through a work experience programme through unemployment benefit which I had been for 5 months since finishing college. 

After my placement I continued to volunteer for 10 months, during this time I was praised about how much trust they had in me, and even ended up running the shop whilst opening a second. I was began to be promised a job but it never happened, as well as saying im not good enough and require training. Still training never happened and I eventually got fed up, at the same time got offered my first job, a shitty factory job and left but work was work.. Money is money especially in this town. 

A little time passes and the factory job begins to fall through. Aswell as a mental breakdown, I didn't want to stay but if I left instantly I'd have no job and unable to claim unemployment benefit due to fine print in contacts of the job. Basically in short I left a paying job even though it's 0 hour contract. 

The pet shop offers me a job, but a training position as stated before.. which lasts a year, wage is shit, not even half minimum wage, which is legal because it's trainee wage, but I needed money and a stable job so I went back. Things seemed to go okay but now a year later. The training is over but coming close to the end just seems to be making my life hell. Again I am apparently not good enough and just don't cut it, all whilst the boss sits at home doing nothing and complaining about not making enough money. 

(before you all say that's what he pays you for, wrong, I'm the only payed staff member all others are volunteers, so he pays nobody to run that shop all day and he sit at home other than me, and I'm a trainee not a manager yet I've to answer phones, deal with social media, manage staff and organise deliveries) 

Not only that, the health of the animals doesn't come first and instead making money does as he refuses to treat animals that become ill and let's them die. 

Anyway he is making my life a living hell, bitching about me behind my back to the volunteers staff about me taking 2 days paid holiday and calling me incredibley rude names behind my back. He gets on my ass about any tiny mistake and honestly I don't want to carry on being there. But how he treats me and all this time just seems to be ways to stop paying me full minimum wage. 
But quiting my job will mean I'm back on unemployment, which I can't claim instantly because I left a paying job. Regardless if I claim or not I am then in an unemployed situation yet again for God knows how long, because of the shitty area, shitty economy and not being heavily qualified in anything which everywhere expects. 

I know an obvious thing is just get up and move somewhere else where there is more opertunity, but not having any finances to do so, unemployment benefit will not provide enough to go find a place to live, furnish a place and afford all the bills to go along with it. Currently live at home with mom but still demands rent each month (at least a hell of alot cheaper than an own place).

Really not sure what to do, any advice.

14,"Throwaway because duh. 

Backstory, I've known my boyfriend for three years and we've only been together for about 6 months officially. I'm not a virgin but he is. I turned 21 and moved away to help with my sick brother before I could be his first time... and I regret it especially now.

I've been so busy and tired lately I haven't been able to keep up our sex life of roleplaying and nudes, and I've been having PTSD flashbacks of my rape almost every night so... I've been a bit frigid. 

Tonight when he finally talked to me he told me a few things. His stripper friend broke her leg and he both picked her up and took her to the hospital and took her home. He said they got high and chilled together. I thought nothing of it but... well...

He admitted 'the sexual tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife' and he 'considered finger fucking her. '

1. She's a stripper so naturally she's hotter and thinner than me.

2. Fingering is one of my biggest fetishes and thinking of him doing it to someone else... 

3. He sounded guilty. Like he was holding back and not telling me the whole story. I hung up on him and... here I am.

What the hell do I do. Where do I even go from here?

Edit: we talked it over and he swears he did not fuck her. He swears it was nothing than a thought and some flirting but for some reason he refused to show me his dick... I asked to see it because I know what a post-coitus dick looks like. When he declined I did not press because in reverse even if I hadn't cheated on him I'd be uncomfortable being pressured to send a vag pic... plus I don't like pressuring him into anything. But the fact he didn't wanna show me just sort of... off-put me more? He's sending me a package from Urban Decay he says to show he's sorry... makeup can't fix my self esteen and heart.",03May2017,3
15,"Hello everyone,

So here's my situation: I'm off work, undergoing back surgery, and I'm out of money! I've depleted all my available credit resources already, and I don't qualify for unemployment (unable to work) or disability (because my condition won't persist 12+ months). Anyone else been here before? Suggestions? 

The full details: I'm a 21 yo female. I have 2 herniated discs: L4 and L5. In recent months, I've been unable to walk, drive, carry out my work duties, etc. I lost my job because of it and have decided not to return to farm work due to its physical nature. However, all of my education and qualifications are in the dairy industry, so my earning potential in a new position in a different field will be very limited. I filed for workman's compensation, but was denied. We are appealing the decision but my prospects are not good. I've tried to ask the Department of Labor for guidance, but they don't offer any ideas or resources. My state does not offer short-term disability. (I am a resident of Vermont, but I'm currently staying in New Hampshire with my parents.) I've already lost my home and all of my savings; I'm so afraid I'm going to lose my vehicle too. I am also very fearful about never being able to recover from the $15k worth of debt I've already incurred because of this injury. I'm just trying to get started in life and I don't know how I'm going to do that if I'm already so far behind and there's no help available for me.",03May2017,3

18,"So my 16th birthday is in exactly 9 days, but I don't know what I should do. I've always dreamed of having a sweet 16 but ever since I moved to Texas 2 years ago, I haven't had any close friends.

The friends I do have are from completely different social groups and my school is so large that some of my friends have probably never even seen eachother. I can imagine that this would create an awkward situation.

So, my question is, what do I do? I have a few friends from my school's wrestling team but I gave up alot of my non-wrestling friends to join the team. If I invited the wrestlers, I'd probably invite only the girls because I personally am not friends with the guys on the team though the other girls are.

If I did have a party with the wrestling girls, I feel like nobody would come and I've been thinking about quitting anyways. I probably won't but if I invited any of the guys on the team, I feel like they wouldn't come either.

I was thinking about a semi-formal dinner with the girls wrestling team. But right now, my parents really don't have the money. Also I'm kinda shy about bringing people to my house since all of my friends are rich and I'm... not.

20,"A little bit of background info before we begin.
I have a close friend, whom we shall call K [14M]. K has a girlfriend, whom we shall call G [14F].

I discovered K and G were in a relationship pretty early this year, like around March. Now the thing about K, is that his father never allows him to feel negative emotions. This is kind of sad if you think about it. I don't think any speech, especially emotions, should be censored. So when K started a relationship with G, I thought it would be quite fine, despite them being 14 years old, because at least K would be able to express his emotions freely with someone who understands.

1 month later, K goes to another friend of mine's house, let's call this friend J. K invited G to J's home, which J didn't mind. However, J discovered a strange blood stain in his room. Knowing that K and G were using the room, he asked G about more. Here's what he found out:

Apparently G pities K because she thinks no other girl could possibly like him, and thus she decides to remain in the relationship. However, she expressed that she did not like how he was fingering her. What I also found out was that K had a weird fetish for girls pissing. He actually forced G to piss at J's house to satisfy his fetish. 

Despite how G wants to end the relationship, she is afraid that K might commit suicide if she ended it. He has once threatened to commit suicide and I am seriously concerned as he has many tools available for suicide. But most importantly, he is willing to go ahead.

Some real advice would be appreciated.

After he left the next morning he said he would text me and never did? It's been 3 days since the date. Should I text him or forget him? It just really hurts my feelings that I at least couldn't have gotten a text like had fun! Or something simple ",03May2017,1

57,"I'm 17 and a junior in high school. With senior year and the real world coming up soon after, I'm getting a little panicked about my future. Money is and always will be an issue, but oddly enough what scares me the most is discovering what I want to major in. I'm interested and am moderately skilled in graphic design, web design, and writing fiction, which has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, and because of that, I've always seen myself becoming a writer. However, I am also in love with technology and the potential freedom that graphic and web design offer. Although I may be suffering with a romantic mindset, the idea of doing freelance work has always piqued my interest. There's just something about every dollar in my wallet being the byproduct of my own skill and merits.

Anyway, to get to the point, I'm trying to find a way to incorporate all of these interests into my future career, but I'm having trouble doing so. Thank you in advance!",03May2017,1

60,"Background: I've always had problems focusing, always procrastinated as much as I could, and could never stop moving. I've talked with my doctor and we both agreed I have severe ADHD. I was prescribed adderall and it changed my life. I had brought up my lack of focus in high school with my father(I'm in college) and he always completely shut down any conversation about adderall / having ADHD. I maintained a good gpa in hs/now, albeit stressfully. This semester I had to withdraw from 3 classes due to a combination of depression, not feeling motivated, and falling behind in class. I just had a conversation with my father, and he told me that he had ADHD, and he was diagnosed / medicated ~25 years ago. I became upset when I started thinking about why he would never have thought ""I have ADHD, maybe my kids will?"" That along with him dismissing me being inquisitive about Adderall/ having ADHD made me get irrationally upset. I feel like all of these years of dealing with ADHD / depression could have been avoided if he had thought about passing on his ADHD or noticing the signs. I know I'm in an emotional state but it feels like he could have at least said sorry. Am I wrong to feel this way?

Tldr: I'm mad at my father for him not telling me about his ADHD, as medication could have changed my life years ago.",03May2017,1

The thing is I don't know if I'm worried just because I'm thinking too much or I genuinely can see my best friend who I've know for 10 years making a huge mistake.

He's a really smart guy and currently in his business program 3rd year doing really well, and suddenly this year he's trying to switch to a new program at school near his home in computer science. No big deal if he wants to, but the problem is he has never been a computer guy, only thing he knows how to do with a computer is pretty much play league of legends, I really don't understand this choice. He's also told me his passion in weed and how he wants to do a business involving weed MANY times. Now ppl might be like wtf, but he truly loves weed, he actually can smoke a join every hour through the day and manage to get high marks and keep his life together, so I have no problem with him doing it.

Though the problem is ever since he got his girlfriend, hes been prioritizing her over everything, even his studies and he's also restricting himself from weed for her. Now when I think of this I just have this weird feeling he's switching programs just to be in the city and near his girl... honestly should I be worried? I feel that he's super smart and he shouldn't be going into something he's not passionate about just to be near his girl. 

PS: I've talked to him once before about how I feel his girlfriend is restricting him from something he loves, but it just made him really aggressive and angry. So I don't know if I should approach him...",03May2017,1

70,"So I'm a 29 year old 3rd year engineering student with schizophrenia. A week into this semester I unexpectedly lost my health insurance through medicaid, and with it, access to medication that stops me from hallucinating and thinking people can read my mind and generally allows me to be normal. Before this semester started I had a GPA of 3.825. Not having access to anti-psychotics had turned me into full-blown crazy person. Some days are better than others, and today I am feeling particularly lucid. I have reapplied for medicaid (I quit my job so I no longer make too much money) and the coverage started yesterday.

This semester it is likely I will fail all my classes, which isn't surprising when I spent 3 weeks without leaving my room. Unfortunately this means I will also be removed from the university because of a semester GPA below 1.00. This is pretty much the only school in the state that offers my major that I can afford.

72,"Long story short, she's 60 and currently live with us and she's had problems recently, like losing her job and being super paranoid. Anyway my parents recently told me that she was using methamphetamine and it all makes sense now because she always thought people were going after her, and people were breaking into her room, or storage, or even going as far to say she was getting hacked. The worst part is that she even thinks her phone, laptop, and car battery were switched for ""crappy versions""

The reason I posted here is because I was wondering how I tell her, her paranoia is from meth. And it obviously is because I looked up the symptoms from meth-induced paranoia and it's all spot on. 

Whenever I used to tell her that I didn't believe people were breaking in, she would get angry, so I'm not really sure how to tell her that her paranoia is from meth, because she is **very** incredulous.

79,"I'm a mid-20s guy looking for a place to move. I've lived in Boston for almost 10 years and it's time for a change. I want to experience life elsewhere while I'm young, single, and have little in the way of responsibilities beyond keeping myself alive and housed. Unfortunately, that last part is getting harder in Boston. Rent prices are insane and it's getting really tough to keep up, save anything, pay off student loans, and do the city things that make living here fun in the first place. 

I'm also pretty tired of the Boston 'vibe'. Too many people taking themselves too seriously, trying to live a NYC-lite work hard play hard fast-paced lifestyle, the ""don't bother me and gtfo of my way"" attitude that's the default in public places, etc. 

Things I prioritize:

--Big music scene with a lot of variety. Going to shows is my favorite activity

--Laid back lifestyles, at least compared to urban new england/new york/DC

--Low rent &amp; cost of living. I know I can't get rural small-town low since I want a city, but the cheaper the better. If I could get a 1br for ~1k or have roommates and pay like ~500 I'd be happy

--Natural beauty. Doesn't really matter what-- lakes, mountains, forests, ocean, desert, whatever. Somewhere to ski within a 3-5 hour drive would be nice but not necessary. 

--Tolerance of diversity in people, ideas, etc. 

--Solid public transit OR traffic that isn't completely hellish

--Strong city culture. I enjoy the unique Boston qualities and the sense of pride that residents have. I suspect that most cities are like this to some extent, but idk. 

--Decent economy for people who have college degrees but lack specialized skills like IT/engineering/etc.

My list right now is: Denver, SoCal, Austin, PNW, New Orleans, Charlotte/Raleigh, Minneapolis. I need to do more research on costs but I suspect I'll be priced out of Denver, SoCal, PNW, and maybe Austin. 

I know I'll need to compromise on some things no matter where I go, but I'd love any advice on places to cross off, new places to consider, or if you read my list and thought ""that sounds just like my city!"" ",03May2017,2

83,"I had a rough upbringing. My dad died when I was young leaving my distraught, bipolar mom to raise me and my 2 siblings. He was sick my entire childhood and I genuinely don't remember feeling happy until some point in high school. Around this time, I started dating a girl who I stayed with for about 5 years. She wasn't my first serious relationship but it was my longest. We were perfect for each other, I've never met someone else who I connected with on such a deep level. We were best friends. We spent every day together for almost all of the relationship until the end. We were barely adults though and hadn't quite found ourselves yet and both made alot of mistakes that made our relationship more tense, even though we had a very strong connection and deep down didn't mean to do the hurtful things we did. She moved away to get a job she wanted and I was supposed to move to meet her when my semester was over. She got more and more distant and I tried more and more to contact her because I could tell I was losing her. She said she needed a break from talking and I needed time to sort out what I actually wanted out of life. She felt that I once had passion and a calling I was chasing but she enabled me to stop caring and feel too comfortable working a job I didn't care about just to afford the necessities and spend more time just chilling with her. When I ended up moving back, I found out she was already with someone else. She made some mistakes but in the end, the issue was me. I've spent years trying to work on myself and get back into dating but I see myself making the same mistakes and just don't get the same feeling from other girls that I did with her. After 2 years we ended up meeting up and I've seen her about 1-2 times a year ever since. I still feel that connection and she's admitted to feeling it too but she ended up starting a business with the guy she left me for and I'm not going to ruin that for her, she always wanted to run her own business. I'm ok with just being her friend and I genuinely don't know whether or not I'd even want to try dating her again if the option came up. Now I'm in a weird spot where I don't even see dating people as a possibility anymore but I've remained mostly optimistic even though it hasn't been working out for me at all. We broke up over 4 years ago and I've dated multiple girls since but it seems like a waste of time at this point. I'm not sure what the problem even is. I can't stop myself from being an asshole, I don't find anything fun or interesting anymore, and I've found just being quiet and alone is easier on me then consistently trying and failing to live a happier life. I've decided to give up and just start working more to occupy my time but I see no positive end goal in that. I just live to work, sleep, and do necessary things around my house. When I have free time, I just lay in bed and find something to waste my time, sometimes just staring at the wall and doing nothing for hours. I now have trouble eating and sleep close to 12 hours most days and then sometimes only sleep 4 hours a night for weeks. I've tried therapy, medications, hobbies, and trying to connect more with my friends but nothing's made a big impact and the older I get, the more bored I get with everything. I'd never kill myself, it would ruin the lives of too many people who care deeply about me and it seems pointless, but life is starting to feel pointless to me too. I've tried any advice I've read or been given but nothing seems to help. I don't think there's anything you can do or say to help but I figure it can't hurt either and I'm out of ideas.",03May2017,6
84,"I just got back home from a week long trip about 6 hours ago and am writing this in the middle of the night. I am very close to my godmother and finding out about this is truly heartbreaking for me. I don't know how else to describe it. Pardon me in advance for any formatting errors or typos as I am writing this through tears rn. 

I googled sepsis and my mom told me a bit about it and it sounds really bad. My godmom is over 60 and it seems to increase in fatality with age and I don't even know what to do. It is a kind of blood poisoning that effects just about all of your organs. She has had a ton of health issues in the past few years and surgeries (one resulting in an organ being removed by mistake) that have made her practically bedridden for a good while and severely depressed. 

If there is any advice u can give me or any information at all about this disease it would be greatly appreciated. She was just admitted to the hospital Monday after she had grown so weak from committing that her husband had to call the ambulance to take her to the hospital. My mom doesn't want me to have to see her in as bad shape as she is in and insists that I just stay home tomorrow am and wait for her to call me. Idk what I will do, if I can I still do want to see her. In part for, emotional support for my mom and godfather and in part just to hear from the doctor what her condition is. 

I can't believe how fast the rug can just be swept up from under ur feet. I just talked to her before we left and she sounded okay. Not great, but she sounded good and I just wish I knew how all this could have happened so fast. Keep your family close to you fellow Redditors. There is no telling how much longer even your closest family men ever shave left. Call up your parents, children and godparents, call up everyone your close with and tell them how much they mean to you. Don't let your last words to them be something meaningless and careless. Don't just remind your kid to take the trash out tonight before bed. Tell them how much they mean to you too. I hope I still get that chance. ",03May2017,2

Fast forward 6 months from then and I begin dating one of her friends after she expresses that she does not want to date. Fast forward a year from then and me and my girlfriend are still together and very much in love. However it seems my friend may be regretting her decision to cut things off. Our friendship has been strained due to the fact that she admitted to wanting to have a three some with me and my girlfriend ( my girlfriend is not down) and shortly after that began dating on of my close friends. Recently she has become dependent on me, she has become very touchy(grabs my hands or will touch my arms frequently), has even begun undressing before I am out of her dorm room (I have turned around while closing the door to see her smiling at me in a bra). Despite all of this she is someone I enjoy spending time with and wish to continue doing so. So I guess my question is is there a way to have a conversation about all of this with her without A.

92,"Hello, this is going to be a semi-large post relating mainly to EMT/FF career choices and each of the salaries that go along with them. Important thing to note before reading, I am not basing all of my decisions on the jobs income it is merely a factor that is being included. 

To begin I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore in college, I live at home, pay no rent and my parents pay for my tuition. Its a pretty awesome gig, which is why I do not want to waste my opportunity. 

I graduate this July from my schools EMS program, and plan to continue going to school once more later this year. I will have two years of college credits and a emt-b cert. This is also relevant, this takes place in Michigan as I am family friends with my local fire chief. Leading to my first few questions, out of college I planned to use my connections and hopefully get hired at the fire station to avoid IFT which everybody on r/ems says is bad. 

1) What is working at a fire-station as a emt-b like, and what are your advancement options? Are you funneled into becoming a firefighter essentially?

2) Rates in Michigan arent Ideal, according to google EMTs cap at 30k while paramedics (4-year degree) cap at 40k. A whole extra 10k more? So it doesn't seem worth it to go down the paramedic route. Do you abandon ems after getting the cert?

Answering those two questions is important because lets **assume** I work at the fire-station and everything is great and my only option is to become a firefighter, the salary for firefighters is capped at 65-70k which is the number I am aiming for, but I am not personally sure if I want to lock in that job.

A lot of this is speculation, I mostly am asking because I need outside advice. What did you all do, what paths did you all take? I also thought about just starting a BSN this upcoming semester and only using my EMT-cert to get a part time job while going to school, that seemed like the most logical. 

Closing questions, and thinks im unsure about or couldn't find on the internet: 

3) Are the salary numbers inflated/deflated? 

4) What is the transition between emt to fire? is the ems cert useful ?


I have posted this to r/Advice, and r/ems as I know one person or a mod will ask.

94,"Thank you for reading, I just feel I need someone to listen to me besides her. I can't talk to my friends about stuff like this. I would like to give a little context and preface before I get to the ""advice"" part, if you don't mind. Anyway here we go-

I'm 23 years old, and I live with just my mom. I'm a self-funding independent filmmaker, and I'm basically home alone all day while my mom's at work. It used to be me, my sister, my mom, and my dad living together. My dad left when I was 14, and me and my mom got closer. We leaned on each other emotionally very much. My sister was still there, but she was very rebellious, and often times emotionally abusive, so obviously my mom turned to me (and I to her). My sister died from a drug overdose about 4 years ago. She was 18 years old, and it was devastating to both of us (even though I described my sister as abusive, she had a loving side and we always tried to help her turn her life around). And we got even closer, and from then on it's just been me and her. We are about as close as two people could possibly be, and we love each other about as much as two people could possibly love each other. We both feel, at this point, that we are the only ones that have ever understood each other, and the only ones we have ever really connected with.

My concern:

I'm afraid I might be eroticizing maternal love. It's the only love from a woman I've ever really known, and I think my mind is taking the next logical step in love (sex) without me realizing it. I watch pornography on occasion like most other people in the world, but for the past year or so I've noticed that I find myself watching mother/son incest porn more and more often. I've always shrugged it off as just a silly fantasy with no basis in reality, but given my home situation, I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence. And I'm having a hard time coming to terms with what this means.

Also, the reason I've decided to post this now is because of a completely unrelated issue. Since I was little I occasionally had violent thoughts (like anyone else), but they are becoming harder and harder to keep out of my head. Like I said, I'm by myself all day and left to my own devices while my mom is at work. And whenever I see a girl walking down the street from my window, I feel like her life is so precious. But another thought always creeps in, and I genuinely want to take her in the house and drain the life out of her eyes (if that sounds oddly specific, it's because that's ALWAYS exactly what the thought and urge is). I am afraid of all of these things that I've written about in this post, and I feel like it's coming to a head all at once.

I know if I go to therapy they will tell me to put some space between me and my mom, but I really don't want to do that because we need each other so much. It's hard to explain, but if I was away from her I would feel incomplete, like the rest of me was still with her waiting for me to come back and be whole again.

Any advice? Thanks.

EDIT: I know that last part about the violent thoughts sounds really dark and bad, but just to clarify, I know I would never hurt anyone and I'm in complete control, so you don't need to be concerned about anyone's safety. It's just scary and consuming sometimes, and I felt I needed to include it because I'm sort of going through both of these things at the same time. Thanks again.",03May2017,2

It makes me so depressed that people think i'm a failure in life. I want to be a nurse. But I feel like i'm never going to make it. I guess you can say I have anger issues , I got kicked out of a few schools in the past &amp; i guess thats why people think i'm such a terrible person. I try so hard to make up for all my mistakes but it feels like i can never do enough. I hate feeling like this and I don't know what to do.",03May2017,1
97,"I'll try to keep this short. A friend I'd known for years, who I considered the best friend I had, knew I was into this girl. I'd mentioned it recently, as well as in the past. She had been in a relationship with another guy , but they recently broke up, which he told me about (prior to them officially breaking up). I found this out for sure via an off-hand remark she made at Applebee's on my birthday (got people together and he brought her with). After that, I explained to him how my birthday took what was a simple crush (""she's cute and nice"") and made it more than that, because it was the most we'd interacted up until that point and she did seem like my type.

Naturally, I didn't want to swoop right in after she'd just broken up with her last boyfriend, especially since I had no interest in being her rebound. I told him I was gonna take it slow, with that in mind. Later, though, I was told by her friend that I probably shouldn't bother because she has problems, some of which he can't even tell me for privacy reasons. I told my friend about this and asked if he'd gotten and read my messages, hoping for a proper conversation on the matter, but he just said ""yes"" and nothing else, making me assume he didn't want to talk about it.

As all this was going on, it came to light that she had a thing for him. He mentioned going to the movies with her friend, and I accidentally told her, missing the fact that it was supposed to be a secret, resulting in her kinda losing it. He told me she was reacting like that because she was interested in him (and the friend had lied to her about it), which he found flattering, but that he couldn't really say the same about her and was thinking of ways to let her down. He also joked about tossing in a ""but you can go out with him instead"" sorta remark about me.

Fastforward a little and all I hear about is him doing this or that with her. They were working together on a play at the community college, so I thought it was due to that at first. Then he was cancelling/putting off plans with me, yet still making time to hang out with her, and I saw how they acted around one another the next day.

Instantly, it all came together and I texted him asking if there was something between them. He told me there was, that they were gonna tell me but weren't yet sure how to go about it. He also said he thought I wasn't still interested after her friend's remarks, despite having made no attempt to ask.

So, he'd lied to me, repeatedly put her before me when I was in dire need of proper human interaction (which I'd mentioned to him), and never even bothered to at least ask me where I stood on matters with her or mention their blossoming relationship to me. Had he simply been upfront with me about all of it immediately, I don't know that I would be nearly as pissed off as I was.

Oh, and there was also the small matter of him telling her I was misinformed about him and her friend going to the movies together, doubling down on a lie rather than admitting to the truth. After I learned he'd been lying to me too, and that he hadn't confessed, in spite of them dating, I made sure her friend knew so he could pass on the word.

Anyway, this friend has yet to say a word to me since the incident, and we work at the same store. To make matters worse, his initial ""apology"" was that he was sorry for upsetting me, not for the things he did that upset me, which I feel is an important distinction. He tried to stick to our original plans to play Magic the Gathering that same day, but I told him the last thing I wanted to do right then was hang out with him, and he said he'd leave me be until I was ready. Still, I assumed he'd try to extend some sort of olive branch after enough radio silence, since I was stupid enough to think our friendship mattered enough to him for him to work to regain it. Instead, it persisted, and I eventually unfriended him on League of Legends (which we used to play together often), Skype (we'd voice chat while we played LoL), and Facebook (along with everyone else; this all highlighted what I've always assumed to be true, that I have no real friends, so why pretend on some silly website?), as well as removed his number from my contacts on my phone.

Every day he and I both work, he comes by our department in the process of doing his job, and I haven't gotten so much as a word from the guy. Likewise, I haven't bothered talking to him because, again, if it's not worth the effort to him, why should it be worth it to me? But I'm starting to wonder if perhaps I'm being too petty about all this, hence why I came here asking for advice.

So, do you think I should give him another chance, even though he doesn't appear to give a single shit about me not being his friend anymore? Or should I just say ""good riddance"" and forget all about him?",03May2017,2

I got taken out of school because I couldn't wake up and make it to school. I then went to online schooling and I'm now working towards the GED.

The past few months I've had some health problems and I've had had a lot of stress/anxiety and I've been really sad. 

I have no friends. I wake up and go to bed whenever. I don't do much besides video games all day. I have no motivation. I used to go on weekly hikes with my dad but he's busy. 

My sleep schedule is trashed, I'm having health problems, I'm stressed/anxious/depressed over it and the future.

I see my therapist once a week. I'm on medication and it doesn't seem to do jack shit, since I feel good when things are going well and I feel terrible when things are going terrible.

103,"So, as I said, I tried out for a band. And they liked me. I got the frontman gig. But, I don't think it's gonna work. 

For one: they dig Southern metal. Chuggy heavy stuff, and what they call ""jam"" bands. Guys who just get together and jam. I'm not against it, but it's just not my style all the time. 

Now, last practice went pretty well. A solid three hour session. There really wasn't any progress in music. They wanna play a show in June. We hardly have any material placed out, and what we do have, we barely rehearsed. I've been in enough bands to know that won't work. I've played guitar for almost 11 years, the guitarist, has been playing for 15, and I'm teaching him the most basic stuff about playing. Again, not shaming or judging, but keep in mind. They wanna play in a month. 

Our drummer showed up stoned before practice. Guitarist drinks, I'm not shaming them for it, they're allowed to do what they please. I drink, but I'm also kind of against illegal shit. After practice, they both got stoned, which made me really uncomfortable. I've been in bands where drugs also ruined them. 

With all that's gone on, I really don't know if I wanna continue this. We have different tastes, but they both, despite being under an influence of some kind, were able to keep playing, and rather well at that. I just don't think it's gonna work simply because the differences in choices, and music tastes. But I know that if I say I'm done, after they got super excited that they had me show up, they probably will take it personal. And I don't know what I should do. 

TL;DR: on a band that seemed okay, but turns out, I don't know if I can go on because of differences in lifestyles. ",03May2017,1

Decided that he wanted to go ahead and have a party where I would basically just be doing tattoo for all his dumb basic white girl friends. They'd be doing coke, playing kickball, drinking, smoking drugs, etc, and basically I would be working, and giving this guy a cut of my money (a detail he could not stress enough). The whole time selling this and himself to me, as though making him happy would be just so good for my fucking wallet, and sex life (two things that are of really no motivation to me). So after seeing my work the first time, he thought it was all really great. Then after I gave him a soft maybe for his dumb party idea, dude started negging me. Told me my tats sucked (through in a no offense as though that matters), and then decided to kinda like jerk me around saying only one was good (mind you he picked on of my worse cause...raisins). Then just kept flip flopping back and fourth using every manipulation tactic I have ever seen in my life. To be honest I only stuck around to see how long this guy would talk.

Normally I'm as frugal as you can get. I still wear clothes from middle school.)

Being a very green town, there were multiple types of recycling bins: paper, plastic, glass, cardboard, etc. As an environmental studies student, I am very conscious about correctly sorting my recycling. 

Rich kids do not know how to separate trash from recycling. 

Recycling company gets pissed off that there is trash in their recycling bins, they refuse to pick up our recycling (after already warning everyone several times). They take away all their bins. 

My roommates and I do not want to throw our recycling in the trash. It's piling up next to our front door. How do we properly dispose of it?

114,"Hey reddit community, I really need some help and not sure what to do right now. I will admit that this was a largely mishandled deal, but I never thought this person would go overboard with these plans.

Basically, over the summer, an acquaintance wanted to sell some anime figurines on an online shop I started for fun on Storenvy. This conversation happened over the phone while he was in Japan and he wanted to buy figurines cheaper there to sell. I agreed to his proposition and said I could probably invest ~$100 in merchandise since I wasn't sure how successful it would sell online.

Later, he gave me some of the figures to me in person at the school office. He mentioned I could pay him back sometime later and that he had more. At the time, I admit that I was unprepared to give him the funds upfront, and wasn't aware how much he had actually spent. I attempted to sell them for a fundraiser raffle, but it was unsuccessful. 

Now, here is my current dilemma. Aside from attempting to overcharge me for all the merchandise that he gave to me in person, he is now claiming that there was another batch that I should have received months ago that I never got. Note* he never followed up with me whether I received this second load, which he says was worth much more. It has already been months since there ""transactions"" took place, and now he is demanding for money for goods I never even received. 

I will fully admit that I am at fault as well for not paying him back for the first batch of goods. I had a rough junior year and family issues, but I was also very irresponsible with this issue. However, this person is now trying to overcharge me not just for items I have, but also for valuable merchandise he never confirmed that I had. No calls, no texts, no tangible proof that I ever received it. I have tried to stay polite on our email chain, but at the same time, I'm so exasperated by how this person is reacting months after this supposed deal.

http://imgur.com/a/DIMIP

I've linked to images of all our recent correspondence, and I honestly don't know what to do. I would like to pay him back a fair amount for the items I currently have, but I absolutely refuse to give him money for the others. I don't even know if he's trying to scam me on this, but I'd like to think the best of this person for now.

tldr; This person is trying to charge me for items he thought I received, but never got.

What do I do?

115,"Hi Reddit, 

Just a little background information, I'm currently in an award-winning collegiate all-female acappella group. I've been singing in a choir or in musical theater since I was in kindergarten and absolutely love singing and am pretty good at it too. I've been in the state honor choir, was treasurer for my high school choir for three years, won best in the talent portion of a scholarship competition, and a bunch of other singy things. But one of the main reasons why I sing is because I've never felt comfortable expressing my thoughts or feelings with my real voice, and I learned how to do that through singing. Its the one thing thats been constant in my life and I don't want to ever stop singing in a group. I'd like to think that I've grown as an individual and leader with all my experience, but resent events/situations have made me question otherwise. 



Currently as a second year in college, I am assistant music director of my acappella group, but never was trained to be one by the current director like she was supposed to. The plan last year was that she would train me throughout this year so that by the end of this school year, we would be co-directors. 



Last week, I ran to be a co-director for next year an didn't get elected, but one of the girls who did get elected lives with and is best friends with the current director did get elected. In my opinion, this girl seemed to be the least qualified person out of the 4 other girls who were running. And there wasn't a vote this year to determine who the co-directors would be which makes me very suspicious of what the process was in deciding who the co-directors would be. 



Tonight, because I didn't get elected to be a co music director, I decided to run to be the Financial Director and/or the Events Coordinator. And I wasn't voted to be either of them... 



If people really don't think I'm fit to be a leader of the group, then why was I elected to be one last year? Either I'm doing something wrong and am just not aware of it, or the people in the group really don't want or like me/I just don't fit it. 



In addition to leadership elections not going how I expected them to be, I don't feel like anyone in the group genuinely likes me other than 3 people (its a group of 15 girls). It seems like everyone else is friends with each other, laughs together, and wants to do things outside of rehearsal together, but for some reason I'm not one of those people. I don't know if its all in my head or the people in the group just don't understand me, but whenever I try to contribute to the conversation I get weird looks and/or no one listens to what I have to say. I just don't feel like people like or respect me for who I am.



It's not like I am a bad person either, I try to love everyone unconditionally and be as understanding and open as possible. I love coming to rehearsal with food to give people and just hearing about people's days, but I don't think they appreciate me like I appreciate them. I don't know if I feel this way because I am self conscious and have always had a hard time connecting with other girls, but I have a few very close girl friends from high school and friends in college that make me think otherwise. 



I don't know what to do anymore, do I stop doing what I love and try to make new friends somewhere else? Or do I stay, continue to try and look inward in order to fix whats wrong with myself?",03May2017,1

147,"I met Jane at work about 2 years ago I recently moved to the area and had no friends living close anymore. I partied (a lot) and going camping that night in the state where all my friends live and one thing led to another.  

Afterwards everything was fine and Jane continued to tag along and be my companion. I told her intentions of staying single because Im a negative influence and have many bad habits.

 After a few straight weeks I admitted to myself dating again, after 3 years single and sleeping around, she was worth risking being hurt again. She moved in that same day I asked her to be mine and I hers while going 100mph headed to a beach party at 4am :)

 I have been loyal to my gf for 2 years(surprisingly) and respect her as my beat friend. We've had an apartment now for 1 1/2 yrs we split with my 2 older brothers. I have fallen more in love than I've ever felt and have almost been killed (my brother is bi-polar) defending her and would gladly do it again.


 The real problem is myself as I stated earlier before pouring out on this thread. I got a dui because I took my keys from her even though she was yelling to not do it. I continue to have a beer or 2 after work and usually more when i don't work. I've only drank too much beer a couple times. 

Before I drank beer it was strictly hard liquor which was the problem. The vast majority of my friends drink like i did and we blacked out a few times a week at least. After dating for 8 months Jane decided she no longer drinks or wants to party and wanted me to follow suit. I no longer have transportation to travel and party nightly but would partake with coworkers when I could tell her it was ok and usually got really drunk again. 

Since this last year I have been doing the best I've done, for the most part, in 7 years yet still continue to make wrong decisions. Jane believes I am unfaithful, or have been, when I completely have been and am proud of it. She won't trust me therefore she gets jeleous and angry quickly. In the 11/2 yrs of having having our place, I can count on one hand the long list of people I considered friends that I've allowed be invited to our home. 3 out of 5 had proven to my girl every ""friend"" is going to bring doom to our relationship.  Between basicly having a rent free bum for 4 months, theft of petty stuff that i really don't care about anyway, disrrespect and noise complaints, she has asked me tonight to let everyone i knew burn in hell and don't look back. I have a couple loyal friends that I trust which have always been loyal but she sees flaws in them all. 

I have always been very forgiving and trusting the best in everyone but this is a big flaw about 95%.The night after next is my birthday and I am renting a hotel room to host my friends at so they can't intued on Jane and since she insists she cannot sleep without my presence I've booked the hotel down the road to come home after.

 I just quit my job and am looking for a release to hang out with a select few friends that formed a tiny trust group back before where out of everybody else we had eachothers backs but clicued in separate groups. I sound like I am rationalizing why I like my friends?

 I understand Janes point of view but I feel entitled to allow people, who would travel such a disstance, to see me on this rare occasion. Jane told me she doesn't love me anymore because I haven't changed and won't stop destroying our relationship with my decisions.  

I believe i have transformed into a better person wether she sees it or not because not being in jail or dead is a guarantee that she's helped me accomplish. My bad habits havnt all gone away but my good habits have grown far beyond my expectations thanks to her true friendship and advice.  This relationship has been so happy and the ups far outway and outnumber the downs but sometimes enough is enough and someone backs out no matter how far down the road. 

This is my longest relationship and her saying she wants to leave tonight makes me want to get a promise ring to match her jewelry I've given her as a sign of how much I need her to continue.If she leaves I will be heartbroken and am left confused everytime I think of losing her. I know my flaws are somewhat fixable but how do I keep my love and still not regret being young and enjoying life. I won't ever regret the time we've spent but I feel fallen to helping myself save this love. 

I was a manager for 2 years at our workplace and a damn good one but I can't manage my own affairs as well apparently. I've never expressed so much like this or on a thread and would appreciate any thoughts or judgments either or.
Thanks for your time....

I don't know what to do because it is verbal. The slapping and the like that happens but doesn't leave any marks is protected under discipline. CPS doesn't care about verbal abuse and has bigger fish to fry, (or not as they rarely do their jobs) but the emotional toll it has to be taking on these children is driving me insane.

The mother seems to genuinely hate her kids for existing (yet continues to have them), screams insults at them at any chance. Some are very young school aged, one is still in diapers. No day goes by without a large amount of hurled hatred and many, many tears from all the children. Any problem that can't be solved with a smack or screaming hateful obscenities she threatens to force them to stay locked in their room all day.

The only thing I can say that is even remotely a positive of her is that she doesn't seem to delight in the cruelty, the entire thing seems/sounds to be all born of frustration. But she gets frustrated even at having to fix them breakfast, and frequently rages that they have other needs beyond that ""I fucking fed you what more could you possibly want???"" It is as if she doesn't understand what being a parent means. I truly believe if it wasn't for the fact it gave her a moment's peace the kids would never get to play.

I'm terrified for them. As an abuse survivor I know that shit shapes and plagues you for the rest of your goddamn life. I just don't know what to do when no one cares because it is a step below physical injury-inflicting abuse. She isn't friendly or anyone you could offer a helping hand and have them take it seriously. Just the all too frequent product of the very poor area we live in. 

I can't help feeling powerless which I hate the most. Not only that but feeling too late as the kid's behaviors have slowly started to mimic their parents. Being told you are hated, stupid, unwanted, and denied the ability to cry makes a real ticking time bomb sometimes. There is a father present and he is more tolerant and far less present than the mother. However when he does go off, screaming and the like is par for the course as well with little difference.

What can I do? I know it may seem like nothing compared to those seriously starved or beaten children, or those sexually abused like I was as a kid but, it truly breaks my heart and destroys me so frequently I'm beginning to desire a therapist for myself.",03May2017,21

154,"Thanks in advance for any advice you have to offer. For the past year, I have been working remotely as a web content producer/copywriter/digital media manager. Throughout this time, I have never received a reprimand or any bad review of my work. However, I recently relocated back to the area where my job is located. 

Since I work from home, I decided to sell my car to help save money. I'm inheriting a car in a month, and I figured I would be able to maneuver around without a vehicle for a few weeks. However, literally the day I sold my car, my job contacted me and told me I'd have to start coming in two days a week starting the next day. I informed them of the situation, and they were adamant that I still start coming in, even before I have my car situation sorted out. They worked it out so one of my bosses picks me up and brings me home. I agreed to do this, and went in for the first day. When I arrived at the office, there was no designated space set up for me. I had to share a desk with another employee, and luckily he had to be out doing off-site work for a couple of hours. The work I completed at the office was the exact same thing I would do at home. 

I also found out that the company may be hiring someone who used to work there many years and who recently moved away. He's best friends with some of the employees above me. I was told he may be coming on as a freelance writer to cover some of my responsibilities. I know this may be reaching, and I may just be paranoid, but do I have any room for combatting this? I don't even mind coming in the two days during the week, but I don't understand why I have to so suddenly and without any explanation as to why it's necessary, when I've been doing the same exact job from home for a year without any complaints. I was also promised a 6-month review and possibility of adding benefits, but that still hasn't happened. What should I do?

Tl;dr: I have worked from home for a year, and now my job wants me to come in two days a week without explaining why and without notice. I'm thinking they may be trying to get me to quit, so they can hire a former employee who's close with the bosses.",03May2017,14
156,"It's been a little while since I last visited this site but I remember reddit being the best place to get advice on many things. I use to go under the username 0coo1 but have since forgot my password hence the new account.

I guess I'll just put it all out there and start from the beginning. I work overnights doing stocking, I probably shouldn't mention specifics but it's a home improvement store (if that matters). Early Monday morning I was using a narrow aisle lift machine to put up a pallet of paper towels in top stock and in the process of doing that two five gallon buckets of Tuff Coat was pushed over into the next aisle. I went to check it out and it went everywhere, it was all over the floor and it even sprayed on the paint cans a few feet on the shelf. A co-worker I'm somewhat friends with (who we'll call A) heard the accident and came to check it out. A told me that he would alert our manager (who'll be known as B) about it. I went back to the mess and attempted to step over the Tuff Coat and that's when I slipped and fell in it. I wasn't hurt but I was in disbelief. I started walking around and of course I was tracking it all over the store. I tried to stay confined to the area and that's when B came up and saw me. I told him what happened and he told me to wash up. After about 10 minutes in the bathroom B came in and told me he laid something on the Tuff Coat to absorb it and instructed me on how to clean it up when I was ready. I was covered in this stuff and had only gotten my face washed and had started making progress on my arms. I only had a sink to wash at and figured I couldn't wash my legs or else I'd get this stuff all over the bathroom floor, making a bigger mess so I went to go clean up the spill. In the process of cleaning it up another person who works over nights (C obviously) came up and asked to take a picture of me (this will be relevant later) I told her ""no, I don't want to remember this"" so she took a picture of the spill and said she was going to send it to someone who works in the paint department. I spent the next hour and a half cleaning it up by myself until one of the opening mangers got to work and got on the store intercom and asked a couple of employees to come help me. I had some help cleaning for about an hour at which point B came up and I told him that he should probably alert our store manager about this as its recently became a problem after a reset was done. I told him that this was the second time this had happened as another co-worker had done the same thing in the exact spot a month prior with a box of paint. He told me we'll just put smaller pallets on that aisle from now on. I also asked B if I could leave now as breathing in this stuff for so long was starting to get to me. He said that he'll ask the other employees that were helping me clean if they still needed my assistance. They said they didn't and B told me that I could leave. Then C came up and said I should take something with me to help get the Tuff Coat off me. So we all looked for something and found the best product the store had to offer that wouldn't dissolve my skin which was Goof Off, it was taken out of inventory and I went home. BTW I don't recommend using Goof Off to remove Tuff Coat as I was in the shower for over an hour scrubbing my skin. Apparently it's called Tough Coat for a reason.

The next day at work which was Monday night I was approached by A who told me that he received a text from someone who works the day shift. He said that this person received some pictures and I thought I heard him say of me but wasn't sure as one of my ears was clogged and I was in the middle of bringing out a pallet on a jack. I went to ask him about it later and in the middle of asking about it we ran into C and he got her involved in the conversation, A said that he told C that they shouldn't take a picture of me and C said they didn't and  pulled out their phone and showed me the one picture of the spill. A had walked off during C explaining themselves so I still wasn't clear about what the text that A received. I found A again and asked if they could send me the pictures and they said they didn't get anything but a text so I asked exactly what was in the text and A started to get a little angry and said that they already told me. I then told them that my ear was clogged and if they wouldn't mind repeating it one more time. A told me that the text said ""looks like I'm walking into a mess, who took the pictures?"". A told me if I wanted to find out what was in the pictures that I would have to talk to the person that sent him the text. Who I don't talk to nor see now that they work days (used to see them around when they unloaded the trucks). During this night B wasn't there and I was told that they would be away for a few days due to a family emergency. I also began to wonder why no one had spoken with me about an incident report and if I should file one myself.

Which brings me to last night.

A wasn't there tonight either (not sure why). I saw the store manager and they asked me how I was doing and I said good. Human resources came up to me as well and said they heard about the accident and was wondering if I'm fine and I said yes that I wasn't hurt but had developed a cough and a weird taste in my mouth (which was improving) possibly from breathing in the Tuff Coat as I had found the HSDS online and it said to use in a well ventilated area. I explained the accident, that B laid something on it to absorb it. That I primarily cleaned it until one of the opening managers instructed a couple members of the day shift to help. He asked me if there was anything else I wanted to tell him and I said no and he asked me if I was sure and I said yeah but asked if I should fill out an incident report as no one had came to me about one and thought that a slip and fall should warrant one. Which he said that it should and seemed surprised that no one had so he went and got one for me. Later last night loss prevention came up to me and told me they heard what happened and asked how I was doing and i said okay. They told me they heard about the pictures and that they were reviewing the footage to see who took them and that someone could be fired for it. I told them what I knew which wasn't much but that A had received that text and C had asked to take a picture of me and showed me they took a picture of the mess. I then thanked them for trying to get to the bottom of this and went on to finish my shift.

Which brings us here to this very moment and me wondering what to put in this report. I obviously should explain the accident but what else do I put in? Do I put in what transpired with B? Do I put the pictures in the report?

I'm really lost right now and could use some help. I don't have a lot of people in my life, at least someone that could help with this sort of thing. I suppose I'll end it here, thank you for your time reddit.

157,"Hi all! I'm sorry in advance if this post is a little bit all-over-the-place. 

So, I've been interviewing at a few companies in DC and hope to have an offer soon. If I get a job, I'll be moving to DC in the next couple months. 

I've lived on my own before, so I know how to budget, but my rent was super cheap and my utilities and internet were included. I also commuted on the bus (so no car insurance or gas), and I was only paying for half of my cell phone bill, not saving for retirement, and not paying my student loans yet (as I was still in school).

I'm just looking for advice on how to live within a reasonable budget in DC. Rent there can be really expensive, especially near metro stations, but I'd like to live as close to one as possible so that I don't have to pay for parking. I calculated metro costs, and if I parked at a metro station and took the metro into the city, I'm looking at a cost of about $75 a week. 

Right now, I'm looking at a potential salary of $37-40,000 with benefits. 

My situation is further complicated by the fact that I have a dog, and don't know anyone in the city, so having a roommate is not really part of my plan at the moment. I don't feel comfortable just living with someone I don't really know, especially when I have a dog. I want her to be as safe as possible. If I could find someone I trust, then a roommate would be ideal so that we could split costs. 

All-in-all, I just need some guidance. This will be my first entry-level job out of college and the first time that I'm paying for absolutely everything by myself. I'm just kind of freaking out about taking on my student loans ($15,000 total), cell phone bill (which my parents were paying half of before), car insurance, rent, utilities, gas, saving for retirement, vet bills, dog food, and food for myself, especially when my salary might only be $37,000 a year. I know I'll be working a part-time job on top of this at least one shift a week, so I'll have about $70 extra each week (should cover food for me and my dog). 

How did you all manage when you got your first real job out of college? 

Anything you wish you knew before you moved and started your first real job? 

Tips for finding cheaper, but still safe, housing in DC?

163,"Hi all. I know this isn't exactly in line with most of the topics on this sub, but it's been causing me a lot of issues. I'm currently making arguably the biggest decision in my life and I'm stuck. I just finished my BSc in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. I've been accepted back at U of T for a master's in medical science, with a specialization in neuroscience, and my undergraduate thesis supervisor has agreed to have me continue for a masters in her lab (although she can't supervise for a PhD just yet). As well, I have been accepted to McGill University in Montreal for a master's in neuroscience. I can't decide between the two. I want to know what you guys think. 

Here are some factors I've been weighing: Toronto is WAY more expensive to live in than Montreal (Toronto is in the middle of a housing crisis) but the minimum stipend at U of T is higher $27,000/year vs $21,000/year. My POI at McGill has a bigger lab with more funding, but it is harder to get authorship in a big lab. McGill is VERY famous for neuroscience and medicine (ie Wilder Penfield, William Osler, Donald Hebb among others) but Toronto has a bigger research budget. My Toronto POI can only supervise master's students, but she may be able to take PhD students sooner or later (no idea though).

What should I do?

166,"   I like to go fast, to hear the engine and wind. As a byproduct of this I don't like when people slow me down. I usually give myself enough distance to stop but not if they were to stop immediately. On the highway when the speed limit is 100 I go 120 but more often now on roads I know I'll go 130 but never over 140. When people are in the left lane and I was going faster than them I'll get up closer to them to tell them to move over as soon as they have the chance. If they don't I'll flash my brights to remind them. If they still don't move over I'll pass on the right. If I see a bike I'll always give extra room and I'll never tailgate someone who is driving the same car as me. 

   I left a bit later this morning than usual and needed to make up time so on the highway I was travelling at 120-130. Getting off the highway is a 50 limit and I was going 100 on it for a short while until a turn where I slowed down. I usually accelerate to around 50-60 on the uphill after the hairpin but today someone was going 35 which is the recommended limit for the turn atop the hill. Me being me got a little closer to tell them that they can take it faster. Atop the hill there is a stop sign so I figured maybe it was backed up a bit and that's why he was going slow. However he had a lot of space ahead of him after the stop sign and was only going 40 on the 50 road in the middle of farm fields. I usually take this road at 70. He brakes as I accelerates from the stop sign and that told as soon as I have the chance I should pass him. As soon as the road become straight I signalled and crossed the solid yellow line to pass. I passed him and then was behind a car doing the speed limit. The guy behind caught up and was following at a safe distance. Initially I tailgated the new car a bit but then backed off.

 Traffic backed up again and just before the single lane become 2 I moved over to the second lane, clipping the grass a bit. I followed other cars matching their speed into the parking lot but as soon as they turned and the lane opened up I sped up. There was someone crossing the road so I couldn't take my normal line through the quick left right chicane-like turns into the secondary lot so I slowed down more than usual and cut the grass at the apex a bit.

   As I parked and was about to get out of the car someone knocked on my window. He called me a maniac and said I was going to kill someone with my tailgating and I almost killed someone crossing the road. I believe I gave enough room and it only looked bad because of my speed. I quickly got on the defensive and first tried to justify my actions. He said he sees me do this multiple times a week. He then says I go on the grass as if it's a major offence. I ended just saying ok to everything he said until he went away. He said he rides a bike and if I was tailgating him on the bike he would beat me. 

   His words quickly got to me. After he left I wanted to apologize but odds are I'll never see him again and it's killing me inside. I also want to improve my driving and not look like a maniac. How do I do this. I can't apologize to him as I don't know who he is. I'm sitting in my car typing this and I've already missed an hour of class, we're not doing anything important today anyways. I feel really bad. I'm reluctant to enter school now. I don't know what to do. I'm a bad driver but I like driving like this. I want to be known as a good driver. I really don't know what to do.

I am hoping to get help on this issue. My neighbor (he is about 75-80 yrs old) Has parkinsons, along with what seems to be a bit of Dimentia. He lives beside me in a triplex (alone, he lives in all three units). He has walked into my apartment a couple of times, which is fine... He is harmless. 

He has called the cops regarding imaginary situations (a dead girl in his home, someone stealing paintings.. etc). 

I asked him yesterday if he has anyone to live with or has any family and he said no. He isnt a poor man by ANY means, he owns a bunch of property in Toronto (The market is crazy right now). And he was a high up environmentalist in the government when he was younger. 

What on earth do I do? I feel responsible for him. Yesterday he lost his keys and we had to call a locksmith to pay for a new knob (My husband looked all over his apartment and found the keys, along with cash that could have paid- but we did).

Is there anyone who I can call? I have spoken with the police (not to report him coming into my home, but for advice), and they said no. Anyone?

169,"Hey everyone. There's a very controversial political speaker named Robert Spencer coming to my college tonight. He has a show called ""jihad watch"" and researches Islam and the potential dangers that come from terrorists (or at least that's what I got out of the videos I watched). I don't know much about the subject and don't really have a political swing.

There's something else happening at the same time tonight - the ""Muslim solidarity rally."" I think this is because Muslim students feel threatened that such an ideological and aggressive speaker is coming to speak. My first thought was ""rallies aren't that interesting, I'd rather go see someone speak who I may never see again.""

Here's the problem - 230 people are going to the rally. 23 people are going to watch Spencer. I'm not making these numbers up; yes it is exactly ten times the amount. And the people going to the rally are REALLY vigilant and strong in their belief, and I feel like if I go to watch the speaker I'll be shamed and hated (I might even be stalked, harassed, threatened, a lot of people at this school seem very strong in their beliefs).

If they weren't at the same time I could go to both but that's not an option.

Should I take the risk and listen to the speaker? Should I play it safe and try to enjoy the rally? Maybe just stay home?

Hi everyone. I need help. So, I'm a lightweight sleeper. I've been known to fall asleep during conversations (even if they're not boring) and I'm really not likely to stay up past midnight too often. It's always been a nuisance, especially as a college student, but in the past year or so I've become seriously concerned about my ability to drive while staying completely alert. 

There have been at least 5-7 different occasions where I've dozed off for 1-3 seconds on the road (which may as well be a full 9  hours when you're driving...) and woken up drifting into another lane. This past week though has been noticeably bad. In broad daylight, around 12pm-1pm or so, I'm fighting myself to keep my eyes open. It's frustrating and it's terrifying. 

I try to take every measure I can to keep myself awake-- AC is blasting or the windows are down, loud music is playing, I've even resorting to just flat out yelling and slapping myself and I still have trouble. 

I've been jokingly telling my friends that I'm gonna die in a car accident soon but honestly, seeing as my car (1989 Camry) doesn't have air bags or well-functioning seat belts on top of all this, I'm genuinely scared. What can I do? ",03May2017,1

To start I suffer with depression that stems from being alone. I have never been one to have a lot of friends but now it's starting to bite me in the ass. I have started this post several times but I just don't know how to go about writing this post. I just feel lost. 
Last year I went abroad and met someone I thought was perfect for me. She was the most incredible person I had ever met and we decided to be in a long distance relationship. It was a really long distance considering it spanned two separate continents. Everything has been fine for a while off and on troubles that every couple has. About 5 months after we had seen each other I start talking to a friend I had a huge crush on before I went abroad. She was having troubles with her current S.O. and I was there for my friend. I supported them and we became best friends. This was awesome. We had a great relationship for 4 or so months as friends. She helped me to feel less lonely with a LDR who lived so far away and was often too busy to talk. Now I have been planning to school for a whole year next year abroad and I will be close to my LDR but there is a chance that I won't get to go. I am waiting to here on my grade results which will decide whether I get to go or not. I don't get to find out my grades until next Thursday. Now is the part that's freaking me out. I have been planning to leave so I have been trying to make the transition easier. I have no back up plan for if I don't get to go. This friend is forming a romantic interest with someone new and I feel like I am loosing my best friend. I also am becoming extremely jealous and it's harming me. I think I have feelings for this friend.
So to clarify this post my problem is this. 
Either I breakup with my LDR and pursue my really close friend who I have a great relationship with but whom I will leave if I get to study abroad this next year the year they graduate. 
Or I let her go which is hurting me a lot and if I don't get to go study abroad will lose her as well because I cannot possibly go another year feeling like this so I will be completely alone.

187,"Before I'm going to tell you guys about my struggles for the past time, I have to tell you that it feels pretty daft to ask advice at all about this subject. I see that most people probably do not have the comfort to even worry about silly stuff like this, but I would still like to ask your opinion about it anyways. (I do understand though, if you DO find me silly. Just tell me to get over it, please don't be too harsh on me though if you do.)

Warning: I'm terrible at being concise when talking about these things, so sorry for hte long post.

I am going through my first year in a bachelor degree, and I've met a girl who lives pretty close (relatively speaking). Since the beginning of the year, we've travelled to and from school together when we could. We got introduced to eachother by a common friend, who also studies with us.

After some time, we got around to exchanging phone numbers, and without noticing it myself I sought contact with her alot. We ended up seeing a couple of movies together, and I eventually wound up falling in love with her. That feeling, however, was immediately accompanied by lots of anxiety and self-negativity.
The afternoon I first discovered my feelings for her, I noticed that she was anxious about something (or simply tired), and that instantly triggered the fear of *me* being the cause of her distress. As if I had wronged her in any way, or that I had been too clingy or something, I kind of blamed me for her feeling sad. 

This continued to have an effect for two months, where I was happy when I was around her and had the distraction of school, but could have terrible negative moods when I was home and alone with my thoughts (almost in a manic way). This started with simply crying alot but feeling better after some time, but it ended with periods of just wanting to be asleep, to not have to feel anything for a time anymore.

After this had gone on for a couple of weeks, I decided to try to tell her about how I was feeling (skipping the negative things though, I did not want to burden her with that). I confessed that I was in love, and she told me she only saw me as a friend and that she wasn't looking for a relationship to begin with (which I respect). 

At first I felt relieved, that I had told her about part of how I was feeling. After some time though, I started feeling numb again, and I decided I had to accept that I wasn't really going to be happy for the time to come. My grandfather died the past week, however, and at first I felt like I couldn't even feel grief for him, considering I had already felt so much negativity in the time before that. 

After the funeral, all the negative emotions that I had 'locked' away came out all at the same time. I felt terrible for more than half a week, but after this, I travelled with her to school again, and had a great time. I instantly felt that my positivity had renewed itself, and that I could work 'normally' again for some time. 

Now, one day later, I'm kind of struggling with what I should do. Every time I get closer to her again, I want to care for her, show her that I am still in love with her, and simply get closer to her. I do understand though that she just wants to be casual friends.

What a possible solution could be, is that I distance myself from her (but this is hard as it is, considering we share our studies and friend group). I'm afraid that I would not be able to stay positive if I choose for this though.


If you've made it so far, thanks for reading my venting. I'm sorry for spilling my heart out on a forum like this, but the only person it felt right to tell all of this to, is the girl I'm in love with. I'm afraid though, that it would overcomplicate our friendship, possibly ruining it. Apart from that, I believe that she probably has enough things of her own to worry about, so I don't want to be a bother either.
I would like to ask you on what you would do in this situation. Could any of you spare a minute to help me out?

Thanks in advance!",03May2017,2

191,"Backstory: I'm a guy, my friends a girl. I consider her one of my best friends. 
We were good friends in high school but didn't become close until she went away to college. We talk just about everyday now. We hang out whenever she's back home and sometimes she ends up staying the night at my house with us both sleeping in my bed.

I've always thought she was attractive, but after denying it for a long a time I've recently come to terms that I do have real feelings for her. I might even be falling for her. The problem is that because of the distance and other factors, it doesn't really seem like it could ever work out. Not to mention that I'm 99% sure has 0 feelings for me. Only reason I don't say 100% is because sometimes she says or does something that throws me off.

She's coming back home soon and I'm not sure what I should do. I don't want to lose our friendship so I don't see a point in telling her about how I feel as I figure it would only ruin what we have. At the same time, I know it's going to be really difficult being around her knowing that I feel this way.

Should just come clean and tell her the truth so that I can move past it? Or if I should start distancing myself from her? We do live far apart, so is it possible for us to continue being friends and that my feelings will fade over time?
Again, she's one of my best friends and I really cherish our friendship. I don't wanna lose that, but I also want to be fair to myself.",03May2017,5

It's a confusing situation, because I consider myself relatively good looking most of the time, and my social skills aren't bad either in most situations. But when I'm in my classes, I never talk. Never to one person, unless they talk to me. I have one class with a few really close friends, but other than that none at all. I think it's a mixture of me being nervous to talk, but also just complete disinterest. This leads me to feeling bad about myself, and feeling like a loser by the end of the day. All of these are pretty small issues in retrospect, but it affects my happiness and daily life significantly. Any advice or pep talking would be really appreciated. Thank you.",03May2017,2

202,"So, I'm not the greatest at being brief but here it goes.  I was (more on that later) a dual major in Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry at a large state school and was planning on going to medical school.  At the end of junior year, I had a GPA of 3.89.  Additionally, I had a 518 on my MCAT (about a 36 on the old scale for anybody unfamiliar with the new scoring).  In the summer between junior and senior year, I had jaw surgery for a pre-existing condition.  However, the recovery and the restricted diet took a greater toll and lasted longer than I expected.  As such, I returned to school without my usual energy (I had been running about 40 miles a week at the end of junior year).

The first semester of senior year was to be my most brutal yet, with 18 credit hours of senior engineering and science including 3 labs.  The coursework was alright, but the lab reports were beyond time-consuming.  I started into a vicious cycle of procrastinating, not getting enough sleep and not exercising, and staying up late to slowly churn through reports and homework.  I went from never having done an all nighter to doing 7 in one semester.  I ended the semester with a cumulative GPA of 3.69

On top of this, medical school applications were due at this time.  This is where some of my personality flaws really came to light.  I had real trouble asking for help (for anything) which may have made asking for recommendations letters difficult, especially since I had basically never said a word to most of my professors.  Additionally, I procrastinated pretty hard on the application itself because I could not stop thinking about everything I hadn't done  (my shadowing was/is pretty weak, my volunteering was strong but not a lot of face to face and no medical volunteering).  I eventually got it all done but was super late in the cycle, which was highly discouraged.  

Quite frankly, there were points during this time where I was suicidal.  I felt like I was drowning.  I would lay in bed at night thinking how much easier it would be if I just ended it.  Rough times. 

So moving onto winter break, I had just managed to lower my GPA 0.2 points in a single semester, gotten my first two C's, and had the uncertainty of those applications hanging over my head.  As stupid as it is, I was a little broken from the semester.  So even though the next semester was supposed to be super easy, relatively speaking, I was just absolutely exhausted.

When I came back to school, I found that I just couldn't work.  I procrastinated on everything, way more than I ever had.  When this inevitably resulted in a little anxiety, I would play video games to relax, except for hours at a time.  I got one interview for a medical school in February and my rejection email in March. I became depressed, and not the functionally depressed of the previous semester.  The sit in the dorm laying in bed/playing video games all day kind of depressed.  There were multiweek stretches where the only time I left my dorm room was to get food, which I only did once a day because doing it more was too much effort.  I didn't answer basically any communication, from class emails to friend's texts. Suicidal thoughts came and went. Again, rough times.

This brings us essentially to the present.  I'm going to fail a few classes (mostly one hours, fortunately) and I won't be graduating with my degree in Biochemistry, but I will have the degree in Chemical Engineering.  I have seen a doctor and am currently on a daily dose of escitalopram (SSRI).  As an additional plus, my parents are being very supportive, though I haven't informed them yet that I've actually failed classes.

The advice I'm looking for is where do I go from here?  I really do still want to go to medical school, but I need something to do in the interim, preferably something that doesn't make me a financial burden to my parents.  I am open to both grad school and a job, but I don't know how to sell to anybody that I just bombed the shit out of my last semester and still say ""I'm a good candidate for your company/school"".  Additionally, I'm really worried about how these grades will affect my future applications to medical school.  On top of all of that, my dad is pushing heavily for graduate school as the interim program, but seriously, how can I even get admitted?

Any help would really be appreciated, and I am open to most ideas.  Thank you all very much.",03May2017,3

212,"My stepkid is in 3rd grade. I'll acknowledge up front she is an overly sensitive child and she is an only child so may have trouble understanding petty kid behavior.

Two girls from her class have been making her life hell all year. It first started when I got a call from the teacher letting me know a kid had smeared cupcake frosting in her hair. Not nice. Then my child started skipping recess because the same girl was mean to her. I emailed the teacher about it and was told she would keep an eye on the situation and do better to include my kid in games. Cool. Things seemed okay but the girl and her best friend would whisper about my child and make her paranoid and tell everyone in the class not to be friends with her, spread rumors, that sort of thing. I told her to completely ignore them, but kids that age don't seem to possess the ability. I also spoke to her teacher about it during our parent-teacher conference. For awhile, every other week the girls would then befriend her, apologize to her and then drop her the next week. So I can see how the teacher could be confused about what is going on since they're tight one week and fighting the next. The school finally intervened and my child saw the counselor to talk about the way the girls have been treating her and the two girls were also talked to and told they do not have to be friends with my kid but they cannot be mean. Fine, I agree. This prompted the girls to tell my child they hate her and will never be friends again. Now they're doing mean things like telling her not to line up next to them and are still inciting other little girls to be mean to her. I've told my child she needs to report it when it happens, since she often does not and then tries to present a case against them later when she's had enough. The girls will also be nice to her for the day when they know she is close to telling so they won't get in trouble.

In some ways, my instincts tell me she needs to figure out on her own how to handle people who don't like her and to just be there for her to listen to her, explain to her what the girls seem to be doing (like befriending her to get her out of trouble) and offer solutions. But, I also feel like I should take a more direct approach and call a conference with the school. There are only a few weeks left and we're moving out of state this summer so at this point I'm just like meh.

213,"Just a little background on myself and life pretty much. I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I'm 23 years old. Back in highschool, I was going to join the national guard. Felt like an awesome idea and I was all in. Talked to a recruiter and was set up to go to MEPs. 

My parents were completely against it. Well, I should really say my mom was against it. My dad was kind of like ""meh, if that's what you want to do, then do it."" Being 17 at the time, I really cared about what my parents thought, and I didn't want my mom worrying about me, so I decided not to enlist. 

Fast forward a few years later to when I'm 19. I was thinking about joining the marines this time doing the MP. Again, I was set up to go to MEPs again. My girlfriend at the time (whom I loved dearly) pleaded me not to go. So I didn't. 

You see a trend here? I was so worried about what my friends and family thought, that I was willing to please them, even though it ended up doing something I didn't want to do. 

Now to 21 years old. My best friend, and I mean BEST FRIEND, joined the Air Force as an active duty load master. He fucking loves it. Gets to travel, financially stable and hes living out in California right now about to buy a house. Living in california was a big deal for us considering we were born and lived all of our lives in Delaware.

And now we are at the present. I like my job right now, but the pay in insanely inconsistent. I'm living with a family friend right now, and I just feel like my life is going down the shitter. I need to get away, pretty much wipe my slate out and start a new. I need some discipline and a kick in the ass to get my life back. I feel like the military can provide that to me and also being financially stable and traveling the world. Also, being able to serve my country would be an honor.

I don't really care what my parents think anymore and I'm single. I have nothing holding me back anymore. I seriously needed to sit down and realize that this is my life, and I will never be able to please anyone. So I've decided to go Air Force.

I know going to a recruiter for information would be an obvious option, but lets be honest, they are paid to sell the military to me. Of course he/she is going to make it seem glamorous. I talked to my best friend that in the air force already, and he's given me plenty of information to take away. But I want more opinions.

What am i supposed to do? Im honestly stuck. Ive never had this issue before, ive never really had to deal with emotions like this before. 

*side note:* yes this did happen imediently after a talk that some of you may know about, involving 3 years without sex with my gf. only saying that here because i know someone will ask",03May2017,1
235,"&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; So I started working at a fast casual restaurant in August of 2016 ( 9 months ago). Because of my work ethic and ability I was quickly promoted to manager in December 2016. My initial raise (50¢) kicked in January of 2017 along with the minimum wage raise for NY. In that same month, I was promoted to Assistant General Manager being given another 50¢ raise. 

&amp;nbsp;
   
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Now I know I am making good money for the time I have been with the company. But for the amount of work I have to do to keep my store running, I do not feel I am being paid enough for my efforts. My new GM ( started January) is not terrible but he is forgetful and I tend to do his job more often than my position dictates. 
For my efforts ( outlined in the comments) I feel I deserve another raise. Should I be asking for one even though I just got 2 in a 9-month span? I am looking for a 50¢ or a dollar raise nothing more.

&amp;nbsp;
     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Every time the District Manager ( the one who will have to approve my raise) comes in to visit the store on my shift everything is great besides one thing he finds every time. He then tends to dwell on that one thing saying I am not doing my job well. Even though on the other opening managers shift he would find a plethora of things being done or are wrong. My older GM openly said to him previous to his departure; I was the best manager this store has and to do what he can to not lose me because I am such a great asset to this store.

&amp;nbsp;
 
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; With all this being said:  Please lend any advice you have on going about this raise or if I should anyway. Thank you very much!",03May2017,1
237,"I'm 20 years old and a 4 year university studying Unmanned Aircraft. I originally thought I wanted to be a pilot so I got my private certificate and began college at this aviation University. After getting into it and really seeing what it was about, I'm not sure if commercial flying is for me. Sure maybe part 61 flying and just going up and dicking around is great but commercial flying is a whole different ballgame. I am about to fail my current flight course to seriously zero fault of my own, I've had almost 30 lessons cancelled due to maintenance and weather, and according to the administration here that is not a good enough excuse for an incomplete grade, so therefore I fail. I don't have the money to retake it again.

Ive always liked getting my hands dirty and fixing stuff, so I've thought about trade/mechanic of sorts but nobody in my family supports me in that because they all still think I have this undying passion for aviation, which I really don't. And even if I did, I don't think it's exactly wise to make a career out of your passion. My Universitys drone program requires you to get your multi engine commercial and instrument ratings, which I can't do and I can't afford at this point, and is unnecessary and excessive/overkill in my opinion. There is one other uni that offers a drone program 2 years that only requires a private pilot certificate, but it's 10 hours away from me.  I also really enjoy nature and being outside and wouldn't mind a job that I can run around in the woods all day long doing stuff.  My science skills are okay but my math is fucking terrible, I scraped by with a C in college algebra and a D in pre calc so that pretty much puts engineering off the table.

I need advice on what to do with my life, do I drop out of college and go to tech school? Feel free to ask questions sorry this is kind of a shitty explanation of the situation..

I'm already in a shit load of debt and if I quit now I can start paying it off without loading up on more debt and just get a job and start living my life..

244,"Hi, lately I've been ""dreaming/imagining"" things a lot more and when I think back on them I strongly believe that the thing I imagined really happened. The most recent example is I was imagining that I got the mail and I got mail from the IRS that i have been waiting for, only I don't think I actually got it yet. I don't know if i remember getting it, or remember imagining getting it. I've been looking for it for hours, throwing couch cushions and everything and i cant find it. On the weirder side of my imagination are imaginary people. I've always had fantasies about having a great boyfriend, mainly because i'm the shyest girl in the world who's 18 and has never even kissed a boy, but recently they've been more...impactful. For instance I usually stick with the same imaginary guy for a while in my imagination but for some reason I always make something bad happen in the daydream, even though I don't really think about it something always happens. The thing is, now it will actually upset me or ill be pacing in the kitchen having a conversation with someone who isn't actually there. The guy who I think about now is a guy i saw walking past me the other day when I was walking to the LIRR and when I saw him I imagined a world where I had a burst of confidence and actually talked to him. Then the whole ride home i  made him a personality and everything. I also find myself talking to these imaginary people in public now too. I have my headphones in so people think i'm on the phone but I don't know why I keep doing it. Everytime a guy actually ask me out I think the worse and I'm too nervous to actually talk to them anyway even though I really want to. Im working on my confidence level but I want to stop having imaginary conversations with ""future mothers in laws"" and going to fake company dinners in my head.

245,"Hey everyone,

I'm a marketing student who applied to 4 intern positions within a very large sports marketing/sponsorship company (they hire interns for minimum wage but the company is global and very well known). Definitely a great ""foot in the door"".

I felt I had a strong resume (good past internships) compared to other applicants (I know the type of people who apply). I answered the application questions well.

I only heard back from 1/4 positions I applied to. I reached out to the HR Generalist who handles the internships too, and she said as out yet, there was no response from the other managers.

I applied April 11

Heard back 15 days later after I emailed asking, and the HR person said there was that 1 department who was interested, but no response from the other managers. I said I would wait for a response, but it's been about a week since then.


Should I follow up again asking about the other positions? I would reach out to the managers directly but I wouldn't know who they are.

246,"I've been working as a Process Technician at a manufacturing job for 2 years now. Despite never being late or calling in, I still feel like some of the Supervisors don't respect me. I'm a young girl new to the industry. Before I had only worked as a cashier in fast-food. I feel like no matter how hard I work, it doesn't matter because I have A.D.H.D, anxiety, am easily overwhelmed and not as smart or quick to catch on as everyone else there.

I'm sure some of it is in my head, but there's no denying the exasperated sigh when I come to her with another question, the awkward tension between us, and the sudden change in her voice whenever she has to talk to me. It sounds like talking to me is the most intolerable thing in existence. It's not like I'm some irresponsible employee that's constantly messing up. I barely ever make a mistake.

My parents are supportive, if a little wary, but I know I can do this.

Basically, I'd like whatever tips anyone may have to keep myself safe and prepared. Last time I flew was with my mother when I was very young, and since then I know lots of things have changed with security considering world events. What do I expect at the airport? On the flight? What do I avoid bringing with me in my bags to avoid being stopped at customs? Are toiletries like shampoo and such allowed to be packed in the suitcase? Is there anything I should know beforehand that might not be obvious to someone who's not flown since the early 2000's?

A few times my boss corrected her work, and she flied off the handle about ""how he was rude to her"", how he was ""a pain in the ass for correcting stupid sh*"" (she's lazy and her work quality is very low), and so on.

Bottom line, anything that puts her in a bad position (directly or indirectly) makes her angry and starts gossiping. Now, the problem while dealing with her is that she also expects you to be ""friendly"" (in her head, friendly = ready to help her with work no matter what) as well as expecting to get away with unprofessional behavior (like messing around with facebook or chatting instead of working because she thinks she can get away with it by getting help later on.

One of the girls told me she actually hates the job and constantly chats with them on private, and she can afford it because there's a guy always helping her because he thinks she really needs help. She also said she tells them stories half way so that her ""current target"" looks bad...

262,"I sometimes take this supplement called 5-htp. It's usually for those that have some mild form of depression. When I take it, I enjoy life just a little more, savoring every human connection a little more, studying is a tad more fun, I have much more fun at parties, I become more fun to other people, I actually connect with others more deeply, I feel like I think more in depth, I am more confident, etc. I just give a lot more shits about things in general. If life without it is an 8/10, life with it is a 9.5/10. (I'm a generally optimistic person).

I have taken ecstasy a large number of times in my life. I'm not too sure if this has lowered my ""baseline level of life enjoyment"", and that 5htp raises me back to ""normal"", or the 5htp increased my life enjoyment overall.

265,"Hello.


Currently living at a motel for two days that my sister rented for me online, and using this time to try to relax and recover from a rather terrible past few days.


On Sunday morning, my dad kicked me out of his house, and I had no place to go.  I went to an old neighbors in the country to stay a couple days, explain my situation, and basically prepare for the future.


Monday, I went to the city, spent most of my day with my laptop in a public library, updated my resume, went to two contractor websites and tried to apply to a few things, reached out to an old contracting company I worked for, asked for some contacts where I am currently at, and tried to square away some loose ends.  I slept in my car in a parking lot, but I have a back injury that made me essentially lay in my car in writhing pain for hours before around 4AM, I went into Walmart and asked for help finding a homeless shelter, somewhere I could try to sleep.


I need a job/employment, but I am unsure I could even hold a rudimentary job such as fast-food as while standing in line to get some money my sister sent me for food/fuel for my car, I almost had to drop to a knee after 5 minutes from searing pain and when I finally got to the head of the line, I had to rest heavily on the counter with a leg out just to find some relief while this was taken care of.


I'm trying to suck up the pain, but being unable to get any proper rest, having no job and barely able to stand for long periods of time makes me unsure I can even get a job, which makes me scared of the fact I may be sleeping in my car until I completely run out of money and the entire thing has me spiraling into the dreaded ""unable to do anything"" state I am in now.


So I am reaching out here.  I've got maybe three resumes out online for tech desk type jobs where I can sit, and once I can get enough strength/wait for the pain meds to go to the library, I want to print more resumes and apply for some positions at banks  locally, hopefully something I can do sitting.


I'm just in a situation where I am bordering on homeless and penniless, I want to work, I would take a job anywhere, but I can barely function.  I don't even know what I should do to seek medical help properly, and then someone off-handedly commented that I should consider disability, which while a blow to my pride, after being unable to sleep again last night, I am now seriously considering.

Writing and photography mainly. Only problem is I have almost zero motivation. I take lithium daily and I smoke weed almost as much. Neither of which I think to be the issue of my stuckness, but what do I know? Not much that's for sure. I guess what I'm asking is how do I get unstuck in life? How do I force myself to do things that I love. Like I bought quite a few books over the past few months and have read but one of them. They bore me. One was to help me hone my skills as a writer, but so many things just bore me and I don't know how to get motivated. I don't want to read some motivational pictures. I hate those. They don't work. Nor do motivational speeches. I don't need someone with no arms or legs to tell me that life is beautiful and I should feel lucky and all that bullcrap.

How can I break free from my mundane life? How can I or what can I do to make a drastic change I have no choice but to follow through with. I have some money. Not enough to just up and move. I do want to make a change. Like I want to go to school, but I have no help to do so. I don't know where to start or what to do in school.

And the cycle begins again. I always finish the work early and the lecture is usually just correcting the worksheets that I already finished and I know are correct.

271,"Okay, so my prom is in one week, and I was asked two or three weeks ago to prom by this senior guy (I'm a junior girl). I barely knew him, but we talked a few times in class and he was pretty cool so I was like sure, why not. I now know that he liked me and kind of wanted to go like romantically but my friend told him that I just thought we were going as friends and he said okay. 

Also, as a note, I'm really shy at school and everyone knows me that way. No one expected me to say yes, and he knew very well that I was likely to say no. I actually wasn't even going to go to prom at all before he asked me, and he knew that. He brought a poster and flowers and stuff and asked in front of the class. Now I feel kind of weird about that because I feel like he did that to pressure me into saying yes.  

I went to get ice cream with him once because he asked and I figured we should get to know each other better. But now it's getting complicated. First of all, he keeps asking me to go with him to get pizza or something on Saturday. I said I was busy because I was hanging out with my friends but he kept asking and saying for me to tell my friends that I can't and it got to the point where I yelled at him ""No, stop"" because he was getting on my nerves so badly. I'm not sure if he means for this to be like a date but it kind of feels weird and I wouldn't want to go even if I wasn't busy. 

We also talked about where we would sit and he was like ""well, I was going to sit with my friends.."" but then we talked a bit and he said it was totally okay to sit with mine. But then when it came time to pick tables, he said that he had a few friends who wanted to sit with us, but there wouldn't be room so some of my friends ""would have to go."" He said it with no sympathy and it was rude. My friends and I said, no, you can't kick them out. But when it came time for picking tables he chose his friends anyway. He also lied to me about this beacuse he said they had no where else to sit, but it turns out they told him they didn't want to sit there but he put them there anyway, and now they left the table anyway.

Also, I really don't want to drive with him in his car alone because it's like an hour drive and I feel so uncomfortable at this point. But I feel like that is what we will be doing and I don't want to.

And also, he came up to me and was like ""hey, you know how to dance right"" and I was like, ""um no"" and he was like ""you better be ready because we are going to spend the entire night on the dance floor."" and I was like, ""um, no,"" and he was like ""it's fine, its not hard to dance, just move to the rhythm."" Like, what? I don't want to dance because I just don't, leave me alone.

Also, he doesn't seem to take the hint when I want him to go away. I know this makes me sound like a bitch, but I was internally freaking out over a personal problem in lunch and he started asking me things and I said ""I don't know"" and ""no"" in the way that is an obvious conversation ender and I kept turning away but he kept going.

I can't really explain it without it making me sound like a bitch though, but I'm actually really nice to him in general. And he isnt like a horrible jerk guy or anything. But he is really pushy and I feel like he thinks he can take advantage of me because I'm shy and awkward and polite. It might be unintentional, I think he really just likes me but he doesn't know how to try to get a girl without treating her like an object. He's also awkard, but outgoing. I wish I had seen this pushy side of him before I said yes, because I really regret it now to be honest.

Here's the thing though: I can't say no, I don't want to go with you anymore, anymore. It's too late, prom is a week from tomorrow. Don't get me wrong, I'm not uncomfortable because I think he is going to have sex with me or anything, because I don't think he would do that. But he might have the wrong idea and expect a relationship or a kiss or something. And I don't think he is a very good person because I feel like he is doing whatever will get him what he wants, he even lied to me about his friends. Also, it might be awkward because we still don't know each other very well. What about slow dances? Oh god.

So I've been thinking about texting him and telling him seriously that if he doesn't want to go to prom with me, he doesn't have to, and I will give him the money that he spent on my ticket. I want to  basically let him know that:

1. this is only as friends, 2. Im not going to dance and if he expects that in a date then he shouldn't take me, (he should have known this when he asked me, I'm not going to change who I am for prom and him) and 3. that if he really wants to sit with his friends he can do that and we can just not go together anymore. 

Would this be mean or crazy? Would this be making drama out of nothing? Or would this add tension to our relationship and make it less of a friend thing and more of a romantic thing? I have never been in a relationship, nor have I ever had a guy friend. So obviously, I'm not very well versed in what is and isn't considered or supposed to be romatic. I also don't want to lead him on. So with that all being said, what do you think I should do? Should I send that text or just let things go as they are? At this point I can't wait until prom is over so I don't have to worry about it or him ever again. Sorry this post is so long, I can't help but write novels every time I ask for advice.",03May2017,1
273,"Ok, here's the thing. 
My relationship has been falling apart for a while now. I am pretty sure my boyfriend no longer loves me and everything I keep trying to fix in myself backfires on me. He does nothing but treat me like garbage. Which has ruined my self esteem. I wanted us to go our separate ways and actually told him that, but he made me stay. Now I feel foolish and even more emotionally abused. 
My health has started detiriorating as well. And I have hit a plateau with my weight loss (I am about 12-15 pounds heavier than perfect and I am tall). I have been super low carb - and nothing. I constantly have a debilitating headache, other than the broken heart. My blood pressure has always been very stable and it has dropped dangereously. I have been extremely busy at work Monday to Friday and then Masters degree classes over the weekend + working out 4-5 times a week.
I am starting to think that there is something extremely wrong with me. Inherently wrong with me. I am very overwhelmed and unhappy lately, when I have usually always been positive and upbeat.

Do you guys have any advice? Where do I begin the fixing process? I am really hurting and desperate. It has felt like a long uphill losing battle to win his love back. Is that normal? Do couples go through that sort of thing? This shaking off the foundations or am I just stupid to be staying? It is the only serious relationship I've had this far and I just really dont know what to do. Could I be seriously ill?

Any advice would be helpful and appreciated. I feel like I am dying, physically and emotionally. ",03May2017,3
274," Ok so I'm gonna tell you about my shitstorm of a high school expirience to see if there is any hope left for me. K so to start off I've dreamed of going to UF since I was 7 years old, fell in love with the school and that has been my goal, but I took resposability too late. When I was in 9th and 10th grade I mostly didn't study for exams and about 50% failed those exams, so I haven't always had the best grades. I'm in 11th right now with 2 weeks left, my grades for the 3rd trimester were pretty good (only having like 1 C and the rest A's and B's) but the first semester was horrible, mostly C's and D's, and that was only this year. I was a horrible student, kinda still am. I'm very lazy and only recently (since january) I've had motivation to get good grades. I don't think I'll get in any universities with this, but I need to know if there is atleast some hope. 

P.S. If this helps, I was captain of my volleyball team in 10th and probably going to be again for 12th. I play in a club outside of school and do jiu-Jitsu as a secondary sport. I would like to get into UF for enviromental science.",03May2017,1

280,"So I'm a senior in high school and two months ago I got my license. I take the bus to school and back but the bus doesn't always show up in the afternoon for the ride home. That's the main reason why I want to drive on my own, so I can get home around 3:15 rather than 5:00, waiting for them.  It's an hour to walk home. 

They have three cars so one is always not in use. The only way I can drive is with them in the car, despite having a license. 

A week ago, I asked my mom when my dad was out for a business trip to use the car however she said we would need my dad here to make that decision. 

He came back two days ago and today I realized my bike tire needed a new tube in my tire. I asked today if I could drive on my own to the bike shop as my mom had to run an errand and my dad was jetlagged. I thought a five minute errand wouldn't be a bad idea. (I ride my bike every where and I need it to get around, especially now since I am not allowed to drive on my own) I was wrong, my dad thought I was asking to just walk and when I explained what I meant my mom immediately interjected saying she could take me, they ended up deciding that we could go Saturday. 

My parents are very busy all the time and therefore driving allows me to get places without waiting for them all the time.  I go to the gym every day, hang out with friends on the weekend, and go to school and back, and I have to wait twenty minutes extra to be picked up, despite giving them advanced notice. (They forget that I'm at the gym)

I have asked my parents several times before why I can't. I want to know what I can improve on to drive on my own.  They always respond to just give it some time or they can't think of something to improve on after I just drove with them. 

 How do I convince my parents to let me drive on my own. They said they wouldn't even let me drive on my own even if I had my own car.  I had to pay for my insurance.",03May2017,1

283,"Okay. Soo, like I said in the title, I am asking for advice. 

Specifically, the problem is my mom wants me to resume communicating with my father. 

We live in the same house, but have not talked to each other for a couple of years, initially because of a petty argument (I honestly don't remember much). Another excuse was my father's speciality is to make verbal fights out of absolutely anything. These fights would escalate very quickly into violence, insults and even extreme threats. 

At a certain point in my life, I realised I had a choice. And so I continued avoiding communication with him in order to avoid these unnecessary situations (I had school to focus on). I also began to remember things that he had done to me as a pre-teen/early teen, that I had forgotten. Simply calling my father an asshole is a gross understatement.

Not talking to him, and not making any eye contact/looking in his direction (if we are in the same room) has been a very convenient solution. I discussed (with my mom ofc) that I do not feel comfortable trying to make small talk with him. I feel that it is highly inappropriate for her to keep pushing me to do so since I had thoroughly explained my situation. I understand that my mom is the mediator in the family and I love her so much but I can't. He dismisses that he hurt me when I was a pre-teen/early teen, saying that he doesn't remember. Inconveniently, I have no proof to defend my claim. I may not exactly remember what happened that began this whole thing, but I remember enough that I'm not going to say that nothing happened. I'm pretty sure if I hypothetically harmed someone and it was premeditated, I would remember at least something.

I would feel better if he apologised for at least some of the wrongs he's done as a mature adult to his child, or even just all of his family in general. I would feel better if he said that he was willing to change and fix our family. We could be happy as a family for once, but I realise now, that it all starts with him making that initial connection.

Paying for a therapist is an option that I discussed with my mom. We've also discussed very possible unfortunate situations that can happen to our family in the near future. Since we are inconveniently financially reliable on him, the fear of losing literally everything is a realistic possibility. Currently, I am on summer break and looking for a job. However, I am in college and paying that off and completely affording for a new place (hopefully with the help of a trusting partner), will take time. My mom keeps reminding me that he complains about work every week (cause he is tired and old) and how he will quit and leave us. I begin to worry. I need a solid ten years to finally be financially independent. But what about my younger brother? He will need more time because he's younger and has a learning disability. And my mom? She says she's too old and unskilled to afford for herself and us. She says that she will probably leave to her family overseas and live on a farm somewhere.

Since there are not that many adults in my life that I can freely talk to about this matter, I was wondering if anyone who has been in a similar situation can help me? Thanks.",03May2017,2
285,"Male, 23 My girlfriend (19) of 2 years (known each other for 5 years) broke up with me on Feb 28, I was having a hard time, then I was kind of okay but now I'm back to being devastated. I feel depressed, I want to disappear, and let's just say hygiene is not something I want to deal with at the moment. Her reason for our break up was that she wasn't happy being in a relationship but she still loves me and cares and would love to still have me in her life. She said shes not interested in anyone nor did she break up with me to get into another relationship. We still text and I'm trying to be her friend but since it was her decision, shes totally fine and I'm broken. She still tells me she loves me, she wishes me almost everyday to have a wonderful day and we still kiss when we see each other. I am confused, I'm not her so all of this doesn't make sense to me. Our break up wasn't bad, I don't hate her, I never felt like she didn't love me, she just didn't want to be in a relationship and that's what hurts so much. She's an indecisive person who often doesn't know what she wants. She's young and she seems to want to experience life before settling down and half of me gets that but half of me doesn't. I'm young too but I had no problem with it. Her mom loves me and after our break up she asked me if we could remain friends, I've known her brother since high school, this is how I've known her for so long and before dating we were really good friends. Anyway thank you for reading, I'd appreciate advice or maybe if someone has gone through what I'm going through, what did you do? Thank you in advance.

286,"My senior year of high school, I got a new math teacher. He was fresh out of college, a kind of awkward guy, and thanks to me being a right little teacher's pet we became pretty close. I had a kind of shitty home situation so I often volunteered to stay after school and help out with random stuff like filing and making copies to avoid going home. I ended up in his classs both semesters and we talked a lot about life and school and everything. Me being who I am, I ended up with a bit of a crush. 

I never acted on it or anything, and tried my best not to look into anything he said as a sign that he would be into me, though there were a few. I dropped hints near and there I guess, but I'm a pretty flirtatious kind of person so it may or may not have gone unnoticed. 

It's been four years since graduation and the other day I noticed several of my old classmates are Facebook friends with him. I sent him a request and he accepted it.

He is on the spectrum, which I think may be part of why he refuses to see a doctor. (he gets irrationally worked up over certain things). He is terrified of doctors/hospitals, and I think deep down he is scared of what he might find out if he goes for a physical.

295,"tldr: you can ignore the story. The worst part of being lied to/tricked is the bad feeling from being taken advantage of. I can't stop feeling terrible or thinking about it. How do I get over it?





It was an apartment broker. I just sent an application in for an apartment. 

First, the guy lied about there not being other apartments. He said that the apartment he was showing me was the only one available. There was another apartment that was cheaper and had a better location(it recently got added online). I called them later pretending to be someone else and they said that this better apartment is available.


Then when I showed interest in that apartment (didn't check online listings), and was about to apply for the apartment, I didn't have the funds with me at the moment to put down the deposit so I said I would come back tomorrow to get the application in. He then lied to me about how someone who previously saw the apartment just scheduled another appointment. I got worried that they would take the apartment, so I spent an hour finding every dollar I had, doing weird bank transfers (because of withdrawal limits) in order to get enough for the deposit so the other person didn't take the apartment. He probably didn't want me finding the other apartment on the website.

I didn't think to ask about the other person when I came back to sign the application and give them the money and he just pretended like he didn't even say that. I'll lose the deposit if I back out of the application and ask to see the other apartment.

All in all, I lost $1200 ($100 more per month than the other apartment) and have a slightly worse apartment.

Not the end of the world but the feeling of being lied to and tricked is disgusting and makes me feel terrible and angry for some reason. I can't stop thinking about it and it hurts (in an emotional sense) more than every other emotion (other than getting rejected or grief/loss)",03May2017,1

300,"I'm wondering whether anyone can give me advice on my future plans for university studies, work, and becoming less socially isolated since recovering from mental illness.

I graduated high school in 2011 when I was 16, with high SAT scores and AP test scores, and had a full scholarship to attend a state university. I was pretty academically successful, but I had been struggling with depression since childhood with a history of abuse (not just my words, but this is how a few different therapists and social workers described me). I was in school for 2 semesters, had poor grades, was unable to control my sleep, diet, hygiene, had panic attacks, attempted suicide twice. I left school after being hospitalized and since then I've been slowly recovering. It's taken years to get healthy again; I've gone through many physicans and psychologists, different medications and therapy, and only in the past six months or so have I been able to even hold down a full time job and eat regularly.

The point is now I'm wondering where do I go from here. It seems to me like I have a few problems to deal with at once, so I'll do my best to outline them:

1: How to I return to a competitve academic environment? I still have some student debt from after I lost my scholarship and some medical debt, and I don't know how that will impact whether I can return to school. I don't know whether I should retake tests like the SAT. I don't know how I can demonstrate to universities that I can be productive and healthy. In an effort to be productive, I've taken up writing pretty seriously, with a few short stories published and plans to publish a novel in the next year, but I don't know how that might look to any universities, meaning I don't know whether that's a good use of my time if my long-term goal is to reattend universities. I could attend a local community college, but I fear that that might not give me the experience or the environment that I'm looking for and would probably be a waste of time and money, since I'd probably have to pay for it myself. Finally, I don't have any idea of what financial aid would look like for a returning student. Perhaps this is something I should contact schools for.

2: In the meantime, how should I go about finding stable employment? Most of the jobs I've worked since I've left school have been odd jobs or seasonal work, and all of it too low-paying for me to live on my own (I live with my mother now). My city hit 20% unemployment in 2014, and most of the young educated people have left for better opportunities. I'm concerned I won't be financially self-sufficient for years unless I return to school.

3: We moved around a lot when I was a kid and I don't have much in the way of social support or many friends, and this concerns me because it could be dangerous if I fall back into depression with no social support. I have a few passions (writing, a few sports), but there's not much of a network near me, probably because of the unempoyment situation. Also, I'm concerned I won't even have money to spend to engage with lots of other people socially, since my work situation is unstable. I've thought about using an online therapy service (I don't see a therapist now) to try and find more specific help with this and how it might tie in with my depression, but I don't know whether that's the right idea.

I think I've been isolated for a long time and don't have much of an idea for how to achieve my goals given my situation. Perhaps it's a mental maturity thing, but I just can't seem to figure out the right way to go about these things, and I'm concerned about the lack of stability in my life.

I feel like this was a rant, and some of it might sound confusing, but I could use any advice I can get, and if anything does sound confusing, tell me and I'll try to clarify. Thanks ",03May2017,1
304,"I have moved to London from the other side of the world. I've been working here in my industry for about 1.5 years. Initially it was hard to get a job in the industry and fit in, especially with the Job/Accomodation/Bank account rigmarole that any newcomer to the UK will know. 

Now, I have been at my current job for a year and I have been offered a promotion. My work has a HR policy to advertise all promotions as a new job opportunity, offering it externally as a 'fair' and balanced process. Almost always its for an employee whom is getting promoted and they need to interview X amount of candidates for said position. I've always hated this and feel bad for the interviewee, particularly when you know they basically have no chance. This time it was me getting the promotion. Being a small team I naturally heard from my colleagues of the external candidate, and heard how the interview went etc. Apparently he was nervous (as we all can be) and I've been told he was quite talented but couldn't sell himself very well. 

But the killer was hearing about the guy and his background. He too has recently moved to London from the same country where I am from and it reminds me so much of myself from 1-2 years ago- I just feel for him. 
I feel bad that he was used to tick a box for my benefit, sure all interviews are good training and give us more confidence but as we are both similar in background and career choice I really feel for the guy. I feel like I want to reach out from my personal email and just explain that I have been where he is right now and know its hard at the start (isolation, job prospects, financial pressures) but it does get better. Really, I feel like I owe the guy a beer or something! Even if its just for a chat about the industry. 

If I did do this should I be honest about HR's policy? It does feel like its not my place to tell him, but I feel like it would give him more confidence knowing it wasn't his nervousness/interview that didn't get him the job.

Is this a weird/not the right thing to do? It is a bit out of HR's comfort zone knowing I myself as a candidate is emailing this person let alone knowing of his identity. But if somebody had reached out to me when I was in this situation I feel like it would of given me the confidence boost to push through. Its hard as I know so many of the struggles he is going through right now. The comradely from our country is very strong and I feel like I should help him out.

Obviously I don't want to upset this guy as I do have the job, nor do I want to be unprofessional or do anything that could jeopardise my position or HR's current job strategy.

Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated.",03May2017,1
305,"TL;TR: Do I pursue my more primal inner desires or more logical inner desires? 

So I live in a small rural town where,  unless you're re retiring there, there is no future. So I'm looking into joining the Air Force and one of the benefits of joining is that I'll be able to move out of this dead end town and once I leave the Air Force be able to go anywhere I want.  

I fell in love with the SERE Specialist position within the Air Force. They will teach/train me how to survive anywhere, all I have to do is teach that same information to others. A very fair trade in my opinion.  

However, I know that making it a career out the Air Force in SERE is not going to be the best option. 

Eventually I'd also like to learn how to fly.  And if I ever get my own helicopter or plane, I'd like to save money by doing my own maintenance and repairs. So there is a position within the Air Force is repairs and maintenance of Air crafts. 

So I'm worried that if I pursue my current desire of being a SERE Specialist, I won't have a steady career after I leave the military. And I'd like to have something to fall back on. 

I also plan on going to school at the same time I'm serving my country. Being in maintenance is almost guaranteed to be 9-5 / 7-3. Which would allow me a good amount of time to take classes. With the SERE position as I understand there will be times where you won't have long work weeks. And other times where you're gone a few weeks and basically working 24/7. But I also feel I will never be truly accomplished unless I know how to survive any situation.

I previously lived with my emotionally abusive dad and recently reached my tipping point and had to move in a rush. I'm now suffering some fallout in terms of anxiety/depression.

I have had partners in the past and have done everything except going all the way with sex. The problem is yesterday I was noticing that my erections were not as hard and did not last as long as they usually do. Prior to this they were completely fine and this came very suddenly. I was able to masturbate and ejaculate fine yesterday and today but I noticed that at the entire time it was only about 70-80% as hard as I usually get.

Trying to maintain some anominity, but I work in science and just resigned. I think I'm a horrible fit for this type of work. I don't have anything lined up but have some experience in writing, etc. So I'm going to try and do that. 

Long story short, my boss and another co-worker found an error in a piece of work of mine that is pretty serious. I bet if I wasn't resigned I would be fired.

I don't know whether to stay and try to resign with dignitiy and professionalism or if I should just turn in my badge tomorrow. I feel like I don't owe them anything, I didn't really like some people on the team and I'm not really interested in the stress.

I think it will be a pretty unpleasant work environment for the next two weeks. If finances weren't a problem what would you do? Would you give two weeks for an environment where you would be miserable, especially if you have plans to go into another field?",03May2017,2
313,"Should I put much stock into really negative online reviews regarding a complex I will be moving into soon? There are plenty of great reviews where residents claim they don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. My friend told me, that from personal experience, most people who leave those reviews are those who did not get security deposits back.

I just get worried about reviews that bring up roaches or mice. Has anyone has an experience like this where they rented a place that turned out to be great but reviews said otherwise?",03May2017,1

315,Basically I have clinical OCD so I need to know if my logic is rational or not. I had to move back into my parents house temporarily and they moved my furniture in the garage. They usually keep the trash in the garage but I told them it would contaminate my furniture so I said to keep it outside. Today I walked in the garage and it was RANCID in there with the trash right next to everything. The fumes made me dizzy so i assume there's something in the air that  can get into my mattresses and stuff. Is this correct? As of now I plan on not using anything they stored in the garage anymore because they are contaminated with germs. Is this accurate? Thanks!,03May2017,2
316,"I work at a small small company. I am the only female ""tech"" right now- the only other women work in the office, separate from me and the guys. I hope that will put everything into context. 

I was talking in a group with four guys and some how sex shops came up, and then sex toys. I had seen a very funny video advertising a fleshlight (nothing graphic) so I showed it to the group. We all had a good laugh about the ""teledildonic"" connectivity the product boasted. 

Then a coworker turned it on me. He started saying that they would find me, implying that I would have a dildo in me and I would be orgasming, with my eyes rolled back, drooling after getting a phone call. I started getting uncomfortable and looking at the ground in silence. 
Then he repeated it but added that I would be connected to the alarm system, just going crazy [with orgasms[, and he even pantomimed me shaking, again saying my eyes were rolled back in my head and I was drooling. 
I felt really violated. He didn't only make it personal, he went so far! And in front of four coworkers! I was embarrassed and felt alienated. 

Later that day I couldn't stay silent so I found him alone and told him that I felt like the joke went too far. He was really defensive and surprised. I told him I knew he didn't mean it to be mean or anything but it made me uncomfortable, as I didn't want my coworkers thinking about me like that, and he apologized if it seemed ""skeezy"" but it seemed rushed and insincere. 

So now I've committed to only having appropriate conversations at work and retreated a bit with my friendliness to this guy, but I don't know if I need to do more. We don't have an HR person, but maybe I should just put something on the record with our controller? It feels wrong to do nothing, but I don't want to overreact. 

I just think if it happens again it would be helpful to already have a formal record. I don't know. I hope I won't get hate for this post. I just want to come to work and feel comfortable. ",03May2017,0
