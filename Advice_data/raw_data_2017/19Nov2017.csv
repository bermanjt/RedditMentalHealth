1,"Happened about an hour ago and I’m so shaken that I don’t know what to do, our two German shepherd puppies (not really puppies now, and huge, about 10 months old) killed our 8 year old cat

I don’t know what our family should do with them, we have two other cats in the house and I don’t want the same fate for them, we’ve had all these cats since 2009-2010 and just recently got the puppies. 

The puppies would chase the cats but we never actually thought they would hurt them in any type of way and we’ve been trying to remedy the chasing behavior since we’ve had them, to no avail.. 

Any type of advice would help.. ",19Nov2017,9
3,"We clicked immediately and talked for nearly one hour without having to stop and think of one thing to say. It was wonderful! She was very attractive, and had friends in the town I grew up in as well (only about thirty minutes away from where I live now). She visits there often. We're the same age, and shared a great deal in common. It felt as if I were on an extremely good first date. I wasn't drunk or stoned either. I was stupid though, and opened a new tab to look for a song on youtube. Chatspin fucking froze! I must have nexted about 70 people before I gave up on trying to get her back. I never even got her name... What should I do Reddit? Is it a lost cause? I gave her my band's website so there is a way for her to contact me thankfully. Pretty farfetched though I know.",19Nov2017,3
4,"Hello everyone i want to start by saying I know next to nothing about music or instruments, but i was intrigued by a piece of music i heard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfAunZPArkg) and now that I have a bit of money I was considering taking playing the guitar as one of my new hobby's. If possible i need to know what type of acoustic guitar would be the best and also what strings i should buy etc... i'm really happy to be taking this up as a hobby all I need is some info and suggestion :) thank you!

5,"I know this post isn't as serious as the other ones, but still I need advice. So my parents have been pissing me off. The only time we have speaker today is them yelling at me to do my chores, and I am beginning to feel more like a slave then their child. Should I make them see they are annoying by skipping out on decorating the Christmas tree? Not that they'd probably care, I am more wondering if I should give in to doing that to make me feel like I am doing something. Or should I just suck it up and join my family for dinner and the Christmas shinnanigans?",19Nov2017,1
8,"I have a truly toxic family and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m almost 18 years old so I plan on moving out as quickly as possible because I just feel upset &amp; sad every single day when I’m at home. It seems like anything I do I’m always a disappointment to them. I can truly say that I’m a good kid. I’m all about school, I respect what they say to me (sometimes), I don’t do drugs, &amp; etc. I’m pretty much a loner. They don’t like that I don’t really communicate with them &amp; I’m always in my own bubble but the only reason is because they tell my business to literally everyone. They always say how I’m such a lazy person, that I’m going to grow up to be ungrateful &amp; more stuff. This isn’t something you want to hear every single day. If they ask me to do chores I will do them but somehow I always end up being the bad guy. They also ALWAYS ALWAYS doubt or have suspicions about what I say to them. Like especially when I ask to go out they never believe what I tell them. They say that I’m out to do drugs or other stuff. I’m not that type of person at all. All they ever do is sit in the living room &amp; talk about me &amp; all the  “bad things” I do. I usually don’t talk back &amp; let them to their shit but when I get fed up I do talk back especially when they try accusing of things that aren’t even true. What should I do about this? should I just wait it out &amp; let them talk their shit or should I actually say something to them?(even tho it feels like no matter the times I tell them something they don’t get it &amp; keep doing it anyway) ",19Nov2017,1
9,"Here i go, just gonna be honest. I'm pretty poor, I have a good job but all my money goes to student loans. I already got forbearance on them once so i can't do it again. My family is also too poor to help.

Diet: I eat usually 0 or 1 times a day. By that I mean an actual meal. Even if I don't have a meal, I usually snack on junk food. My 1 meal a day usually is either chicken and steamed veggies or pasta with butter and cheese, that's all I have the energy and know how to make. Sometimes I take multivitamins too but that's rare. I don't have the spare income to get extra ingredients and I make too much money on paper to qualify for food stamps. Also, I usually can't eat unless I've smoked weed.

Exercise: I sit down on my job. I game and watch shit in my free time. So I sit or lay down 23.5 out of 24 hours of the day. I think I have a gym membership since my mom works at the hospital, but I never have the energy to go.

Social life: I have friends and even females who are into me, so healthy sex life but I've been burning all those bridges cause I never feel like going out.

Living quarters: I live in the basement (I'm 23 so that's sad in itself) and there was a flood so there's mold down there. We can't afford to have someone come remove the mold, although we did tear up the moldy carpet. I'm afraid this mold is the one responsible for taking over my brain and sapping my energy.",19Nov2017,2

12,"Hey. My name is Oliver, and I'm fourteen years old. I'm somewhat of an old soul, in the sense that I've never really fit in with the kids in my age group. I'm not a competitive person, at all. So I don't like sports. I'm pretty much unable to take competition seriously. If someone's being aggressive about an issue that doesn't warrant aggression, like a sports game, I just kind of naturally chuckle and try to solve the issue calmly. I'm not trying to talk down to people with competitive personalities, I think it can certainly be a virtue, I just don't really understand it. I'm not an extrovert, I usually like 1 and 1 contact, but I'm not an introvert either. If I'm alone for more than a couple hours, I get bored and lonely. I like people a lot, but too much or too little contact puts me into a temporary vegetative state. It's difficult to describe the feeling. Like deep subtle emotional insecurity. I don't have a lot of hobbies, I enjoy reading some books (usually just fantasy or dystopian fiction) but my attention span isn't too great, so I get sidetracked easily. My one true passion is writing. I have a language arts teacher who always recommends to me that I publish the stories I write for his classes. This makes me really happy. About a year ago, I started becoming interested in Buddhism, and Taoism. As well as things such as lucid dreaming, and astral projection. The idea that actions as simple as meditating can alter your consciousness to a state impossible to achieve normally enticed me. As I explored spirituality, I started to learn about plant medicines. Cannabis, Psilocybin, LSD, and the big one DMT. I read trip reports and listened to podcasts about people's experiences, it actually blew my mind, and sort of made me pissed off that the government is so ignorant regarding psychoactive compounds. Since then I've been introduced to the drug community. Weed's been something I've been incorperating into my life, and I honestly think it's a very positive thing. I generally take an edible once a week, and explore the depths of my consciousness. With cannabis I love the psychedelic effects. Hearing and seeing my thoughts, seeing the whole world from what feels like the prospective of a newborn child, having what feels like a comedian in my head commenting on everything I do, it's honestly incredible. I've taken mushrooms on three occasions, and they were the most incredible occasions of my life. The second one was the most profound. I took 2.5 grams, and the visuals were beyond comprehension. When I was peaking I was down to my primal instincts, and when I was finally able to lay down under a heap of blankets and close my eyes, I entered a vortex of spinning shapes and colors. With the words of a girl saying in the background, ""Are you tripping yet,"" but before she would finish it would repeat itself and the end of the first phrase would be played under the beginning of the next phrase. It was bizarre. Eventually this vortex opened up, and I was in a 3 dimensional world. There were incredible structures in the sky floating on purple clouds, rainbow fractal beings walking around, living lives similar to humans. Then it panned over to a purple tower in the background, and through the window of this tower. What I saw was something I can't explain. An entity so bizarre in shape I wasn't able to process what I was seeing, I just knew that it had a deep connection to me. A shock wave of euphoria flooded my mind and body, and some word that wasn't in any language I've ever heard before echoed through my mind. Then I snapped out of it and felt reborn. Well, a week ago my mother searched my room up in down, claiming, ""she was cleaning it"" and found an edible wrapper. I was honest with her, because we have a good relationship, I explained to her why I do this stuff, she didn't understand at all. She will be drug testing me for the next few months, which is fine, I totally get it. What she told me though didn't make any sense at all, and it made me question is she really knows who I am. She looked at me and said, ""you're too young to want to alter your consciousness, all you're doing is fucking up your brain"" Just because I'm 14 doesn't mean I think or process what I observe in the world any different than an adult. Does she really want me to wait 7-8 years to explore my mind? That's ridiculous to me.",19Nov2017,2

15,"My fiancé and I have been together for roughly 5 years now and everything in our relationship is fantastic. Our communication is great, we share similar interests.. but when it comes to sex and things of that nature she is very closed off from most things. 

We are both in our early 20’s and still trying to figure out what we like sexually and emotionally, but almost every idea or suggestion I have seems to be met with a road block. I’ve had polyamorous relationships in the past and really enjoyed the openness of it all. I’ve had girlfriends with weird kinks that I’ve really enjoyed. But these things are taboo to her.

I told him I wasn't sure, I hadn't given it a lot of thought. Recently, though I have been thinking about it and about relationships in general. I am sort of confused about what the point of having a serious relationship is. I love my girlfriend very much, she is wonderful. She is absolutely one of my closest friends and is great to live with. That said, relationships are a lot of work, and I was thinking ""why am I putting in all of this effort?"" Yes, the companionship is great, but it isn't something I can't have with other friends? We started dating because I was looking for a girlfriend and she's great, but I realized that I never knew why I was looking for a girlfriend. It is just something people do at that age. Now there is talk of marriage, but I am having trouble wrapping my head around why. I don't want to sound like I am ungrateful or don't enjoy my relationship, I do, but at times I question what the point of it all is. If anyone has gone through something similar, I would appreciate insight. Thanks

tl;dr: Wondering what the point of a relationship is, why have I invested so much time, energy, commitment etc. into it?

23,"Hi, I guess I just need advice. Four months ago I broke up with my girlfriend because I was not sure of what I wanted to follow through with while going into college. To make it worse, I broke up near her birthday and after disneyland. I understand what terrible mistake that was. I also hooked up with a friend cause she had the freedom from her parents that I always sought. I ended up breaking off the hookup. The girl than went on to burn some things in my room, and make out with my little brother to get back at me. Two weeks after the breaking up, I confessed to my ex what I did, and she sort of took me back. After some intimacy, her family tells me to stay away because they do not want her around me. I understood  that, and tried to keep my distance.

This was on top of me leaving to college 40 minutes away.

Last Saturday, I hung out with my ex, and we ended up holding hands and being close again. She told me she can handle the hardship. She then proceeded, less than a week later, tell me its not realistic to do such a things. That it would be too difficult, and she does not want to lie to her parents.


Now, I guess im lost. I still have strong feelings for her, and it was my screw up that led me to where I am now. Even as I write this, I know I left her because I couldn't stand the parents tracking her all the time, asking me to take their children home after school, to just about anything. I did not feel guilt initally with the breakup because I was happy to be free from the need to constantly please them. I disliked helping then, and in return they still didn't like me being alone with their daughter. I think about prom night, when I just wanted to take my ex to the pier nearby because she did not want to dance. I remember getting the call to take her home, and being tracked all the way back. Each wrong turn I got a phone call.

Im at a crossroad where I don't know what to do. I plan tonight to tell her sorry, and that shes right. We may have feelings for each other, but with me being busy with college, and her being in highschool still and working every week on top with her parents. It wont work out, and in the future well come back into regular contact with each other.

Just letting go though, its difficult. For four months I have tried, and she has gave me hope on two occasions that I thought sealed the deal. People tell me college should be somewhere to start new. I have tried, but everytime I go back to work I see her. 

To make matters worse, I stopped my weekly therapy at college because I was so happy to have her back. I guess I have to call back, and reschedule myself.

Its strange, I broke up with her, and now all I can think about is her. I can not even process is my lonliness in college is due to her, or me. Or if my need for her is a product of being lonely in college. I dont know what I should do anymore. I dont know if its the guilt of what I done. I would do anything to earn forgiveness from her parents. I just dont know anymore. Everyday is just a mix bag. And, I have asked for advice, but I dont know what to do with it. I miss her, and it was my fault.",19Nov2017,2
24,"I need some advice on a family blowout. My husband and his older brother have always been best friends. About five years ago, my husband's brother (HB) helped him get a job at his company, my husband's first ""real"" job. Since then, my HB moved back home, got a job, bought a house and got engaged and married. My husband and I were genuinely happy for him and celebrated all his successes. A year ago my husband got a new job making significantly more money. My HB never congratulated him and made a lot of snide comments about how he was ""lucky"" and this his job was way more difficult and it was bs how much money he was making. Things were tense, but my HB came through for our wedding, wrote a great Best Man speech and was in good spirits. After our honeymoon though, my HB stopped speaking to my husband. My husband confronted him and asked what was wrong and wanted to work things out, HB said he wasn't ""not talking to him"" and there was nothing wrong. Cut to this weekend- we haven't seen my HB and his wife in 6 months. HB didn't greet either of us, never congratulated us on our baby, but then he and his wife announced they were pregnant too. When my MIL confronted my husband and HB, HB said that my husband acted superior and better than everyone which led into an all out screaming match. Despite the way he's been acting,we love his brother and want our families to be close. It seems though, that if we don't make the first move, he will never speak to us again.

I am unemployed and have never held a job longer than 1 month. I have tried to apply for jobs online but have not gotten any calls back. My daily schedule looks something like this: Go to school for a few hours, come home, go to the gym and then play video games for the rest of the day. I also only have classes 3 days a week, so on my off days I do nothing but play video games all day. I am scared that once I am out of University I will be 27-28 years old (too old) with no real job experience in my field of studies. While there will be way younger people with degrees.

32,"Long title, but something just came to light recently after I started a new job. I take a medication for my ADHD, called ""Vyvanse"", much better than adderall, far less of a depressive drop-off. But the thing is, it motivates me to get things done, and to try my hardest, which I normally do anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

There's another thing it does, it gives me great ideas that I normally implement in the workplace,in turn, I garner a lot of attention, both from colleagues and patrons. The thing is, I don't like the attention, but I like my idea and want to put it into place.

&amp;nbsp;

Making announcements about sales, approaching patrons with genuine customer service skills, and overall just doing what I feel I want to do. But inside, something is just telling me ""No, don't bother"", and the feeling is overwhelming, stopping me immediately.

&amp;nbsp; 

I figured it was the anxiety that the Vyvanse puts in my system, but I took my anti-anxiety medication, and for some reason I've also been getting depressed with the meds. Regardless of all that, my thoughts are what really stop me, and it stops me because I don't want the attention it gives me. Because I normally don't like attention regardless, because I don't like people, but on the same token, I want to put fourth the work effort that I feel from within. Is it really who I am? Or..

Come the end of October, I thought the agreement was we would be paying $450 each. Nope. The girlfriend thought they would only be paying $700. I offered to pay $50 more for rent plus internet and gas. They never really agreed. I was forced to pay half for November and now they are telling me that they cannot make their portion of $850. They are barely working.

44,"I'm 17, in highschool, and never done as much as hand holding before. So I'm coming into relationships from a point of total ignorance, other than seeing my friends in them. Basically I have a classmate who I really fancy, but she could be a lesbian (I'm a guy). She seems to like me but I'd like to think I'm pretty well liked in the school overall, so there's no real way of telling if she likes me in *that* way. As I see it, I have 4 options. 

Option A: Ask her to hang out with me after school one day, and feel it out from there. I think this is the best option and the one I'm leaning towards. Even if she is a lesbian that doesn't mean we can't be friends. The only downside is that it would leave me open to rejection and awkwardness between the two of us.

Option 2: Ask a mutual friend if shes gay. I'm not too keen on this one because I'm a pretty reserved person and not only would I have no idea how to ask without seeming weird, I'm he would tell her or other people and then I would seem weird to everybody. Of course this option would be nice in that if she is indeed gay I wouldn't have to worry about embarrassing myself. 

Option III: Completely abort the mission to be in a relationship with her and forget about how I feel. This seems like the worst option because I do quite like her and I don't think I can just turn that off. Also in general I tend to give up on difficult things throughout my life and I don't like that about myself. This would, even if she completely rejects me, prove to myself that I can actually commit to a challenge despite it being challenging.

Option Four: Just ask her if shes gay or not in a casual way. This way if she says yes, I can continue being her friend without putting my dignity on the line. If she says no, I can continue pursuing the romantic relationship. 

Am I overthinking this? Absolutely 100%. I'm also assuming that she doesn't already have a boyfriend or girlfriend. And I promise I'm not a weird stalker who takes relationships waaay too seriously.

He is very sweet, very educated and politically active. The only problem is however we are opposites personality wise (but we are kinda friends- so opposites attract in this case i guess) and the good majority of girls lust after him.

I'm currently a junior in high school taking 5 APs and part of the chess club and the tennis team. During around elementary school to around 7th grade school was a complete breeze and nothing seemed to phase me. I was known as a smart,quiet, and really short kid (still am) and i'd generally stay away from any form of popularity or social media. I was also known for being extremely advancement in math. In 7th grade everything just,fell. 7th grade was my algebra class and i already have been doing algebra for 1 in a half years and after i got the grade for my first test i was broken. It was the lowest test grade ive ever gotten ever, and in my best subject? it fucking destroyed me. The teacher would keep telling me i wasn't good enough for the class even thought i clearly knew my place and stayed. I kept getting C's to B+'s and just couldn't understand why. I didn't care about ego but i did care about my academics, and god did it fucking break me. This eventually lead to the next year and the next which became even worse and worse. Before i'd be happy with a 90 or above and then it became an 87 then an 85 then to 80 and now in my current year i'd be happy if i even got a 70. It just pains me so much that i was so strong in something but i fell completely and have shamed myself. I'm sorry if this is a ramble but this pain of just unsatisfaction of success burns my fucking soul every single day. I try and work hard every day but ive failed so much every test is like an anxiety attack. Failure after failure made me believe my studying methods were all wrong and i had to change them each time. It felt like every test was some experiment but that experiment would go wrong very fucking time. My question is if anyone else has gone through this or just can say anything to help me. All i want is success i don't want this bullshit of a life anymore, I've had enough of hiding grades and lying to people i know of certain tests. I'm just so scared i'll get left behind and become nothing once i'm an adult.

59,"So I'm both an intern and full time in a graduate program. Over the last month I've been cheated on by my boyfriend, I cut my dad out of my life, and my sister has been in and out of the hospital and doctors offices with stage 4 kidney disease and mental health issues. She doesn't need dialysis now but will in the somewhat near future. Taking care of her has been a family effort.

All of this is super overwhelming. I have some mental health issues myself, including depression and anxiety. Lately I've been so anxious that I have been sick to my stomach and depressed as well. I'm doing my best to keep surviving but with all of that I'm behind in my classes. So badly that I'm going to fail one of my classes as of tomorrow. 

I decided to talk to my advisor about it. I was talking to her and I didn't want to tell her about all my life drama and that I have mental health issues and that I can't handle this shit... So I lied. I told her that my sister is starting dialysis and I take her to a lot of appointments so I'm behind. I made her illness sound more severe and demanding because I didn't want to people to judge my lack of stability and question my sanity forever.

She ended up giving me a few extra weeks to finish my classwork.

I feel so bad for lying about it. I needed an out so I didn't have to reveal my emotional issues but still get a much needed extension but I think I crossed a line. The worst part is that my cohort found out so now everybody feels bad for me.

I can't imagine that either of those is the best way to find the right therapist for me. And even if that was the right way to, when do I know it's time to try another person?

I took her to the vet the next morning after being rescued, she got her physical and appointment for all of her shots, bloodwork, and was spayed. The only issue I have noticed is she was licking a lot, had a couple small patches of fur missing, and some bumps near her back end. 

I decided to buy natural oatmeal shampoo to try bathing her. She did well but got scared towards the end and peed. I didn't know what to think of it, and she acted fine afterwards. 

I gave her a bath the following week because I noticed her bumps coming back. She again peed but calmed down after I wrapped her up and even didn't mind having her fur blow dryed and just layed there. 

Tonight though she was more terrified than before, and once I noticed she peed I said that is it, no more baths.

She is the sweetest thing, but I need help on what else I can do? I have been considering another appointment to the vet. Although I wanted to see if there were other ways I could maybe help before she has to be put on medicine?

63,"I am having severe anxiety over thoughts of my girlfriend cheating. When I am at baseline (calm) I know she is loving, loyal, wonderful and I know my thoughts stem from very deep anxiety and are not rooted in reality. There is no proof or really even time for her to cheat. We are always together except when she sees friends and she texts me the entire time, doesn't come home smelling of sex, doesn't shower, etc.

She is wonderful and has been so patient with me and open, but my constant accusations are ruining her and our relationship and I don't know what to do.

I have been researching ideas and so far it seems I need to start viewing her more as a complex, whole person like myself and less like someone who is just going to follow primal instincts (food, sex). I will also be exercising more, meditating, and have put on my phone a list of things to do when I get these anxious thoughts:

* Do not engage in conversation while I am anxious.

* If I become anxious again while conversing, take 10 deep breaths before continuing.

* Ask myself if it is an honest question or an accusation.

* Ask myself if knowing the answer to this question is important. Ask why the answer is important. Evaluate.

* When she is speaking, truly listen to her. Do not listen to anxiety or your own thoughts and reactions. Breathe and ask her to repeat for understanding if you have to.


That's my plan so far. I am just so afraid I have done so much damage already and I am scared because I thought I could change but this anxiety is out of my control.

There is a mutual feeling between a freshman, (we’ll call her Hannah)and I, we seriously love each other and the idea dating did cross our mind but we kind of put it aside cause of our ages. But it resurfaced because people see us together a lot, usually she’s laying her head on me or wanting to hold my hand and whatnot. We are at our school play and my pal Logan asked if we were dating, to which I replied no. Another girl who I barely know also asked if anything went on and I said she might have a crush on me but no. And it upset Hannah and she messaged me asking why we don’t just date since we already do couply stuff anyway, (besides just the two of us going somewhere) and even her friends ask why we don’t or aren’t dating already.

I’m also not doing it because of peer pressure or anything, I’ve wanted to ask her out but wasn’t sure.

70,"So, my boyfriend and I are 28 and have been in our relationship for 2 years. If he is being mean, sometimes I ask him to not to be so mean.(we have had conversations about how I need him to be nicer when speaking to me.) If he continues being that way, sometimes it escalates into me asking him not to be a 'dick'. 

The other day, he was being short and snippy for no reason and I eventually asked him to stop being a dick. He then called me an 'instigating bitch' and brought up the fact that I call him a dick, so that's practically the same.

The advice I need is, Is calling him a dick the same thing as him calling me an instigating bitch? Or is he out of line? I know the conversation needs to be more constructive than 'stop being a dick' but we have those conversations quite regularly these days and he always promises to be nicer, but then something like this happens. Advice?

90 percent of the time he is nice, so he's not always mean. But sometimes he flips a switch and starts being very mean in his tone, not necessarily usually the things he says. Most of our relationship is pretty perfect but sometimes he can make me feel very bad.",19Nov2017,2

78,"Title kinda sums up the issue. I'm 18 and I just started attending college. In high school, my parents would always drop me off since it was on their way to work. However, the college I now attend is halfway across town which meant no ride and I would have to take the city bus to school and that really wan't working with my schedule. 

Long story short, I desperately started looking for a car even though I didn't have my license at that point. About 4 weeks ago, I was able to get a car that was in great shape for only a $1000. I spent about 2 days cleaning it out and spent $15 on an air filter. I quickly got my license within 2 weeks of me having the car. I started driving to school as soon as I got my license and this past week, I had to drop $500 on critical repairs on the engine and replacing a destroyed driver side mirror (was like that when I got the car). I also have to put $20-$30 of gas into the car weekly since it's about 22 miles round trip for college.

The issue that's been looming over my head is that I was told by my parents that I would have to let my brother (16) drive my car. Here's the issue with that. He's 16, hangs out with people that flip their cars over with 8 people inside and has no money. So I'd be paying for his gas and whatever maintenance costs are from him. I was told he would use it when I wasn't driving my car or when there was sports events out of town he had to be at. My dad is paying for the insurance but the plan he's got on it, the cars totaled if it gets into an accident, even just a minor scrape. He claims the car was only $1000 and how I can get another car.

At this point, I don't know what to do. I'm not going to let my brother drive my car at all and I'm going to start pulling the starter fuse and hiding it if he starts driving it. The way I see it, he's got no claim to the car when I've paid for the car, repairs, gas and spent 2 days cleaning the car. Even my grandfather is on my side about this. I know my dad is paying for insurance but with the coverage on it, I'd might as well as take over and get my own coverage on it the way people drive nowadays. Any suggestions? ",19Nov2017,7

88,"I’ve been working as a leading hand (team leader) in a production based role for about 2 months now. It’s on a newish production line in a factory that I’ve worked at before. The line consists of 3 work stations where 3 newly recruited operators work upon. They were trained up for two weeks before moving onto my weekend shift pattern.

I’m quite a laid back, nice guy and have a tendency for people to walk all over me because of these traits. I find it very hard to confront people.

I need advice on how to deal with the 3 operators and their behaviour.

The operators are between 17-26. Two male, one female.

Here are some examples of the issues I’m having: Quite regular talking - which I do not mind in the slightest. But when they talk they generally stop working and this affects the amount of product produced. We have an hourly and daily target which my manager enforces. They are more than aware of this and I have already explained to them about their talking issues. Completely ignored.

Late in at start of work and after breaks. Despite being told on a number of occasions about this issue and how our production knows, in realtime, whether product is being made or not.

Safety boots. Or complete lack of! All are aware of this importance to wear them and I had addressed this with them just yesterday. 2 operators were offending, 2 turned up to work today in trainers!

Standing around doing literally nothing when and if the production line stops due to an issue. Even though they’ve been told to always do something in this circumstance. Ie: cleaning, stock/parts filling or even just grabbing a sweeping brush. This is a constant (every single time) occurance.

They have been told by myself and higher management (yesterday) to report all issues and rejects as they happen. And to call me over to inspect reject immediately. Half the time they don’t call me, half the time they do and forget what the reject/error message was in the machine.

We struggle to hit our achievable targets because of these issues.

How many times do I need to repeat myself about these things, most of which I would consider common sense duties?!

I’m trying f to gain their respect and treat them fairly and not be one of those overbearing arsehole bosses.

I should add that our shift is 3x 12hr weekend shifts when no management are present except for a few hours on a Friday morning.

93,"Hello. I am a youth leader in an inner city church.

Every few months we host a special event night. Usually based around some sort of games or theme to keep it interesting for the kids. As opposed to a bible study or something like it. For example one of our youth nights we had a cranium gameshow theme and the next was a dodgeball tourney.  

The main problem with many of these events is we have many of the shy or troubled teens choose not to participate. Be it they feel they are not engaged enough or are too cool. It kind of perpetuates the problem of cliques or kids dropping out back to the streets.

So our next theme is an escape room. We chose this to even the playing field for the intillectuals as we choose athletic activities too often. We have a few puzzles set up but we are afraid with the eighty or so teens (give or take a few) running them through in teams would take too long. And eliminating them out would kill the participation and interest. Like the cranium night.

So one of our thoughts was to run a ig or fb live feed from one of the leaders in the room on a projector and have some sort of participation from random teams who were knocked out in the prelims to either give clues to or sabatoge the internal team (i.e. wemo off the lights for thirty seconds or blare some annoying music via bluetooth) but im running out of ideas and time.

Me and my first boyfriend broke up 3 or 4 months ago. I’ve been trying to let go of what he put me through ever since, but despite my efforts, I’m still hurt.

Everything started out okay, but went left quickly after 4 months. There would always be this cycle where he’d be mad at me for some mistake I was unknowingly making, proceed to ignore me, angrily subtweet me, act like he was about to break up with me, and *then* proceed to tell me what was wrong. I was very attached to him, so this cycle tore me apart every time and I’d blame myself for whatever happened, no matter who’s fault it was. 

He also brought up other guys he thought were attractive a few times too many while we were together. He’d go into excruciating detail about it and joke about cheating on me, but get mad at me for feeling a certain way about it. I had been cheated on in my only past relationship before this, which he knew, but he kept doing this even after I talked to him about it. I think he was conscious of this and liked having control over me this way.

He’d never offer emotional support. He’d often get annoyed and stop talking to me altogether while I’d go through occasional insecure episodes, many anxiety attacks, and depressive states. I’d usually blame myself for it and things would get worse for me. Whenever he went through the same things, I’d do everything I could to help, but it often times went ignored. 

This included him hinting at committing suicide in a tweet and then saying it “wasn’t that serious” after I had a terrible anxiety attack over it. Another time, he told me he had self-harmed and I tried to give support, but he ignored it. I was out with friends when he sent me a video of blood running down his hand, which gave me a panic attack and ended in my friend rushing me home.

Before I broke up with him, he would call me annoying and “hard to love”, which absolutely destroyed me. I again blamed myself and took it. I initially left him because of a need to better myself and because my issue of blaming myself for everything was “hurting him”, but he got emotional, blamed me for him picking self-harm up again, and took to Twitter to make me look like the villain. I still feel responsible for the self-harm part and have had trouble living with myself since. 

He told me not to talk to him again. A month or two after, I got a Snapchat from him talking about hooking up with someone else, which gave me an anxiety attack in public. I blocked him on everything a day or two after. He emailed me asking me to talk to him a month ago, and I deleted it and acted like I didn’t get it.

My sister tells me that it’s possible that this all could have been traumatic for me, but I’m not sure. I’ve usually always associated trauma with different things. I’ve been trying to let this all go so I can move forward, but I can’t for some reason. I don’t think I have feelings for him anymore, but I’m still really just hurt over all this. I feel stuck.

I really don't have friends as I switched schools to a school closer to my home, and my old friends really don't talk to me as much for that. Probably not going to buy a bottle or drink anytime soon, as it's sorta taboo in my family. I just don't know what to do :( 

I'm going to study for a test tomorrow for one of my classes, and stay home to watch something on Netflix. I did go out to eat last night with my family, but going to stay home for my bday.

102,"So for some context, I live on a cul-de-sac that doesn't get any traffic aside from the elderly folk that live here and definitely not at this time of night. My parents are out of town and I'm staying here with my baby sister and our 3 dogs for the weekend. 

Someone just rang our doorbell and when I went to see who it was, nobody was there. This is super weird because a) nobody comes on our street and b) we have a super long, steep driveway that nobody wants to walk up to begin with and c) it's super late for anyone to be at our door anyway. 

I'm really anxious and paranoid and I'm not sure if it was just a stupid ding-dong ditcher (its a Saturday night so who knows) or if my fear is valid. Either way, I turned on our home alarm system.

I think it's just a jealousy thing, we used to be close and the new guy comes along and I'm shunned in his favor. It's just annoying, whenever I try to engage in conversation with the old friend the new guy comes in and sides with him on everything, so I can never really get my thoughts heard. I get it, berate me in the comments, I'm a self centered dickhead, but at this point it's affecting my ability to be friends with the two of them.

113,"Hi all,

So just going to lay it all out. I (f25) have lived with my boyfriend (m 26) for over 6 months. We have been together 5 years. Our friend (m 26) has moved from over seas. We invited him to stay with us and start paying rent etc. when he lands himself a job and gets settled.  

He has now become an uninvited guest as he takes up a lot of physical and mental space. He sits in the lounge all day, is always home, and has started making a negative impact on my boyfriend and I's relationship.  We just need our own space!  He acts like a baby when he is not invited to things and I actually feel embarrassed by the way he acts and things he says when he does interact with our friends. He seems to drain my energy, is constantly negative and I have now found myself not wanting to go back to my own home!  I have told him that it is time he moves on and finds his own place and that it would be beneficial for all but he has reacted very angrily. I have,in the meantime, moved out and will not return until he has gone; giving space and making sure he takes it seriously. My boyfriend has my back and has also told him a date that he needs to leave ( we have given him 4 weeks). I am worried that he is not actively looking, instead arguing about moving, and will not leave. His sister is also visiting soon and I believe that is also a reason he does not want to move. I do not understand how someone would not think it reasonable to find their own place if causing so much tension in their guests house (as well as being asked)?! What should we do if he still refuses to leave when the time frame is up? It's such a tricky and sad situation as we used to be friends (my BF still friends with him) but this has caused quite a bit of damage with his refusal to move.",19Nov2017,1

126,"so i moved across the country in august
and it’s going pretty well, good house, location, exercise, job in the first week at a health food store.
i want to study herbal medicine.  so it’s a useful stepping stone job.

there’s a guy.  seems cool.  i don’t really have a type bc i don’t really shop but he might be my type.
he introduced himself to me the first day, smiles, makes conversation when working in similar spaces, like anybody probably (actually not everybody does, some solitary workers —me included sometimes—).
also, i think i catch him looking at me sometimes when we’re doing work where we’re near each other but have to do our own stuff.

i don’t know.  i’m relatively cool.  i’m pretty nice.
i think he could be into me, or anyway it could go in some direction.
but i get terrible anxiety in crowded small places sometimes and lately i’ve dissociated again.
so there’s that.

i keep trying to make myself talk to him bc i know we have some similar interests but my thoughts freeze.  and i look either rude or nervous or dull or something else.  and eventually he will stop saying hi.

friday i was dissociating and he was trying to talk to me and i couldn’t talk much and later i said to him i get dizzy sometimes walking these circles [aisles].  so that’s weird.  he just said yeahh and didn’t talk to me anymore that day.

but sometimes i know he thinks i’m clever and he’s called me interesting and i know he saw me giving him flirty eyes and he didn’t look away.

so.  should i tell him?  that i get anxious sometimes and it’s not that i’m rude or dull or don’t want to talk to him.  it’s situational.
it’s not an attractive truth.
but how can i change this and like go forward. 
because i wonder if he and i could be interesting to each other.

i just don’t want to not try.

if we don’t fit, that’s cool, he’s still cool have a full life.  at least i know i tried.

it’s not even that this has to go romantic, i just want to get to know him, see what’s up.  then romantic

TL;DR:
i like this guy at work.  he might like me.  i’m socially awkward mostly in crowds also bad at small talk.  but a cool interesting person.  should i admit to him my anxiety, because maybe that way we could get past it and realize our chemistry ",19Nov2017,0
127,"Hey everyone, so this is more of me trying to get something off my chest and I guess, find support on here because I feel alone in this issue. Long story short, I had some friends a long time ago, one in particular I will call M. Now me and M had been friends for almost 10 years straight, he was there for me all the time, no matter what. He helped me discover music, Consoled me when my gf back then had cancer, and let me stay over whenever I was having a rough time mentally. Cut to last year, and that all changed. I had become more religious and trying to devote myself more to that, and he became, well, disrespectful. He was constantly backed up by a friend in our group, we will call him D, and made me feel like shit all the time. What broke the straw for me is that we were all playing magic the gathering together at his place, and he had asked me how my religion was going, and I began to open up about it, feeling welcomed for once in that sense. However, I made a point to tell him that I was starting to be more serious about it, and they liked to throw around the GD word around me, and it made me feel really uncomfortable. I decided to open up to them at the table, saying that I understand they have a right to their own words, but rather, to please respect me and not say that around me, rather than telling them not at all. I was really trying to be respectful to them about it, and was met with spears to my face. From D I got ""Well, that's not going to happen. I will say what I want and that's that. I don't worship that, and I find it silly you ask that."", and from M I got a weird look, while continuing to keep saying it, and later back up D. I told them enough was enough. I broke it off there, explaining to M reasons why I didn't want to be friends anymore, and in return, I got a Microsoft Word document explaining everything I said with a section under every sentence explaining why I was wrong, and under those sections was secondary reasons why he was right. I had talked to him face to face about it, and that's what I got.

133,"Sorry in advance, it's a bit long. My friend will be called $F.

Not sure, but I think some background info would help out: I've know him for several years now, and practically consider him a brother to me. We've talked about things that made us hurt, cried together, dealt with each other's tempers, and had plenty of good times playing video games. The long standing problem that I have with him are his tendency to act on his emotions. Knowing my own flaws, I have spoken to him about this as well as my own, in an effort to deal with that problem (as well as my own, of course). I have a new problem with him that has surfaced over the past couple of years, and it is that he simply has no desire/passion for anything.  He states that he wants to do things, which boggles me because to do the things he wants to do, he needs money. Money from a job where he can earn a decent penny, but has no desire at all to move up the ladder to do so. However, in the overall picture, he's a chill guy that generally does not cause problems. He doesn't ever ask anything of me and will turn down offers to help, but he will do anything he can to help me if I ask.

The past few months, I noticed that something is a bit off. I'm sure this started with some family issues that came up he has very, very briefly mentioned. Knowing that $F has a tendency to act upon his emotions, I did ask if he wanted to talk about it so that I can create or at least act as the outlet so pressure doesn't build up too much. He declines saying he's fine, even though he says it bothers him. Pressing the issue just makes him repeatedly say that he's fine and to drop the subject. So ok, I drop it and stop talking about it. 

As time goes on, I notice that he's slowly becoming more and more easily agitated and it's really starting to show when he's at work (as told through a good mutual friend, whom I'll designate $A). A will tell me about it, but whenever I ask about work to F when I see him online, $F does not complain and says that work is as usual. It did reach a boiling point though, which resulted in F blowing up at the manager and $A, resulting in $F quitting and cutting ties with $A. This was over the standard operating procedures of work, where instead of doing steps 1-2-3, $F did things in steps 2-1-3 (for example) because it was easier for him and he got things done much faster that way. That surprised me quite alot, because at least from my pov, those two were good friends and shared plenty of common ground. When I spoke to $F about it, I just told him to let it out of his system and I would listen. He went on a fairly energetic rant about how he felt that he wasn't being treated fairly. I asked him if he talked about it, and his answer is no. When I said that him not doing/saying anything about it wasn't going to solve anything, he was quiet and didn't give a response. Perhaps there is something else amiss that I'm not getting, but $F has told me that $A was just being a dickhead, while $A tells me that $F doesn't listen to anyone and hates being told what to do. Whether they talked at all about the problem or not before things went nuclear, I don't know, but $F will not talk to $A anymore despite me saying that he needs to apologize for lashing out like that. $F did agree that he was wrong for doing so though. 

Now, a few weeks have gone by, and I'm told by another good mutual friend (online only), $B, that $F is acting weird. $F started asking for the address to the discord we were using without context repeatedly, while $B had absolutely no idea why since $F was already in the server. Here's the chat log that was sent to me:

$F: what is the discord

$B: u are in the discord
$F: What is the discord

$B: ?

$F: What is the discord

$B: U ARE IN DISCORD

$F: What is the discord

$B: what the fuck are u trying to say?

$F: WHAT THE FUCK IS THE DISCORD SERVER

$F: ENglish mtuha fucker

$F: do u speak it

$B: U ARE ALREADY IN THIS DISCORD SERVER

$B: U ARE IN THE FUCKEN CHANNEL

$F: Can u just copy and paste it

$B: u are already here

$F: What is the discord

$F: Fuck u then

$B: Look in your tool bar u are here

$B: nowu left

Just as $F did with $A, $F now refuses to do anything with $B. To me it looks like $F was being childish as all hell. When I spoke to him about this, he didn't provide me with a copy of the chat log on his end, instead stating that $B was giving dumbass replies and so he gave dumbass replies back. $B told me that he has been acting huffy even before this, where $B was trying to help $F with his mic problem and $F saying that he knows what the problem is (and doesn't fix it). I told $F that he overreacted, and he replied that $B is just acts like a troll.

To be honest, over the past year or so, I started to see his behaviour as slightly toxic even though I don't want to. It's like he's pushing people away, but he's still friendly with people he meets. He's a brother to me, so it worries me that he's acting like this. However, I just can't let him just do things like that since I believe that to be self destructive and isolating. He gets mad when I try to have him talk out his issues. I just don't know how to approach the problem.",19Nov2017,1

Just being here, alone or not, gives me panic attacks and disorients me in time and space. and, any time I have to be near this person or interact with them, I feel the weight of the coldness, the contrast of someone who used to be warm becoming ice, someone I used to be able to joke with and talk to, now like a wall of formality, at best. Someone I used to think cared about me, now only ever concerns themselves with me when I explicitly ask them to, and even then only when feeling obliged by the circumstance.

I have lived trough many breakups by now. I know I have to just push through these feelings until we no longer live together but it is one of the most triggering things for me, I feel like I am living with a sociopath who would watch me suffer unblinkingly if it came down to it, maybe even would take pleasure in it. That makes me hide myself from them. someone who only wants interactions with others for some objective. Whether or not this is true is not my concern at this point. Rather, I want to minimize my own pain because it brings out such ugliness. Ugly thoughts, behaviors, etc. due to feeling powerless and out of control. I know the only thing I can control is myself but even if I behave neutrally and maintain as much distance as possible, the emotions feel almost completely unbearable.

As the title says, I’ve got two jobs. One I really enjoy and have had for awhile, but gives little hours, and a retail job I picked up to be able to make a living wage. I love my first job due to it being in an office environment and not requiring me to interact with other people too much. I can tolerate interacting with customers at the retail job, since it’s my job, although it isn’t something I would like to do. But the bigger issue I have with this job is the fact that everyone is always talking about someone behind their back, and the manager doesn’t really seem to act like a manager at all.

I guess the better question is what sort of job should I be looking for?

153,"I'm 20. I dropped out of college few months ago because I wasn't enjoying the degree (interpreting and translation) and I would rather have a career in a different branch (IT). However, my family's reaction was overwhelmingly negative. More on that later.

Right now, there are three people in hour house - me, my sister and my mother (also two cats). I was a slob after I dropped out, playing videogames all day for months. I found a job few weeks ago.

My family has been very unsupportive since I can remember. Parents divorced when I was 10 or so, I haven't heard from my father in about 7 years. Not even a single call or a text message. On one occasion, when I was filling some paperwork, I actually couldn't recall his name. 

My mother would always take me to therapist as a kid (ADD), but I feel like she was there for herself and not for me, she didn't tell me what ADD is and only told me that I am there because I'm 'misbehaving and not doing my chores' and so on. I only recently realized what ADD truly is, how it affects me and how it can be helped.

My grandfather is extremely narcissistic and hated me basically my whole life. I can't remember one good memory related to him, all of them are negative. He would always scream at me and call me names. Even when we were on vacation, he would later call me stupid for not remembering all the places we have visited, and how his other grandchildren always remember that. When I dropped out, he told me that I have completely ruined my life and he will no longer support me.

They always liked my sister though. Granted, she needs the support a lot more than I do; one of her hands has not fully developed at birth so she has a stump and can only effectively user her left hand. That would be OK, however my grandfather is always so nice to her while treating me as an outcast. That's why I never visited my grandparents unless necessary (same with my mother, from what I heard they didn't treat her nicely), but my grandfather doesn't understand that and instead calls me lazy and so on for not helping him.

This has been going on for years, but things have taken a turn for the worse recently.

First, my mother has decided basically overnight that she wants to move into a bigger city, obviously not taking me with her. So I found a job and filled out some papers so I could stay in the house we have lived in for years with cats together.

Then, my sister has decided that I would not be able to take care of the cats and said that she would take them into the grandparents' house, where she would live as well since it's in the same city we live(d) in. What baffles me is that I didn't even have a say in that situation, she just called the grandparents and next day they were gone. When I stood up to my abusive grandfather and told him I'm sick of him bossing me around he got super angry and told me he's done with me and that never wants to see me again.

And that leaves me with a house, but no furniture, no fridge, no washing machine, no cats that I loved and no family. The only thing I have here is a bed and a stove.

What can I do to make my situation a little better?

I'm gonna list out the things that I know :

1. Data Structures and algorithms : decently good with it owed to over two years of competitive programming.
1. Programming languages : C, C++, Python (these are the ones that I regularly use and am confident with)
1. Linux and git architecture  :  I know the basic workflow of how git works, same for linux, I know how to use it, I know the commands that one often needs, the backend of it all , not so much.
1. Machine Learning : used scikit-learn to build a facial expression recognition tool for static images, and other mini projects. 
1. WebDev : backend development in Django, although I'm familiar (but not well versed) with front-end dev as well. 

I tried to pick up projects at random from GitHub, for example : [plowshare](https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare) but it turned out to be a lot to process and make sense out of.

156,"hi guys, im just here to look for advice/vent. if you've been here for a while you've probably read one of my posts where i was happy and felt like it might work out.... this isnt one of them ):. so this school year i met a really nice and cute boy. i would always catch him staring at me. i eventually found out he was gay and i started to crush on him around mid september. we would start waving hi to each other whenever we walked passed each other at school and smiled. then one day after band practice he approached me and started talking to me. then the topic came up and i gave him my instagram. he dmed me and then i started to hang around him during lunch around mid october. this all looks super postive but its not. im a quiet person. i'm quiet around almost everyone, even if i like them or they are my friend, so i never really talked unless i force myself to. this often caused awkward silence whenever it was us two alone. i didnt really talk and a month passed.

i think he might have stopped liking me because of this and he might have moved on because i've noticed today he stopped approaching me/ starting convo as often as he did. earlier today i walked into a convo of him and his two other friends in the middle of talking. they were like ""i dont know if i should text (other gay guy first)"" and they were just saying ""dont worry you got this"" my heart was really broken when i heard that... and also more awkward silence.... and know im here crying as i type this.... i honestly really thought he liked me.... i truly did... but i was too quiet and now he probably has moved on.... ive never really cried because of a crush but omg im so confused and heart broken at the same time. when i do talk to him i seem like he's not interested because he gives simple replies to me but to his other friends he's a different person.

i dont know what to do now. should i tell him i like him? should i just start to move on? how do i get him back??? am i to blame for this? i never thought i would be crying like this over a crush. i guess now i know why they call it a crush ):... advice?",19Nov2017,2

168,"Hi reddit users. I know a guy who's at my school, we met like a year ago but we're not friends or anything, we just know each other. About 6 months ago, I was rejected by a girl who I was in love with and I moved on. Then, I noticed him staring at me. We kept making occasional eye contact for the remainder of the school year, and sometimes it was awkward, but we didn't really talk to each other. Now, we're in the next school year, and we are in 2 classes, unlike last year, where we only had 1 class together. This year, a lot changed between us. At first, our eye contact continued. But then it got a little more 'suspicious'. I know it sounds weird when I say all this, but it's how I experienced it. And by the way, this guy's pretty shy, at least, most of the time he's pretty silent when I'm around. I will call him Billy for now. So, one day, I'm in class sitting at a table with my friend Joe, Billy and Billy's friend Samuel. I know Joe a lot more than I know the other 2. So Joe and I get into a discussion about music, and I say that I like Phil Collins, which should'nt have been a surprise, since I post a lot of Phil Collins stuff on instagram and snapchat. Then, Samuel snaps at me and says 'who the f*ck is Phil Collins?'. Billy, on the other hand quickly asks 'yeah, who's Phil Collins?', in a more interested tone. The next week, I show Joe some Phil Collins music, and Billy comes to us and he says 'it's not that bad'. I know, it doesn't sound like much, but it doesn't end there. The frequent and unnecessary eye contact between Billy and me continues. Then, one day, we have a test and he's sitting in front of me and he starts turning his head around and I notice him trying to look at me through the corner of his eyes. I know it sounds like he's autistic, but it's hard to explain the moment. Anyway, more of this kind of shit happens and one day, Joe and I talk about what we'll be doing tomorrow: going to see a movie. Billy quickly asks, 'what's going on tomorrow?'. I tell him we're going to the cinema. Billy gets interested, but the topic quickly changes. That afternoon, I ask him if he wants to come along to the cinema. He quickly replies within a few minutes and immediately asks who's coming along, which cinema. I tell him and he asks what time. I tell him the time and he says he unfortunately can't come because of a soccer match. He wasn't lying, a friend who's on his team actually asked him about the match earlier that week. Billy kindly says 'I can't come then, sorry'. I say: 'oh that's a pity' He says: 'yes' I say: 'it would have been fun' He says: 'yes unfortunately' So we go to the movies without him, and I never hear him talking about it again. Time goes on. Then, we get our first exam week. This is where shit takes a slightly odd turn. So, I'm sitting at a table during break time, and this annoying guy called Kurt won't stop talking. I see Billy walking down the stairs, he walks by us and stands at the other side of the table, where Samuel is also sitting with his girlfriend. Then, one of Billy's other friends, Bryan, also comes towards our table and sits next to me and Kurt. Then, within a minute, Billy grabs a chair and for some reason, decides to sit next to Bryan. Kurt keeps on talking, Bryan leaves for the bathroom, then Kurt leaves as well, and it's just me and Billy. Then Billy smiles and says: 'that guy Kurt is crazy'. We both start laughing so unbelievably hard, his face turns red. It was so weird realising that I was sitting there laughing with him. We had never had a real conversation and somehow we just start laughing like normal friends when we finally have one. After that day, it got weirder. The eye contact seemed a little more intense. We haven't really talked since that moment where we couldn't stop laughing. But I remember that on the last day of the exam week, I was at the bike rack, and I looked back, and I caught him staring at me. Same old, same old. Now it's been a week since the exam week and the staring and overall awkwardness has increased to an all time high. This guy has been following me on insta for a year but he has never liked any of my posts. And guess what, a week after the laughing incident he suddenly decides to like my post (which I posted on the same day as he liked it, of course). Very odd.

But now I'm 25 and tired of the life I've lived and ready to give up all of most I do to do something that actually benefits the world.

176,"Sometime this year, I started this annoying habit of ""splitting"" words while reading. What do I mean?

Well, often when I see a word longer than 5 or 6 letters, like ""annoying"", I pause and read it to myself again as anno-ying. I split every long word I see in half while reading (insa-nely, insig-htful, discu-ssion). If I see a word that has an odd number of letters, I split it in 3 parts (sub-red-dit, co-nte-nt, redd-iqu-ette). Sometimes I even split groups of words as if they were one word (sometime this -&gt; someti-methis, turtle beach -&gt; turt-leb-each, shower thoughts -&gt; showe-rtho-ughts) (coming with examples for this is really hard, I'm just writing down words that I see around me).

When I come across the word precisely, I'm like, ""hmm how does this word split?"" And the voice in my head reads pre-cis-ely. ""Dammit, I did it again."" I continue reading and come across particular. ""parti-cular. Dammit, not again!"". At this point I have wasted 5+ seconds splitting words in a paragraph that takes less than 20 seconds to read.

183,"I've been recently feeling a lot of guilt and having basically a moral dilemma for telling my ex girlfriend that I had a one night stand. She was my first real love and best friend but we didn't break up on bad terms so I still look up to her and want to make sure she's as happy as possible.When I told her she said she was very disheartened by the fact that I would do such a thing after seeing me as a person that thought of sex as something more - i.e. Basically should be done between people who love each other. 

The problem mainly lies that she doesn't believe in casual sex and thinks that it's morally wrong for two people to engage in intimacy especially when they don't love each other or have an intimate connection. I understand that everyone has their opinions on the subject and that's it's hotly debated but it's really been getting me down the past week and I figured I'd just post here to get some insight.

That's as much information as I know right now and both were shot and killed by an unknown assailant. He was senselessly murdered on his mom's birthday. 

My friend lives across the country and called to tell me this morning. She and her fiance are driving down today to be with family. What can I do for them? I've got three days off this coming week, one of them being thanksgiving, but I work with my sister and she is willing to pick up any other shifts I might need off to be with her.

What can I do? If anyone has been in this situation, what do they need? How can I help? They're basically my other family. For me, grief has manifested into nervous energy. 

My best friend is getting married next year. I can't bear to think that her happy day is going be filled with such needless pain. I was in the process of planning a bridal shower for next month. 

I don't know. If anyone believes in prayers, please pray for them. I don't but her mother does, and she needs them right now. The family was ripped apart by a nasty divorce and a nasty stepmother but they've all cone together today for the first time in at least a decade which I suppose is a strange blessing. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I kind of needed to just tell someone I guess-- names haven't been officially released so I'm going to keep quiet until the family has officially said something on social media. Unfortunately that means that everyone is still wishing their mother a happy birthday on Facebook, and I think that must feel terrible for her. Everyone hug someone that you love tight, it's unfortunate how quickly your entire world can change.

193,"My father took over a small family business in July and has me and my brother running it. 

It's a humble business and we knew that it would need a turnaround to get it where we wanted it to be. At the time I was 100% for this and didn't mind that we wouldn't be getting paid a full wage for the first while, just so we could get on our feet. Bearing in mind this was already a falling business in a dying sector. 

At first I was okay. I've been working 60 hours a week, seven days a week since July. We were only getting paid for just over half of those hours, which was tolerable. But now coming into the winter months, since the start of October, we've had to cut our wages again - so I'm only getting paid such a small amount for huge work. My loyalty is definitely failing. 

I'm now stressed and anxious 24/7 because I know that I can't afford things that are coming up, such as Christmas in general and a friend's wedding that me and my partner are to attend. There was also a vacation planned for next year with my partner and her parents, but I'm almost certain that I now won't be able to afford that. I just get by, and I can't see it turning around any time soon. My brother is under the impression that in a coupe of years, the business will be where we want it to be etc, but I really can't see myself sticking this out for another few years. 

I feel myself wanting to leave, but I'm torn because I feel as though I'm fucking over my brother and father in the process. I work 60 hours a week and get paid roughly €230, so about $250? It's not maintainable for me. There's also a couple of weeks where I'm still owed back pay.

So the story goes something like this...

I'm a 23 year old girl who's been depressed for quite some time. The only thing that kept me going somehow was my job as a journalist, but now, I don't want to do this anymore, even if it was my dream and it meant everything to me. I want a quiet job, where I can type on the keyboard (something I love to do) and maybe do some research, but nothing more.

I pushed away all my friends, and now, quitting my job is going to change who I am perceived to be as, because everyone knows me as a reporter and an aspiring independent journalist, and when I'll stop being one, I will mean nothing, even to me.

I am somehow afraid of what people are going to think of me. I will be a quitter and a disappointment for many people. Truth is, I don't want to care about this anymore.

But what can I do with my life, how can I find my identity again? I feel lost and if I don't find even a thought to cling on, I am afraid that I will kill myself in the end.

200,"I'm 24 years old, attending community college and have a part time job. About a year ago, my brother and his then girlfriend decided that they were going to have a kid. It came as a surprise to everyone as she (at the time) was addicted to pain killers and was in no state to be having a child. She ended up having to get on methadone, which she is still on today, and going to an outpatient rehab. During this time, after admitting to her parents that she was pregnant and dealing with addiction issues, her parents kicked both of them out of the room they rented at their house. Skip ahead a few weeks and they've moved into an extra room we have at our house. They've made promises of providing rent (they haven't yet), which my parents kind of let go as they have a baby to take care of, but they also haven't been contributing much at all. They stash almost all of the food\drinks they buy in their room as we offer them our own almost every day. My brothers fiance also seems to think that we are now her babysitters. I often will be in my room and hear the baby cry for thirty mins to an hour in the living room, until I come down and then she magically reappears and acts like shes been taking care of him the whole time. She only seems to care about making her methadone appointments and mooching off of us for as long as possible. 

is there any nice way to get them out on their own? No one would mind them being here if they helped around the house, but they seem to go against any rules we try to implement. 

my parents have been thinking about telling them they have [x] amount of months to move, but again, the baby is kind of getting in the way of them wanting to kick them out. 

sorry if this seems like a rant! 

thanks for any advice.

201,"So my mother is a hoarder, and has been my whole life. I've known that and am at peace with it. 

Last night I was talking about how I liked pocket watches and she remembers that she inherited one decades ago (that neither my father or I had ever seen/heard about). She digs through piles of crap to find it, and I really like the thing. I find out information on it and it becomes a conversation piece of the evening.

She then takes it from my hands, and explicitly gives it to my father. He is dumbfounded, it has been in their house for decades, and she then just put it right back where she got it from. Later, when he's off somewhere she tells me out of the blue that she was really happy to give it to him, and I can have it when he is dead. Then when my mother was off somewhere my father says he doesn't want it, knows I do, and will figure out a way to get it to me. (I did not bring up the watch with either of them, they both simply said those things to me while I was watching tv).

I'm not into possessions, but for some reason this interaction has me seething.  The object was never mine, so I don't know how to handle this. If I sit her down and talk with her about it she will consider me spoiled for wanting something that was not meant for me (trust me on this one). If I get it from my father I will be going behind her back on a gift she gave. If I do nothing I will continue to hold the interaction against her internally to some degree. The best thing for me to do is move on, but emotionally this one struck me somewhere.

How do you cope with bizarre bouts of jealousy like this?


Update- I just checked my email for the first time this morning and I have one from my father asking me to pick out display cases for it. The email is carefully worded, but I believe he now wants to keep the watch but put it on display instead of leaving it in the piles of crap like it was. This does nothing to assuage my feelings of jealousy, but figured it should be added to the summary.

Also if I should drop Physics, or study really hard and hope for the best. I feel like if tell my parents I’ll lose my engineering job and it pays well ($12.50 a hour).

At this point I do not know what is going to happen with our marriage. That's not what I'm asking for advice about...That I can take my time thinking about. But it's going to be Thanksgiving in 4 days and we were supposed to go to his family's house for 4 days over thanksgiving (Wed-Sat). I cannot bear to even look at my husband or talk to him right now, let alone spend 4 hours in the car with him, pretend like everything is fine with his family for four whole days and sleep in the same bed as him. I just cannot do it. 

We have a 5 year old son who is really looking forward to going to grandma and grandpas for thanksgiving and seeing his cousins. I don't want his holiday to be ruined and to disappoint him because of my husbands actions. But I also know I cannot go far away and be trapped with my husband and his family in their house and have to fake happy for four days when I am still so livid and want nothing to do with my husband right now. 

I have considered not going at all. I have considered consenting to leave Thursday morning and come back Friday morning. I don't know what to do and I need advice. 

My husband does plan to tell his family about what happened but I am asking him not to until after thanksgiving....I really dont need that level of awkward around his family.

P.S. our son has no idea what has happened and right now I'm just acting like everything is ok for his sake",19Nov2017,6
230,"I quit my job a year and a half ago to pursue a career change and get into the tech industry. I finally did it and it's a pretty relaxed job.

Now that I'm entering my 30s, I'm starting to feel stagnant. Whenever it comes to new frameworks I don't even bother learning anymore ... I'm pretty burnt out. I know that tech is a field where you always need to learn or else you won't make it.

But right now, I just feel so tired. I want to enjoy the other things in my life like enjoy family time, travel, reconnect with good friends. During my time of unemployment and job-hunting, I shut people out of my life to make sure I land something .... now that I did it, I don't know what else to do with my life.

My job is great in a sense that it allows me to take lots of vacation time or give back to the community by doing pro bono work.

It's tough for me to pursue a relationship too because I'm in a new city and a lot of meetups or gatherings I've found that I'm not really fond of the types of people here.

Long rant aside, I'd like advice on how to spend my 30s, how to keep finding goals for myself that I would actually enjoy and not work-related.

236,"So my wife and I are really good with our finances. We budget every month and are usually able to save about 20-25% of what we make and still have a good lifestyle. We both work and make about the same amount of money. At the end of the month, any money left over from budgeting is divided evenly between the two of us to spend as we will. We call it our “reward fund.” I like to save mine until I can make larger purchases, typically for a new guitar or related gear, and my wife spends it more quickly on things like food, clothes, etc. 

Well this morning I asked my wife about buying a new, moderately priced guitar, and she would have nothing to do with it. She told me that she is needing to get ready for graduate school and that we should not be spending a lot of money right now, even though it is supposed to be my money to spend how I please. 

The thing that gets me though is that I don’t tell her how to spend her money, and she has technically spent more of her reward fund than me since I have quite a bit more than her at this time. Adding to that, she wanted to go out and buy a bunch of home decor stuff today that we have not budgeted for.

I would like to sit down with her to let her know that this is bothering me, but anytime I try to have a conversation with her about stuff like this, she gets super mad/emotional and it just ends up putting a strain on our relationship.

Am I wrong for feeling bothered right now? I’d like to tell her that I am not comfortable with her dictating how I spend my money, but I also don’t want to deal with her becoming angry/emotional about it. She tends to self-loathe when I point out double standards like this and then it turns into me needing to validate her. 

Is there a way to approach her so that we can have a logical conversation about this, or should I just let it go?",19Nov2017,3

I kinda fell in with a bad crowd about a year ago. I've been in and out of trouble since, and I've been trying my best to clean up for a few months. Thing is, all my friends are druggies and there's nothing to do around here except drugs. There's no public transportation infrastructure, no parks worth a damn, no youth groups, no anything. I've been trying to move out but with the latest bit of trouble I'll be stuck here for a good long while.

I have the usual bunch of mental issues... Depression, anxiety, etc (seems like everyone around here does) and driving is really the only therapy that works for me but that's pretty well gone now. That leaves me getting to work and going home. That's it. I can't do that. That's why I started doing drugs in the first place.

244,"My life has not been going that well for a while. I had somewhat of a mental breakdown a while back and became homeless (I am somewhat fortunate in that I have a college degree). After looking in ads for jobs for a while, I moved in with a woman and was able to stay at her house for a while in return for doing chores around the house, doing some cooking for her and having sex with her (she takes the active role and I am more submissive).
She was very generous and she gave me an allowance which I have been saving up for when I can eventually move out. 

However, at times I feel as if I am a bit of a pet, rather than the useful servant I want to be. So, while I really like her I intend to move out as soon as I can and maybe travel around the United States and do work where I can get it. One more thing and that is while she has been very kind to me and she is gentle with me, she has made it clear that she does not want me to leave. She has quite a few BDSM implementss (such as handcuffs restraints and even a cage). While she has used some of these on me (handcuffs) consensually, I am bit worried that if I told her that I intend to leave, she will not be so gentle. I intend to leave one day (probably in a couple of months) when she is out at work (I regret that this will be a breach of her trust) and leave her a goodbye note.

So, after it closed I was a bit lost.

I even asked a bunch of friends to open a new server with me, thinking that I could take on such a big project because I was passionate about it, but they bailed out of the project a week in and I have no other friends I could turn to about it.

257,"Hey everyone, my girlfriend is in a tough spot right now and I need some advice. Here some background first. 

My girlfriend and I are 23 years old, both in college to become nurses. I start a nursing program this spring and she only has two classes left and she will graduate with her RN. We've been have been in a stable relationship for about a year now, however I have known her for around three years now. We currently do not live together, but we have plans to in about a year. I'm financially stable working part time at a very rewarding tech company.

Her situation is a little bit different. She works part time as well, but is barely meeting ends meet each semester because of the high workload of the program. Her issue right now is that she needs to look into a loan in order to register for her last classes in the nursing program. However that loan needs to cover the balance currently due and the remaining once registered; roughly 20k. She cannot get approved because her credit was ruined a couple years ago dealing with some family/financial issues. She also does not have a family member willing to cosign the loan. 

We've spoke about it a couple months ago, and I mentioned we can look into it, possibly I could cosign. She did not come to me asking to cosign and I didn't offer to cosign. Just that we can look into it and what it entails because I'm not familiar with it.

Currently she has three weeks to obtain a loan and after some phone calls/research and asking some close friends everyone says no. I totally understand where they are coming from because if I'm not willing to pay 20k I shouldn't be cosigning. It's just horrible to see how hard my girlfriend has worked and possibly having to withdraw and start in 1-2 years again. 

I really just need some opinions what people think about this situation. Possibly if there are obtaining loans with little or no credit. Worst care scenario she will have to withdraw and continue working on her credit, starting up next year.

258,"Hi, hello. So I’m an 18 year old girl and a bit over two months ago I had my first kiss. It happened with this girl I met a week before who is pretty openly a lesbian. I’m shy and inexperienced but she liked me so she flirted with me and took me places and finally she kissed me. After that, she asked if I was straight and I just shrugged because I wasn’t sure. Anyway, we met up the next day, then chatted and met up again after two weeks and that was the last time I saw her.

Now, the reason we haven’t seen each other since then is because she got back with her ex a few days after I was with her (I know this because of her Instagram (she posts a lot)). I was sad and cried over it but maybe like a week later I realised that I don’t actually have feelings for her. While I do find her incredibly attractive and beautiful and her voice and smell and pretty much everything about her is so appealing to me, I realised that I just became infatuated with her. I can’t actually have feelings for girls.

I think that most teens at this point would be like “oh, oops” but I just fell down a rabbit hole since then. I feel like I lied and tricked her about my sexuality. I’m afraid that she would think our time together meant nothing to me or that I did it because I was bored or as experimentation (nothing wrong with experimentation, that just wasn’t the case here).

The problem is also that I don’t have a reason to tell her anything, if that makes sense. The last night we were together it seemed as if she really liked me and wanted to spend more time with me and she wrote on my arm that she has written about me (she’s an artist), but she was back with her ex two days later. Which I get, they were together for a long time and seem like they’re still in love with each other. And I was just a fling that she probably doesn’t think about anymore.

I also realised, from some things she said, that she thinks that I’m gay/bi and can’t accept it, while I was just confused and haven’t really figured it out yet (I have my reasons which I won’t be disclosing here). Maybe she thought that she helped me figure out that I’m not straight. I don’t know.

I’d like to tell her all of this but I don’t think she’d care or maybe she’d get angry with me. Also I don’t want to invade her life since I’m someone she knew briefly and this is all on me, really has nothing to do with her.


I don’t think I explained the situation well enough since I don’t want to tell the things that were said and done between us, it feels too private. But yeah, this is what I’ve been thinking about and crying over non-stop for way too long and I see no way to put it to rest.

260,"ADVICE WANTED 

I'm 3 ½ months into the first semester of a Doctor of Physical Therapy program at the best school I could ever imagine been accepted to and I'M FAILING! I'm currently failing two classes, and redeeming myself would require final exam grades that at this point I don't think I'm capable of. It sounds like my academic advisor and professors are encouraging me to withdraw from the program and apply to a ""lesser"" program that I'll more easily get through. However, in doing so I'll loose TONS of money ($40,000+), at least two years (the application process is not easy and very time consuming), and I'll probably have a hard time getting into even the ""lesser"" programs as this withdraw will be a huge red flag and my application was mediocre to begin with. 

Here are my options: 
I could give those final exams a shot and see what happens. I would study as hard as possible and maybe even cheat off my neighbor just to earn passing grades in those classes. If I'm successful, I'll be placed on academic probation as my overall GPA will still be low since at best I'll earn a passing C in those classes. Then I'll have to work hard to bring my overall GPA up by the next semester or risk being dismissed from the program then. 

If I take those exams and fail, I don't think I'll be able to get into another DPT program, ever. I'm not sure of this, but it's the rumor on the street. 

If I withdraw, I will apply to other DPT programs, but still risk not getting accepted and spend tons of money and time in the process.

I could try to take medical leave and restart the program with next years class. My school hasn't offered me that option, but I hear it exists. This plan sounds perfect, but I have no idea how to accomplish it or if it's really even feasible. 

To add, I'm 30 years old and have been putting off other life goals like marriage and kids for my academic pursuit.

I am 31 years old and recently got married to a wonderful woman. We were living in Europe for a while (she is German) and then came back to my hometown of New York City. We had to move in with my parents because we didn't have jobs or an apartment upon returning to NYC. We thought this would be temporary until we found jobs and an apartment. Well if anyone is familiar with NYC, you know the rents are astronomical. Not only are rents high, but it's really hard to find a place even if you do have the money. And I have been unable to find a stable job thus far (I am a web developer). I have been applying to lots of jobs and had a couple interviews but no success so far. So we've been in this small apartment living with my parents for over 10 months now and it's starting to grate away at our relationship. It is also doing serious damage to my self-esteem (what 31 year old lives with his wife at his parents place?). We both need lots of personal space and our needs aren't being met here. 

I spend lots of time networking and looking for a full-time job but I just can't find one. And she is starting to make me feel really bad about my inability to 'provide' for our needs. I feel like I'm stuck in a hell and I don't know what to do.

266,"Tl;dr: Should I tell others not to use this website to buy things because it’s shady as fuck, or leave it go? 

I ramble a lot so figured I would put the tl;dr in the front, sorry. Just a quick question, I’ve just recently had a pretty shit experience with a certain website selling goods that is supposed to be an official hub for merch for this band my friend likes. Needed to get her a gift for Christmas. 

Either way, had limited time to deal with long shipping times so figured this was the best bet. I heard nothing for weeks, no status reported on the shipping. Until Tuesday. They created a shipping label. It’s Sunday and they’ve done nothing else. Okay, a little long, not that bad but still bothersome because I need to get this item and then ship it across the world again before Christmas. 

Messaged them, asked for a refund just so I can be safe and find something amazon prime instead. They said it’s already shipped. I mean, it really hasn’t. I looked up on twitter to see if anyone else has had these problems and they absolutely have. One person ordered a shirt in August and its end of November and they still haven’t gotten it. The other said “they told me it was a presale item that it will ship this week, still didn’t get it”

Alright. So I found their Facebook and messaged them, said they replied in a few hours so I wanted to make sure someone didn’t ignore my email like they’ve done with others. Just said, hey I bought a shirt, I’m wanting a refund. They replied “your shirt is a presale item and won’t be shipping until ___” they don’t even know what I bought so they can’t even know if it was a presale item. It pissed me off. Waiting to see if they’re going to give me a refund or not but I’ll be absolutely livid if I have to wait four damn months to get this shit to get my refund. 

So for the question: I run a social media account with nearly 200k followers and the demographic is absolutely 100% people who are potential customers of this website. I do not want this shit show to happen to anyone else. Should I make a statement, or only if they complicate this further? Should I not make a statement no matter what? I’m considering it. Sometimes we are blinded by emotions and make bad decisions, and I want a neutral party to help me sort out what I should do.

268,"The realisation dawned upon me when I was cleaning my utencils' cabinet recently. Every time I take something out from a cupboard/cabinet, there is a huge pile of related, yet unneeded pile that comes out alongwith. It is a hassle to deal with. It is a part of every aspect of the household - clothes, bedsheets, cutlery, utencils, shoes, magazines, bags, etc. This is my parents' place. 

I have a habit of purchasing fancy stationery and never using it, labelling it as a 'collection' when in reality, I believe it is the hoarders' genes kicking in. Same is with clothes as my clothes (even decades old are brand new). Just a while back, I realised my toys from my earlier years are brand spanking new because I rarely got to play with those (slightly abusive household, I know) and I have never given the toys away. I look down upon children who continuously play and break their toys.

My maternal uncle's family have the same habit of not giving toys to their children - hiding it and citing 'being expensive for everyday use' and even punishing them with taking it away and never returning it. 

Looking at all of this and my effected thought process from afar, I cannot but wonder WTH?! 

I will be getting married next week and I do not want to go down the same path with my kids. How do I break the cycle?

I want a relationship where my girlfriend trusts me enough to have sex with girls with her, but I would never want it the other way around. And even though I could hold off on having sex with other girls, I feel like I would feel extremely accomplished and like my girlfriend was really into me for letting me do that. 

But it’s not true. I would never want my girlfriend to feel the same way because no matter how into her I am, I would never want to see her have sex with another guy or even think about it. And all last night I was thinking about how if I had a girlfriend and I told her I want her to have sex with other guys with me, she would almost positively be excited for that. And it made me so sad! 

It’s why girls post pictures on reddit nsfw so much and do the wife sharing thing, but I am so hypocritical. Why wouldn’t I allow a girl to do that? Why does that disgust me? How am I supposed to feel? Why am I so hypocritical? If I was in an “open” relationship like that, I would never feel strongly about the girl. I would start to lose attraction to her immensely...

This is just a ramble but I *know* other people feel this way. It makes me lose hope on any more real love in my life. It makes me just think people are fleeting but it’s so unfair to me. Why do I have to be so possessive and want a girl who’s possessive too, but in a way where she wants the best for me so she’ll let me have sex with other girls and her? Why is this a fantasy of mine? If the best for her was having sex with other guys with me, I would think so much less of her :/. What the FUCK?",19Nov2017,2

274,"I received a call from my grandmother this morning that the the police department contacted her by voicemail, that it is ""important"" that I communicate with police about my father, who I have not spoken with in 10 years, and have met twice (I am 20 now). 

It being sunday, I left a voicemail and will call the number provided again tomorrow. I assume at the moment that my father has passed, although no one in that half of the family has any information regarding him. He resided in California, last I heard. He is about 50, has been exposed to agent orange and has a wide range of the side effects caused by it, which extends my belief that he has passed. 

I wonder if any of you have knowledge or advice, I have a large amount of anxiety, and fear that there is something that I've done, as my father is not on my birth certificate. I have no idea how they are connecting me to him.

275,"I’ve been working at my company for 2.5 years now, overall my salary is pretty good but I recently asked for a raise. 

Some background: I have been independent and have been taking on a lot of responsibility which justified the raise. In my 2.5 years my boss has never once taught me anything and I have been learning everything on my own. 

About a year ago, my boss hired a younger employee. He, on a regular basis teaches her outside of work hours and helps her out in ways I’ve never been helped. He puts a lot of his time and energy in helping her succeed. My issue is that he has never done this for me (and some other employees) and it’s been bringing down my morale. 

I did end up getting a raise, but the younger employee also got a raise and now her salary is higher than mine. 

Should I confront my boss? If so, how and what do I say? Thanks in advance for anyone who has a suggestion. ",19Nov2017,2
276,"I am a student. Besides my studies, I am active in a student association (15h/week) and I'm doing a small internship (8h/week). I'm busy all the time.

This year has been a hard one for me privately. My boyfriend has moved far away from me, which I find really hard to handle. Some people close to me are struggling with psychological problems and I found out I have a 50 percent chance of having a genetic predisposition for cancer.

All of this, combined with my busy life, makes me feel stressed all the time. I have heart palpitations, eczema and trouble sleeping.

279,"My grandfather lives in a condo complex and there is a small forest behind his property. Living in and around the forested area behind his condo is a small family of 4 kittens and a mother cat. My grandfather feeds the cats food every day and they hang out on his patio and under his covered patio furniture. (We put some blankets under there for warmth.)

It's getting cold out and my family wants to catch the kittens so they don't freeze to death. We've called animal control, but they've said that they can't take any more animals and they won't come out to catch them for us. We've also contacted some rescues in the area but they seem to only offer traps. We'd still have to catch them ourselves.

Is there any good/specific way to catch the kittens and the mother? What is the best strategy to use? Will the traps even work? How would we use them? What would we use to put in the traps? The kittens are extremely fast and slippery. Any suggestions would be helpful. We just don't want them to freeze to death.

I also realize kittens need to be a certain age before they can be caught. I think it's 10 weeks. We don't know how old they are, but they've been around for a couple months and eat solid food.",19Nov2017,4
280,"Hi. I'm concerned about myself. 

I'm bipolar but I've been very stable for the last year with no episodes. I'm in a relationship that has been very stable until the last few weeks, I'm not having issues showing up for my student teaching on time every day, and I'm full time in a graduate program where I have been successful until now (I even made it on the deans list the last 3 quarters! Go me!).

In the last few months (this quarter) my father has been absent from my life and in the past we've been very close. He's a narcissist and has always made me feel like shit, and things got worse when him and his narcissist wife adopted a baby (he's almost 60). He cut me out of his life completely about 3 weeks ago and then told everyone that I gave him an ultimatum to choose between me and his wife and left him no option (I didn't give him any sort of ultimatum and have even had my therapist and boyfriend look through messages and emails to make sure I didn't do this). It has been a stressful situation for me and I've spent a lot of time mourning the loss of my father in my life.

My sister's health has deteriorated significantly and she has been in and out of the hospital, including a month long stay in September. After receiving a pretty bad prognosis she has had some mental health issues as well. My family (including me and my boyfriend) have alternated care for her, including taking her to doctors appointments several times a week. My boyfriend and I have started to support her financially, and I'm having to accept that my sister is dying.

My boyfriend and I have been a little rocky lately after he was getting too close with a female friend. We've been going to counseling and fighting a lot and have been toying with the idea of me moving out.

So I have these three big sources of stress on top of student teaching and full time graduate school. 

The thing is, I haven't been in a depressive episode or anything. I wake up easily, sleep easily, go to college, student teach every day, go grocery shopping, shower... I'm a fully functioning human being. 

I am incredibly stressed out, but I'm oddly calm about it. When I think about everything I'm so anxious that I'm sick to my stomach. I'm constantly paranoid about how I interact with people and the things that I say, especially when talking to people who know and talk to my dad. I'll say something about my life to my cooperating teacher or anyone who knows my dad and think about it for days. 

I've kept my anxiety and stress to myself. I come off as totally calm and having my shit together. My family and friends think I'm ok. I haven't talked about my stress level with anyone except for my therapist, and he moved away 2 weeks ago so I haven't talked to anyone since then, including my boyfriend who I live with. When I'm at school teaching or talking to my family and stuff I can ignore the stress and anxiety (except for some social anxiety) so in those moments I feel and look fine. 

There's one area where I'm not functioning properly... I cannot do my homework. I just cant. I stall and I procrastinate and then when I start to do it I just can't. I go to college on Saturdays and I was realizing how behind I am and started crying in front of my cohort yesterday. I just can't do it. 

Is my not being able to do my homework related to my stress? or am I just lazy? I got an extension on my classwork because of my sister, but my other sister and mom told me that I'm just choosing to avoid my homework because they've seen me at my worst and this isn't it. Is that true? Can avoidance be a symptom of stress even if I'm not showing other symptoms of depression? Or do I just need to get my shit together and keep up?

I feel super overwhelmed by everything but I don't understand how I'm functioning in every other area of life and just not homework. Maybe I just have senioritis? Other people are struggling with motivation in my program also, but still finishing assignments in time. I'm worried that I'm actually just lazy and being dramatic. 

tl;dr I'm under a lot of stress because of my family drama, a rocky relationship, and my sister's health problems, on top of full time teaching and graduate school. I haven't been able to buckle down and do homework regardless of fully functioning in every area of my life. Am I just lazy and unmotivated? Or just stressed and showing it in a weird way?",19Nov2017,2
281,"I don’t know how to handle a family situation. I have a 15 month old son, he’s my husband’s and my only child. Earlier this year, my husband’s uncle was arrested for possession of child pornography. He was on house arrest for a while, and now he is serving time on the weekend in jail. He is now a registered sex offender. I have no clue what kind of material it was, I don’t think it matters. My husband says it was downloaded accidentally with other kinds of porn and he didn’t know anything contained images of minors. 

My mother in law asked if we would be uncomfortable having him at Christmas with us. I said I am absolutely uncomfortable with it. Now I am the one preventing a family member from being with his family at Christmas. 

Am I overreacting? My son would be the only child present. Everyone seems to believe this was all an accident, that he acknowledges he was using shady websites to download porn but he didn’t mean to access illegal material. I say there’s no way that happens accidentally.

My husband is so torn, he’s still processing all of this. We live far away so this is the first time we’ve been forced to actually deal with it. It’s his relative after all, a guy he’s looked up to his whole life.

After being violently sexually assaulted and half drowned in a shower by my ex girlfriend I've been terrified of women enough to feel unsafe around them alone and am even anxious around other members of my family.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/68677o/was_i_raped_i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_it_and_im/]

I posted this question for r/askwomenadvice but got no response ans since its international mens day, i thought i'd celebrate by getting the help i so desperately need. 

I am thinking of going to a doctor and seeing a psychiatrist because if I detach myself from myself I may be suffering PTSD based on the nightmares about her, the anxiety, the intrusive thoughts, a small anxiety about showering which I've overcome, and general fear of being in that situation again. 

I have gone on dates (in a public place of course)  and gone through a few self destructive phases since I got away but I always pushed away anyone I thought might get close to me. 
And every time I'm alone with a woman and a fsir bit with men regardless of who they are I feel an anxious pervasion of thoughts like whether or not theyre going to assault me. 

I pretty much just hole up in my basement flat and only leave for to buy food and go to work.
I have bad days and good days, it's the difference between wanting to get up and teach myself something or hiding in a corner on my bed wrapped in sheets hugging a stuffed dog I bought from Ikea because I can't get a real dog to protect me and to hug for a few years. 

I've tried online dating in the hopes that I might be able to meet someone who I can trust but so far between low self esteem and fear there's no chance. 
I did try to kill all remnants of the person I used to be in an attempt to not be the person who got assaulted.
But so far all I've managed was to ask my colleagues to call me by a different surname whilst I work in the school, i did plan to legally change my surname but my family guilt tripped me out of it. 

So yeah that's my story/rant
So I'm asking for advice on how I can stop fearing women or at least stop having nightmares about my ex.?

So I [F21] recently broke up with someone I stayed 2 years with. I honestly don't know why I was with him in the first place. I was depressed when we met, and he has helped me so much, but we were not compatible at all, there was no passion, it didn't even feel like a real relationship but I didn't realise that until this summer, when I broke up. It was my first relationship.

Recently I started dating someone, and he's amazing. There's a spark, I feel a connexion. It happened very quickly though, and I feel like I don't know how to handle it. I feel extremely happy to be with someone like him, I'm extremely happy to feel what I'm feling and to experience what I'm experiencing, but I also feel overwhelmed by what's happening and even... sad sometimes? I don't know why, I have no reason to be. 

My childhood was kind of complicated and I used to be very lonely, by choice, because I was afraid to be made fun of, to suffer, etc, I would avoid creating meaningful relationships with people out of fear. Now that it's happening, I feel like I don't know how to deal with it. Maybe that's the reason I'm sad? Maybe deep down I'm still terrified of whatever might happen?

I’m 21, and I live at my moms house. My parents are divorced. my mom is the most abusive and toxic person I’ve ever met. We get into arguments every time we interact. I’ve dealt with it my whole life but I really cannot take it anymore. It’s severely affecting my mental health (I’m diagnosed with anxiety, bipolar, EDNOS). I’m currently not in treatment but I use cannabis for my panic attacks and for getting to sleep and it helps a lot.
Anyways, I have been extremely busy with work and school and I’ve been very stressed out in those areas. My mother just makes it worse. 
So we had an argument today and she told me to move out. She’s threatened kicking me out before but this time I think she was serious. And if she wasn’t I still want out. 
I considered moving in with my dad, who lives with my grandparents in a 2 bedroom apartment. I’d be fine sleeping on the couch or whatever.
Heck I’d live in my car if it means I could get away.
I have a place where I could stay for a little while (my friends house) but I need a solid living area. 
Idk what to do....like I said I have a job but it’s kinda inconsistent so it’s probably not enough for rent somewhere. I’ve tried getting another/a different job for the last few months and gotten some interviews but no luck. And I don’t want to drop out of school again.

In time, I had to get back to work and he had some things to tend to anyway, so I parted ways with him just for a week and told him to think of me and to just be patient with the drugs until he saw me again.  
Several days later, he used again and it's been down hill from there.  
I helped him again but after some time, I told him that if he used again, then I couldn't be around him.  
I've met plenty of other people who use but they usually have some control over themselves. He on the other hand becomes an entirely different person and is horrible to be around.  
He used anyway and I've been away from him since.

it turns out that he made a lot of people upset and, I can not imagine why anyone would do that, but he is actually still alive.  
  
He will not admit him self to rehab and the police in Colorado say their jails are too full and he is on his own.

He has no plans on attending rehab and there is no one there for him.

His dad wants nothing to do with him.  
  
I am in Virginia right now but plan on returning to Colorado.  
I don't want to hear that my friend is dead and it makes me want to return to Colorado and beat him up.  
I just want to beat him up so that he's disabled for a week, whether laying disabled in a car or in a hospital.  
Then, when he is better, I want to kick his ass again so that he just can't use.
