0,"This year we get class ring orders and they're expensive! Sure you can get other things like mugs or necklaces as well, but is it worth getting an object that you probably won't use or wear after a couple years? Sure I guess it's a good sentimental. But again is it really worth spending hundreds of dollars on?",16Sep2017,2
2,"So every Friday for 3 years my family has ordered pizza from Pizza hut. Once or twice a month, when I go to pick up the order, I'm told that the pizza was made wrong (never how it was made wrong) and I'll have to wait for it to be remade. I'm never given any other options, and I've thought about just telling them to cancel my order and leaving because of how often this is happening, but as this is not my money and other people's food, I can't do that.


They don't always remake the pizza. One of the recent times this happened, I ordered green chile on all of it and banana peppers on half and they botched it by not putting on banana peppers at all. This was discovered after I had been waiting for 15 minutes already. Instead, they ran banana peppers through the oven on their own and then put it on the pizza? First of all, It wasn't until I got home that i realized it took that long for them to fix the problem because my phone died while I was waiting. The banana peppers didn't stay on, and I had to wait for ten minutes for them to heat the banana peppers up while they let the pizza get cold on the counter. 4 times out of 10, the order is made wrong and I have to wait for it to be made right...or for them to heat the toppings and dump them on the pizza.


Half of those times, I'm given a half-assed apology and a 2-liter of soda. The other half of the time, no one tells me absolutely anything and four or five other people will come in to pick up before mine is even touched to be re-made.


The only reason this has gone on for so long is because my dad is obsessed with getting pizza from this specific pizza hut every Friday, and since he's at home while I'm waiting he doesn't seem to care and I don't know how to person.


What is a healthy way to respond to being told my pizza was made wrong and I'll have to wait that will get the point across that this happens too often for it to be okay?



TL;DR: Family has been ordering pizza from Pizza hut for 3 years, but once a month or 4 out of 10 times the order is wrong. I'm just tired of being understanding and polite when it happens so often. I don't want to be angry, abusive, or rude but I do really have no idea what to do when this happens. Is it alright for me to ask for something since I had to wait? I've waited upwards of 20 minutes before getting visibly upset and asking if there was a problem with my food and was about to ask for a refund, and that's when they started giving me the sodas if my order was wrong.",16Sep2017,2
3,"Hey guys. These upcoming days I will invite a friend of mine (girl) to eat fish with in a local restaurant. I do not know what kind of fish I like. I mean, I eat fish, but I don't know the names of the fishes, plus I'm super picky with whatever meat I eat as I really prefer it fat-free. 

I am open to advice as to how to not completely embarrass myself by learning what to get, what drink to combine it with etc. etc.. Thanks in advance!

5,"I posted this on a different subreditt but didn't really receive much help although I did get some good advice. 
This is how it goes. 
Lately I have found myself wrapped up in a problem that is really interfering with my day to day life. The problem is that I can't stop thinking about girls. I see a girl that I find attractive and I already become infatuated. I finally muster up the courage to speak to her and now I can't stop thinking about a girl. I think it may be my hormones but it's driving me into depression. I have been reading the Bible, it helps temporarily but the thoughts come back. I have this one girl that I have been thinking about and I only spoke to her twice. I don't know what to do. Also I don't masturbate or anything. Teenager just in case you were wondering.",16Sep2017,1
7,"So I got a new job like two months ago. Obviously I tried to be friendly to everyone to integrate the team. Which went fine.  

Anyway, here is the issue with a co-worker of mine. Long story short, he called me multiples ""pretty internalfarts"". But it was in context like ""here comes pretty internalfarts"" or something like that when I come in the morning so I thought it was meant to be friendly. 

Everyone working there are kinda friends. I know some hang out outside of work, have diners etc... Anyway, he asked me to eat supper with him and I really thought it was friendly. The week before that he told me he is in love with a girl who used to work there and who doesn't like him back. So no reason to think it's supposed to be flirting with me anyhow. 
Problem is, it wasn't and he spent the evening opening doors for me, etc... 

I absolutely never did anything flirty at all forward him since I'm a lesbian, I can really say for sure he isn't my type, but I'm not out at work. Schedules kinda changed at work (which is unrelated to him) but now I often work 5 or 6 hours with him so it's not really possible to avoid him. 

I tried to be less friendly to him today. And his reaction was to try even more to get my attention. By making noises, or singing my name or asking me questions he already asked me multiples times or doing whatever things like that. Which I could react to the first five times but it quickly became hard to know what to answer to someone who is whistling in the same room than you and expect you to react. 

Anyway, I don't know how to reject him nicely. He doesn't seem to know how to read between the lines at all. I would rather not to come out at work. Also, a few coworkers seems to be his friends, so I think they know about it. His sister who also work there and kinda became my buddy seems to know about it because she asked me if I was mad at him or something. 

So I find it even harder to reject him because it's a little like publicly rejecting him or something. So I guess it was bitchy of me to kinda ignore him, but I have no idea how to handle this type of situation. Sorry for the venting. Any advice would really be appreciated :)

8,"We're talking about 30-60 minute scream-at-the-top-of-your-lungs sessions. No way of knowing if it will result in a violent incident. Chances are low, but you never know. Remember Kitty Genovese? Don't want to be guilty of the bystander effect.

On the other hand, I was strongly raised in a ""mind your own business"" environment, and I would hate to get a knock on my door whenever I am having an argument at home. Therefore, so far I've done nothing.

But this is a quiet suburban neighborhood. These ladies are loud enough to be heard clearly *in* our house, and they're not even our next door neighbors. And it's an ongoing thing. If it had only been the one time, I wouldn't think about it twice. But tonight was maybe the 10th time since they moved in half a year ago.

I have thought of some options:

* Keep doing nothing. But I'd hate to have to shut my windows every time this happens. Plus I feel like I should be doing something.

* Call the cops. I just hate involving the cops, if there is no violence (yet). Plus it would like  be a *thing*. Ew. Pass.

* Knock on their door the next time it happens. The responsible, adult option. ""Is everything alright?"" My fellow introverts will understand why this is a distasteful option. The mere thought stresses me out.

* Leave an anonymous note. I think this is my preferred option. Not sure what would be the most effective text. ""Next time we're totally calling the cops."" (Yeah, right.)

A difficult situation (for me). What do you suggest?",16Sep2017,1
9,"Should I give up and move on, or maybe just admire from a distance, or maybe try to pursue acting to up my chances by maybe .001%? I can't shake these feelings and someone like me would never in 1 million years ever even have a chance with someone like her. My mind is spinning and it won't stop. Everytime I see her, I get a weird feeling in my stomach and my ears go red but I can't just forget about her. In fact, she's been such an inspiration to me (and maybe I've been just a little too obsessed with her) that I've started dieting and working out and have even thought about pursuing acting in the hopes that one day, things could happen. What's wrong with me? Should I see a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist? Will these feelings ever stop? I feel like if they did though, I'd just go back to my old self, depressed, lonely, quiet, shy, afraid to even go outside, but when I think of her, I feel motivated to get things done and focus on bettering myself and becoming a part of society. I would probably be on the verge of suicide without her. Help me please, I'm so confused.",16Sep2017,1

I know I hate driving, so I stuck to less busy back road highways. I also drove the speed limit for 90% of the time (slowed a bit before for some sharp turns). 

Despite this, for like half an hour I slowly accumulated a line of 5-6 cars behind me because I don't speed (I feel uncomfortable going over the speed limit).

26,"So my 12 year old sister has a reoccurring habit of not doing her homework and telling us she has already completed it whenever we ask. We only find out about the truth when the teacher emails us about it. After each incident she'll be really hardworking, but give it a few weeks and she goes back to lying. 
This has happened many times already and I feel like I'm wasting my breath now whenever I punish her for it. But I can't let her do as she pleases, cause she's my sister and this issue is causing my mother stress. 

It's not the issue about not doing her homework that is our biggest concern now, it's her lying habit or maybe her ability to not grasp that consequences comes with her actions. 

I've asked her before if she knew not doing her homework and then lying about it to all of us would get her in trouble. And she said she didn't know this would happen. Bear in mind, the exact same thing happened just a few weeks ago. 

And I just don't know what to do... How could she not know? Did she really just not think at all that anything would come back to bite her? Would really appreciate any suggestions or any explanations for her behaviour. She's still 12 and mistakes now are fine but I just don't want her growing up to be an impulsive liar. ",16Sep2017,1

BUT on the other hand, I have the knowledge to hopefully repair the frame, I feel kind of attached to it because its my first vehicle. I mean I could repair it and just keep it rolling till the engine or transmission dies. Hell I only just got the A/C working again after replacing literally every part of it over 2 years. Plus I really don't like driving, I only do it because I have to, so spending a bunch of money on something new seems like a waste to me.

Encouraging words? Thoughts?

My mom wants me to go to London with her and my brother in a couple weeks. My brother keeps changing things around on her (he's a functional alcoholic... I guess) and she was getting worried she'd end up spending the trip alone. I agreed to go since she's paying for my airfare and she already has hotel accommodations. How awesome right? We will be gone a week.

I have always struggled with anxiety, spent many years in therapy, on medication, lately, mostly off of it. I am having such severe anxiety about leaving my kids (3 and 6) that part of me doesn't want to go anymore. The terrorist attack today really made that worse. Sigh.

I feel totally ridiculous for even feeling this way but my mind keeps going to ""what about my kids if something happens to me"" and also feeling like my youngest is going to be so sad and not understand why I can't just come home. He's always so excited to see me when I get home from work.

38,"My twin brother, lets call him X, keeps FUCKING STEALING STUFF. The problem started back when we were young, maybe 6 or 7. I don't remember much but I do know that he would say he had to ""use the bathroom"" when we were at stores and he would go to the toy aisle and open the packaging of toys and take them. From then on we would have constant problems with him and his stealing and lying. He won't STOP FUCKING LYING &gt;:(. This went on until we were 11 or 12, and he seemed to have matured. His problems seemed to have gone away and he stopped stealing and such. We are now both 13. This event occurred maybe 10-15 minutes before I started writing this. X and I both play this game called Roblox, we both enjoy it. So I'm bored and I go through his roblox profile and find maybe 100-150 dollars worth of virtual items. I ask him, ""Hey X, how the heck did you get so much robux(the premium currency of roblox)!?!"" He also had these items that you get from redeeming codes from these little roblox toys, and I also ask him ""And how did you get roblox toys!?"". I know we never bought any roblox toys, as our parents don't want us wasting money on games. He says he used a code generator to get roblox toys and he did some survey website to get the robux. I know he was full of BS when he said he used a generator for the roblox toy codes. I also knew there was no way he could get 150 dollars worth of premium currency from a survey offer website. So I ask him, ""X, there is no way you used a code generator for roblox toys, who did you take them from?"" He keeps insisting he used the generator, until say I will get our parents involved. He then confesses that he opened the roblox toy boxes at target and copied the codes down. HE FUCKING STOLE ROBLOX TOY CODES FOR STUPID ASS VIRTUAL HATS. This got me pissed. I started interrogating him and kept questioning him, asking him why he would steal ROBLOX TOYS from Target. He keeps saying ""I don't know"" like 50 times. And you would not believe how pissed I get about this. This is when things get heated. I then ask him how he got 150 dollars worth of robux. He keeps crying and shouting at me, insisting that he used the robux survey offers. I keep questioning him, asking how he got the money and if he stole our parents credit card, and when he doesn't budge, saying he didn't steal anything, I raise my voice loud enough for my parents to hear across the house and say ""SO YOU'RE TELLING ME, YOU DID NOT STEAL ANY ROBLOX TOYS FROM TARGET?"". This gets him CRAZY. He starts crying and slamming his head on the table, saying ""IM TELLING THE TRUTH, STOP BOTHERING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"". This gets my very, very upset. I then start walking out, saying ""I guess I'll just tell mom and dad that you stole roblox toys then"". He cracks and starts telling me that he used ""leftover money I gave him (I did give him money) to buy roblox cards from publix, and a 50 dollar best buy gift card he got for his birthday (which he did get)"". I get very upset. I'm thinking, first you say all you used was a survey offer for robux, crying, saying you're telling the truth, then you suddenly bring up ""leftover money"" and the gift card. I ask him that, and he just starts crying and freaking out. Keep in mind we are both 13. So I keep asking him, ""Why would you steal a freaking ROBLOX TOY from Target??"" again and again, and he keeps freaking out and getting mad. He then goes up to me and punches me in the neck. Naturally, I get very pissed and try to hit him back. He turns around when I go for his stomach and I jab his back twice. He tries to hit me in the head and I sweep kick his leg. I jump away and he starts crying and falls to the ground, saying his leg hurts, which it probably does. I get him up and as far as I know he is fine right now. When I tried to see if he was ok he just yelled ""GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME"". Keep in mind this was at 10:30 or so. So I ask him one final time, ""X, why did you steal roblox toys from target?"" He says ""Its over, ok!"". I say, ""No, it's not. You think this is some little thing right now and no one will notice, but its NOT. You keep doing this, and you'll go to jail soon."" He says, ""I'm sorry, OK!"". Keep in mind he is saying all this angrily, angry that he got caught. I then say, ""If you're really sorry you would've stopped all this stealing nonsense years ago. But look at you, back at it again with all this bullshit."" He starts going berserk, and I ask him one last time, ""Why did you steal roblox toys from target?"". He finally cracks and says ""Because I wanted it, ok!!!"". This gets my pissed. We thought he got over this shit already. This is when my dad calls for us and we both go away from each other. After my dad is done calling us I come here and type this. 

Sorry if this is barely legible, I am very upset and not that good at writing about present events or whatever you call it. I completely understand if I handled this wrong, and please someone tell me if I did. Please give me serious advice. Feel free to criticize me, I just need help with X. He's my twin brother, and I love him, which is why I get so pissed when he keeps slipping up. He can't seem to get this though, and he thinks I'm just bullying him, which I might be. Again, feel free to yell at me, and tell me if I'm handling this like a complete dickbag. 

Also I don't know what to do. I would tell my parents, but I don't want to stress them out more and ruin everyone's week. When X  gets grounded or in trouble, he makes everyone's week or 2 weeks a living hell, or until he gets ungrounded. My mother has a heart condition, and if she gets over stressed she will get very, very ill. I'm also afraid of telling my parents because I don't want to ruin my family bonds with my twin, and I don't want him doing something crazy like harming himself. He already bangs his head on walls when he gets called out for doing something wrong by my mom and dad. X, my twin, doesn't have any mental problems as far as I know and all my family knows. So should I tell my parents or what??? I don't know what to do!!!

Again, if I'm handling this completely wrong, please please please  tell me. Tell me anything. ",16Sep2017,1

I was recently prepped and ready for a urine examination with a large theme park company in Texas, was siked for the opportunity to work on their International Financing team as well. Sadly I was suprised with a follicle exam and while I was still confident (3+ months since smoking), my results were positive for thc. Their medical review officer apparently made a case for me not being a habitual user/testing possibly having an extended time frame depending on the patient, but ultimately the test was taken into higher regard. I was on good terms with the team/VPs and was wondering if you all think it would be out of this world to offer my condolences to them.

49,"So I work at a Target.   Earlier in the year, I worked a 1pm to 8pm shift throughout the week and I loved it.  Well, as much as you could love something like that at Target.  Some time in the middle of the year though, we went through a corporate ""restructuring"" where pretty much meant that shift and indeed the whole position was eliminated.  They moved me from that shift to a 4am to 1230pm shift and I have not adjusted well.  I've worked 4 days in a row now and I haven't gotten more than 3 hours of sleep at a time.  It is really messing with me, and now, because of my lack of sleep, I am becoming scared of sleeping.  It's weird, but it's true.  I am thinking about quitting and testing the job market.  I have already asked to switch to something else but they said that those shifts aren't available right now and I suspect they don't want me over there anyway.   I have a bachelor's degree in Geography and I feel like i should be making better than $10/hr.   Should i quit or should I stay?  I do live with my parents although I do have pretty high car payments.  

TL;DR Work changed my schedule to early morning and I am not adjusting well.  Wondering if I should quit seeing as I have a bachelor's degree and work right now is Target.

Her dad has 2 brothers (including my father) that have recently found out about what she does but they haven't talked to me or the rest of my family about what they want to do. Her mother doesn't want to do anything because M makes plenty of money to support herself and her mother. I'm pretty sure M and her boyfriend also sell drugs to make money.

58,"So me and a friend share the same birthday and I wanted to do something but didn’t want to hog the spotlight so to speak. I texted him on Wednesday asking this
&gt;“Would you want to do some sort of collaborative party? I was thinking of like having people over for dinner but I don’t want to hog the spotlight so to speak. “

He responded “Yeah sure! We could do something at my house later too.” 

Great, I thought! We will invite some friends and have a nice night celebrating our birthdays. 

We had 18 people coming and my parents were alright with it if my friends family covered half the cost of food and drinks. My friend said that would be fine. So I invited all 18 people and most of them are coming. Again, great! I’m really excited. 

Mind you I have repeatedly asked him who he wants to invite to the party and if he has any requests but was never given an answer. 

It is worth noting he is more of a quiet kid and isn’t big about parties but we went to a party a few months back and he seemed to enjoy himself so when he agreed to it I didn’t think anything else of it. This is partial my ignorance but it didn’t appear to be a problem. 

Come 11:00pm tonight, with the party tomorrow, he texts me asking “Is it alright if I don’t pay for any of the food?” 

I replied
&gt;“I mean I can’t force you but you should have told me sooner because splitting the bill was how we could invite more people. I’m sorry. I tried making it both of our parties but I didn’t really have much to work with from you. “

At this point I am pissed because now I have to pin the cost of food on my parents and they are slightly annoyed to hear that. Now all my plans are up in the air and now I don’t know if I can still have the party. All because he backed out last minute. In the midst of my anger, I told him to “not bother coming”. I hated doing it but I felt disrespected by him and I didn’t want him to be there anymore. 

I thought I was doing something nice for him and I was excited but now it’s going to inevitably cause drama amongst my friends on my damn birthday. I may be biased but I pride myself on being self aware and open to admitting when I’m wrong but I feel like I am completely in the right here and what he does was not cool at all.

I was in a 1 year relationship with my ex(20) and I(23) deep down loved her with all my heart, but she dumped me. I also like to mention a month before she dumped me she slept with another girl. (She's Bi) I was shocked and confused. I didnt know what to do. I gave her my heart. I gave her my soul. A few days after the breakup I found another girl who was same scenario as me. Problem was it was my best friend's girlfriend. Long story short we ended up sleeping together after a long night of partying. I kept it a secret for two weeks but I felt awful so i told the truth to my friend. I even told my ex because we still wanted to keep things mutual. After they heard what I said they both kicked me out of their lives. I keep blaming myself because I let anger and alcohol take a hold of me but even I cant use that as an excuse.

60,"Hi,

I've been feeling really, idk, sad lately. I really don't want to say depressed because I don't want to believe that I am with all of the horrable stories and side affects associated with depression.

But I just can't help but feel all kinds of negative emotions right now..

So basically here's my situation:

I'm 19 years old, and i am about to start my second year of college. My brother is in high school and he currently has a girlfriend. I have never had a girlfriend and I barely have any friends who are girls. I've just been too shy and too picky when it comes to girls, and Ive always hated parties and super social events so that's pretty much why I'm a second year in college and I've barely talked, interacted, or dated girls.

I was pretty okay with not being around girls, I was too swamped with homework as an engineering major and, idk, I just didn't feel jealous about other people having girl friends or anything. I was happy with the friends I had. I just didn't really think about getting a girl friend or feel desperate or anything.

But since this summer started, that all changed.

This summer was by far the longest one I've ever had, which is cuz my college has a really long summer vacation and starts school in late September rather than late august like most schools. So this long break from school, this long break of me being alone in my room with nothing to do, has given me tons of time to think and reflect. 

The more I thought about my past, the more sad I got. I've been watching a lot of teen/high school themed Netflix shows lately, and that has made me realize that I've missed out on so much. I've never experienced what it's like to have a high school girlfriend, and I'm approaching my second year of college having never kissed a girl or anything. I've barely hugged any girls.

What really pushed me to my limit is when my brother got a girlfriend. This happened a few weeks ago, and at today my brother told me that they had sex for the first time. 

Now, as I said above, I didn't really care much or felt jealous about other people having girl friends before. But hearing that my younger brother not only has a girlfriend, but he kissed and had sex, just made me absolutely overwhelmed with jealousy. 

I just feel like such a loser now, I feel like my brother is doing everything that I didn't do and *wished* I did in high school. And I just feel like I'm wasting my life just sitting at home for this long, long summer while my baby brother is having the time of his life.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to feel this way, I just want to be happy for my brother but I can't. I hate jealousy but I just can't help but feel it right now and idk what do.

62,"So, basically, my best friend (20/F) met her boyfriend (19/M) last March (so about 6 and a half months ago) and we also became roommates at that time. Anyway, her boyfriend also had depression and anxiety so she thinks spending every breathing second with him is a good idea, but we won't talk about that. 

So from around that March when they started dating to May when they had become more serious, her boyfriend cheated on her and she found out while he was in the hospital at one point and he couldnt have his phone so she looked at it and found some texts. She completely forgave him for it, and made excuses for him. Look, I never dated anyone yet, but I sure as hell am not stupid. I hate when people don't hold themselves to a higher standard. 

Not long after, I get informed by my best friend, who didn't want to even tell me in the first place, that her boyfriend asked her to marry her. Of course she knows me well enough to already know my opinion in the subject, but as much as me and another mutual friend try to tell her not to do it, she doesn't want to hear it.

There could be a whole list of reasons for them to not get married (like the fact he cheated real bad, they're way too young--that has a lot of reasons within itself), it's just too bad some people don't care to obtain that kind of common sense. So I know they're probably gonna get married sometime soon and she would 9.9/10 expect me to be there, but I'm not about to go to something I don't support and think is just stupid and poor judgement...does anyone think differently?",16Sep2017,1
63,"I'll start this with my day at work today. As of late, I've been feeling very gloomy and empty inside, almost like my depression is coming back. Listening to music, I was cleaning up my workplace before closing. My coworker, a female, came up to me and hugged me; I hugged her back, not thinking much of it at the time; but fast forward to when I got home; I was playing ""Rosemary"" by Deftones while laying in bed, one thought train led to another, and the event that occurred at work kept popping up in my brain. Towards the end of the song, my eyes began welling up, and rolled down my cheeks, slowly at first. Eventually, it turned into a complete breakdown, where I just could not stop sobbing. I kept thinking about my need for unconditional love that my family isn't providing for me, how lonely I am, and the hug that happened at work. 

Please give me any tips, ideas, or thoughts. Is this loneliness? Why did I just burst out crying? How can I rationalize this and apply it to my life in a positive way? What does this mean? Any and all suggestions would vastly help.",16Sep2017,3

65,"Hi there. I'm a sixteen year old boy and since I was ten or eleven I've always had a stigma against women in relationships vs. guys in relationships and I'm aware that I do it, and I hate that I do it.

For example, I can see a guy dating a bunch of women or something along those lines in a movie or show and I have almost no issues with it. But when a girl in media does the same thing and it's from her perspective I subconsciously feel that it's wrong and gross and that she should be choosy and whatnot. 

And it's not just in media either, in real life if one of my male friends gets a girlfriend I congratulate him and I'm genuinely happy for him; but if a female friend gets a boyfriend who she really likes I can say that I'm happy for her and congrats, but underneath I don't actually feel that despite not having any romantic feelings towards said girl. I feel that it's wrong, even more so if she's a close friend of mine.  

I was recently watching a show with a female lead and in the show she has a crush on someone. I felt that she was ""too good"" for the interest and that she shouldn't do that. But then in my head I noticed my hypocrisy and I reversed the roles; I had no problem with the swapped version mentally and that's what bothers me. I'm okay with me or another male loving a female but I'm not okay with another female loving a male. Another example from the show is how the lead's sister goes on dates with guys almost every single day, and I think ""Man, what an unloyal hoe."" or something like that, but if I reversed the roles I would think of the guy as a ""Player"" and I'm ashamed of it.

I'm not sure if it's some form of hyper jealousy or over-protectiveness and even though I notice that, but simply having self awareness of the problem isn't enough to get rid of it. 

I think at some point I developed the mindset that women were too good for men and they deserve to be treated like gods (I was a neckbeard when I was like twelve lol) and that men aren't special but women are. The funny thing is that I don't have an issue with lesbian relationships either but I have an issue when it's a female's perspective and it involves a male. I've had girlfriends before but I never had an issue with them liking me and I think that's absolutely ridiculous on every level. 

I'm just looking for a way to get rid of this silly stigma because I'm really sick and tired of it. I feel like such a bad person because I strongly believe in equality for everyone, but subconsciously I can't get rid of this mindset that directly goes against what I stand for. 

I've never told anyone I know about this (because frankly it's fucking stupid) so the only logical option is to ask a bunch of strangers online. Any advice? ",16Sep2017,1

70,"Hi /r/advice

I've been living with this guy for a few months now. I feel as though I've been nothing but kind, generous, and accommodating to him. 

I've helped him with everything that I could when he's asked or otherwise. 

We are both graduate students so I understand we are constantly under a lot of pressure, but the way that I feel around him is very uncomfortable and disrespected. 

Example 1
He asked me once to borrow something for class, but I needed it that day. I told him I could lend it to him after I was using it in my class that day. This seemed like a good idea because he did not need it until later that day anyway.  

He rolled his eyes and said ""Sure."" I was put off slightly by the attitude but I brushed it off. I asked him where he would be after I was out of class. He responded saying that he didn't know. I asked him if he could check, to which it appeared that I was inconveniencing him by asking. 

So I approached him later to let him know I was not trying to harass him, but it would help me feel more appreciated if he could let me know where he was at that time, so I could help him out. 

He told me I was being absurd. I was slightly offended to be honest, but I shrugged it off. He ended up asking somebody else. 

Example 2
Another occasion came up when I went grocery shopping for us. Because he says he is too busy with school to go. (We are all very busy but I have to eat) I told him I would bring him the receipt and we could decide what was fair, to which he agreed. 

When I returned with the receipt, I asked him if he was ready for me to break it down. He said yes, so I began to explain what I bought and how much I felt was fair for him to pay. I explained that I will probably use more so I paid a larger share. 

He raised his voice at me, in disbelief of what I was asking him. I tried to reassure him that I was not trying to get over him through groceries.  I told him I was breaking it down for him because I wanted him to be comfortable with what I felt he should be paying. He used very little eye contact proclaiming that he felt it was unfair and that he didn't understand and that he didn't care. 

I was shocked, and slept on it for a couple days. I approached him later and asked if I could talk to him. I expressed how I felt a lack of respect from him, when I feel that I have been nothing but generous towards him. He agreed that was rude for the second example, but maintained that I was being absurd in the first example. 

He told me he would understand if I was a girl (I'm a guy) for bringing up things like this and that he thought I would have thicker skin. He said he will just stay clear of me in the future. I told him I was only trying to let him know how I was feeling and I was intending for us to have a better understanding of each other. He seemed unphased. He said that he will just have to be fake because no matter what he does I will judge him for it.

I don't quite know what to do, I felt that I attempted to approach this situation as maturely and assertively as possible. I just feel so uncomfortable with this person, what can I do?

71,"I live in a hostel-style kind of apartment (individual rooms, communal kitchen &amp; bathrooms) and a couple of months ago we got a new dude in one of the rooms. He literally never spoke, and we'd nver see him outside his room unless he was leaving the building. Last week he cornered me in the kitchen, and started demanding to know why the world was ending. I told him there was billions of years left before the world ends, and that sorted him out. A few minutes later, he burst out of his room again, cornering me in the kitchen and demanding to know how that time period is even conceivable. I started having to talk him down a little, agreeing with him and trying to get back to my room, but he kept blocking my path and began asking if I did science. When I said yes, I do psychology, he fuckin freaked. Told me to get out off his brain. YELLED it. Accused me of wanting to take him out of circulation. I had to calm him down and then when he went back to his room, I went back to mine and locked the door.

Tonight he did something similar. Came out, started yelling hail satan over and over again, then said he was a nazi, then a communist, then that he could control peoples' minds. He wasn't aggressive, but I'm concerned because his room is between me and the apartment exit. There were witnesses this time, and while they're content to let it drop, I don't know what to do.

This just happened like five minutes ago. He's been silent and back in his room since then. My gut instinct is that he's either on drugs or he's suffering from schizophrenia, but I'm only a second-year psych student and it's not my place to diagnose people. Would it be stupid to call the police? I don't want to needlessly escalate stuff, but i feel like he's in pain and is a pretty major potential threat if he's on some stimulant.

She became really abusive after awhile. She'd get drunk every night and text me that she hated me and wouldn't give me a reason why, I shrugged it off thinking she had a drinking problem and just needed help. I liked her a lot, she was one of my best friends and I forgave her every time.

I was diagnosed with mild autism a year beforehand and I decided it might be an okay thing to tell her, considering she was my best friend and I thought she deserved to know. I don't usually tell people who aren't on the spectrum or aren't a professional, not even family members, but when they are planning on having a baby/and or are pregnant such as a sibling I do tell them. Short story: My brother found out in a really bad way, overreacted and aborted his baby because of it. Still dealing with the emotional issues of it all.

I told her and she didn't react very well, messaging me telling me she didn't believe me, I tried to educate her but she wouldn't take it, so I thought oh okay, and I didn't tell her again or speak to her about it. She became incredibly rude after awhile, drunk texting me again, tweeting about me (Twitter) saying things like ""I have a really crazy friend"" ""She fakes disabilities for attention"" and basically spilled the tea over me, however you would like to interpret her behaviour. I knew it was about me, but I decided to go to sleep that night and to not message her anything about it. 

The next day I woke up with a message from about 3 people, one telling me to kill myself, telling me I should stop faking a disability and a few others that are her friends as well. I ignored the messages and sent her screenshots asking her if she knew anything about it and she told me I was crazy and that people who are autistic can't speak and aren't as smart as I am. I again tried to educate her, but she wouldn't, but after that she begged to be my friend because she ""missed me"" after one week of not speaking to each other.

She did it again, she messaged me drunk saying she didn't like me so I decided to cut it, and again the tweets came in saying I'm so horrible not wanting to be friends with her and she tries everything to be good to me. She messaged me things about my ex-boyfriend saying he probably moved on, basically tried to hit in every place that would hurt. I know she's wrong.

I'm really trying hard to prove myself that I can do this but I have exams and essays coming up less then two weeks that I need to do well in. What should I do? ",16Sep2017,1

83,"I have an iPhone 6 that I use daily. The battery life of this phone is not great (cannot get through the day with a single charge). Saw the commercial of the new OnePlus 5 with its dash charge technology, am interested in buying one. After seeing the release of iPhone X and its hefty pricing, I decided to jump ship (Android most probably). Having used Nexus 4 in the past, wouldn't be a problem for me.

As for the Nintendo Switch, I was and still is a gamer. I used to play FIFA, CoD and others during my free time. My time on gaming had decreased dramatically due to university and work. I gave my PS4 to my brother, who is still in high school. The facts that FIFA is coming to the Switch as well as promotion on the Switch got me excited.

I know is two different gadgets. Any advice and comment will be much appreciated.

84,"To keep things short, I was intending to graduate at the end of this year after 4 years of university with two degrees. However, between a whole lot of work outside university, working 4 days a week, and two of my family members having mental illnesses requiring some support from me, I fell impossibly behind on one of the units. Knowing I was going to fail otherwise, I dropped out of the unit, figuring it's better to not have the academic penalty for failing. This is a unit which only occurs in the second semester of the year.

Which leaves me in my current situation. I have finished the requirements for one degree, and all but one for a second (related) degree. This leaves me with two choices:

1. Graduate at the end of the semester with a single degree. In doing so I will be forfeiting my other degree and will not be able to go for it again with starting all over again. However, I will have a degree by the end of the year, or;

2. Wait until this time next year to start the unit again. I'm confident I'll be in a better position to pass the unit this time around, however this will mean a period of a full semester of no units or degree. I can do plenty of volunteering/work experience during this time, however I don't know if that time would be better suited job-searching with a single degree. I would have no degree until the end of 2018, but I would have two afterwards.

I'd love to hear people's advice. I'll clarify on the degrees if required, or any other information needed.",16Sep2017,1

Every time I think I got something,.....there's always a reason why I give up on it. I wanted to be in the medical field for the LONGEST time. But after I found out how strick it is and that there's way too much school and studying, I gave up on that. I went to Cosmetology school, graduated and everything. Only to find out that cosmetologist don't ""make bank"" at their first salon job like I assumed. You either have to have connections or work your way up the corporate ladder. And now I've been on the Park Ranger kick. I love animals,all species. Probably more than people. I also love nature and would love to help out the planet however I can. Only thing is, I don't know how to even get my foot in the door with that career choice.  And if I do, will it be just like the cosmetology situation? I want a job I'm passionate about, easy to get and I'll be making a decent pay while doing it. (I don't even know if that kind of job exist). Don't get me wrong, I'm a very hard worker, and like to earn what I have. I'll have to say, money motivates me to an extent. My whole life I've had shit jobs, living paycheck to paycheck.

Im a 27 years old dude and i never was the ""falling in love"" type. Im soft inside and like feelings but i think love is a false feeling because its goes away. and we want more and more...from another person.

I dont like relationships (but i dont want to have sex with everyone), because as i see as an outsider this sux. 

Arguments, always beiing around with each other 0-24, a need to do everything together if we dont, thats not a relationship, or force positivitie.

Every week now i have a dream where im in love with a fictional girl who i never met before, dont know her name. Non sexual dreams. Just speaking with her, laughing, holding hands, hugging, kissing....and the feeling is so realistic. The scente, the textures everything.

110,"So a little context... I started an internship in human resources to gain experience in the area, and things were going great. I started 10 days ago, and my boss already told me that she intends to hire me at some point. I started my internship with no hopes of getting a job because she already told me that her crew was complete but that there was a LOT of work to do and my help will be appreciated if I wanted to do my internship there. So I accepted the opportunity because my initial purpose was to learn. 
And well as I said.. things were going great...until I noticed that my money went missing...Twice. We all keep our purses in the back (in the same office, but behind some furnishing). A few days ago, when I went home and looked at my wallet I noticed that 200 pesos were gone. I kept 300 pesos from my last trip there to change them at the bank at some point to my local currency. But of course, I was confused because they didn't take it all, they left 100 pesos, so of course, I thought, maybe I misplaced it somewhere else. But yesterday, I went to the ATM during lunch hour, I went back to the office, left my purse in the back, and when I got home, I discovered that again my money was gone, but not all of it. Only half of the money. Now I'm upset and frustrated because, this is an internship, which means I'm not getting paid in the first place, after 2 or 3 months unemployed this is a great opportunity because finally I am learning what I want to do (human resources), and I don't know if I should stay and be all paranoid keeping my purse with me and not trusting the people I work with or I should just leave and tell what happened to my boss, or other option. There are no cameras nor I have any proof of this, so naturally, I think that telling my boss is not a great option.

112,"I have a friend whom I can only communicate with electronically that has been diagnosed with depression and ADHD for a few years now. Today I had finally confronted him about the specifics of this, as otherwise he is living a happy, successful life. He said that he has short spells of existential crises that he doesn't tell anyone about because he believes it is a 'petty issue', which he solves by simply 'getting over it and moving on'.

I told him that he should look into seeing a doctor or therapist (which he hasn't ever seen in his adult life at 21 years old) about seeing if there is any medication options he could take to solve this. He argues that the issue is so minor and he is easily able to deal with it himself and has no need for them. As I continue to discuss to him about how he has yet to make an attempt to see if he might need a medication for this 'minor' issue or not, he began to attack me saying that i was 'not qualified' to tell him to consult a doctor because I'm not the person who was diagnosed with the issues. He then goes on to say that he was 'born with depression' and it is simply 'uncurable'.

I am now worried that our friendship is in danger simply because he believes that I am caring about him only because it makes me feel important and impactful in his life (as we've never seen each other in person), despite my sayings otherwise. He says that one of his local friends (whom I also know) is the only one qualified to speak with him about it but I don't believe he will give him the same solution I did. Is there anything I can tell him? If I give him articles or research, he does it right back to me about how his depression is 'uncurable' and 'has no need for medications'.

So, I don't really want to delve into my backstory right now. 1. I'm at work and don't have time and 2. meh..

The gas pump went out in my boyfriend's jeep about a Month or so ago and all has gone downhill from there. So that was a Thursday, I was on my way to work and just got off the back road to get on the main road from my house. All of a sudden the Jeep just shut off and I was barely able to stop it in a ditch. The driver's window was off track so the little arm to hold the window up was sticking out and you had to manually pull up the window and push the button to keep it in place. Well the Jeep was tilted due to being mostly in the ditch so when I tried to softly shut the door, the window shattered. I tried to see if maybe the battery casued the vehicle to turn off and waited a while for someone to stop. No one came. 

I found out I didn't have minutes on my phone. With no neighbors around, I decided to walk 5 miles home to my boyfriend. Thinking the White shirt I left in the Jeep would let someone know I broke down and would be returning. I've seen cars with white rags on the window before that were untouched for days before being moved. I thought nothing of it.

Well it took me about 2 hours to walk home, in 90 degree weather, in my scrubs, with no water. No one stopped as they drove by while I tried to flag them down carrying my handbag and sweater. 

By the time I walked up my driveway and neared the back porch where our main door is, my boyfriend walked outside and dropped to his knees in tears. He explained that the police had found the Jeep with a smashed window and thought I was kidnapped. They were 5 minutes away from starting a search party for me.

And then my dad pulled up...The following week my boyfriend's uncle died of a sudden heart attack. They were very close and it was such a shock. I had never seen him in such despair. 

The weeks following, his boss said work was very slow, and eventually there wasn't any work for a month or more. We've been blessed with a great friend who stays with us and lets us share his truck to get me to work. 

Well this morning the oil warning light came on in his expensive truck and we had to take it home. I was late to work after making arrangements to use my moms truck. 

Life should start using lube if it's going to keep fucking me.

133,"I live in CT with my parents. I had a major break up with a viciously abusive ex and moved back home two years ago. I'm 29. 

I finally found a full time job and I'm making enough to have a studio apartment. I just want to save a cushion of 10 grand first, which I can accomplish by January. 

I'm worried about my parents though. [this is their home](https://imgur.com/a/s5DiM) where I've been living. 

Every single room is like this. My dad is type 2 diabetic, is running his failing business which brings in nowhere near enough to meet his needs, my mom has been unemployed for years and is an untreated schizophrenic. She's convinced she's not sick. When I was in grade school and she got diagnosed, she told me her doctors were part of a satanic conspiracy to destroy good people and make them believe that they're ill. She's currently losing teeth, her feet are turning brown and flaking apart because she refuses to wear shoes. My dad only says ""you can't help her"" when I suggest trying to force her into care. He sleeps until noon most days and then works until 11-12pm. 

I want to call someone for them when I leave. I don't know what I can do though. I'm unfamiliar with the methods in CT. Their basement has flooded multiple times, and there's mold crawling up the drywall and through the carpet. They don't have hot water anymore and so shower in freezing cold all winter. I can just barely take it at my age, but my mom will go without showering for days and usually smells like a barn. They have no friends who visit, no family, and the little family my dad had, he cut off over ten years ago because of his unwillingness to change. 

I'm currently spraying flea killer all over my room and vacuuming/washing everything because I've been waking up with bites. 

I want to help them, but when I leave, I'm telling them I'm not visiting anymore. I don't think this will change them at all. My mom barely lives on planet earth, and my dad would rather die alone than concede to a mistake. He proved that by cutting out his brother for ten years and still going, as well as ignoring his diabetes symptoms until he was hospitalized. (No insurance, of course)

Has anyone here dealt with this, can you give me some advice? I've really got no one else in my life to reach out to. ",16Sep2017,33
135,"My wife and I both work for the same university but in different residences. She just got a promotion, which of course pissed off the people she stepped over in the corporate ladder. Since her promotion she has had trouble with 3 different individuals. They're just doing childish shit, talking about her just loud enough so she can hear them, shutting doors in her face, walking away while she's talking to them. As kids we were both bullied so as much as she says it's not getting to her it's getting to me. I fucking hate bullies. My instinct is to wait for these clowns after their shifts and beat the shit out of them. I train mma recreationally and they're all fat drunken slobs so I'm confident I could handle all three of them at once...but that would be wrong. So what do I do for her and for me?

So my ex and I broke up back in May and I kinda went off the deep end and I talked to anyone and I sent some nudes. So this one guy I talked to only wanted to mess around and we made that clear in the beginning. So we sent pictures back and forth for about a week, and then I started talking to someone and now he is my boyfriend so I clearly stopped talking to the other guy. 
Okay, so late last night I got a message on Facebook with that guy calling me a cunt and a whore and he told me to go kill myself multiple times. Then he said he was going to send all my nudes out to everyone. Then he blocked me on all social media. I took screenshots of what he sent me.

138,"I'm starting to get very annoyed by this individual at work to the point where I may do something I regret. For months now this has been carrying on and I've just sat there and kept my mouth closed and done little about it.

There's this woman at my work who is known as a gossip that I professionally have little-to-no interaction with. Recently her topic of conversation has been myself and because I have work friends scattered across various departments the information is getting back to me.

From what I have experienced first hand with her when it's regarding other colleagues I believe that what she is doing currently to be true among the testimony of others that have witnessed it.

This women seems to be obsessed with both my personal and professional life on a negative and b!tchy level. This is came into light when I had come back from a couple of weeks annual leave. Two of my employees had informed me that this woman had been in my department and was b!tching about my personal and professional life to them. This conversation was then had with many other work friends that also had recent interactions with her. At the time I let it slide because apparently she had been going through some personal issues of her own.

Now almost two months later she has still kept it up. She has come into my department when i'm not there and slated me to my employees and others at work regarding what I do at work, how much I get paid, my personal life, woman etc. She has made up rumors or fabricated negative information about myself based on the little to no actual contact I have with her. I have kept my contact with her to a professional minimum, I literally only sign invoices from her and kept my opinions on the matter to myself in attempts to not give her more ammunition. This has led nowhere.

I am starting to get to the point where I can no longer keep biting my lip and let this slide. This is becoming or has become a bully at work whether I believe it or not and I don't know how to handle this. I have a HR department but I do not want even more drama or ammunition for this woman to thrive on.

140,"I almost made the huge mistake of committing suicide the other night I thought I was completely alone. Luckily I saw I'm not mainly due to the fact that people drove and came and got me and talked to me.

However my only worry now is I don't know how I'll react in two days when I have to go back to school
The school is keeping it quiet so only a handful of people know I almost attempted. I just don't know how I'll react if I get someone who doesn't know insulting me or being mean.

My mom arrived late to pick us (3 siblings and I) up from our grandparents' house. She was drinking, but wasnt wasted. 3 minutes later she almost got into a collision, head on, into the other lane with another car. I jumped to grab the wheel and swerved the car because I believe, if i hadnt, someone would've been hurt. Maybe worse.

Lets say she did collide despite my attempts. Would i have been at fault for trying to save us?

144,"Hey all, first off, I just want to say that I'm brand new to reddit, with this being my first ever post. It sucks it has to be a downer but lately I've felt very lost in my life and that maybe this would be a decent way of seeking advice and motivation for self improvement.
I'm 21, still live with my parents, and still attend a community college with an undecided major. I also work a job once or twice a week that I take no pride in. I very much want to change all of the negative aspects of my life but most of the time I give up or forget why I even try. I keep thinking that in time things will work out, but I question how long it will be, if ever at all. My confidence and self esteem have gotten significantly worse the older I get and more I realize how behind I am and if/how I'll ever catch up. The diminishing confidence has also effected my relationships with certain friends and my family as well. I feel awkward around people who I shouldn't feel awkward around because I feel like I've ruined their once positive expectations of me. I've started smoking weed everyday for a few months and that's a factor that I want to eliminate but it's too tempting when I'm bored. My love life is basically nonexistent since I had my first ""relationship"" (if I can even call it that) with a girl over the summer who decided to cut things off just after 3 weeks, which only fed into my lack of confidence and insecurity so I still haven't lost my virginity. I do have a select few friends I can talk to about things like this, and they do their best. However, a lot of the time I just feel like I'm bitching or talking to a wall.
All of the issues I've mentioned are things that I would like to fix, and not just a list of things to make people feel sorry for me. I know that change starts with motivation but I just can't find it.

148,"Hey guys,
So as you can probably tell with the title I am young. I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. 

I have dated a few other girls before, but it was nothing serious. But this girl, we really like each other. She even broke up with her boyfriend to be with me, she said she has liked me for about a year and was just waiting for me. I have also been going to all the varsity football games and school events, since she is on varsity cheer she has to go to all of them and I go to support her. I have just been hanging out with her a lot. We have also done some other things that people seeing each other would do. 

Now here is where things get complicated. She wants me to come over to her house next weekend to ""Study""(We know we're gonna end up watching Netflix or something lol). Now the thing is my mom does not want me dating in high school, and I think she may be onto me about this girl. She has outright asked once ""Your not hanging out with a girl are you?"" And then she would say how I'm not allowed to date in high school. She honestly does not want me to have any friends who are girls, and I do have a lot since I am a very outgoing person. Now she is also very overly protective. Which is a good thing, just very annoying. 

So what do you guys think I should do? Should I continue to lie, or should I tell her about this girl? And what should I say about going to her house next weekend? Regardless of what I should do, do you guys have any suggestions on how I should go about it?

Thanks everyone! :)",16Sep2017,5
150,"My brother-in-law is getting married in a few months. My husband is the best man and all of the cousins/in-laws are in the bridal party. I'm not close with my husband's family and felt really uncomfortable going to the wedding alone. That being said, I sent them my regrets.

After sending my regrets it became a big dramatic scene. My mother-in-law got involved. Both her and my brother-in-law pressured me and made me feel really guilty about not going to the wedding. They said I shouldn't feel weird going to the wedding alone since I'm around family. I finally caved in and said I would go after speaking to my brother-in-law.

The issue is I still don't want to go and don't know how to get out of it. I'm beginning to wish I followed my husband's plan of RSVPing yes and faking sick on the day. I really struggle with social anxiety and everyone that I know is in the bridal party. I asked for a plus one and said I would paid for it but that was denied since they're over their numbers. I literally can't imagine going to this alone. I did tell my in-laws about my social anxiety and it was dismissed as something I should get over.

153,"Hi,

I was sharing an apartment with a couple people, and one of them happened to rack up an amount of debt to us throughout the year. The rest of us thought it would be fine because he had paid back all the debt in one go before, so we didn't really think much about it. Unfortunately, after the apartment sharing ended, he blocked all contact with us (blocked one of my friends on facebook, ignores texts, ignores my facebook messages, although he hasn't blocked me... weird).

That being said, I am in the same university as him, so if I do some investigation on to his classes and just stake out, I can probably do something more. However, this may get slightly violent, which I wouldn't want to happen, so I thought the best way would just be to contact his mother; I met her a couple times and she seemed like a very reasonable parent who probably would not let her son get away with stealing from others. That being said, I do not know her contact info. I know her last name and the town she lives in. I did simple google searches and was unable to find her. Are there any other free methods to find her contact info that I can try? If not, would there be any approaches for me to take through the university?

155,"Is there any chance I could be depressed? There are times when I would wake up and cry and not know why. There are times when I would just not feel any kinds of emotions toward anything or anyone, even the most important person in my life. Everyday, I would overthink a lot, even without wanting to. It's like my brain would drive itself haywire without my permission. And there are times I would feel suicidal and be really pessimistic about some aspects like my life in general, or how I am as a person, and I just want to disappear like a bubble, without anyone ever knowing. There are times when I would feel nothing. Most of the times I'm not motivated to chase my dreams. Mostly I would just be doing the things I need to do mindlessly without actually Wanting to, like without actually being excited about it, even if I want to Be excited about, cause after all it's my dream, and I can't do productive things because of it, and/or because of overthinking, but I just don't have the energy/spirit to actually be wanting to do those things. I'm so sorry if I jump from one thing to another, I don't know how else to explain it properly.

I told the people important to me that I may have depression, and they said they really think I don't, cause they experienced depression, and I told them depression has a different manifestation in them cause we're different people. They asked me what my manifestation is and I couldn't answer cause I couldn't give a straight answer, which made me doubt I have depression, but I obviously have something, which prompted me to ask this question...

Everyday there's something weighing heavily on my chest and I can't even pinpoint what it is. Sometimes I don't even bother to pinpoint it. It's like trying to catch smoke with your two hands.

I feel really down right now cause the people I expected to be by my side during these times aren't here. They told me to get my shit together, when I don't even know what my shit is.

I actually want to get a test to at least know if i have depression or not, but my courage is disappearing cause they (important people in my life) tell me I don't have depression and they just think that I think I do.

The people who are important to me, whenever they see me tear up and ask what's the matter, I can't even find the words cause I can't pinpoint the reason. And they eventually start ignoring me whenever I do that, and I don't know which one feels worse. 

They leave me alone when they think I'm being dramatic about my feelings/thoughts, but to me I was just trying to explain it to them, and eventually being called messed up cause I can't get my shit together, and cause my way of thinking in a Certain Aspect is shallow. 

I tried talking to them (important people in my life) about it, like I think I may have depression, but it always gets dismissed like it's nothing. Whenever I kindly ask them not to act superior towards me, they'll say they Are superior due to the fact that I think I may have depression and that I am messed up. 

I tried talking to strangers about it, cause it was the only coping mechanism I had for a decade. I was a lot suicidal back then and the only way not to cut myself or even inflict pain on myself is to talk to strangers (people I meet in online communities), but it's not really working, it's just that it's the only way I know to at least prevent me from killing myself. I had to cope back then cause of some trauma back in high school which ruined pretty much everything I had: my self-esteem, my confidence, self-worth, my image, my outlook in life, my perspective towards other people, even my scholarship. And add family problems, among other things. I guess it just piled up to this point and I'm breaking down now? I don't know.

They (important people of my life) kept on slapping it on me that I don't need them, cause I have the strangers I talk to online (1 stranger, a male, one acquaintance, a female), and it sucks so badly cause even if I tried explaining it that it was the only way I could cope, they kept on saying that they did it alone, and they called me not-independent, like I can't stand on my own feet cause I can't deal with my shit without the help of other people, and that made me feel even shittier about myself, and I don't know how else to move forward at this point. 

If this is not depression, please tell me what it is. If it's something as light as me being a wuss, please don't say it in a hateful/salty way.",16Sep2017,0
156,"I'm here to vent and seek advice. I [25, M] launched a business 2 years ago and definitely dropped out of college this year because running things takes a lot of dedication and I cannot do both anymore. I've made my choice and I'm happy about it. I'm currently the top earner in my family as well, I live on my own and haven't even asked my parents for a dime since I was 20. My siblings, 3 (m) &amp; 5 (f) years older than me, are PhD students but still need considerable help when it comes to their finances, sometimes even more than what my parents can afford to offer. Yet, my parents and relatives seem to be more accepting of their choices than mine no matter how well I do. Every year we go once on a vacation together as a family and since my parents can barely afford to save anything as they spend everything to complement my siblings' financial needs, this year we wouldn't have been able gather if it wasn't for my initiative to sort of sponsor it. My business is really exhausting and all I wanted was to spend some good time with my family and 2 siblings but instead it turned into a nightmare. Everybody appeared to not mind down talking what I'm doing, how I'm not focusing in the long term and how little - contrary to what I apparently think - money matters. Whenever I would enthusiastically offer to do something fun (simple stuff from ordering a bottle of champagne to celebrate our reunion to stuff like renting a yacht which I did) the response from my siblings was always apathic. Never excited, as if we were on opposing teams. For example, one evening we went out and I ordered a scotch (just for fun) and lit up a cigar (just for fun again). Their reaction was weird, they mumbled something through their teeth and were obviously pissed off and uncomfortable. After trying several times to start a conversation and failing, sick of the awkward silence I noted how we had become so distant as not to be able to have a honest/simple conversation anymore with each other. My brother apologetically agreed with me, my sister blew up accusing me of not being relaxed, of having become ""a bad"" person, of always trying to have everyone's attention and then also threw some insults in the mix such as that I'm depressed, bipolar and should spend my money seeing a shrink instead of spending it on bottles of champagne. This caught me totally by surprise. When I answered saying the money I spend is my own and I can do whatever I want with it and went on to question her logic mentioning how she &amp; her boyfriend spend 90% of their salaries (they teach in college) in renting a house they normally couldn't afford to live in and how because of this their living expenses still have to be covered by our parents, she blew up again reminding me that my parents had paid for my first 2 years of college as well. Among others she also accused me of having ruined my parents' life by dropping out of college, of having traumatised them. I talk to my parents regularly at least 3-4 times per week. We discuss family matters and from time to time they bring up my decision to drop out because they didn't like it and they want me to go back to school at some point. My sister on the other hand had gone 5 months without talking to them this year (not even a message or email) ""because she was too busy studying"" and even blocked my parents Facebook account for almost 1 year over some petty disagreement in chat. For the entire period I always tried to bring them together, my sister has her own life but my parents get lonely sometimes and need reassurances especially after a fight with my sister or brother. When they fight in front of me with each other (dad &amp; mom) then they feel even more guilty, profusely apologising when things calm down. I'm always trying to empathise and sometimes I bring up how I'm stressed too and I understand them and how it is normal to lose your temper sometimes. Since my sister hasn't spoken to me in ages personally, I have come to the conclusion that my parents' have told her what I tell them in moments of candour and either she twists their words to make them suit her own insults or our parents really have an opinion of me that is very different from what they let me think. Either way, this shitty vacation is over and now i really don't feel like spending a second with my family, except of my brother who is more flexible and understanding. I feel disrespected, stabbed behind my back and betrayed by the people I love most. Although one part of me wants to go back and act like nothing ever happened, I also really cannot take it anymore. I do not know if it is possible to find the right balance since it appears that my parents will always look down at me for as long as I'm a drop out while my sister's hostility is seriously out of control. Is there a way to fix this, what should I do? I feel like I'm very close to making a drastic decision, keep a big distance with my parents from now on and basically cutting off my sister. I never thought I would ever have to cut off my own sister but after this time, her behaviour, I felt like she hated me with all her guts and for the first time I understand siblings who haven't spoken to each other for decades.

164,"Hey guys

I do know how to start this. I typed up the title once before but changed my mind and cancelled the idea of publishing it. Now I am back because I cannot figure this out alone and I need your guys' help.

You guys might be wondering that the title is poorly worded but by the end of this post, hopefully it will be more understandable to you guys from where I stand.

I just finished my computer science degree in Canada and was planning on relocating to the states. I had a girlfriend who I met in university and had been dating for 3 years. And that time with her was nothing short of perfect.  I recently broke up with her because she has to finish her schooling in Canada and I really need to be someone in the computer science world (if i can). When thinking about parting ways I did not think much even though I knew it was going to hit me very hard after because I am weak.

And that is exactly what happened. I was nice to my gf but in every relationship there are times when you guys have fights and you guys say things. For the past 2 days the mean things I said (nothing major) has been on repeat in my head and I cry missing her. Our breakup was mature and proper. I told her that I was moving away and it was time to focus on career because this is the time and it wont come again. This is my first breakup and I think this is why its so hard. But more importantly because she was very nice to me (Almost as nice as my dad == My maternal grandma {Keep reading below}). 

I am not someone who is capable of dealing with abandonment and I have come to terms with that growing up. I had a father who was a overall general domestic abuser (wife, kids, even pets...). He left me when I was 3 months old and came back when I was 5-6 for a year and then when I was 14, to only FINALLY leave again at 17. Growing up I never thought that my childhood had any effect on me and I always thought that people who say they are messed up because of their parents are wrong.............but I was wrong.

With a little self reflection I realized that I am indeed screwed up. My abandonment issues / will lose something issues are way deeper than I expected. I am a person who looks for SUPER instant gratification. I think that if I have a whole pizza and if I don't eat it then someone will take it away. Or I still remember this because its engraved. My father once gave asked me if i wanted to do something and then he changed his mind to do it the next day. However, I was after him to do it and so he told me ""Its not going anywhere"". And I still remember standing there at 15 thinking to myself ""It most likely wont happen tomorrow"". The activity is not of the importance as is the thinking process. I think I am screwed up in the head.

My parents did not have a happy marriage and they resented each other because of the deeds my father committed. It wasnt a flash bulb memory then but it is definitely one now : I still remember like it was yesterday. My father was leaving the house with a big pile of clothes and as he exited the door :

""Dad, where are you going?""
""Just to get these clothes washed. I ll be back in 10 min""

With having lost so many things in life I am just so scared of losing another source of happiness. I come to to reddit not to find ways to be happy (do this and do that, busy yourself) but rather to deal with sadness in a more practical way. I also come to you guys because I need you guys to help me understand myself. What do I want? Do I want to give up working for the girl and stay back or go explore the world because there is only one life? I am so indecisive and afraid to choose.

165,"So my ex lost miscarried with our child cause she decided to go out a two week drinking and drug binging expedition with her friends while I was working away to make as much money to save for the arrival of the baby. 
Obviously we broke up cause of that but when it came to ask questions for closure like why did you do it? Why did you blame me for weeks saying it's my fault for leaving for work and you felt lonely and lost it cause of stress of being alone. 
Many more questions. Like where's the discharge letter from the hospital (it happened when I was away) 
Weeks I got of mental abuse of blame and accusations till the truth come out of videos and pictures of dates when she was pregnant drinking and partying. 

So I'm fuming and when I ask questions. She's threatened me to make false accusations to the police to ruin my career as I'm new teacher and that can end my career before it starts. 
Her and best friends have messaged me with blackmail and threats and have recorded conversations of saying that they'll make false accusations. I've been advised to place an injunction against her and report her for defamation of character but I don't want to go down this route just yet.

166,"Hey guys, so basically I get 30 Adderall xr 15 mg pills a month for ADHD. Usually it's never a hassle to get my script but this time in particular is a pain.

Basically they were short 10 pills so I had to fill only 20 instead of 30 and was told to go back to my doctor to rewrite a script for 10 more which he did given the situation.

Apparently though since it was ""technically"" a completely new script written, I can't get it filled until my 20 are out, which is an issue because I was planning on travelling soon and need my whole months supply with me. The reason I cannot fill it is because my insurance won't cover meds like Adderall being filled while my current script is still present.

How can I resolve this situation? I go to Walgreens btw. Can I call my insurance and explain the situation or do insurance companies not change their policies given certain situations and is it pretty much set in stone?

168,"I'm 23 years old, all of my pre-reqs are done for school - and I live at home with my rents. I'm stumped, I don't know what direction to head in. I was enrolled in a CS major for money and the quality work/life balance that it was supposed to supply, but was unaware of the nonstop learning and passion the people in that industry have and want you to share as well.

I'm not like that, I want to run my 40 hours and go home and have never had an interest in anything that actually made me gravitate towards its subject material. I don't need to make much now that I realize it either, $35,000 yearly is all I need to live comfortably as I'm not one to have kids nor am I interested in marriage and my spending habits are incredibly tame.

I don't know what to do, not in the least. Should I finish up school while I'm figuring out what to do? Pick a degree that's more 'big picture' orientated, like logistics management? I recall when I was programming, a lot of my peers would love to dive into the nitty gritty. They'd talk about all the tools and frameworks meant to get the job done, but I only cared about getting the program finished. Seeing the project through is what mattered to me, not ""Wow, so glad we used angular instead of react to finish this!"".

Should I join the military to buffer another 4 years until I figure out a direction? My issue with this is, I can only do this for so long, I need to figure out a direction and stick to it. I'm 23 already, I have to get my shit sorted immediately.

174,"Well, if I'm going to give this an actual go... I guess I'll share some information about myself so you can get to know me. The first time I typed this out, it sounded like a dating profile..I will try to find away around that. Apologies in advance.

I am 26 years old and female. I'm mostly proud of myself as far as success in life goes. I mean everyone fucks up and ruins shit now and then. I do a great deal of that. 

I rent my childhood home from my parents, it's big. I have 5 cats between myself and my boyfriend and we have a roommate who has two.. So, yeah.. seven cats, all indoors...and we have navy carpet for farks sake. (my dad chose the color and I cannot wait to replace it, vacuuming is hell). I work full time as an Optometry Technician and I am proud of my work accomplishments. It took me years of busting my ass and dealing with bat-shit crazy people to get where I am in my career. I'm under 5'2"" and full of rage and coffee. If I'm being honest, I really am not that angry anymore because I got myself off birth control and other mood altering prescriptions. I feel so much better and way more like myself than I can remember. I like to sleep and I never get enough of it. Literally, I go to bed late and wake up early six days a week. I'm not crying about it, I know all adults do this. I'm just sharing here. 

All of my cats have interesting names, except one. One of them is deaf, she's adorable and weird. I will introduce them later, they're interesting, at least to me.

I feel like I either have really bad luck or just make really bad life decisions often because I'm always broke and always behind on everything. But hey, we all struggle right? I don't know about that. I feel like most people only have to stress about one situation at a time or only have one bad thing happen to them at once instead of like eight things all in one day.

Let me explain, if I'm still holding you're attention and you haven't scrolled past or fallen asleep... I previously talked about how I think life likes to fuck me. So to sum it up real quick like- Jeep broken down, boyfriend's job slowed to a halt with no work, two deaths in the family a week apart, not having enough money to stay on top of bills, paying a stupid amount of money for my power bill and just general stress that comes with worrying about putting food on the table. 

On a more positive note, I have an opportunity with a part time at home job that starts in a couple days. That'll be a huge weight lifted off us because it'll help make up the difference in bills and what not. I go on tangents. I don't even know if I'll be sharing this.

181,There's this girl I'm friends with that I work with and I got feelings for her a few months ago. I asked her out and we agreed to go on a date but I guess she changed her mind because whenever I tried to plan anything she would make excuses. We used to talk all day every day but then she moved off to college and we'd talk only a little bit. I thought she was just busy all the time but yesterday she didn't respond to me for half of the day even though she was talking to my friend. My friend says that she send him pictures of her with other guys so she's seeing other guys even though she told me she was too busy for a relationship. I feel jealous and I really like her but I think I should move on and stop talking to her at least until my feelings go away. Would I be an asshole if I did that ?

182,"I'll just make a long story short: I am struggling with erectile dysfunction and have been for longer than I've even been with my wife.  We haven't been able to have sex at all, because I would say I'm 98% incapable of getting an erection.  I will rub her and do other things to please her instead (she says I am great at it).  
  
With that said, it was recently brought up that I should get a strap-on to use on her.  I was uncomfortable with this idea when she brought it up.  I would not be very well-endowed even if the ED issue was put aside, so it's like a double-whammy.  The idea of using a strap-on makes me feel insecure and broken, and I can't figure out if I have a bad perspective on things or if I'm right for feeling that way.  It concerns me that she would think about other men while we were using it (since we've not been able to have sex, that would obviously not be what she'd think about) or that it might make her think about how she could have another man that didn't need to go to such lengths to give her sex.

I really want a girlfriend that likes some of the same stuff as me like games, painting, books, etc... but I want her to also be a virgin like me. I've been to therapy and it didn't help. I absolutely can't stand knowing she's had sex with others, it's the most horrifying thing in my mind. Sometimes just the thought keeps me up the entire night or if I do sleep it's the first thing I think about when I wake up, I can't fucking take it anymore.
I'm starting to get extremely scared that I've lost my chance and I can't seem to concentrate on anything else consistently.

I'm aware it's probably not healthy but I've tried getting over it and I just can't. I don't mind not having sex, or waiting for marriage or anything. I just absolutely can't stand these thoughts for 5+ hours every day driving me insane. I'm quiet but pretty good looking, and doing on the surface. I'm confident that if I can find a girl like this I'll begin to calm down, but right now I've been more stressed out and agitated then ever, I've tried meditation, therapy, more cardio, nothing helps.

Third, it's making me so lonely because I know people are distancing themselves from me and also it's hard to build relationships when your not in one place all day. Fourth, this is all based in Miami where every single person I work with speaks Spanish, so that adds to the loneliness because I don't speak Spanish and barely understand it.

217,"My (27) best friend (30) of 10 years is being stalked by her ex. They were together 2-3 years and have been broken up for 2 years. During the relationship, he was extremely manipulative and controlling. He would play loud music to make her get off the phone or just grab the phone and hang it up to prevent her from talking to her friends/family, he went through her facebook regularly and deleted people and sent mean messages to guys on her fb (including coworkers which embarrassed her to death), didnt let her go anywhere alone by inviting himself (even to girl time like clothes/makeup shopping), etc. He became worse and worse to the point he would yell in her face and take her keys so she couldnt get away. Things never became physical.

Eventually she left him and stayed with me for a couple of months before getting her own place. He went off the deep end when she left and began stalking her. Everywhere she went, he was there: her work, her home, MY home until I told him I wasnt afraid to involve the police. He would call nonstop from number-masking apps so it couldn't be blocked. She changed numbers and he facebook messaged one of her coworkers acting like he was her, stating ""she"" lost her phone and could the coworker please send the number. It worked. He called around the clock, day and night. She would turn her phone off for days and the secomd she turned it back on it would start ringing. He made multiple social media accounts and used friends'  accounts to stalk her on facebook.

It escalated over the months to the point where he broke into her home multiple times whether she was there or at work. He didn't hit her but he did grab her arms and refuse to let her leave until ""they talked"". He stole her phone to go through messages and she had to buy a new phone (she got her phone back from him later). Cops have been called multiple times and are happy to help, but she would never follow through and press charges. She moved to a town 2 hours away about a year ago, and things have calmed down over the past 6 months. The ex still makes social media accounts and likes her posts in public facebook groups, but he doesnt have her newest phone number and doesnt know where ahe lives, so it's been better. She has a new, emotionally-healthy boyfriend she has been very happy with for the past few months. 

However, she has been looking for a new couch and posted in a few yard sale sites for our county. He saw these and made a craigslist ad for a cheap couch in our area which she jumped on because it was so cheap. We realized it was him because the messages seemed off, like he was trying to find out where she lives. We get suspicious so she tells him she would like to see the couch before it is delivered to make sure she wants it, and he just stops responding altogether. Shortly after, she gets a message from, you guessed it: the psycho ex. He acts casual like they are friends and he just wants to catch up. So creepy. 

So now she is crying and throwing up she's so upset, but I still can't seem to convince her to get a restraining order! Idont understand why she wont utilize all the tools available to her to end the stalking! She should not be living in fear because of him - it has been 2 years and I cant seem to convince her that he will never stop until she stops it. Please help - what can I do? I'm afraid he will kill her one day and I will know that there were so many signs and I just couldnt get her to prevent it. Ive begged and cried and she will say ""i need to press charges/get a restraining order. If one more thing happens, I will go"" but every time she just doesn't and ""doesn't want to deal with it""....She was so strong and independent before this, but for some reason she just wont stand up for herself in this situation.

About a year ago or so we had a falling out with one of my brothers who did some very inhumane things so we didn't want to associate ourselves with him anymore. Recently we decided to cut him out of our lives completely and we remembered he still shares a family plan with us at AT&amp;T. When we went to the AT&amp;T store we are told we can change whatever we want with our account but my brother can ultimately reverse any changes made because he put the account under his name without our consent. He used to work at an AT&amp;T retail store for about a year or two and he managed to change the primary account holders name from my mother to his without our consent. So after a long few days of calling customer service and providing enough information that this happened without our consent/knowledge we changed all of our information including email/passcode/passwords. Then i immediately deactivated his account. A day after I see that he somehow managed to reactive his account and when i called AT&amp;T about this they say they have no idea. The only one who had the login information/passcode was me. I dont understand how he got in and managed to reactivate his device. It's been a war of deactivating and reactivating his device for about a week now and im tired of it but I dont want him to have the satisfaction of making us pay for his phonebill, which by the way is about 500$ a month thanks to all his installments and phone upgrades.. Please someone help me on what I should do. Any advice will help and im sorry for such a long post. Im frustrated.",16Sep2017,1
225,"I am a 30 year old female who has a complicated relationship with my father.  For some context, I know I have been his favorite since I was a child.  Growing up, this made me a bit uncomfortable as he was extremely invasive with my privacy and even went so far as tapping my phone calls.  He never abused me sexually but was definitely one to slap/hit when angry. While growing up, he was largely busy with work but spent time withe the family when he could and always provided for us financially.  Whenever he feels upset towards me, he brings up the fact that he's always given me whatever I wanted and paid for my education and feels like he gets nothing in return.  He even got angry one day when I moved away and said ""when I die I'm not giving anything to you"". He later apologized but this comment disturbed me as it was very telling about how his thought process works.


Moving forward into adulthood, I've recently moved back to town after living away for 10 years. He seems to be obsessed with spending time with me. I have decided to live in my own home and he complains to my mother that I do not live at home with them.  I see my parents every week for 3 hours on Sunday and he has complained that I don't see them enough.  I know my parents won't be around forever and I love them very much but 3 hours a week is plenty in my opinion especially for someone who works full time.  Everytime I leave the house my father acts as if he won't see me for months and almost follows me around. Durig the visit he stares at me and is almost completely focused on me, and this makes me want to avoid spending time with him ans I feel he cannot just relax.  I can feel his attention on me and it makes me quite uncomfortable.


How do I distance myself from my overbearing father without ruining our relationship/hurting him? I almost feel as if he holds me responsible for his feelings and has enmeshed himself with me unwittingly.  What is the best way to set a boundary and keep the peace?",16Sep2017,1
