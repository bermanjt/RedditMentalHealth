0,"This involves a lot of back story.

I loved art but until maybe 2 years ago I've been really discouraged in the field and it turned out to make me super miserable I didn't like to be critiqued every day and feeling the stress of a deadline.
Last year I really loved writing and expressing myself, my friends supported me through comics and all sorts of doo-dads, I loved writing essays and then it slowly went to go downhill after people started discouraging me and my little stories. Thou a lot of people liked them, one or two people made me feel bad so I stopped.
Fast forward to this year, I fell in love with acting and singing, it was really fun preforming with my friends and having a good time but now my peers and I have grown to despise it, we're all stressed about everything and now all this stress is starting to make me miserable. None of us get along like we did at the beginning of the year. My teacher is stressed out and it's not doing to great.

Why do the things that I love doing and expressing myself with turn into something that makes me upset or miserable.

4,"Ok, so. As a child, I was a total crybaby. I can't really pinpoint when exactly that changed, but I figure I just matured out of it. Nowadays, as a young adult (24yo) I'd say I cry a few times a year, which seems pretty normal.

However, I've noticed a pattern. Even if I'm already crying, if someone else starts to cry, I immediately stop. It's like a switch gets flipped inside of me. For example, my SO and I were having a heartfelt, difficult discussion and I was quite teary. But as soon as my SO started to cry, I just couldn't. Same thing for funerals, sad movies, etc. I have no problem (I mean, it's not fun crying in general) crying in front of close family/friends but as soon as they start, I'm completely unable to cry.

I've tried to do some research on my own, but most of the info pertains to people who can't cry at all - but that's not my problem. I guess I'm open to any ideas as to why this happens, mostly because it's something my SO brought up recently and I'd like to figure out what's up. ",11Apr2017,1
5,"So I am in a very bad situation where I have a friend(who shall be referred to as Friend A) that I only know from online that lives on a whole different continent that has been really depressed and has threatened suicide multiple times, one time causing another person( Friend B) to have to call the police on him. Friend B wants to move on and have nothing to do with Friend A because it's been too much, and I'm getting to that point too. Friend A refuses to move on from Friend B and it's making his depression worse and it's affecting me too. He has gone for help when the police were called but it appears they just gave him a generic antidepressant and it's not working.

6,"Hi, I'm 27, from Los Angeles. 

I've been living here my whole life, and I feel like it might be time for a change. There's no dramatic reason in me wanting to move or anything. I'm honestly just looking for a more affordable life. Los Angeles is too expensive, If I were to pay rent(I currently live with my grandparents) here In LA I wouldn't have money to do much else. I've gotten lucky and I have a decent job that's opening a lot of opportunities for me. So that got me thinking that it might be a good idea to start planing a move.

I have a few locations in mind. 

Denver CO
Portland OR
Bloomington IN

My current income is 33k/year. 

Currently my plan before I move is to over the  next 10-12 months is to:

1. pay off car loan

2. Save at least 3 months of pay / rent (besides deposits)

7,"Hello,

Today I felt like something was just off. 

I felt unmotivated to workout, just uninspired to work. 
Thinking about my life and what I regret and have done in the past several years. 

I really want to say that it is stress but I don't know what's going on. I have never felt this way ever but I started to think about what achievements I didn't achieve, things I regret doing and not doing, how good my relationship is with my family and how it's bad with others. 

I thought back on where my confidence disappeared to. After 8th grade, I just became anti-social, not athletic, disinterested in school. but before that, this was never a problem. and today, I started to think all about that and felt like I'm missing a lot and something went horribly wrong.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, please help another bud out and tell me how to deal with something like this. This is something brand new to me.

11,"So I just caught wind from a co-worker in the office that during a meeting tomorrow, the owner of the company will be requiring all employees to sign a non-compete contract with no incentives. This contract states that no employees will be able to perform any job that is even remotely similar to the services provided by the company (obviously). It goes on to state that and knowledge and education gained, including a CDL, from employment at the company cannot be used for no more than 3 years within a 50 mile radius of the shop location. Now I understand having to pay the company back for any costs of said skills and certifications acquired, but to not use them? My question is, am I legally required to sign this contract with my position on the line if I don't? I live in a right-to-work state so I feel that this answers my question but I want to know if there are any other options. I have been working for this company for over a year and well past the probationary period and found a passion for doing what I do, not to mention that I'm actually really good at it.

I'm a younger sibling (im 16 my brother is about to turn 18) and I feel like my parents honestly do not give a shit about anything when it comes to me. When my brother was younger, my parents took care of all of his drivers ed and driving shit right away, bought him a care, and all of that crap. I had to pay for my own drivers ed (which I started late) because my mom wouldn't even though she could afford it, and now that I have my permit (16 and a half years old already) never takes me driving. On top of that, she tries to control every aspect of my life while also not doing shit to actually try and help me be successful. She says ""all she wants is for me to be better than she was"" and i'm already doing that ten fold. She was a shitty kid which shes told me many stories about and now rides my ass over everything imaginable. She caught me with alcohol one time and tried to label me as an alcoholic and that i'm turning into such a bad kid, and recently she caught me with my almost 6 month girlfriend getting head and literally kicked me out of the house for a whole week. Now she called my school and told them to not let me leave school during my free periods, which I have nobody to even bother talking to during.

35,"I feel as if I am trapped on the edge of a cliff and if I make the wrong choice I'll fall. 

In short, even though I've never really thought about it until recently, I've never been an independent decision maker. I was home educated from an early age, and my mother dictated everything I said and did. When faced with a choice I would go with whatever option she would pick, to avoid conflict. Fast forward to college, I enrolled in dual-credit courses because she and everyone I knew thought it was a good idea. When I was due to graduate and had to pick a college, I didn't have a ""guide"" to follow, so out of sheer indecisiveness I opted to just stay at the tech college I had done dual-creds through.  Two years later I had an associates, but everyone kept saying that I needed Bachelor's to get on in life. Once again I had no blue print, and ended up going to a school that I didn't actually want to attend, but made sense logically. I chose a major based on it's projected field growth, and that I didn't entirely hate it. My reasoning was that if I hadn't found something that I felt passionate about and could make a living off of, better stick to logic. 

Well I graduated some time ago, after being lucky enough to meet my current SO. We both went through a patch of job hunting; he landed a pretty secure position after much effort on his part. I meanwhile realized too late that I was not cut out for my major. I graduated but I did not excel.  I have been trying to study to pass a certification test, to go into another area that once again I feel lackluster about. I don't dislike it, but I feel no passion. It's just another possible career route. I can't make any decisions on my own without constant fear that I'm in the wrong. All throughout college I felt like a noose was slowly tightening around my neck tighter as graduation approached. I didn't enjoy school, but I had people telling me what to do and assignments to follow.  I feel so stupid, everyone else in my age bracket was chomping at the bit to be free and make their own life choices, meanwhile I'm quaking in my boots. I just feel like I'm doomed to fail, and even if I do set my sights on something I'll screw up. My SO is supportive but I haven't told him of my mental struggle. I feel like something is wrong with me, that out of all those years in college I never found something that I loved and wanted to make a career out of. All I did was go to class, do my work, and sleep.   I've even tried taking time for myself to analyze things and find out why I'm so apathetic towards my future, and I've found that I *do* care, it's like I'm terrified to move on in my life. School was my existence for so many years, that it's like I've been cut loose, and without instructions to follow instead of running about freely I'm afraid to even put one more foot forward.

What can I do to get over my fear and indecisiveness towards my life choices?",11Apr2017,1
37,"I'm sorry for the long post, I am just at my wits end with my family situation and I wanted some advice on what to do.  I'll try to keep it as short as possible:  I moved away from my family about 5 years ago to a completely different country. (Long story, but met my husband who lives across the world and made the decision to move there.) I regularly keep in touch with my mom via telephone calls and internet, and I have two younger sisters who I communicate with occasionally. My sisters are completely irresponsible people. They are in their 30's, into drugs (weed) which doesn't bother me if they were financially stable but it's what they spend a lot of their money on, never pay bills on time, always leaving their kids with my parents (my father is turning 70 this year and is pretty much their baby sitter).  About a year ago, my mom made the really dumb decision to move to a large house with my sisters, their four children, and my sister's boyfriend.  

This was all while knowing that sister #1 was horrible at paying her bills. She had been evicted a few times because of not paying bills, and has had her utilities shut off more than once for the same reason.  This was also knowing that sister #2 has a verbally abusive boyfriend, who was on drugs at the time, and had a history of not keeping a steady job.  

Her excuse was she ""felt sorry for her grandchildren.""  Which is true, I feel sorry for them as well, but my sisters know how my mom feels about kids, and uses that to their advantage all the time.

Over the past year, she constantly tells me about the issues she's had with them, #1 not paying bills, #2 getting into fights with her boyfriend at 3am and waking the kids, not keeping the house clean, being lazy etc etc.  

Recently sis #1 and her boyfriend both lost their jobs, and both are not trying as hard as they should to find another one. My sister's boyfriend has been off of work for 6 weeks. My mom has been struggling to pay the bills as my dad is retired and only get's social security checks, which also go toward rent. 

Sis #2 will sometimes ""forget"" to pay her part of the bill, or spend it elsewhere, and just expects my parents to cover her.  I just got a message from my mom asking me for money to help cover their rent as they will be getting evicted tomorrow if they don't come up with 300 dollars.  I told her I didn't have the money as I am living check to check as well, and also I didn't even know how I would get the money to her as it would be hard to get it to her same day anyway seeing that I am on the other side of the world from her.  

I am at my wits end with my family, my mom allows this to happen, and my sisters are just so irresponsible, it makes me sick :( And now to top it all off I feel like the worst daughter because I couldn't help my mom out with money, even though she's helped me out with money before...I just don't have it to give to her, and I don't know how I would get it to her on time....

Can anyone give me some advice on what do to? Should I just leave it all be? Thanks for reading my long post...",11Apr2017,2

47,"All my life I've been the geek at school: I like computer science, I swam (which isn't a respected sport at my school) and I didn't have that many friends.

In mid February, I decided to quit swimming and join track, due to the sport becoming stale for me. I wasn't the fastest runner but I met some nice friends. I also began my college hunt (I was a junior at the time).

Skipping ahead to this current school year, I joined XC in the fall and did well in that, and then was one of the top runners at my school for Indoor track. I've grown relatively popular in the past half a year or so and met many new people. I have joined Robotics club in fall to quench my thirst for nerdiness, and I am the co-president of Coding Club. I also got my first girlfriend and had my first kiss at the beginning of 2017. In addition, I got into every college I applied to and know general where I'm going to go next year.

Life seems like nothing can or will go wrong. I have a very severe case of senioritis. I will do some homeworks unless I'm not really feeling it, and I have a LOT of time during school to get all my work done, but I spend that time playing on my laptop doing something like Geometry Dash or whatnot. I don't finish my work sometimes until 1 or 2 AM due to procrastination. During robotics club I don't do squat to help: I just do other stuff, or I skip to visit my girlfriend.

Speaking of her, our relationship is pretty healthy however we've become increasingly touchy and I've found myself to have very little self control when I'm with her. Furthest we've gone was third base but she wants to go all the way home.

On top of everything, my parents are moving and require my help to be home and do stuff for them to sell the house, and my schedule is very packed and I'm rarely home due to my activities (which is BS because I just procrastinate) so they forced me to quit either Robotics or Track (I quit robotics).

A very close friend of me and my gf (let's call him C) and I decided to room together in college. I never really expected the BFFs type of relationship since we're pretty different people. We hungout a lot freshman year but started meeting new people and getting into our own things, which I'm fine with. There was some silly drama with C and a girl wanting to date but multiple people didn't think it was a good idea (including my gf) so he just about completely shut us out. My gf and C were friends way longer than me and shes taking it pretty rough. They seemed to make amends with one another but C has gotten progressively more passive aggressive.


So here's where the big issue occurred. C had friends over in our dorm, he didn't tell me, studying together and whatever. I came to get my charger, talked with them for a bit, and left back to my gfs place. Not even a couple of minutes passed and they started trash talking me and my gf for various things. Only reason I know is one of the people I'm actually pretty close to but C didn't know.


I personally don't care if he has friends over without letting me know but as soon as they disrespected me and my gf I got really pissed. I wouldn't say I'm a confrontational guy since I let a lot of stuff slide but when I do confront someone it's usually cause I'm pissed. C on the other hand avoids confrontations as much as he possibly can, unless it's a girl then he'll just cave on whatever she wants.


So I am requesting advice for someone like myself to address these issues to someone like C.

Tl;dr:
My friend disrespected me and I need help addressing the issue.

Also I apologize for grammar and spelling. I'm on my phone and I'm more of a math guy.",11Apr2017,1
71,"My girlfriend we'll call her Caroline (who is 17 almost 18) of almost a year (May 9th &lt;3) just got evicted from her house. Her mom doesn't work, it come to light that she hasn't been paying the rent with the checks she gets from her husband and lying to the whole family. Today was the end of the 3 week notice to leave the house that she failed to tell any of them and they were forced to leave the house with absolutely no kind of forward notice. I'll tell you a little about her mom's history. She first stole my gf's sister's (we'll call her Christine) money. She had been saving up to buy a gaming pc and when she had almost all the money, about 1000$, her mom took all of it. Christine is kind of passive and lets her mom do things like that. I know that she has once aloud her mom to use her to take out a loan. Just recently Caroline had the same thing happen to her. She stole 400$ of my baby's hard earned money. Caroline goes to school, works, and is in the military. She on the other hand isn't passive after a well deserved argument she went to the banks and filed the money stolen and eventually got it back. That leads us to this weekend. Apparently poor Christine had her money stolen again by her mom yesterday and today is when they got evicted. Caroline went to her friends house for the night but doesn't know what she is gonna do in the long run. Her mom pretty much just said ""well see you next week sometime"". Caroline is in highschool and Christine is out of college about 21 and has a boyfriend. They all work and are thinking about renting an apartment but they don't have too much money and nothing to furnish an apartment with at all. Its overall a very bad situation. I can't believe a mother could do that to her family. Also, I am 18 and work part time as a host. Just any kind of advice I could have to help this situation would be amazing. Thank you reddit.

72,"So ever since the beginning of high school, I've had a pretty bad experience with friend groups. So I have a lot of acquaintances and friends and like 3 close friends. The problem is none of them are in the same group. Recently I asked a girl to go to prom with me (she said yes) but she's a sophomore so none of her friends are going. My close friend said he would get invited to a group and that he would invite me after he gets invited. It turns out the group is full now because of dinner reservations. I wanted to just go with 3 couples. But the other two guys are still set and stone about trying to convince the group to take in six more people which I don't see the point in and it seems relatively sad and desperate to me. In the process, one of them insulted my date so I'm still pissed about that. His reasoning is that when I said it was sad and pathetic that they're still trying to go with the big group he was really mad and thought I was taking a shot at him. I've asked a bunch of my friends if they're going and either they're not going, their group is full, or the after party has alcohol and the group is just a bad crowd in general. I still can ask a few more people tomorrow but I'm really running low on options. Should I just not go with a group? Or should I just swallow my pride and go with the two friends and their dates and the huge group that they're essentially begging to be a part of?",11Apr2017,1

Hello, I recently had an extremely deep conversation with 2 of my best friends as a freshman in high school. It is EXTREMELY important doe to also know that this is a private boarding school. 


We are at the time of the year where we have to start selecting our roomate(s) for next year. My friends tried to shed some light for me and tell me what a few other people are trying to get and who's trying to do what. I figured out a couple of snakes were testing to manipulate me to join one of their friends so they can get into a small dorm of 10 people as they were looking for on over person.


I accepted at first but then later saw through it and denied very quickly. The conversation I later had with my buddies really opened up why many of my peers did what they did as they are both very powerful intellectually. They were honest with me when they said that i am very prone to being manipulated by others, which is why accepted the offer in the first place. Therefore, they tried to attack me to bring me in as they knew everyone else was to strong.



I learned quite a bit from this experience, but they told me to always  try to see the politics of everything and why people try to pick certain people for certain benefits.
So getting to the question..... How can I see people to find their true benefits ?",11Apr2017,0
75,"After I graduated high school I was unable to go straight to college because of my family's financial situation. One of my parents was friends with someone who was willing to train a free intern. The ordeal was very casual as I'd mainly be working from home except for a few in-person meetings with other people from the company. There was some promise of eventual compensation after the first 3 months (the usual trial period) however, I've been there approximately six months and haven't really heard much more on the matter. 

At first I was happy to be doing any work as I had a ton of free time since I wasn't doing school. I learned to use new programs and to get more traffic to the company's website. However, I began experiencing immense amounts of stress the further I went. For one, since my boss knew I wasn't in school he expected me to be able to respond to e-mails quickly. I was always very professional about it but sometimes he'd spam my inbox with the same questions and I'd get anxious if I hadn't had a chance to do something which didn't make the boss too happy (even if I was never given a time limit). Overall, I was rather good at getting things done in time but the amount of stress I'd end up experiencing over this unpaid internship ended up being not worth it. And I know I'm eventually going to have to quit but since he knows my family personally my parents will be down my throat about why I quit, and how great it was for me to be doing something etc. I have since started school so I have less time to spend on this and really don't need the extra stress but I feel bad about leaving even though I'd prefer to be working where I'd be compensated. This internship indirectly correlates to my field in some way or another but I feel like it'd be better for me to move onto bigger and better things. ",11Apr2017,1

82,"Background of current issue: I work in retail, and have been a manager at my current company for 5 years. At my store the overnight teams are divided into two, two person teams and we work a week rotation then we're off for a week. A couple weeks ago we hired a young man who really blew me away with his vigor putting shipments away along with other tasks; although in retail speed is appreciated accuracy is just as, if not more important.

Originally I was the supervisor in mind for training being I have the most experience and am currently the strongest overnight supervisor. Due to scheduling he was placed on the opposite rotation thus learning from a less skilled and less experienced supervisor. She failed to correct a couple things and this past weekend I was covering her vacation and was appointed the task of correcting him and ensuring what he knows thus far is correct and up to company expectation. 

My current issue is from the get go he has been fighting with me tooth and nail about my instruction and tasks I've been giving him. My store manager has been out of store the past two days so I haven't been able to set up a coach and council with them thus leaving me in this limbo with his understanding of my authority.

101,"Hey friends
So here is my story. I think, as I mentioned, I have finally hit rock bottom, and honestly I am needing things to start looking up. I have a series of problems that are all attributed to my irresponsibility. My mental illness was definitely a factor, however I think it's time I took responsibility for my actions.

First of all, I'm 20 years old, and should be just finishing up my third year of university. I used to be a chemistry student with dreams of medical school. My first and second year, I literally did not pass one class. A huge part of this, again, was my mental illness, however there were steps I could have taken to help myself, but I did not. So I go to register for courses this year and see (of course) that I had been released from my program, and was only allowed to continue studies as a non-degree student until I've completed 4 credits, then I could be considered for re-admission into my program. So essentially, I've wasted thousands of dollars and 2 years of my life doing nothing. I know - it makes me feel ill too. So now it's looking like it may take me 6 years to finish my undergrad (in total, from the beginning) and that's with overloading my courses. I am humiliated. In addition, my family has no idea about any of this - according to them, I'm full time and on track. Cause of the whole humiliation thing.

Another fun thing - my finances are in shambles. I have a credit score of about ~400. About two summers ago, my mother got into a really bad situation with a drug addict boyfriend and stopped coming home, so 17 year old me had to fend for herself. I got 2 credit cards and a part time job, but I was not responsible with paying back the cards, nor did I have a lot of money to do so. Fast forward to now, and both cards have been cancelled by the bank. I get it - I'd drop me as fast as possible, and I understand that I screwed up. Also, because of me not being in good academic standing with my school, the loan I got in first year now needs to be paid back in full before I can take out another - even more debt. Some other random bill debt on top of all that - I can't breathe. I don't know how to fix any of this. The grand total is somewhere around $5000 in debt.
What's unfortunate is because of all this, I can't afford the medicine I take to keep me from basically cycling back to the really bad state I was in before. 

I'm on my way to earning my very first university credit - it's looking like I'll pull an 80 or a 75 in the course. It's a tiny step but I'm very happy about it. As far as everything else - I honestly don't know where to start. My family is a mess of it's own and not much help, and I've looked into doing an academic forgiveness petition but it's doubtful it will be accepted because of my lack of documentation for my mental illness - due to my unwillingness to get help early on. With the money stuff, I don't even have an inkling of how to solve it all.

I guess what I'm asking is 1. has anyone else ever screwed up their life this bad? and 2. What the heck do I do about it? I'm tired of lying to my friends and family, and fearing my inbox because my landlord is asking for my late rent. I need some words of wisdom/ a plan of attack from an unbiased party. It's scary to wake up every day.

P.S Thanks for listening to me whine - it really really means the world. 
TL;DR I am a moron who makes bad choices. Help me. ",11Apr2017,1

I also have problems connecting and opening up to people on a personal level. Whats wrong  with me ?  I also get very intimate with my pillows and feel an emotional connection when humping them and imagine they are various females i see in real life. Am i crazy ? I feel very lonely and actually have grown accustomed to it and prefer it over big crowds but i can put on fake funny confidence when needed.  Sometimes once in a blue moon ill sleep with a hangman's noose i made around my neck because it makes the constant thinking stop and i feel safe and warm. I have constant thoughts of suicide and weird things make me very sad to my core. I went to the mall with a buddy the other day and saw a female going up the escalator with a very short skirt and no panties on i saw everything and suddenly it made me really really sad to the point where i had to go home and felt sad for 3 days after that.  At one point i could not look at pornography without bursting into tears. I no longer have a desire to date but do anyways so i can keep learning how to interact with people. Keeping busy with two jobs and uni helps. I don't eat a lot or sleep or bathe or wash my cloths much anymore theres not really a point in my mind if im not aiming for dates anyways.

However, one of these people is no longer our friend, due to him stalking me and being an all around abusive creep, to me in particular. We have forgiven him but also have been gradually cutting off communication with him. He is going and planning the gathering (it will not be at his place). Because of this I do not want to go.


A few of the people going used to be close friends with us, but have become busy this past year. Most attempts to set up time with them have been rebuffed.

How do you deal with loss? Im not talking about loss like your mother dying peacefully in her sleep. Her job done and yours only begun. Im talking about the loss of a potential future. The hatred and anger that must come from her to not even want to talk to you. Im talking about the loss of love. The loss of hope. Im talking about the kind of loss that has you sitting in the front porch at 5 in the morning, chainsmoking unfiltered reds and looking up at the night sky wondering whether or not youd get to be under it with her again.


This isnt a physical loss. A part of your soul can never be regained. You know that you could message her and tell her what you feel. But that wont help. 

So you click open her blocked messenger profile and read back to a few days before it happened. You start to wonder. If you had said the right things at the right time, would you two still be together?

124,"Basically my brother is 29. He has a 2:1 degree in biology but from a not so great uni...He's schizophrenic and is weird in social situations but not terribly so. But worst of all he is 29 and has no job experience apart from random temp stuff that mean nothing. It's so frustrating.. He gives up easily (he's quit a job at amazon before because it was too painful apparently) and was so useless he got fired from a security job. He's been trying to take driving lessons but he's already whining that he can't do it. It's so frustrating and it pisses me off like hell. I'm honestly starting to think he'll NEVER get a stable job. Because I look at him and think who on earth would want to hire him? He's useless and kind of ugly.  Call me heartless but I'm trying to be as blunt as possible so I can actually get a proper answer. It's been about 2 years since he left University and he still hasn't found a job. He's literally always at home and It makes me fucking resent him so much. I know it hurts my Mum too. I speak with her but she always brushes it off saying ""it's not his fault, he tries"". She says she can cope.  He's a schizophrenic and has suffered deep depression over the years. I'm 19, btw. I go uni and work part time. My older sisters work so hard and he looks pathetic in comparison to any other man his age. No job, no girlfriend, no career or experience, no license. I have never met someone this pathetic. His redeeming qualities are that he is a kind person and is very selfless, but that wont get him anywhere. I don't know what to do.

126,"Hi all,

So I posted in a separate subreddit a few weeks ago asking for advice with some anxiety and anger management issues I've been having. The advice was to go and get help, which I have done - I've now had two sessions with a counsellor over the past 3 weeks and it's been very enlightening. (The other post was on a different account that I can't remember the login - derp)

Basically the outcome was that the underlying cause of my stress is due to family issues. Throughout childhood I have memories of getting uncontrollably angry with my sister, and we found that this was mostly because I felt that my parents greatly favoured my sister, and that I would always be the one at fault. 

I've always suspected this to be the case, but never taken the time to analyse it. It's become a lot more obvious in the last couple of years since I left university. There's also the issue that they just don't seem to want to make the effort to see me, and never express that they're happy with how my life is and what I've achieved so far.

Some examples for context:

- My partner and I bought our first house a year ago, and in the run up to Christmas we suggested that my parents came over for the afternoon of Christmas day (we would go there for christmas eve &amp; the morning of the day). Long story short this got completely shut down with completely bizarre reasons from my Mum as to why they couldn't come, culminating in her inviting my Aunt and Uncle to theirs which felt like a deliberate attempt to not be able to come and see us.
- I recently started a new job, and part of that was going down to their London office for a couple of weeks for induction stuff etc. While down there my Mum would constantly say how great London is and don't I wish I lived there. To note, I have my own house in the country, a really good job and a committed relationship, so I'm perfectly happy not being in an expensive city!
- My grandparents from Ireland visited them a week or so ago, and they already had plans to go and see my sister at university (which is a good 3-4 hour drive away) so I suggested they might want to come and see us, (we live 1 hour away) as they might want to see our house etc etc. This got immediately shut down and the suggestion was that I should go over to them, which I couldn't do as we have a huge amount of work to be doing on our house at the moment.
- Anytime I suggest any kind of social situation they never seem keen. There's a gin festival in the city near us in a couple of months, and I suggested we went all together and they could stay over at ours, and again, immediately shut down :( 
- I get teased about how long the work we're doing on the house is taking all the time. However we only get one day a week together (my SO works Mon-Sat) so it's pretty slow going. I've never had any suggestion that they might come and help out despite suggesting it previously.

These are only a handful of examples, and I just don't think my Mum especially is all that happy with how my life is, and wants me to have this crazy few years in my 20s, and that settling down this early is wrong. Which is fair enough if she thinks that but it really puts me down given I've got what most of my friends are aiming for! My boyfriend and I are probably going to get engaged in the next year and we were discussing how I should probably mention it to my parents at some point, but I don't feel comfortable as I feel they'd just try and persuade me out of it :(

This stuff is also really damaging my relationship, as I'll randomly get incredibly angry and stressed about what seems like nothing. Plus he has a very different relationship with his parents so it's difficult for him to understand why I'd want my parents to pay attention to me more than they do (he's in his 30s so I guess that makes sense). It's frustrating as I know the root cause I just don't know how to tackle it.

Basically I know I need to somehow tell my parents how this is affecting me, as I'm constantly looking for validation from them from years of not getting any, which is causing quite a lot of stress and anger which is causing random explosions when it gets too much :/ But I'm terrified my Mum will take it the wrong way and get angry or upset. Help!! 

P.s. sorry if this is rambly and doesn't make sense!

129,"So since I left school 6 years ago I have pretty much partied every weekend, consuming a lot of drugs and alcohol and sometimes going days without sleeping.  Luckily last year I came to my senses and since then I have gradually got a lot better and most of the time I have no interest in taking drugs any more, I enjoy being in nature relaxing or staying home making music way more than I enjoy partying. But every now and then I just get this uncontrollable urge to go out and get fucked up, its like theres actually another person in me that finds its way out and all of my sensible thoughts are pushed to the back of my head.

 The urge normally comes when I hear a song that gets me excited or hear people talking about partying, then I start making plans to socialise and drink alcohol, and when I am drunk there is absoutely nothing that will stop me from spending all of my money on cocaine.

Its incredibly difficult to get any help in terms of therapy because the mental health specialists dont want anything to do with you when you mention you sometimes take drugs, they just refer you to the drugs therapists who then tell you that they only deal with people who are actually addicted to drugs and that you should go back to your doctor.

I'm addicted to pills. But to other type of pills. I'll try to make it short.

Magnesium orothate 
Vitamin D 1000 ui
Calcium 500 mg
All with one pill for stomach protection. All in the morning.

141,"Hello. I have anxiety and depression, and I tend to get anxious and stressed, then snap at people. I've gotten better at not outright snapping at people and controlling myself, but even if I don't, once I hit a certain point of anxiety it's like a switch flips and I'm much more tense, aggravated etc. At that point if I receive any more stimuli (physical), input or general change I either get a panic attack or lash out in fear.

For context, my father wasn't around much in childhood and I had a very rocky relationship with my mother, who I lived with most of the time. I also spent a lot of time at an after school care service, and had rage issues growing up from my parents' divorce. 

My mother was quite...abusive and a lot of times I felt like I was the caretaker and parent, or I was standing in as her husband or emotional support. I felt like I would be walking on eggshells with her because she would just lash out at me or say mean things for no reason, then act like nothing happened. There was a lot of money problems because my dad was unreliable with money, and generally I didn't have much structure or parenting when I was growing up because my mother wanted to be my friend more and my dad was not there. My mother did her best, but she had a lot of fear and she allowed that fear to control her actions.

I left my mother's home at 19 to live with my dad because she hit me, and spent the next two years going in and out of therapy for suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety issues. I've improved a lot since I was 19, but one of the main things I want to change I cannot control and it is affecting the people around me. My therapist suggested that my issues revolve around expectations - when there is an abrupt change of plans I get very anxious, this possibly stems from the lack of structure in my childhood.

After anxiety episodes like this happen I get panic/anxiety attacks and spiral into a loop of self loathing. I just went through one, and now that I've had the attack and rested I feel so stupid for freaking out over something so small. I don't snap at my loved ones much any more, but obviously being around someone so tense and on the brink of lashing out is draining to my loved ones. 

What I want to ask is, how do I stop this? I want to stop getting triggered so I can stop lashing out at my loved ones and just be. I don't want to be like my mother. I don't want to be afraid of everything and anything and I don't want to get anxious and tense and potentially lash out at my SO. I don't want to continue the cycle of abuse.

144,"In high school (over ten years ago), I had a close friend who one night, at a party when we were both drunk, climbed on top of me and kissed me and groped me, even though I asked them to stop. I'm not sure if they did more than that because I blacked out, but I suspect they also fingered me because I felt sore the next day. I didn't tell any authority figures, partially because it was before all the PSAs about consent, but partially because we were both girls, and I felt confused. 

Instead, I told a few of my close friends, and they immediately stopped speaking with the person, and encouraged others to stop speaking to her. We toilet papered her house numerous times, publicly shared the names of her sexual partners. She thought I was the person instigating this behavior, but I was still so shocked and ashamed, I could barely process. But I didn't discourage my friends when they would suggest things we could do. 

The years passed, and the story changed in my mind. I told myself I was the victim of unwanted sexual acts, and we just as a group stopped speaking to this person after. But I've been thinking more about it (especially after watching the show ""13 reasons why"" about bullying) and I am realizing what we did to this person was cruel. I wonder what I should have done differently - gone to the authorities and ruined her life legally instead? and am trying to wrap my mind around what happened. A part of me wants to reach out and apologize to her, because it really devastated her, another part of me feels justified because of what she did.

I cant do this because of the children, but sometime i feel i could just up and leave, maybe because i never knew my father as he left when i was 6, and it never affected me so it wont affect my kids right? I know thats morally wrong. But yet still feel i could do it.

Secondly if i was to leave my job, started travelling and decided i wanted to come back, i would never get my job back or possibly get a job anywhere near the money that i am making just now.

Its necessary. Otherwise, why would relationships exist? But how far can it push you before you reach your limit? 


To some, people are like single serving meals: You love them for a month then you throw them. Then you love the next person.


To hapless romantics like me: Love is forever. Love is enduring.


But above all, love is painful. It's an open invitation to be stabbed. An open invitation to be betrayed. For me personally, love is one of the most important things in life. Among with freedom and happiness. I would die for love. I would charge the trenches and fight tooth and nail until im a withered corpse for love. 


But lately I've been having doubts. I found my soulmate. It was painful. I bared it all. The infrequency of the visits. Her second guessing our relationship, making me beg everytime. Then the toxicity of her parents. I could bear it all. 


Atleast I thought I did until I snapped. A life was threatened and now she wont even talk to me. Months and months and even YEARS of waiting were thrown away all because I made one mistake. Nobody owes anybody anything. I understand. But an understanding and sympathy would've gone a long way. I should've ended it the second time she said we were over. Told her to be an adult and make her own decisions. I believed in love. My one mistake meant that everything was a lie. My one mistake destroyed the relationship. I took it all until my sanity collapsed. But my one mistake was too much.



I have so much love. So much fucking love. But im thinking of pissing all that away the next time I get up from this chair to expel the remains of the vodka. Truth be told, I want to go back to the jaded cynical asshole that stood up girls for 2 months. The guy she fell in love with.

It was one of those curses you do in everyday conversations like ""fucking hell, bob, shave your legs"" kind of cursing, but somehow he misinterpreted it as a ""fuck you bob, your opinions smell like shit, fuck off"" one or something like that. 

Now me and my friends in the chat didn't think much of what I said because they understand the mundanity of it all, but that one friend suddenly cursed back, left the group chat, and blocked me.

Now I was confused with what was happening, and so were my friends, so I messaged him to explain that I wasn't mad at him, but was basically called ""trash"" and was told to ""never talk to him again.""

My friends tried to explain, but he was hearing none of it. Basically, the only opinion and perspective that appeals to him is his own. He told one of our mutual friends that he ""plans to bully me when school starts"" and ""make my life a living hell"". Three weeks after that, I messaged him again telling him that it was all my fault and i was very sorry for what i did and that i'd do my best to make up for what i did, which I sent because I sincerely wanted to be his friend again, because I cherished what we had. Reply?: ""Fuck off!"".

Two days later, I got a message from another mutual that ""he would only be friends with me again"" if i do this nearly impossible thing for him and succeed. IF I do it for him. There's a condition.

157,"Sorry this is long and probably full of typos, but I really need help here.

So my roommate randomly brought home a cat one day without asking for my permission. I'm a huge animal lover so of course I welcomed her with open arms, even though I'm severely allergic to her. 

Now here's the issue, he's totally neglecting her, he only got the cat as ""last whim"" to keep a guy he had feelings for, in his life. Once the said guy left him, my roommate totally dropped the cat from his life. He only shows her attention when we have company over (just solely for the attention). He cleans out her litter box maybe once every two weeks, she keeps stepping in her own feces and it gets stuck in her poor paws. He never feeds her and she would go days without food or water if I didn't live there. I've seen him kick her violently across the room because she bit his ankle and it absolutely broke my heart. She never gets bathed or her nails clipped, so I took the initiative and got that done for her. Did he pay me back when I asked? No. I've bought all her toys and food for her since he refuses to buy her food. He actually went out of town last week and knowingly left without getting her cat food (which I reminded him plenty of times to get) so I had to buy yet again another bag that he won't pay me back for. I could care less about the money really, it's just kind of frustrating because she is not my cat yet I don't want her to starve.

He hasn't established a vet yet and she's been in the house for over three months now. She's a kitten so I know she's overdue in all her shots, and where I'm from, you legally have to get your kitten a rabies vaccination after 4 months of age. The kitten was born 10/13/16 so she's definitely overdue. 

The cat and I have bonded so much because I am the reason why she's still alive and somewhat healthy. I want to adopt her under my name but I'm way too allergic to her to actually keep her, which sucks because I love her so much. I've told him countless times to trim her nails, bathe her, feed her, and take her to the vet; yet he tells me each time to ""worry about myself"". He's now just keeping the cat out of spite and I know he'll make my life hell if I were to put the cat in a better home. 

Now here's the catch, he illegally claimed the pet from a woman he knew. That said woman's name is on the adoption papers, so the cat is not under his name, and that is illegal where I live because the woman signed a contract saying she wouldn't give the pet away. The shelter has no idea he has the cat now and he hasn't registered the cat with our apartment either (which is also illegal).. 

So he has absolutely no rights towards the cat, what should I do in this situation reddit? I'm moving out in two weeks (because he's an awful person) and I would rather not leave the kitty behind. 

(Just a little insight to how shitty and crazy he is: I told him to get cat food for his cat before he left for LA last week, he decided to yell at me telling me it's ""HIS CAT"" and when I came back at him saying it's ""MY HOUSE TOO"", he stole the wifi router and purposely broke the dryer and left for LA without buying cat food. Now I know this post may come off overdramatic, but all of this is true to the core, of course the roommate and I will always have issues, but my only concern right now is this poor kitty!)

161,"I've been anxious for a while that I've been obnoxious to a couple of my female friends. I've wanted to date them both and have been writing too much to them. To the point where they don't respond. I regret that, because I don't want to seem desperate. One said no, so at this point I want to be a normal friend. I'm worried I can't anymore, because any proposal to hang out will seem like I'm looking for a date with her. The other girl, I'm worried, doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. So that's that. I've fucked up a couple of friendly relationships with girls, and I'm worried that this will affect any potential relationship in the future. I want to have a girlfriend, but I'm worried that these past actions (that I regret) will still affect a relationship with a future girlfriend. I.E, I'm worried that I'll be too anxious to lose friends to ask them out.

I'm in love with a girl with a boyfriend. If they break up, I'm not sure I even dare to ask her out. I love her very much as a friend, I don't want to lose that in case she doesn't feel the same way. I could tell her that, but then I'd rather not tell her how I feel.",11Apr2017,1
163,"tldr: I hurt my knee, and my work won't let me work, even though I was a few days ago with the same injury and other have done it before.

So this all happened within the last 24 hours and I need some kind of advice on what to do.

I am a 17 year old that has been employed by McDonalds Canada for the past year. I have always tried to do my job to the best of my ability, and have rarely made mistakes. 

My restaurant has many manager, 5 of them being salaried (1 of which who is in charge of everything). Our head manager and myself get along about half of the time, the rest we don't at all. Typically in the times that we are not getting along he choosing to say very hurtful things. These aggravated insults normally include ""my biggest regret was hiring you"" and other things such as knocking things to the floor and making me clean them. Whenever this happens I don't say anything and just smile and do what I'm told. 

On April the 1st I crashed skiing and hurt my knee. I could barely walk but chose to still go to work and school (I just took some time off sports). Work way fine, I asked to be in a position where I wouldn't have to move frequently in hopes of not hurting my knee more. 

The following Friday, I was fed up with the pain in my knee and decided to go to the doctor. They told me that I had injured my MCL and meniscus, and that I should not put weight on my knee, and therefore be on crutches. On that night and Sunday, I went into my shift with crutches (as many others had done before). They were welcoming and got me a chair to sit in so I wouldn't have to be standing, and put me in positions that I wouldn't have to move very frequently. 

Yesterday I went into my shift and was immediately sent home, with my managers stating that they couldn't have someone working on crutches. And today I was told that I must take off all my shift for the this week and next. I asked why I was not able to work with crutches as others had done and was told it was a health and safety risk. So I offered to go in without crutches and I was also told I could not. 

I know this might sound like typical restaurant behaviour, but at my location it is not. I had one friend who broke her toe and was given a chair for 6 weeks. Another lady tore her ACL and spent nearly 6 months on crutches and was given a chair in each shift. On top of that, when I was hired I was told that if any employees became injured, McDonalds would do their best to accommodate them, and find them a job to do so they don't have to lose money. 

I just need advice on what to do. In 2 weeks I leave to California and won't be able to work. I can't afford to not work this week and next (especially with Easter pay). Any advice is very much appreciated.",11Apr2017,1

My contract ends this Friday, and for the past month I've been looking for a job. I return in about 3 weeks. I've applied on average to two jobs a week where my girlfriend lives. I know it may not be a large amount, but they were all jobs I was at least mildly excited about and fit the qualifications. I got one response, but it didn't work out because I wouldn't have been back soon enough.

My girlfriend is currently starting to get very frustrated with me. My current job doesn't have a lot of hours (but the pay is decent), so her argument is if I have so much free time, why haven't I found a job? She's been saying I'm being inconsiderate and is threatening to get worse if I don't find something by the time I get back. I feel like I can up my applications, but then I would just be applying outside of what I have a chance at getting (not to mention applying to things I am not interested in).

171,"This is a long story, but please bare with me. I found a woman who is pretty much the perfect match for me. We've been engaged, while not lawfully we consider ourselves married, for a little over 3 years now. However, she has 3 children from a previous (abusive) relationship. 

Our living standards are pretty low. She has no income because she's in school. She was getting by with the low child support payments from her ex and some help through government programs. I stepped in with my minimum wage income and helped to improve things around the house (it was a nightmare). 

As I was getting involved the mental state of the household was becoming more and more apparent to me. The oldest, May (a now 15 year old girl) has ADD, very argumentative, and lies way more than any child should, but she is bright and an excellent artist. The middle child, Julie (a now 11 year old girl), is the most behaved/motivated, but is often distracted by her siblings/friends. The youngest, Ken (a now 9 year old boy) has ADHD and is also dealing with depression. He refuses to do almost any work, does not respect personal space, and can be violent/destructive (though not as extreme as it sounds), but I can see that he has the capacity to be fairly intelligent. The biological father is...well...an asshole. He has and to a much lesser extent continues to mentally abuse May, clearly favors Julie, and ignores Ken. Doesn't do much with them when he sees them (maybe once a week, sometimes less) except take them to get fast food or sit and watch Netflix with them (while he browses the web on his phone). My fiance has ADHD, bipolar disorder, and is an epileptic. 

Side note: hard to explain why we're so good for each other, but it kind of boils down to: I'm dominant and she's submissive and we have very similar interests. 

This is a HUGE clusterfuck of mental health. Initially I tried to take a slow approach by not intervening in the parenting and just being nice to the kids, but I learned fast things were out of control. My fiance's parenting skills were minimal and the kids were walking all over her. I stepped in to try to pull everything together. 

Long story short (if you need deets feel free to ask, it's just a lot to type right now), overall things have improved, the kids are in therapy, Ken is on medication (with little if any improvement), but things still feel out of control and the stress of it all is becoming a bit much for me and sometimes I want to cry, leave, or just blow up with swear words and insults at the first person I see. I keep most of it in though. My fiance does know how I feel for the most part. I communicate, but minimally because it makes my fiance feeling guilty and doesn't change anything. IMO, if I don't keep it together this family will implode so I need to figure out how to deal with the stress because it's creeping out in the form of anger/yelling and I'm not a fan of treating anyone that way.",11Apr2017,2
172,"Hi Reddit,

This is a throwaway account just in case. My boyfriend's mother passed away and this year will have been 10 years since it happened. She unfortunately committed suicide and my boyfriend's little brother (who was 12 at the time) is the one who found her. This has affected his family in numerous ways and this will be the first time I am dealing with this, and I am not sure how to.

He has briefly mentioned before that Mother's Day upsets him. May is Mother's Day, June is the anniversary of her death, and July is her birthday. All of this is coming at me at once and I just want to be there for him and even his family in the best way I can, but I do not want to interfere or overstep any boundaries. 
 
Some background:
We have only been together for a little under a year, so this is a fairly new relationship, but we love each other very much already. He and his family talk about his mom occasionally, but not very often. Whenever I bring her up or ask him questions about her, he will answer the question and then change the subject.

173,"My ex-GF and I broke up 1 year ago, and now after thinking I would never find love again, I bumped into a woman who I immediately fell head over heels for 3 months ago. We hit it off pretty well, and I think she was interested too. However, I was still emotionally vulnerable at the time and decided to not pursue anything further. I thought occasional facebook messages would be good enough; if we don't date might as well have a good friend.

But now its been 3 months, and I literally cannot get her out of my head. I finally built up the courage to ask her out 2 days ago, but now her responses back to me have been vague with no definitive answer (yes or no). So I am quite wound up now wondering if I missed an opportunity to do this earlier, wondering if I was hallucinating the good vibes that I had with her, wondering if I have done everything too late in my life, and then looping back on why my ex-GF decided to end our relationship. So now, kind of a mental mess with no clue how to move on and no recourse from my own self doubt, sitting in my own place without doing too much except for thinking, thinking, thinking.

I was a devout Christian until I was 24, when I became 'self-aware' in a way and spent 2 weeks in a thick depression with the blinds shut and 2 months as a social vegetable.

I want to make a change in the world, and I want to explore and discover and ignite new passions. I want to further it, help things in it, and make my mark on it.

Alrighty, I've never actually posted anything substantial before, so bear with me. I'm at a loss on what to actually do any my SO isn't really helping me with the decision. A bit of backstory before I get to the meat. I work ostensibly as a sales guy for roofing material, but I also drive as a delivery guy for the same company because that's how I started off. My boss is the branch manager, I'm salary because of sales position, and I work 10 hours a day 5 days a week and sometimes weekends. I am going to school for Unmanned System Applications (because it's the damn future) and am on track for a masters program. They have a program that if you have a 3.0 GPA, you can apply to get accepted into it and they switch classes out for masters level classes.

At the moment, my entire school is being paid for from my benefits from the military. I also get paid to go to school, a hefty chunk of change, that covers all books and supplies I could ever need. I am the sole provider for a family of 4, myself, SO, and 2 kids less than 5 years old. Due to the fact that I can't really do my jobs as a sales guy, the management is horrible, and the boss can't keep personal and business separate, I am beyond stressed. I have 2 years left of school, 3 if I get into the masters program.  

Here's what I want to do and why. I can quit at the end of the year, live off the money I get for school and savings, and graduate and get (hopefully) a job that is better on all levels. I can live off the money I get and savings for about 2 years, I've done the math, with little wiggle room.

I'm not contributing anything to the world, just wasting my life and other people's time. I don't even know right now whether I genuinely believe this or I'm just doing it cause I have nothing better to do. Will I struggle with this feeling forever? Could I be bipolar?

202,"I recently was accepted to a Master's in Public Health at my current undergraduate institution. I have to commit by April 15th to be guaranteed a spot into this program. However, the only other school I would consider going to over my current school has arranged for a phone interview for their MPH program this coming Monday the 17th. This other school would be at least 5000 dollars cheaper for me to attend per year (but possibly up to 10000 a year due to differences in costs of living and different fees other than tuition). My ultimate goal is to get into medical school, and the program at my current school is run through the medical school here. Thus, it is possible that I would be developing a stronger relation to the people that could ultimately be deciding whether or not I get into medical school. To ""commit"" to the program I have already been admitted to, I merely have to send an email to the program director. Thus, I do not really view it as a binding measure by any means, but I do not know what the kind of bridge that I may be burning if I back out of a letter of intent.

I was 18 at the time and was in a relationship with the girl of my dreams. It was my first relationship, and I loved her more than anything in the world. We slept together every night and were sexually active. She used to take sleeping medication and one night while she was asleep I climbed on top of her and humped her. Over both of our clothes, no penetration.  I knew what I was doing was wrong, and I did something incredibly selfish and fucked up anyway. After I stopped she woke up and got scared. I lied to her and told her it was probably a nightmare. She calmed down extremely fast and our relationship wasn't affected by this at all. I loved her so much and I couldn't bear the thought of her leaving me if she hated me for doing that. She broke up with me a year later for unrelated issues, but didn't ever confess what I really did.  I wound up talking to her about it a few months after our breakup and she said she had no memory of it ever happening, and said I probably didn't do anything wrong. I decided to leave it where it was, because I didn't want to hurt her by telling her what I did. This being said, I haven't been able to move on at all.

218,"So, I am a student studying abroad in another country. We have a week off from classes and I invited my sister to come stay with me for 3 nights. Well turns out in my housing contract, run by my university, I am not allowed over night guests. I found this out a few days before my sister was to arrive, but I told her not to worry about booking a hotel as I haven't seen my janitor/landlord in the 3 months I have studied abroad. Although I assume he turns up regularly to the house, but many of my roommates haven't seen him, that's why I say me and my sister can avoid him for 3 nights.


But! The FIRST day my sister comes over, we get caught by the janitor, and I tell him she is staying in a hotel. He speaks to her asking how does she like the food here and how the weather is back home, being friendly. I thought OK, the landlord seems nice, he might let this slide and not report it to housing. He knows my sister is only staying for 3 nights.

Anyway, later on in the day I get an email from my university housing that I am being threatened with eviction for having an overnight guest. So me and my sister panicked and start looking for hotels for 2 nights. We found a room but it can only be moved in from tomorrow. 

So my problem is, we are currently still at my rented house, almost about to sleep and plan to quickly leave in the morning before the landlord catches my sister staying overnight AGAIN.

Is this a good idea for my sister and me to leave early and quickly? Any better ideas? I think in the contract it says the landlord can't enter our private rooms, only communal areas. What if my sister stayed in my room until I see the landlord turn up and walk away from the house. Then we can leave and get the hotel room?

Update #1 Hey reddit, just want to say thanks for the comforting advice, me and my sister left early the next morning before the janitor came round again. We are currently in the hotel room, and plan to explore the city. Apparently the landlord stuck around our kitchen/common room a little longer today, and I think he was waiting for me or my sister to come out if my room. Good thing we got out fast!",11Apr2017,17

I feel very cut off and unsure of why the chips landed the way they are. Part of the problem, I've realized, is that I just let people walk all over me. My sense of humor can be very sarcastic and self-deprecating a la Louie CK but I think somehow people stop taking me seriously because of it.

234,"Okay, so this is weird, and I'm going to try to make this as short as possible because I feel like it requires a lot of explanation.  I'm a high school junior girl, and a couple months ago this senior guy started talking to me in class and in a few extra curriculars. We didn't become close friends, but aquaintances. He would come up and talk to me every few days, and now its at least every day and for a longer period of time. Basically, he is friends with this girl and he was supposed to go to prom with her as friends but she changed her mind and so he started looking for another date. The girl knew he and I talked I guess, and I would always overhear her telling him to go with me. Also, the other day, he  said to me, ""I heard you aren't going to prom, why not?"" (Yes, as of now I'm not going, I'll get into that). And then I overheard him asking his friends to help him with a poster for a promposal that he is apparantly doing either tomorrow or Thursday. Also his friends keep acting weird around me and they are talking to me a lot more. I am very well aware that I am reading too much into this and he is asking someone totally different. The point of this post isn't really whether or not he will ask me, but what will happen if he does. So from now on let's pretend he will.
      I'm really shy, and I don't have many friends. My friend ""group"" isn't going to prom like me (we are all pretty introverted and prefer to stay home). Prom is only in one month, and I haven't bought tickets, a dress, done anything, because I wasn't supposed to go. Tickets have been on sale for motnhs, and I'm pretty sure everyone already picked their tables. I have a few friends going who aren't my absolute best friends, but they all have different friend groups that they are obviously going to be hanging out with. 
      Here's the thing though, I really actually would love to go with this guy if he did ask. He is really funny and cool and talking to him more has made me feel like I'm breaking out of my little bubble, I guess. (FYI, I assume this would be a friend thing, not like a romantic date thing). I think this would be a good experience for me if it worked. But I have no clue how prom works. Would I hang out with him and his friends (who I don't really know) or would he expect to hang out with mine (that I don't have)? Also, people get limos and stuff, but since I don't have friends would he just drive me alone? Or again, would I hang with him and his friends? What about pictures? Also, if he was the only one I knew there, how would I get through the night with only one person to talk to? What if he wanted to dance with his friends and I sat awkardly at the table and everyone watched me?I probably sound so stupid thinking that I could say yes and go to prom with a date but no friends/table/transportation/social skills/any knowledge whatsoever.
           This brings me to the thing. So, he's making a poster, and if it's for me that's really scary. I don't like attention and my face turns red and I smile really big even if I'm not happy but just plain nervous. If people are watching this would be a million times worse. Also, I don't know how I would respond. Yes, no? I want to say yes, but I feel like he wouldn't realize what he was getting himself into. I had the idea of asking him to step aside with me so I could tell him that I would love to go but I wanted to make sure we understood what would happen. But I don't want it to feel like rejection when I don't say yes in front of everyone, especiall because I want to stay his friend no matter what. I don't want this to ruin it. Just thinking about this happening to me makes me feel nauseous, I'm so nervous. About the promposal and prom night. 
        This all makes me hope that it isn't for me, and he's asking a different girl. But then I get kind of sad because it would be exciting to go. Thanks for reading this far, sorry it was so long. Hopefull someone will give me advice on the situation. 

TL;DR: An aquantaince/kind of friend might ask me to prom,even though I originally wasn't going to go. None of my friends are going, so I wouldn't have a table to sit at and no one to hang out with besides him. But he has friends, and I'm not sure if I would hang out with them and him, but I don't really know his friends and it might be weird. I want to go though, even though I'm really nervous and confused about what to do. I'm also nervous about the promposal, because I want to talk to him and ask him about the logistics before saying yes, but if it's in front of everyone I feel like I have to say yes, especially if I want to remain his friend.

241,"A bit about me: I'm an 18 year old girl who's currently working two jobs. One is a full time - testing prototype printers, and part time I work as a pizza delivery driver. For fun, I love to go bowling and work as an audio/sound engineer. I have a spunky seven-year-old cat named Morris (Like the 9 lives cat food commercial) who I'm looking to get a play buddy for in the near future.

A bit more background: My parents are super religious freaks. (Cult level) Right after graduation last year, I moved out of that shit hole and into a friend’s house. My parents moved away and I haven't heard from them since. I've lived here paying rent for the room I'm staying in and it's been fine. But the family and friend I'm staying with have decided to move to Europe because of work. I can finally afford to get a place of my own but I was notified a bit too late about them terminating the apartment lease.

As soon as I found out, I applied for an apartment I have been interested in. I got approved and the move in date is May 13th! But the lease is up at my current residence on the April 22nd of this month. 

I have little under two weeks to find a place to stay for my cat and I. And I gotta stay somewhere for practically four weeks. Now, I don’t mind sleeping in my car if I have to. I can manage that.

Why is this problem occurring? Spring started and my delivery driving job decided to SEVERELY cut my hours. I went from 25 to 35 to literally 3 to 8 hours a week. And I’ve also been sick with the flu. So I’ve had to stay home from work without any sick pay at my other job.

Problem: My problem is the move in fees for my apartment. It’s totaled up to be about two grand. I’ve managed to knock off about 25% of the move in fee. So I got about 1400 to 1500 left to go.. I can probably manage to pay another 600 of that. So how do I honestly get the rest? I’m willing to work hard as I need to. I’ve been doing a lot of research and a lot of articles have said “Get a loan” or “Sell something!” Getting a loan is not great for me because I’m 18 with no credit! And I am not sure if I’m going to be able to pay them back in due time. And I don’t really have anything to sell…

Specifically, this colleague who I'll name as AJ; angry John, launches a verbal attack opening with ""you fat cunt, you didn't do any of the cleaning on nights. You're a lazy fucking cunt who sat on his fat arse all night."" I tried to explain that not only did I do the cleaning, but there was nearly 24 hours in between when *I* did it and when AJ did it.

But my sex drive has dropped pretty hard I guess and I don't really even want to while she wants to pretty much every night. And I tell her almost every time that I don't want to and give excuses I guess ect. And we've talked about it and she feels unnatractive and like I don't want her anymore in the physical way. But for me it's exhausting and I just don't get the horny feeling anymore. I still do sometimes but it's never at the right time, like when I get home from work or if we're both off on the same day I don't feel like having sex. I hate I've made her feel unnatractive and that I'm bored of her. She keeps telling me I'm bored and I don't even realize it and i guess she's right. She's the only girl I've ever has sex with and when we have sex it's like the same thing over and over again. We've tried to spice it up and stuff but she tells me that every time we do it its special. But when she asks for a quickie or something I don't feel it and it's just sex. I hate that I've made her feel terrible and unwanted. But I don't want to increase my sex drive or anything like that. But I just want to know how I can help her feel wanted but still not have to force myself to have sex with her because she can tell. So if someone can help I'd appreciate it. If there's something you don't fully understand just ask and I can clarify. So thanks again for anything.",11Apr2017,1
251,"Alright so I'm currently in college and I'm about to enter my last semester of college. I currently live in the city where the University resides. However when the fall semester begins I will be moving back home. The commute will be about 40 miles and is all 55 mph roads. 
The problem I run into is that my parents current internet connection is a whopping 6 Mbps download and 4 Mbps upload provided by AT&amp;T. These speeds aren't enough to do any of the homework I need and the service drops out constantly. If two phones are connected then the wifi drops them both. We have asked them if we could get higher speeds but they just tell us it's not possible at all. So I called Comcast (as much as I didn't want to) and after three months of calling them they finally gave me a quote on how much it costs to get service. They want $3000 to run a line to my house which is 0.3 miles from the closest home with service. I find this amount ridiculous. I tried to get a detailed breakdown of the cost but they just told me it's one of the ""lowest prices they had ever seen"" and wouldn't give me actual reasons for their number. 
It's hard to not save up the money and pay this company but I do not want to give in and do that. That's as much as a semester would cost me. My girlfriend says it's extortion but I don't think so because we already have internet service. Am I wrong? Is there anything I can do?",11Apr2017,2
253,"I've been seeing my girlfriend for just short of 7 months, and she knows that I smoke weed. I have chronic bone pain as well as depressive/anxious tendencies, and like to smoke weed to compensate. However, when I go to smoke she gets anxious as well, and sometimes even cries. I've been cutting back, and hard. I went from smoking every day to smoking only once every two, three weeks, and only with her permission. She's been doing better and hasn't cried or freaked out in a long time, and she's been letting me go out more. Part of what's bothering me is that the most I've smoked all year is four times in one week (and I mean four sessions, one session per day), and I'm really frustrated by the slow progress. I feel like I'm not able to make my own choice, it's starting to put a damper on my relationship with her. I had a heart to heart with her recently and made some progress, but I feel like I'm skipping out on something that could seriously help me for her sake, and ignoring my own sake. I could really use some advice.

TL;DR: My girlfriend gets anxious when I smoke weed, but I get anxious if I don't

Edit: I have medication that I'm currently on, but it hasn't been working for me and I won't be able to see a doctor for at least another month",11Apr2017,23
254,"Hey guys, I am a freshman in college working on a degree in electrical engineering. I am feeling frustrated lately mostly because I feel like i'm not doing enough for my parents. They are helping me pay for my college and even pay for my car and insurance. I wish I could do more for them but I'm still just a student. There have been more and more bills for me coming in but my parents always take care of it and I wish it wasn't like that. I want to repay them but I don't really know how. I know after college, my money will go towards trying to get them early retirement(they have earned it) but I want to help them now. Any advice? I have free time on the weekends, perhaps I could get a job on the weekends to help them out? Also, my parents aren't rich, they are just hard working and want to see their kids succeed.
