1,"We have a tug of war tournament at our lake cabin complex every year, and the results are always the same. The matches go like son's versus daughters, daughters versus mom's, dad's versus son's etc. The problem is there are way more players in daughters than than in any other category,  so the daughters always win except against dad's. So I need some advice on ways to make the tournament more fair that is still inclusive to all the players.",07Aug2017,2

7,"Long story short, my family knows I'm an atheist and told me they'd never respect me for that life choice. They're religious. So I made the decision that day forward that I don't see a reason to continue communicating with them if they won't accept me for who I am. 

Mother has been messaging me the past couple of weeks, trying to get my attention and telling me she wants things to go back to the way they used to be. This is coming from a woman who called me a whore for wanting to live my life freely. There was a lot more drama with basically my family making me hate myself, feel guilty, and threatening and yelling at me for making life choices to live a secular life that isn't hurting anyone. Like posting photos online with quotes about being nonreligious. And what if I decide to get a boyfriend? They'd never accept that. And they're always being bipolar with their acceptance of me. But I know every time they say they'll be ok this time around with my life choices they'll just turn it back again and say they don't and I'm going to hell. Every now and then I get hate messages from my siblings also. 

Sister messages me out of nowhere today calling me selfish for ignoring my mother and saying she hopes my future children abandon me the way I have family. She insulted me calling me trash, a terrible person, selfish piece of shit. That her and my family sacrificed a lot for me. I've made my boundaries clear to my family but they keep overstepping them. I told my sister I don't owe her or anyone anything and they make those choices go support me previously. Reading these messages makes me feel very stressed out and sad. 

Am I heartless person? What should I do in this situation? They want me to meet up with them
later this week but I haven't seen them in like 3 weeks after their last drama session with me. I'm really hesitant to see them as I doubt things will improve between us, I've tried before to do so and nothing has changed. ",07Aug2017,2

12,"So I am having some relationship issues, my girlfriend and I have been together about a year and a half. This is our second time dating as well.

The thing I need advice for is, early on in the relationship I established that I didn't want kids and she said she didn't either. That turned out to be a lie I guess. We aren't planning on having kids anytime soon. But I don't think my mind is going to change on not wanting kids. I have never like kids even when I was younger I preferred the company of adults. I have tried to bring up the fact that I am having anxiety about that specific part of the future and when I do she gets angry and feels like I am purposefully trying to make her mad. I am worried that we are gonna spend all of these years together, get to the point where she is ready to have kids and I won't want to and we will split up, that seems like a huge amount of time that could have been spent finding people who will fit better with our life plans. Then even if we don't split up at that point and we get married I don't want her to regret it down the line because we never had kids. 
Any advice is appreciated, thank you in advance.",07Aug2017,1
13,"So I've been studying with a guy friend and today I just looked over and he was sitting on a table (thus his elevation was higher than mine) and he was wearing shorts and his junk was just kind of there right at the leg area of his shorts. 

The thing is, I am quite conservative and my boyfriend already doesnt like this guy friend. My friend has no idea this happened and it bothers me that I saw it. There have been other instances where he has been a bit unaware and hugged me in front of my boyfriend, etc. that has bothered both my boyfriend and I. Usually my boyfriend and I tell each other things that has happened that bothers us or we think crossed a line, etc. 

Do I tell either of them this? And what do i say? I know I am sheltered and if this happened to anyone else, they might not think twice of it. Please be respectful of my upbringing and my situation. Thanks everyone in advance",07Aug2017,4
14,"I want to ask advice to see if I was being inconsiderate and needed to react differently or if I really had run into someone with an anger issue.

I'm in line at airport security this morning for a flight and normally when I'm in line for airport security I wait for the people in front of me to put all their laptops, shoes, backpacks, electronics, and etc. out before I think of placing trays onto the conveyor. I'm still half awake and waiting for two ladies to finish placing the trays in front of me when I noticed the guy behind me preemptively start to pick up trays. When the ladies finish I lay out all my stuff onto the conveyor and I do take up a lot of room because I have three trays and a backpack. From the corner of my eye I notice the guy has placed his tray onto the trashcan because there was no room on the conveyor belt due to my stuff. I didn't understand why he needed to get his stuff out so quickly and I didn't think too much about it. However all of a sudden he starts cussing and saying things like ""fucking roll up"" with a really red face under his breath. He also starts to slam his trays into mine even when my fingers are holding my trays. Starting to get intimidated but don't really know how to handle the situation as I've never dealt with someone like this before. When I walk into the metal detector I forget to take my belt off and he exasperates ""typical of him to forget his belt too"". I start to panic and hope that I can just grab my stuff and go. As I'm waiting for my stuff, the conveyor he walks by next to me and pulls my stuff out of the conveyor and shoves it down. I quickly grab and leave hoping that we would not be on the same flight.

I was really scared the entire time as I did not know how to handle the situation. Should I have tried to apologize? I really had no idea that I had done anything wrong but in this situation maybe I was being rude or if I explained myself to him I could have maybe defused it?

22,"So right now I'm in my final year of college, I have no direction in life but have been saving money from my current job and am on a good financial path. No college debt, fully paid off car, 6 months expenses saved up ( thanks r/personal finance).

But as I said before I'm getting a (psych) degree mainly because my parents are forcing me to. Being the first in the family to get a degree is a big deal for them, so I was forced to not take semester(s) break and figure out what I want to do with my life. 

I am currently a manager at a casual restaurant earning 13$ an hour. ( which is not a competitive salary, and my employer is not willing to match other companies/ give me a raise) So I am looking for another job that earns the same or more that if need be I can hang on to and advance the ranks if I cannot figure out what I would like to do. I am nearing one full year management experience and am great with customer service. 

So if you have any suggestions of general jobs or fields that are good to get with minimal experience, and have a lot of growth potential I'd love to hear them. Of course I'm atleast looking to match or beat my current salary.Thank you very much! ",07Aug2017,3
23,"I have recently had an argument with my mother. She is now fabricating the story and making me seem very bad. She is spreading the story to our relatives. I am now afraid of how they will think of me. She says that she is not going to spend a dime on me. I have not left my room for two days and I am afraid to eat. She tells me when it is dinner time but I am too scared to go out and face her.

I admit to being a lazy good-for-nothing who can only achieve good grades and such in school but do nothing at home. She has told me that I am trifling and lazy and have no reason to complain, she is right.

 But I still feel at unease in the house and always get inwardly terrified or depressed when I am around her. Neither she nor my stepdad have really abused me, she has slapped, punched, shoved, pinned me to walls, and choked me once while my stepdad has pinned me against a wall/ my bed and both have hit me with a belt or other object. They have said hurtful, demeaning things but I try my best to block them out or hide from them when possible. 

I have been thinking of suicide or running away as I am tired of being such a useless burden to them and I can't take this much longer. 

I'm not strong enough or smart enough to see another solution. If I keep living and pretending, I am letting the problem fester. My mother has already said that our relationship will never be the same again, an apology isn't going to work.

27,"**Summary:**  
Lately my mother has been missing me a lot, to the point I'm worried about her. She obviously wants me to move closer to home, although she won't say it outright. Should I consider moving back? Is there anything else I can do for her besides just trying to chat with her more often?
  
  
**Long story:**  
I'm from Montana and moved to South Korea in 2011 and stayed there for 3 years. During that time my mother seemed fine with me being away from home. In fact, she was usually worse about keeping up contact than I was. She has a lot of hobbies and also remarried around that time, so she was often busy. In 2014 I moved to California for graduate school and visited her a little more often. Then in 2016 I moved back to South Korea and got married. 

I'm not sure what changed, but she seems to suddenly miss me a lot more than before. The last few times we've seen each other, she always gets really depressed and cries a lot around when it comes time to part. I wonder if it's partly because her husband's children live in Montana and visit them all the time? Her husband's son had a child recently, and I get the feeling my mom really wants me and my wife to move to Montana and also have kids...for me, though, that would be hell.

Of course my mom is too nice and won't ask me to move for her. She just says she's happy for me, but really, really, misses me. I love my mama and feel really bad for her. My wife doesn't really want to live in South Korea forever either, so she would be happy if we moved somewhere in North America. But I'm reluctant to move, at least for now this is exactly where I want to be. Any advice is appreciated!",07Aug2017,1

29,"This is going to be an incredibly long story, so please bear with me. Over the past few years, I have had a friend (we'll call him J) who has been in love with me since elementary/middle school. I want to mention now that I have never dated him or done anything that would make him think we are more than friends. We've grown up together and he used to be a part of my karate studio, so it's hard for me to see him as anything but a brother figure. He's been telling me quite often for several years that he's in love with me or that I'm his best friend in the world, and sadly I don't feel the same. We used to be really good friends until his craving for romantic affection bothered me so much that I quit karate after many years simply because his presence made me uncomfortable. He would move in to kiss me goodbye and I would push him away, but he would do it every day for months. We still talk quite frequently, and he will check my social media and ask me rapid fire questions about who I've been hanging out with. At the beginning of June I took up a summer job and posted about it on Facebook to my friends. A couple minutes later J starts texting me, asking how long I'd be gone, if I could see him before I leave, etc. I've told him on several occasions that I don't want to hang out with him because he makes me uncomfortable, he only ever wants me to come over to his house and he continues to make romantic and sexual advances towards me no matter how much I ask him not to, but he will get pissed when I tell him I don't want to come over. When I rejected him, he passive-aggressively blew me off and told me I was playing hard-to-get. A couple hours later, I got a call from my father that apparently J had CALLED HIM on his personal phone asking if I was really leaving for a summer job or if that was just an excuse. I was beyond pissed after hearing this from my dad, and I told J how out of place he was calling my dad and asking if I was telling the truth (even if I was lying, which I wasn't, I still don't believe he would have had the right to call my dad about this, since they never speak otherwise. My dad knows how much trouble I have with this guy and told him off over the phone.) I just got back from my summer job exactly a week ago, and once again J stalked my social media and saw that I met a guy while I was there. He messages me asking about this guy, asking if we made out, if I slept with him, and other really personal things that were invasive. At this point, we are not even close enough friends that I would tell him these things even if they did happen. Somehow (probably through our slew of mutual friends), J found out that I will be taking a road trip to go on a day date with this new guy and he was livid. He keeps telling me that he will beat this guy up if he ever sees him and he tells me that I am going to get myself in trouble seeing anyone but him because he's the only one that can ""treat me right"". I have tried blocking his number and social media but he will create a new one jut to talk to me or call my phone on different numbers. Honestly I have no clue how to handle this situation anymore and need advice, he will not listen to me and go to any ends to communicate with me how much he loves me.

30,"My mother and I always had a hardened relationship. She never lets my outside the house at all, this summer was a blow because she had me in lockdown the whole summer. She took my keys away, so if I do step outside, there's no way back in. 


Either way the main reason as to why she's been treating me this way is because she knows I smoke weed, and my mother is an old school Colombian female. I also don't have a job at the moment. But isn't it a bit to early to be acting harsh on your kid. I would understand if I was 35 years old still living in the same household with my mother. 

Tonight I'm going out with friends to explore and sightsee. Most of you will call me stupid because I'm even stepping outside knowing there's way back in, but when you stay inside for a long period of time, you tend to go a little mad and have so much frustration built inside. 

If there's no way back into my house, what do I do? I just want some outside air. My mom is insane.

In 32 years I've never heard anything resembling positivity or peacefulness from either of them.

Two examples come to my mind. I want to lose weight, and I want to be a published author. I have the time, talent, and resources for both. 

I only work an 8-5 job and in fact am changing to a (hopefully) less stressful and (slightly) higher pay one in exactly a week. It's not a dream job by any stretch, but it is a welcome change. I also have access to exercise equipment, several great walking paths, and I own a large dog. I'm female, so the idea of walking alone makes me nervous, especially at night, but a dog makes it slightly better. I can cook, aka I can follow a recipe. As for writing, I have a degree in creative writing and I know I am a good writer. I know what it would take to get published and have friends who can help edit and revise.

Everything is there for me. Especially time. I have friends and something of a social life, but plenty of downtime. But...I don't do anything with it. I watch TV, play video games, and reread the same twenty or so books that I know I love.

I do have depression, diagnosed and treated. I'm actually what my therapist calls in partial remission. Which is incredible to me because my depression has ruled my life before and also because my dad died not even a year ago (I have written extensively about that on here, so I won't re-hash it).

My life isn't bad. For some it would probably be a great life. But it isn't healthy and it's not making me happy, not in a lasting way. I've tried to break my cycles before and they are always merely a couple days and then whoops, right back where I started. I can see it. I can see what is wrong and what needs fixing. But I don't do anything about it. 

It should be an easy change. A nice walk with my dog every day, a dedicated hour or two to creative endeavors several times a week. Better meal planning with healthier meals. It shouldn't be this hard, should it?

A part of me secretly wishes that they would end up being together so she would stop hurting even though it'd also hurt on my side but I've always known him to be a good guy and found it hard to believe that he'd toy with anyone's feelings, and there's this maybe in my head that likes to believe that he's unaware of the girl's feelings since he's inherently sweet, nice and friendly (although maybe doesn't know his boundaries quite well). I wish I could make him say sorry or make him realize what he's done because I dont want him to have any bad blood with anyone because the girl's friends already secretly hate him for it.

It is legal in our state to smoke Marijuana, and he makes liberal use of that law. I hear him smoking when he wakes up, before he leaves for work, and immediately when he gets home. He comes home on his 15 minutes breaks and lunch to get high. Every night, he drinks hard alcohol and smokes weed until he passes out. He has admitted to having anxiety and depression, things I actively struggle with as well, however I am on medication and have seen counselors on and off for years. 

He refuses to see a counselor or a doctor to address any mental health issues. He is in and out of the ER as his lungs are severely damaged and he frequently gets sick and cannot breathe. He gets high every day, multiple times a day, and then faces severe crashes where he locks himself in his room and refuses to see people. He readily admits that he is not happy and does not plan on living long if his band doesn't make it ""big"".

I am heart broken and torn. I feel that he is wasting his life on drugs and alcohol, just like our parents did. He doesn't see it as an issue because they are legal substances. My husband is an occasional weed user, and I have a glass of wine every now and then, and I have considered ""banning"" these substances from the house, but I know this won't stop him from using. I cry whenever I think about him and recently broke down at work because I couldn't hand the stress. I feel guilty that I cannot help him be happy and healthy. What do I do?",07Aug2017,1
53,"Growing up, starting from elementary to mid high school, I was always shunned from everyone for being different. Over the years i built up hatred and anger towards everyone at my school which started leaking to general population. School came unusually easy to me but I didnt notice myself holding people to the same standards I was being held at until after sophomore year, when my anger also started. I noticed that I had hints of jerk in me towards the end of junior year but I never considered myself a jerk until freshman year of college. Now, a couple years later, I'm not sure which of the problems came first.

62,"I currently live in a 6* bedroom house, the asterisk is there because    I live in the one bedroom of this rental house that is not a bedroom. It's a den, connected to a converted, private bedroom.

The landlord made it obvious that the two rooms were connected but not in the nature that to enter one room you would have to go through the other.

I'm a person who strongly privileges privacy, like to the point that lacking privacy drives me crazy. It's been a constant thorn in my side. To make up for this I installed a curtain blocking off my room from the doorway/hallway.

 But it doesn't make up for the fact that my roommates having people over or creeping through at night disturbs me seriously. Or for the recurring incident of my roommate leaving the door open. Etc, and my roommate in the adjacent room has proven to be the type of person not to care. 

So I wanted to ask to build a non-load bearing drywall wall into my room, which would make the first 1/4th of the room into a hallway for the private bedroom, while partitioning off my room from the open area but making it a lot smaller.

 It seems cheap and easy to build, it costs one month's rent, it would add value to the house, alleviate the awkwardness of the rooming situation and give me privacy. It's also certainly cheaper than me leaving the lease (If I left the lease the wall would pay for itself in one month.)

However, my landlord is not a level headed person (there's a high chance he would freak out from the request), and I'm only leasing this place for a year. Beyond that, the room is steal for D.C. and he has leased the room to many people before me without complaints (I'm assuming.) I debate whether it's worth it to push it, in fact the idea of even having the convo stresses me out. But, I still think it's a win for all involved.

Should I even bring it up. And if so, how should I do it?

I personally was planning to get quotes and stuff, contact the real estate agency and learn about the contract, and get all my facts and numbers in order before approaching the landlord. And then taking it over from there, there has been work done in the house before (he built a door into the wall for one converted bedroom to have more privacy.) So I can't imagine it being too much of an issue, but once again I would prefer advice.",07Aug2017,1
63,"As we all know, it is Summer right now. I'm 18 and I currently work in a cafe as a seasonal job. I've been working for 3 months since the semester has ended. I actually planned on quitting within 2 more weeks because college is going to start again in 3 weeks. The main reason why I'm working is because it's the fucking Summer and I rather be keeping myself busy in the outside world instead of staying at home all day, listening to my parents and do completely nothing.


My parents expects me to find a job in an office because according to them, an office job is ""respectable and they make a lot of money."" They also expect me to find some internship already... I just finished my first year of college and I'm currently in an undeclared major and they're fully aware that I'm undeclared. I'm still taking a bunch of required courses and then I'll finally declare a major. So far I've actually considered to major in either Business Administration or Teacher Education. I totally can understand why they view ""office"" jobs something respectable, but it's obviously not easy to find an office job so easily... So I took the easy way out and worked in a cafe that my friend offered. The pay is actually really good for a temporary job. But I honestly don't care about the pay much. Again, I'm only working so I can do something in the summer and have some experience. I honestly can see myself building up better commutation skills from working these past 3 months.


But here's the problem, I've been lying to them and told them that I'm working in an office and doing some paperwork. Before I've even started to work, I told them that I got accepted to work in a cafe. But obviously, they didn't approve that and believed that ""it's a trash job"" and threw a lot of negative crap on me... But that didn't prevent me from declining the job offer . So I ended up lying to them and said that ""I've interviewed at an office and got accepted as a receptionist"". (I've actually applied to many different places as a receptionist but none have actually accepted me"".) Anyways, they actually approved the fact that ""I'm working as an receptionist"" when I'm really not. So again, for these past 3 months, they've been believing that I'm working in an office but in reality, I've been actually working in a cafe.


I've been lying to them because I didn't want to deal with their negative shit everyday and let them yell at me every single damn day about my current real job because I know they will. I know my parents too damn well.
Today, my mom went through my bag, and found my check and saw the address of my job and looked it up and found out that I was working in a cafe all along. Then for the past 4 hours, my mom and dad kept saying that ""I'm no longer interested in school and I'm gonna drop out just because I'm working in a fucking cafe"". I've told them so many times that ""I""M ONLY WORKING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS"". And then my dad brought up crazy assumptions saying things like ""I'm probably working as a prostitute or a stripper or some dirty job"". (I don't even know why he even thinks like that). Plus I only work in the day and get at home around 4PM. They get crazy mad when I get back at home at 8PM. The sun doesn't even set at 8PM. Plus, I hardly go out with my friends because of how crazy strict they are. And the most I'll go out with my friends is at least 2-3 times a month which isn't even a lot and I always get back at home around 7 whenever I hang out.


My dad goes crazy when I hang out with friends. I don't hang out with people who do drugs and shit and he thinks that all my friends are terrible people and I'm gonna end up being a druggie. Honestly, I feel like my parents just want me to be someone antisocial with no outside life.


It just doesn't make any sense to me that they want me to be able to find some ""respectable office job"" immediately when I barely have any fucking experience.... So am I actually wrong for lying to them the entire time??",07Aug2017,2
64,"Hello!

So, my mom announced earlier this weekend that she and my dad were about to embark on a month-long ""detox"" diet. Nothing too weird coming from them. But then she detailed the specifics, and apparently one is only able to eat fruits and some vegetables for a month; no other sources of proteins or fats, and many heartier vegetables such as root vegetables are off the list.

If this were a week-long ""cleanse"" (which, as people who never drink and who eat salads every day, they should not have to do), I would shrug. If there were more food groups involved, I wouldn't worry. 

But they're both in their late 60's, and my dad just started medications for his (unfortunately hereditary) high blood pressure. I feel they're too old for such ridiculous diets.

My mom is sick of my skepticism, and I can see how, as someone who has taken the courses for pre-med, my opinion could be filed under ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" 

But I'm worried about them. Is this validated? Does anyone has older friends/family/themselves who have done such drastic eating habits?

65,"I've had this sitting in my head for years now but finally I just need some direction. 

Does anyone have experience with not having any tolerance for learning? I mean, I've always hated it, even for subjects of interest. I feel like when I sit down to learn, I hit a wall that prevents me from progressing. In that moment, I feel a great deal of frustration and end up thinking about how far I am from where I want to be. I get so angry that I could punch a cat or something. 

I'm not sure where my impatience with learning stems from, but it's greatly hindering my progress. I'm bored with what I already know, and I want to improve! I just get too angry with my own failure that I end up giving up. 

I need actual advice for dealing with this practically. Right now I'm focusing on art and anatomical study (figure drawing). It's very frustrating stuff. I'm not needing advice telling me to find something that I love to learn, because that's not going to happen. I hate learning anything because of the failure involved.

67,"I'm a 17 year old male. I smoke wax all day everyday. I have been smoking weed everyday for almost a year, wax for only a few months. I started smoking to help my mild insomnia and because I enjoyed getting high. As time went on I realized I generally felt happier and more motivated when stoned. I started going everywhere stoned. I eventually had almost trained myself to be somewhat normal acting when stoned. 

Now I have been working at this banquet center for 2 years now. I had grown great respect from leaders of the staff. I was the best employee of my position, and obviously one of the hardest workers there. But the managers (different from the leaders I mentioned earlier) are a bunch of ignorant fucks. They treat everyone like human garbage, but it's all equal and fair right? So it's ok in there fucked up minds. They have an obvious no phone policy, but one manager is a bit to strict about all the rules.  I was caught checking the time on my phone (You know how you barely pulled it out of your pocket then slip it back in) by this manager. So since it was my second time getting caught I was suspended for a week; to clarify, I was not out on the floor, but in the kitchen while nothing was going on.

69,"So my grandma loathes her children and grandchildren, including my family and my aunt's family. My grandmother lives alone with her second husband and none of us want to live with her because she often get angry at us for no apparent reason. The weird thing is, the children she hates the most are the only two that give her monthly money (my aunt, my dad, and me because I have relatively more stable job that the rest of her grandchildren) and yet, her favorites are the one that treat her like crap, never visit her or even care if she has food in her kitchen. 

Anyway, my dad and my aunt want to reconnect with her so last month, we flew her to the city where we live, and she stayed with us. Obviously she won't stop nagging and kept whining about being sick and all (she isn't), and hated it when my mom mentioned that my dad, her oldest son, is very very sick and yet didn't talk about it. She then picked a fight with my niece, whom live with us, because my dad bought her a very expensive wristwatch (it was literally the only watch my niece has, while my dad already bought countless of watches, golds, jewelry, clothes, etc etc, for my grandmother over the years). Then she picked a fight with my mom, by start calling everyone and yell about how my mom never take care of her while she was staying with us (my grandmother used to mock my mother for not having job like her other in-laws and once my mother got one, she was furious) and then later refused to drink milk my mother bought for her because the box was different, even when my mother explained that the content was all the same, it was just a new package, then complained about how she felt unwell because she didn't have her milk by laying on kitchen floor. I didn't particularly like my grandmother, so i often avoided her because everytime she saw my face, she went hours of bragging her other grandchildrens and refused to acknowledge anything i ever did to her. Like, i drove her anywhere she wanted to go, i went out at like, 5 a.m. looking for breakfast she wanted, and then she brag about the grandchild whom never visited her in years. I mean, i didn't need her approval to do nice things, but it was still annoying. 

then, knowing that me, mom, and my niece weren't really affected by her attempt to create feud, she picked a fight with my dad. she called my cousins, threatening them to visit her now while they're in the city. They did visit, but it was when my dad wasn't home (he went to find medicine) and my grandmother was SO MAD that my dad wasn't home to serve his nieces, regardless that my dad had a perfectly good reason, and also:

a) they never visited our home for years since my dad helped them got into medical school
b) my dad did not even know they were coming
c) my grandmother forced them to visit her, at our home, which they never visited for years

anyway, my grandmother called my aunt, she packed her stuffs and move from our home, and yelled crazy mean stuffs, including how money we send to her meant garbage.

so, now me and dad are having dilemma whether if we continue sending her money or not. on one side, we're deeply hurt by her actions and words (that we've endured pretty much all our lives), but on other side as children, it's our duty to take care of her (we're not really religious, but we try to follow the path as close as we can). what should we do?",07Aug2017,4

I say this loosely as I'm being given a few months and the feelings mutual as we both annoy each other and while we are civil and friendly its a fragile friendship atm.
I have a doggo that while shes a good dog and housebroken, gets walks,and regular bathroom breaks, she'll randomly have a accident. Recently she had an accident in the basement and roomate told me about it,as I wasnt home at the time, to clean it up. No big deal at all just have to use this carpet extracter that we had borrowed from his parents. 
( this one to be exact. http://cache.air-n-water.com/images/royal-mry7910-l.jpg )

Well it turned out that there was alot of fur in the carpet that I didnt catch and it got all in the extracter nozzle and kind of clogged it up. This has happened before and since its one of those that you can't take apart (I tried) its best to let it dry then to kind of take a thin pipe cleaner to pull the hair out. This is a pain in the butt and takes time so I set it off for my next day off.

Fast forward to my roomates day off (which is diffrent from mine) he discovers the carpet cleaner and, thinking he's handy, tried to take it apart to clean it. In short he basically snapped the thing and tried to glue it back together and I can tell its not going to work by not being able to seal up properly to create suction to pull the water out of the carpet.

In an effort to kinda rectify the situation for the future blame session that will happen I tried to find a replacement part but I find that its been completely discontinued. I have a feeling roomate will try to push me to buy a new carpet cleaner since its my dogs fur and I used it last and I have been avoiding him since.

I would like advice before confronting him/I am confronted because I'm a really passive person who if told 'this is your fault' Ill crumble but I honestly can't afford a brand new carpet cleaner because I'm trying to move out to begin with.

So my question is am I responsible for replacing the entire thing or is my roomate? I feel like if it came to that it should be split between us but my roomate might try to make me buy it myself.

My school is in the low 20’s in terms of rankings. My GPA is below a 3.0 which, even if I found nice coworkers, dashes any hopes for me being hired anywhere that pays well. Yesterday was my 18th interview (almost 70 applications submitted) and I still could not get hired for a legal job. I was enthusiastic in interviews, and showed interest, but I suppose I’m not cut out for it.  OCI is not an option. I am cutting my losses.

*THINKS SHE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT
But there might be a bright side: the only thing that has made me happy this past year has been learning about engineering. I’ve been coding every day, and even joined an organization where I’ve been studying electronics and practicing my soldering skills. 

For so many years of my life, I was just trying to “get the grade” so I could get out. Everything revolved around having been abused: I went from being an abused kid to wanting a career helping abused kids. I’m beginning to wonder if growing up, if I ever had a moment to introspect, if I would have focused on something other than law and public service. Maybe now is the time to see?

*PROPOSED PLAN
My mom wants me to stay in law school because she thinks it will guarantee me a good job. The statistics on new law grads are bleak, in my opinion, I don’t think I’ll make as much money as she think I will, and even if I do, I don’t think the work will make me happy. The other person I’ve asked is my boyfriend, who encourages me to explore. He is an engineer with a PhD, so it’s not like he doesn’t value education, but I worry about disappointing him if I fail at the plan below.

So here’s my crazy idea:
What if I took a year off from school to really dive into the electronics self-study and explore my passions? With a full-blown curriculum? Then, at the end of the year, I would try to get hired somewhere. If I can’t get hired, I’ll return back to law school. 

TL; DR
I didn't explore anything before going to law school, am now depressed, and want you to tell me if I should drop out to self-study electronics. ",07Aug2017,3
88,"My dad got a house. He said I can live in it rent free I just have to pay utilities. Well he's home for 3 days every 3 months so it's basically my own house. 

I like that. I love peace and quiet. I love being by myself.  I'm a recluse so I don't really like being around people. 

Well if I got a roommate, pretty much all of that is gone. 

 

Pros of having a roommate: I can charge them rent and split the utilities bill. 

If I ever got broken into I wouldn't be as vulnerable since there's two of us.  

Maybe they'll clean the pool one week and I'll clean it the next week etc.  

 


Cons: 

No more quiet and aloneness. I don't feel like it's right to say ""you can't have company over"" if it's their house too. Sounds insane. 
But then what if they're having company over 4 times a week. The whole point of moving out is so I can have a quiet stress free place to unwind after work and focus on my uni classes. 

What if they're slobby or something? I spend 8 hours a day chasing people around a retail store because they can't pick up after themselves I don't want to do that at home too.  

I've had people I've known for 10+ years steal from me.  If I can't trust them how can I trust that some stranger won't steal my stuff? Right now in my room I have 250 dollars in cash thrown all over my desk because I'm too lazy to go to the bank and deposit it.  

I can't walk around naked. 

If it's just me, there's only a small chance that I will break something.  If there's me and someone else, there's even more of a chance of something being broken.

94,"Title says it all - When I was young I had everything going for me - no self esteem issues - no confidence issues - nothing like that - I was mentally sound. 
Everything was going great up until I had a girlfriend for 4 years as a teenager - then suddenly I got conflicted with everything in my life and I havent been the same since - 

I don't know how it began exactly but its like somewhere along the line a seed of doubt crept in and manifested to the point I'm at rock bottom, no life, nothing like myself and feeling absolutely broken. 

I can honestly say I hate my life, I hate the person Ive become and I have no way of knowing how to get out of this.

Its like I let my life slowly slip inch by inch until I have ended up with. 

I was never insecure but somewhere along the line I became that way. 

I can't stop looking inwards. I can't get back on it with life, Im directionless and completely out of touch with myself. 

The only way I can describe it is Ive stopped having that strong sturdy masculine feeling I used to have so much of - 

I hate feeling this way I absolutely hate it - I want to feel powerful in myself again but don't know how - It kills me being in this position with myself and my life as i used to be the most confident guy I know. 

I went through one thing after another in the lead up to this - Multiple deaths in family - a toxic 4 year relationship - health scares with parents and friends moving away - and stuck in soul sucking jobs and what now is unemployment - 

Its like my life has been a 10 year downward spiral I can't get out of for the life of me. Life has kicked me down and I can't find my way back up and it all started with giving far too much of myself in a relationship.

Im honestly ashamed I let my life get like this - I feel broken and out of the game completely. My friends wonder where I've been but I don't want to see them because it hurts my ego being like this - I'm sure any guy with an ego like me hates being seen when your not at your best  and can understand - 

I just don't know my way out of it - I don't want to kill myself and I won't, I just want to get back on top of life.

She was very nice and talked out ears off about her life as a doctor, her obsession with Louis Vuitton, and how she's very successful, and how her mom died of cancer and that she would go to goodwill to remember when her mom used to take her there and now she goes looking for clean pillows for shelters. Anyways, she also told me she wished she had kids of her own to give away her purses to, she offered to sell me one of her many old purses since she said that she never had anyone that would appreciate a Louis Vuitton purse (mind you these purses are $1,000+). I told her that I can't afford a purse that expensive and she said she'd sell it to me cheap because I was nice and listened to her stories, I told her I only have 200$ in cash and she was fine with that because she said the money would just be donated. We are supposed to meet up tomorrow and my friends are telling me this is too good to be true. She said she was a rescue doctor or something during 9/11 and she's now currently an on call doctor in Scottsdale Arizona. I don't remember her first name but her last name is Starr. Is there anyway to find out if she is a legit doctor? I feel like she isn't, because I googled her and didn't get any results, and now my gut is telling me to not get the purse because she might of lied to me about being a doctor. I have never asked advice on Reddit before and I'm sorry if my story is all over the place. What I'm trying to get advice on is if I should get the purse because it's cheap and this lady seems nice or don't because she might be lying about herself to gain my trust.

98,"Hello guys, my name is Ivan and I am 14 years of age.

I do not know where to begin, so I will start off with my job. I used to run a youtube channel for video game clips, which kicked off pretty well. I would make very good money at the same time with almost limitless effort as users would submit their own clips. Around 4-5 months after this, my youtube channel had been shut down and started to turn to stage 1 of my depression. A bit after that, I decided to start fresh with a new channel posting the same type of content. It kicked off, but not as well as the first time. Months into that my channel started dying and my money had been drained away. After roughly 2 years of work, I am back to where I started. Almost no money and the unwillingness to restart in any aspect of my life, be it sports, entrepreneurship, or youtube. I need to kick myself off somehow and with summer coming to an end I'm sick worried of my next year in school taking up most of my free time. Sorry for some broken english as this is a bit of a rushed post, but I will be willing to seek advice from anybody!

99,"Hi everyone.

Throwaway. I've also crossposted this to r/schizophrenia.

My family (husband, wife, one-year-old daughter) lives in a large European city, in an old building that has a tight-knit network of neighbors. Our maintenance man has been with us for about ten years. He comes by once a week to clean the stairwell and does some odd jobs in between, so we see him a lot. He has paranoid schizophrenia and is also a highly functioning alcoholic. A lot of the residents give him space because they find interacting with him to be uncomfortable. He does easily slip into rants that can seem manic, but that's not really difficult to deal with. He's a smart and nice guy, and we enjoy chatting with him about his dogs or mundane stuff like the weather. We're on good terms. He has this job and other similar gigs in houses nearby because he can't hold conventional employment, so we want it to work out for him.

Last year, he got into trouble with the landlord for using up his budget for cleaning supplies too quickly. He rang our doorbell and explained the situation to me, hoping that I would defend him and explain to the landlords that his usage of cleaning supplies was normal. I was alone at home and super pregnant, just days away from giving birth. I didn't know how to help because I wasn't familiar with the situation. He was really worked up about this, and the longer the conversation continued, the more insistent he became. Eventually, he forced his way into our apartment, because he was worried the landlord would overhear (they live one floor below us). He tried to push the door closed. He was only a few inches from my face and kept getting closer and louder, he wouldn't stop talking and I was having a lot of difficulty convincing him to leave. The situation was pretty frightening for me. Eventually, I forcefully told him to get out of the apartment, that his behavior was not OK and that we could talk about the cleaning supplies later. He seemed to ""wake up"" and left without protest.

A few days later, he apologized both to my husband and to me, separately. Looking back, he knew what the situation must have been like for me and he felt terrible about it. He explained that he sometimes loses control but afterwards, he knows when he went too far and it's important to him to make amends. This was a huge relief. We didn't tell the landlord or notify the police. We never spoke about the situation again and continued with our friendly chats whenever we crossed paths.

Fast forward to one year later. We just discovered that, when he is done cleaning the stairwell, he spits into our daughter's stroller before leaving. He always spits in the same place, exactly in the middle of the spot where she sits, and it's a lot of saliva. So much that he might be spitting multiple times. We can prove that he's done it the last three weeks in a row, but are assuming that it's been going on for much longer, because of corresponding stains that have shown up in the stroller for the last few months. I have no idea what this means, what might have prompted it, or how to react. We haven't confronted him yet - but this time, we did tell the landlord.

Do I need to be worried about my daughter's safety? I can handle anything else with compromise and empathy, but when it comes to her, I have zero tolerance.

Thanks for reading this far. And thanks for taking the time to help.",07Aug2017,1
101,"This might be long so I appreciate anyone who will read this and give me their take. A little backstory: my best friend and I were roommates for 2 years and just left college to move back home (we live in separate towns around 2 hours apart). We will graduate together this coming December since she is student teaching in her hometown and I am finishing up my minor with online classes for the fall semester. 

So this summer she brought to my attention that my favorite band was playing in her hometown on my birthday (my birthday is now this coming week). After checking out details I ask her if she would want to go with me. She points out that she wouldn't have brought it up otherwise. BUT she had a meeting for her student teaching the next day in the afternoon. I asked her if that would be a problem. She said no, it was fine.  I buy both of the tickets as well.

So we come home and a week passes and I get a text (first contact since we have been home mind you) telling me that she met with her teacher and that she had been invited to dinner that night before (my birthday) with the rest of the team. She told me that this was ""too big of an opportunity to pass up""...you will see these people the next day and for the next 3 months? Its not an official obligation? Also its your best friend's birthday who you made a commitment to?...

I have several problems with this but I just don't know how to respond. A little more backstory: during the summer she confessed to me that she felt shitty for how she treated me during the end of the semester. That she was trying to distance herself from me by basically hooking up with her old best friend from back home. She asked this old friend to go with her to a different concert that I would have also very much liked to go to. She knew it was kind of fucked up since she specifically didn't tell me about it for the longest time then gave me the childish response of ""well you didn't ask me so..."" But anyway I have a shitty memory so at the time I told her I was stressed out of my mind with projects (which was true) and that I didn't notice. Later I remembered how she specifically was acting like she was already done with me and how I would rant to my mom about it. 

After sending the letdown message she starts going on about whats going on with her and asking me how I am doing which is such a blatant distraction technique. So now another week has passed because at first I was just super angry and didn't want to respond and then I just didn't know how to respond.

I am struggling between being angry or just letting it go or somewhere in between. I know if I did this to her on her birthday she would be pissed beyond words. She has put me in a real shitty situation because I want to be mad with her and explain my feelings but I am worried that I will damage our friendship. We were still planning on graduating together girl?? You can't completely cut ties with me yet? My mom has been telling me this is something you very well could end a friendship over.

A good deal of me is saying just play it safe, graduate together and move on, but another part of me wants to be the ""difficult friend"" for once and let her know the truth. I have already basically given her the silent treatment (not necessarily on purpose, more out of idk what to do) for a week. She sent another text talking about getting settled and asking me how I am doing a few days ago. If anyone could give me their opinion I would really appreciate it. ",07Aug2017,1

How's it going everybody?


Me and sister are of the same age, and things are not healthy between us at the moment. I'm kind of ignoring her due to some reason from the past two years, but she is really trying hard to keep our relationship alive. She's not going to leave me alone even after all this. This shows the kind of good sister she is. 

I started ignoring her because she was hanging out with losers who have no morals. I, as a responsible brother confronted her to stop hanging out with losers, but she didn't take my words seriously. I thought what to lose, and i started ignoring her. 

It's been almost two years that we haven't talked/met. Today, she came down to my place and confronted me for the reason i stopped looking out for her. She cried and yada yada yada. I felt really sad for her. She's just asking me the reason. If i won't tell her the reason, she would just go away permanently out of my life. I can live with it, but don't know if she and my parents can. I asked her for a day's time to explain her everything, but i really don't want her to feel sad for that reason again. I really want to make things right between us. 


What do you think i should do?

Should i tell her the reason and make things right between us?

105,"I have been living in a big city, away from my small hometown, for about three years now. I would have probably left the city sooner due to failing to start a career, or really finding friends, but about 2 years ago I met a nice girl and stayed because of her, mainly. Over time, I lost touch with the remainder of my friends in the city, and recently the relationship started to feel stressful too. I ended things, but I am not sure if this was because I was feeling a failure and lonely in the city or if the relationship itself was bad, or both. My girlfriend would get very scared and angry whenever I suggested I might want to split time between the city and other places, such as my small hometown or other countries, so in the end it seemed like something had to give, though there were other problems to do with her mood swings, and maybe me not being ready for the next step. I ended my office job and made goodbyes to the people I did know. The last month in the city alone was very hard to get through. I was thankful to have made it through, but then I returned home a few weeks ago and it seems clear early on there is nothing here for me. My friends from childhood are perfectly polite but people have their own lives now and I am not sure what I expected. I have seen a few people and tried making a few plans but it doesn't seem like nearly enough. Yesterday, some old friends walked passed me and they only gave me a smile and a nod, which left me feeling very numb, as I have not been back in six months and I guess I thought I would get a different reaction to that. I left what I did have because I was feeling discontented, and now I have even less. I am staying at my mother's house and she is being very kind and supportive, but I didn't live with her a lot of my childhood and we are not that close emotionally. My plan was to take a working holiday next, and split my time between trying that and home, but to see home like this has really taken the wind out of my sails. I will still try travelling, but instead of a fun, healthy thing it now seems like a desperate, last-ditch effort to find a place in the world, and also a way of running from the shameful, friendless existence that I have fallen into. I have enough money to maybe get a plane ticket somewhere and survive a few weeks, during which time I would need to find a way of making money, quickly. I dismantled my life because I wanted to try being someone better, but now that I have dismantled it I am left feeling quite hopeless. I don't think I would commit suicide due to the hurt it would bring other people, but it is suddenly seeming very neat and comfortable to me in a way that it hasn't before.

108,"Finding myself

One of the toughest decisions you can make in life is whether or not a risk is worth taking. Packing up and moving away from your hometown can prove to be one of the biggest decisions you’ll ever have in your life. Moving away from what is familiar, to what is comfortable, and to what you have always known is a scary thought. In fact, it’s terrifying. You can’t help but question what will come of your life if you do take the risk. Will you lose friendships or relationships? Will you be completely and utterly alone and regretting it later? Or will it be the absolute best decision you’ve ever made?  The unfortunate thing about risks is that you never actually know what can come of it until you take the leap. But let me tell you something. Once you decide to take the leap, what follows will leave you breathless.

You find a part of yourself you never knew existed.
There is a quote that says, “You don’t know how strong you are until being strong is the only option you have.” 

I experienced a homesickness I never thought possible. When going home for the weekend no longer was an option, I ventured out to other ones. 

The timid and shy girl I thought was me, wasn’t anymore. This new person, she was strong, she was tough, and she was inspiring.
You meet genuine people.

When you leave home, you have this irrational fear that the people there will move on and forget about you, and I’m not saying that isn’t true. But if they are moving on, then there is a reason they are. Nonetheless as you find out who you are and what you want. You realize people you've known forever don't see things your way, so you hold on to the wonderful memories but you move on without them in your life. Once you're away from everyone and have been through life without dependency you realize YOU are the only person that can save yourself. YOU get to make the decisions, YOU are the one in charge, so be the BOSS of your own life. And live!! Live it to the fullest!!! ",07Aug2017,2

110,"I am 22/f working at an international firm. The job is terrible, very recently someone from a different department was rude and aggressive while talking to me and I am deeply unhappy.

I am considering resigning by the end of this month and I need help supporting my resignation with a convincing reason. Let me explain why this is important. I was an intern at this firm for 6 months and was told that based on my performance during the internship I'd be offered a full time position. Around May, I asked the HR if I would be getting the full time position since: a) I moved to this city for this job and I need to renew my lease soon otherwise I wouldn't have a place to stay b) I would definitely like to look for another job if they weren't going to give me one since I wasn't going to be unemployed.

The HR rep at that time didn't make any promises but she said that there's a ""big chance"" I'll be given a permanent position. So I decided that I should send out my grad school application (in case I don't get the job) and look for an apartment with a three month lease so that I can move home if the need arises. Shortly after I applied, found a new apartment and started a job hunt I hear from the company and they tell me I have the permanent position. I thought things are finally working out but they got worse.

Ever since I started as a permanent employee the work pressure has been intense. I'm at the bottom of the food chain but I'm doing 2x more work than people higher up. This is odd for the field I work in. I'm handling three major projects and sometimes I work 11 hours a day. Because I was an intern previously, I have a lot more experience than the people who are straight out of college and starting work as full time employees. 

Within two weeks, I was extremely stressed and very unhappy. I didn't enjoy the work anymore. Adding to this, my parents found out I had applied for grad school and they think I should pursue a master's. So they keep advising me to move in that direction. 

So now I am in a dilemma because I haven't heard from the university yet (I hear from them in the first week of September) but if I wait that long to hand in my resignation, it won't leave me enough time to finish all the formalities needed to move to a different country and attend uni (I'm an international student). So I decided to take a gamble and quit in August, serve my one month's notice till September and then move home early October (if I get accepted into uni)/ start a new job.

It's a big risk, I know but I feel like it's a risk I need to take. I don't see a future in this company, I already low key resent the people I'm working with and I just don't feel like I'll have much growth here.

My employment offer says that I can hand in a resignation any time without any reason but I know the HR rep is going to ask me for one because : a) I had initially shown interest towards the job b) quitting after a month is really odd. How it works is, after I resign, the partner approves it and from the date of approval I serve my notice. Between me sending in my resignation and the partner approving it, it's the HR who handles everything so I am just afraid that if she feels that I blindsided them (which I think she will), she might take weeks to forward it for approval. And it'll be a bitter situation I don't want to be a part of. She's had words with two other people who quit because they wanted to pursue higher education right after accepting their jobs so I know that doesn't sit well with her.

So what reason can I give for quitting suddenly? I feel that it has to be something out of my control, something neither she or I can fix that will ensure everything is done in time and I leave by 1st October (my lease finishes end September and if I renew it I'll be here another 3 months). 

The alternative to not serving my notice is paying a month's salary to the company - money I do not have atm. I'm really confused and I dunno what to do.

112,"My english is rusty, excuse the grammar.

So, yesterday i ended a 10 year long friendship. For months its bothered me and literally spammed this subreddit with it so i dont want to write a history class.

Emotionally i feel i invested way more int that relationship then he he used me mostly to empty emotional stuffs. It became very toxic for me. His thing was for years now that with no reason he generated drama and acted out. When i said, did, or did not or did not said something he always found a drama oportunity. If he acted out he didnt spoke with me until i beged for sorry. Literally ""give me explonation what you did"" ""i dont speak with you until you dont say sorry"". Months now this drama became a monthly issue. He always wants me to deal with his life and he want me to be ready and listen his petty problems. If i dont write back immediatelly  he whines.

Last night was the final for me. He wrote how it went with his flat rent meeting. I wrote an ok but my hands was dirty and i wanted to ask more. But i was a fool because i went to the bathroom to wash my hand for 10 SECONDS and this was enough for a drama why i wrote an ok not a lenghti essay.

I wrote a lenghti message how i feel and i dont want to bother myself with this toxic and selfish friendship.

Im literally alone now. He managed to get friends but i didnt focused on this so i have none. Im pretty scared not because im alone but this situation is new. I thought about i rest for a month and dont force myself to find friends. I dont know but i have enough of drama queens.

115,"TLDR: Mom's saying that they're just friends, but I find it really difficult to fathum that this is the case given the information she's told me, and don't understand why she'd lie about something so trivial. 

30 years ago, parents broke up because Mom (now, almost 60) had an affair with Red. They dated for about a year or so.

Approx 5 - 10 years later she dated Rud. Rud was married with 2 kids of his own at the time (similar ages to me and my siblings). They broke up after about a year (ish).

Fast forward 20 years and she's recently gotten in contact with both Red and Rud.

Red contacted her first. It was *true love* all over again.

Then Rud contacted her. It was *fate, intervening*.

Then Red had a mood swing where he didn't want to deal with Mom seeing the two of them. So she called it off with both. 

Then Red is back on the scene, but *just friends*.

Then Rud is back on the scene, they're dating, its *meant to be*.

She see's Red more than she sees Rud as Rud's job has him travelling around the country.

Perhaps I'm being old fashioned and prudish, I'm finding it really difficult to fathom why she'd lie and why she's ""seeing"" Rud, but spends more time with Red. I also find it really inappropriate that she's spending so much time with Red, knowing that he has feelings for her. She's also not told Rud that she's spent so much time with Red. I'd be furious.

I understand that it isn't my business who she does what with who, but she talks to me about it and I'm trying to process it all. Am I just being prudish? Does it sound off to anyone else? ",07Aug2017,1

118,"Hey guys. I know the market is good right now, but I'm trying to think long term. I've been investing the last last 3 months or so. Had a good burn in late June, learned my lesson on buying into hype, started doing mad research and I've been pretty successful since.

So I have the opportunity to pay off my loans in amazing time (we're talking about 2K a month for 5 months). Alternatively, I could invest that in crypto and suffer loans another year or so.

My wife and I both work. We have enough in the bank that we could live for 6 months or more on her job alone. We're financially secure.

Conventional wisdom says pay the loans and gain financial security. But, part of me thinks this is an opportunity for the bold in the long term. (2-10 years). Getting principle in now could potentially be another 2x down the road. I'm concerned about the risk of losing 5 months of investment time in a market that's moving upward at an exponential pace.

I just don't have anywhere or anyone else to vent out to, maybe at least one person will read this and share their own experiences, I don't know. The last few months of my life have been nothing but terrible, I can't seem to find any meaning in anything I do or don't do. 

It's gotten to a point that I'm now stuck in a terrible job that I absolutely despise, solely for the reason of getting by, I also can't find any motivation to finish my last year of university. 

Being alone is mostly alright, but even now, instead of talking to a friend, I'm looking for advice here. All my friends and acquaintances seem to have involuntarily distanced themselves away from me, and I have no will to try and find someone new. Even when I do find it, I end up being too open, trustful and naive with people, which always ends up hurting me in the end, but I just can't fake it.

I don't know where I went wrong. I've tried many things in life, though I can't seem to find any particular hobbies that I love to invest my time in, I'm just swimming by, like I'm being swept by a riverstream. I have no goals, no clear future plans. I used to be okay with it, but lately it's been hitting me hard.

I've never been decisive. Everything I've ever done gets boring really quick, and I just don't know how to deal with it. I don't have any suicidal thoughts, never did have, but I can't merely exist anymore. I want to better myself, I want to feel good with myself, I just don't know how.

127,"Hey everyone, before I get started I'd like to paint a picture regarding the culture of the company that I work for. So we're a really small company that quite honestly underpays its employees...not by much but still can be seen as being underpaid compared to similar jobs in the area. However, most employees don't really mind because we get two bonuses a year. A small summer bonus and a rather large Christmas bonus. These bonuses are seen by us, the employees, as a way to compensate for the pay discrepancy although officially they are just bonuses. These are not small bonuses but rather large. I know of a coworker who got a $15,000 USD Christmas bonus. The largest bonus I personally got for Christmas was $5,000 USD and the largest summer bonus I got was $1,500 USD. Ok, now that I've painted a picture I can move on to the topic at hand... so over the last couple of years we were seeing smaller bonuses, we thought nothing of it because being in Texas with the oil and gas industry free falling as it is, well...let's just say no company in Texas was immune. But now we are on the rebound and we were expecting our usual bonuses. Earlier in the year, the president of the company announced that he had purchased a house in XYZ location and told us we could go and spend a weekend with our families. Reservations must be made in advance and it's on a first come first serve basis. We all thought, oh what a cool guy. Things must definitely be on the rebound for the company. Well, needless to say, we didn't get our usual summer bonus and kind of left the entire man power of the company in suspense and fluttering around trying to see what's up. Word reached me from a higher up in the company that there was a meeting in which the (lack of) bonuses was addressed and the president responded with ""Well, when I bought the house in XYZ, my intention was to have that serve as a bonus incentive for you guys""

So is this a douchebag move or nah? On one hand, people have come to sort of rely on these bonuses. Apparently our bonus is the president purchasing a house for himself and allowing his employees to borrow it. To top it all off, we have to pay $150 as a ""cleaning fee"" and we must pay for our own transportation to and from (it's a couple of hours away) There's now a joke going around regarding our christmas bonuses that he's going to buy himself a house in Europe (funny but sad) On the other hand....technically speaking, he has no obligation to give us any bonuses at all. I'm under the idea that if you're going to offer a bonus, then it should be done right and not buy yourself a house and call that our bonus.

130,"Hey there. So I'm a soon to be junior in college home for the summer. I've been working since I got home (the 15th of May) and generally alsays like to have a little job on the side for money and to keep busy. I've worked every semester of school.

This summer I got a job at a country club and golf house as a server/waitress. I was very excited about the job because it seemed like a cool enviroment, has good pay, and I THOUGHT I'd be making bank in tips. The place turns out does not allow employees to take tips. Strike number one.

Over the summer I worked morning and night shifts, weddings, parties, golf outings etc with other employees but really it wasn't bad. I liked the rush of serving tables even if it was confusing. One of the main reasons I took this job was to be around others because I am a people person. 

So three weeks ago, I see my name on the master schedule as to be scheduled in the ladies locker room. Okay, I thought, just another place to work. I found out that shift entails cleaning womens golf shoes, mopping all the bathrooms, vaccuming, dusting, cleaning furtniture, laundry, and cleaning every bathroom in the place 6 times a shift. At first, I didn't mind because cleaning to me was easy. I never grumbled nor spoke up.

I've been doing these kind of shifts for 3 weeks straight and I've been losing it. I'm in a room, if I'm not cleaning, the size of a closet and I am not allowed to leave. Even if I clean the whole place, a) my boss finds dust on the top of the toliet seat on a railing or a ledge and I HAVE to dust all over again or b) I'm sitting alone by myself for so long. I'm im at 7:30am every day and I'm allowed to leave by 4:30 or 5. I was scheduled to do this shift 12 more days in two weeks ahead but I'm quitting. I'm done being isolated and treated this way. I'm sure they will find somebody else to do it.

I feel a bit stupid and selfish. On the one hand, it wasn't hard, it pays well, and I always feel guilty about quitting. It wasn't a horrendous job (except when people clogged toliets) but my mom said I looked ""dead inside"" when I came back from work. I had nothing fun or interesting to tell my friends and family when I came back from work. I was feeling a wave of depression.

133,"How do you rightfully make a decision when it feels like you'll be full of regrets regardless of what you choose to do?

I recently broke two bones in my foot during a weight lifting accident, and now I have to come to a decision if it would be worth it for me to try to play football my senior year. If the healing speeds up I may get to play 4 games at the most nearing the end of the season, but most likely will only be able to play 2 the way the bones are broken. And I'm not sure at all if it's worth it. To begin with, I've played football all three years previously, and now looking back to last year, I don't think I enjoyed playing at all really. Playing usually just gave me enormous amounts of anxiety and stress and it felt like I couldn't do anything else. I always played because my parents wanted me to. And now that I have this broken foot, im going to be out for the majority of the season, and idk if you've ever sat out of any type of sport but it drives me absolutely crazy, watching my teammates practice and play during every single game while I stand on the sidelines and watch, not being able to do anything, so I really don't know if it'd be worth it to go through with standing on the sidelines to maybe play 4 games of a sport that I truly don't think I love at all. But I don't want to regret not playing my senior year. My coaches, teammates, and parents all want me to play, and not playing seems like I would just become a giant disappointment to them and that would kill me. I also don't want to look back at this part of my life and always regret not playing. But at the same time, I really didn't have the desire to play regardless of the broken foot. Playing the games is like a love/hate relationship. I love the memories I've made while playing but I don't think I've ever actually liked playing itself if that makes sense. I just don't want to regret what I choose to do, but that seems impossible to avoid and it's truly tearing me apart",07Aug2017,3

141,"Last Friday, I was the victim of a targeted burglary. My house windows were smashed in with a brick and my laptop and tablet stolen amongst other things. The financial consequences of this are annoying, but not something that's going to put me in severe difficulties. I had no insurance because it was too much for me to afford, but I can manage to replace what I've lost enough for me to work should the police fail to find anything. However, between that and a corrupted back up, I've lost pretty much 80% of the work that I've done in the past year.

My question is, and it might sound like a stupid one, is this dodgy to say inclusive of super? I feel like it is being a little deceiving by making it seem like you are receiving a higher salary when you're not, especially since by law they are required to pay you super anyway.

I didn't mind the age range that I talked to, so I thought he would at least have the courtesy not to lie about his age. He told me that he was mid twenties. But as I said there was just something off. The way he messaged me, just some inconsistencies in the stories he'd tell me. I even said to him that I didn't believe it, that he was lying to me. But he was adamant that he was telling the truth and I just have trust issues, but come on it's the internet?!?

Anyway, we just exchanged pics but after that I never asked for anymore. But I did ask for pics from places he'd visit. In one, I caught a reflection of him taking a photo and lo and behold it's like an old man, probably around 50.

I just don't see the need to lie, especially as i specified I didnt mind the age. We were just talking over kik and it was only friendly chit chat and I did mention role playing but did specify that i did not want it at this particular moment. (I thought he was around my age?!?)

I just feel violated, even though nothing major happened and can't help but think that ultimately his end game was to do some role playing even though he never pressed for it...

Am I over thinking things? What should I do?",07Aug2017,2

150,"So I am a coordinator at my job since February of this year. The position and program I am in are both new, and I've had this program basically built around me.  I took a pay cut to take this job as it was in a different, much more rural city, as I wasn't really advancing at my old job (which I didn't mind) and I thought ""one step back to take two steps forward"" in terms of getting experience. 

I'm not a fan of my current job as it wasn't really what I interviewed for, and I am not a fan of this town/city I live in now. HOWEVER I also wasn't actively looking to leave, not yet at least. I was going to work on building my management experience.  

I was contacted by my old job and they asked if I was interested in coming back to them, for a huge pay raise, almost $11,500 pay raise, back to doing a little bigger role than I had.  I want to accept this role. 

I know that my current job is going to react horribly to me giving two weeks (I cannot give them anymore as I was offered the job today and have to start my new gig on the 21st). I feel terrible for doing this to them. Not sure what I should I do? How do I give this notice? ",07Aug2017,2

First off little backstory I'm a 19 year old male from the U.K, city just south of Leeds.  I'm still living at home because I'm financially okay living off student loan, I don't have to get a job to live and my mother is okay with it as long as I pay her 300 a month which I can easily afford. I live on and grew up on a council estate so existence is relatively cheap

I'm a bit of a loner because I'm just bitter idk it's how I've always been, cynical and sort of grumpy and I'm convinced it just drives people away. I've got 2 friends that have been sort of there since highschool and that's really all I've got

I don't get invited out at all, I just assume it's because I'm just isolated but even if I did I couldn't bring myself to do anything I just can't handle the unknown I just feel like there's a reason I've ended up as isolated as I am and people will just think I'm a fucking freak for it.

I didn't want to ever end up like this but it just sort of happened, my two closest friends think I'm depressed but I'm not I'm just lonely I think but at this point I don't know anymore.

160,"This is a complex series of issues and I'm so stressed out about everything that I need to find a place to vent and figure out what to do. If you don't have advice for everything I honestly don't expect someone to know exactly what to do. 

My girlfriend and I are in our early 20's. We have a 4 month old together. 

In June I was fired due to my own stupidity and a misunderstanding of the attendance policy of my job. I was making enough for my girlfriend, who was on maternity leave after having my son, to stay at home full time. After I got fired, she took a job at a call center despite having extreme phone anxiety. She wanted me to stay at home for a short time but after a month it became clear that one income at a job that didn't pay as well was not going to cut it. So now I work full time and we have her sister babysit for the overlapping work period.

The problem is this: We currently have no money going towards savings. We are living paycheck to paycheck. We have existing debt obligations that are $15,000 for me (car+ credit cards) and $4000 for her. So at any moment our whole world could come crashing down. 

In addition, every day my girlfriend hates her job more. She has phone anxiety and her supervisor is not motivating. She has also failed phone surveys due to misinformation by floor supports. She said she dreads going into work and wishes she could stay at home again. 

I offered to work two jobs, but she won't accept that because I will never be home. We talked about her getting a different job but every time I go to look she says no one is hiring full time. She will be staying at her job but she hates it. I think the key is the second part, but I am a terrible communicator and am so stressed out that I am only making these talks worse.

Every day I find myself dreading life itself. We've been going to couples therapy for something unrelated to this but they're focused on our relationship and I feel like how I'm feeling isn't being addressed. I just wish I had an answer to all of this.",07Aug2017,1
162,"So I'll be starting as a freshman in college this fall and I don't want to go. I've never thought I, or anyone, needs school to be successful. The only reason I am considering going to college is for a backup plan. I have never actually seen myself graduating from college. On top of me not wanting to go, I'll be put into debt by going. The state covers half of my $5400 tuition, so every semester I'll have to come up with $2700, which I don't have, so I'll have to take out loans. I hate the thought of going to college and coming out working for someone else for $50000 a year.  I like the idea of not going to college to pursue my dreams, but I don't know what my dreams are. I don't know what to pursue. This is probably the most important decision of my life, and I have no idea what to do. School starts in 2 weeks. ANY advice is appreciated. Thanks.

They are honestly such horrible people and I know they will keep living their lives being horrible to other people because they all think very highly of themselves. They will never change their ways. I just wish I could hang out with them all one more time. Sit in the background of their conversations like a fly on the wall. Wait for them to say something conceded or horrible (it wouldn't take long) then to just stand up and say. ""I can't sit here and hear these delusional lies and horrible comments anymore. You are bad people and I can't be around your toxic energy anymore. I feel like being around you is rotting my brain and that my moral compass is completely broken. I can't be around you anymore."" 
Then just walk away and leave.
I just know that they would probably just say I was crazy and disregard what I say, as well as talk bad about me to people that I'm still friends with. That's the worst thing about living in small cities. Bad news gets around quick.

164,"*tl;dr:* Sorry, realized this got long. Is it worth it to risk losing my girlfriend to the grasp of time, by joining the military? By joining, I would improve my life in most ways, except by risking losing her. I don't know if it's worth it and I'm looking for advice.                     

-------------------

Hello /r/advice, I've created this thread because it helps me a lot to get the opinions of strangers, that aren't biased by being close to me. I'm struggling with a decision and I don't know what to do. Apologize in advance if this rambles.                 
                    
For ages I've been an unmotivated procrastinator with big ideas and no drive to actually do any of them. I bullshitted my way through high school, and I've gone through several college majors and many failed college classes. I work two shitty minimum wage jobs (job hunting right now for a third) and live paycheck to paycheck paying for my car maintenance, insurance, tuition, rent, etc. I'm also really struggling with the tuition payments, and I hate having to be in debt already. I hate my living situation and I tend to be miserable a lot. My life honestly isn't that bad and I definitely count my blessings, but I do feel trapped in a monotonous daily grind that isn't getting me anywhere.               
                 
I recently had the brilliant idea- I could join the military! This has led to a month of research and I'm still weighing it back and forth in my mind every day. When I picture myself in 4 years, if I join the military the picture is very different. It really seems like most aspects of my life would improve.                
            
- Decent enough pay with fewer expenses mean I'll leave the military with actual savings. On my current path, I would have little to no savings because I would be spending my minimum wage on college, vehicle, etc expenses. I also won't be in debt tens of thousands of dollars for student loans.             

- I can learn valuable skills and maybe even get a job afterward using the training I get.              

- I can learn discipline and break the bad habits I've settled into with my daily monotony.             

- I can serve my country, which while many think this is corny I find a good amount of pride in that.             

- I can have some interesting life experiences instead of just being in the same shitty city I hate every day of my life.             

- I would have a better educational outcome because I wouldn't be stressing working 3 jobs while trying to do school.             
             
- I don't really have any friends at all anymore, so I might be able to make some friends in the military.             
             
So anyway those are some of the reasons I think it would definitely be a positive thing in my life. In fact I'm so convinced that if it wasn't for *one detail*, I'd probably go enlist right now.                 
                
That detail is, of course, my girlfriend. I'm mostly happy to leave behind my life as it is right now and start something new, except for her. We've been dating for years, have an amazing relationship, she's my best friend, and we plan to get married once we graduate and get real stable jobs.              
Whenever this topic comes up, people always say ""If you don't last 4 years long distance while you're enlisted, you two weren't meant to be anyway."" This terrifies me, however. I see it as a sort of fallacy- how many amazing relationships just wouldn't work long distance? Just because one/both of us don't last long distance, we weren't meant to be?                    
I know ""there's a lot of girls out there"", but I *love* this girl. So much. And I'm just scared that, if I do enlist, we'll slowly drift apart.                 
I've talked with her about this and she's 100% supportive of me, but I'm not even 100% supportive of myself. I know that if I do join, I'd be doing it for both of us- I don't want to marry her and burden her with college debt. If I do 4 years in the military, I'll have enough for us to put down on a house and start our life together properly.                 
               
So I just don't know what to do. Keep up my current life that I hate, with the only positive thing being seeing my girlfriend? Or join the military, make a drastic change to my life, but risk losing her forever? Please just give me your thoughts, I just want more input on this. I don't have many people to talk to and I really appreciate any of your advice. Thank you!",07Aug2017,3
165,"My name is Darren. I graduated from university in May of this year with a BoS in Physics and Computer Information Systems, and a BoA in Math. 6 months ago I had the next 6 to 7 years planned out which was going to be graduate school towards a PhD in Physics. Then hopefully off to a space program (NASA or SpaceX). But after some intense self evaluation and reflection I realized I had a greater passion for traveling, learning about new cultures, maybe even writing about it. But i cant go back to school for another degree, I don't have either the financial aide available anymore or the money to do so. At the moment I am volunteering my time in a program called WWOOF to put some volunteer/agricultural experience on my resume. But I honestly have no idea where to go from here to pursue what I'm passionate about without falling into the work trap. I guess the advice I am asking is does anyone know of any programs/organizations that allot for a college graduate to travel for little to no expenses if I can simply work for them. WWOOF has been nice but the travel expenses are generally my responsibility. I've looked into the Peace Corp and contacted a recruiter but after doing a month or two worth of research I'm not sure its right for me. Anything anyone could offer would be great.

166,"I asked this in the ask reddit advice thread yesterday but since then I haven't been able to to block it out of my mind like I usually do, so I thought I'd ask in a more specialised place. 

I have an old friend. She was my best friend, and there's never been anyone I've been able to be so open and assured around. Long story short, 2 years ago we had an atomic falling out. Only spoken and been friendly intermittently since. A couple times we managed to fix things up but it never lasted more than a few days or a month before either fizzling out and drifting apart or another huge argument. I missed her badly the whole time. 

The last week of May, I ran into her by chance while walking. This was the first time we'd spoken in a year. We talked for about half an hour and she seemed really enthusiastic about getting back in touch. Whole conversation was really nice. Best since before everything went bad. We texted for a couple days after that and I told her I had a really busy June ahead but as soon as the month was out I'd be in touch and we could meet up properly. I never did. Every time I go to call or text I just chicken out. Literally every day since July 1st I've told myself all day I'll talk I her ""later"" which eventually turns into ""tomorrow"". If all goes to plan I'll be leaving town for university in September, so the more time passes the less chance there is for us to rekindle our friendship before I have to go. My friends all have their own issues with her and are ambivalent towards her and don't like to discuss her so I can't talk to them about this. Not sure what I'm expecting to hear, but I'd greatly appreciate input on this whole mess. ",07Aug2017,1

170,"So, I'm pursuing a dual math and finance degree at a top research university. I started this path directly after high school, and although I am confused about a lot of things, I don't regret my majors at all. 

I was a 3.4-3.5 GPA student on scholarship until about exactly a year ago my boyfriend of five years, literally a week after expressing things about us being together forever etc. cheated on me and moved in with the other girl. I was heartbroken, and since both of my parents are largely out of my life, I felt like I had nothing left. I stopped going to classes, almost lost my cushy on-campus job, and was just a ball of nothingness for about 3 months. By the end of the semester, I was in therapy and tried finishing off my classes as strong as I could, but still ended up with a 1.87 GPA for the Fall 2016 semester. 

In the following semester, I tried my hardest to get as high of a GPA as I could, but I failed the scholarship standard by 0.06 GPA (GPA standard was 3.3, I had a 3.24). I lost my scholarship, and I'm in the process of appealing, but it doesn't look good, because I really messed up this summer semester and straight up failed a class for the first time in my life because I tried to take two really hard math proof classes in a shortened summer semester. 

I'm still going to therapy. I'm still working on myself, but I'm just so upset that I can't seem to focus. I should be graduating in May, but between having to retake these classes and not as much financial aid coming my way, it'll be next December or later now.

I also failed the first actuarial test the first two times I've taken it, which is extremely discouraging. Even though I'm not committed to an actuarial career, it would've really helped me get an internship and make some money and get some job experience, etc. 

I'm very frustrated with myself, and I don't even want to make advising appointments because I was doing so well and now I'm stuck. I was an overachiever for a long time, and I'm struggling to watch my high school friends doing really well, while I'm... just not.

172,"I'm currently self employed and I live with my parents. I am seeking to move away from home. I have a place in mind with a mutual friend in a town an eight hour flight away. In fact, the airplane ticket has already been booked, but as of late I am torn on whether or not to carry through with this decision.

The reason I feel like I need move out is because I find my current city very stale. Whenever I think about staying here long term, I become extremely restless. I'm also trying to build something entirely my own, but the fact that I am living with my family at age 25 is demoralizing to me. I hate holding this image of myself where I am an independent adult, yet so dependent on my family to continue caring for me. I don't have any dependents, or any unpaid financial debts of any kind. There is also this part of me that believes now is the perfect age to leave home. If I were to wait any longer, I would regret it.

The reason I am torn is because I understand that deep down, the focus and time required to build my own dreams lie entirely within my own control, because it stems from the self. That I have a wonderful, loving family here which provide me rent without charge and food without cost. I have a girlfriend here, who when I told her about the ticket, she was supportive of my decision before later bursting out into tears. I wonder if moving out is a mask to hide my inability to face my own problems. I'm currently very comfortable here- there is a lot that I take for granted.

I've never once told her (we've been together only a few short months), but I love this girl. She is bound to school for another four years, in which she will be focused on her own education. I can't help but feel like she's better than me in many ways. However, at the end of the day, I'm not bound by anyone to any place. The decision to stay or go is entirely my own.

When is the best time to arrive if the show starts an hour after doors open? I want to get a decent view of the band, but want to minimize the amount of time that I'm idly hanging out alone!

Are people usually social at music venues or do they stick to their own groups? I'm not opposed to talking to others but would be fine with being left alone, too, since I'm mainly coming for the band.

191,"We found a cat thursday at 3:30. It looked awful. Very dirty and covered in fleas and had ear mites. There was no doubt in my mind she was a stray. We took her to the vet less than 2 hrs later. It cost over $200 for flea treatment, ear mites treatment, deworming, vaccines, and testing. I brought her home and it took an hr to bathe her twice in dawn dish soap and I was physically picking off the lives fleas running on her face with tweezers. It was terrible. We didnt know where she came from but it was clear she had been out for months. On friday i looked at the spca website but did not find any missing pets like her. On saturday a woman showed up at our home claiming to he the ""owner.""  I asked her how long she had been missing and the owner had definitely seen her tuesday morning so she was missing less than 48h at the most. In my mind there was no way this cat got that bad in that short of time so it was clearly living like that in her home. The woman admitted she had fleas in her home and said the cat was indoor only and that she had seen the fleas jumping on the cat and herself. She said she had the cat 2-3 yrs and never brought it to he vet except once when she first got it. The cat is not fixed and has not had vaccines. She had no records on her and supposedly has pictures but Ive not seen them.  She wanted the cat back. My initial response was no. If she even is yours then I know your house is infested with fleas and I just spent $200 getting them off her. She said she would work on getting her house cleaned but wanted her back at some point. I asked her to gently consider if she felt she could or was giving her the best care based on how she looked. She said she is definitely going to take care of her now but I just find it shady that it took someone else doing it for her to realize the cat needed help. I asked if she could financially afford her. She receives social security and has just moved here from TN to live with her mom. She does not work. She said yes she could definitely afford her care. I asked her to reimburse me the cost of the vet visit then and she said she couldnt.  She ultimately left the cat with me professing to get everything in order and do a better job caring for her. She has called twice in the past 3 days and has been getting pushier and more defensive and persistent on getting her back. I told her that since she had no record or proof of ownership that for now she would stay with me until I speak with the spca about what needs to happen with her. I was also honest with her in saying I was concerned with how she looked and there was suspicion of neglect. I honestly dont want her to go back there because of how bad she looked and although Im all for second chances on most things... I dont feel like neglect is one u should get a re-do on and the kitty shouldnt have to suffer while you keep trying. :/. I obtained the vet records and spoke to animal control who recommended keeping her for now till it could be sorted out. Ive left message for the spca cruelty division officer but have not hear back yet. I spoke to the receptionist at the spca who couldnt really help me.  

Im worried because this woman knows where I live and I know little about her except rumors she is an ongoing addict who may have lost custody of her kids in the past. She is currently late 40s, early 50s. I know her house must be covered in fleas. 

What would you all do? Any advice or do u think Im doing the right thing? Ive never been in this position before. I dont want to be holding someones cat hostage but she also has no proof and no records of ownership anyway. And with no proof or records I cant ethically give this woman this cat when she is admitting she has fleas and doesnt give her animals vet care and may have neglected this one if it is hers. Im waiting on the spca but in the meantime she keeps calling. :/  and who knows.. maybe it is hers and she genuinely loves her but if thats the case she still was totally neglecting her care. 
I did talk to a lawyer who said the worst she could do was take me to civil claims court but with no records it would be unlikely. Im definitely an anxious person and the thought of having to go to court terrifies me. 

My ultimate plan was on fostering her until I can find a home. I have 2 offers in already for her ... both to families with excellent references and a hx of taking great care of their animals. So now the poor little thing is in limbo while I get this all sorted out.

TIA! 

TLDR: i found a cat that looks uncared for. Owner came forward but has no records. Cat appears neglected if she was in fact living in that home. Im keeping the cat till the spca intervenes but she keeps calling. Any advice? ",07Aug2017,1
192,"So the new girlfriend of about 6 months is pregnant. OBGYN appointment coming soon. Make no mistake here folks, I am happy but scared out of my mind! I have a 2 year old boy who is the single most beautiful thing walking this earth! Words can't describe how much I love him! Problem is, I never wanted kids. But now that he is here I couldn't imagine life without his precious smile! I regret nothing! She also never wanted kids. Both of our were surprises. 

I am 33, she is 31 going on 29 (no woman is ever older than so I've learned). She is divorced and I am never married. She has a beautiful 5 year old that she shares custody with her ex on good terms. I do not have the same good terms she does. My ex is bitter as all hell. I think a shotgun wedding would ""cheapen"" or degrade our vows (if married for the sake of the peanut growing). 

Issues-
We can't afford another kid
We aren't married
I am afraid what it could do her to career
I am afraid what it could do to my family and her family
I am afraid this could effect my custody of my son (although I am confident it won't but I am a father after all fighting family court)
I am kind of leaning towards abortion but I am completely unsure. (Please no religious talk, thank you in advance). 
She says it's not a good time and I agree but could I really bring myself to agree to or mention abortion!? How could I live with myself after it ya know? How could she?
For the record she is not crazy like my ex. She is weirdly very level headed and intelligent. Much more than I could ever be lol.
I have nothing but admiration and respect for this lady! She blows my mind daily with her determination, how hard she works and does it all with a precious smile that brightens my life. Truly. I do not want her to feel trapped and I don't want her to feel I am trapped! I love her completely, that I am sure of. I am sure that I annoy her but hey, what are good boyfriend for lol. 

She is afraid of going at this alone and I have reassured (and will show with actions not just words) how much I mean that and I will be with her every step of the way. 

HELP
TIA
TL;DR-kid on the way and I am panicking big time.

195,"tldr: my non-biological brother (14 now) has been spying on me (female, 16 now) and trying to record me naked for 2 years. I haven't told anyone but I want to take action now.

longer version: My brother and I are not biologically related, our parents married when we were young. We were close in childhood but have grown apart since he began spying on me. About 2 yrs ago I was taking a shower and found a camera in the bathroom propped up on a high shelf recording me naked. I deleted the videos and left it on the counter. I was about 14 then, and extremely shaken, but had no idea what to do so I just ignored it. I thought it wouldn't happen again.

Now its almost 2 years later, and he still tries to spy on me. Whenever I use the toilet or take a shower I see his shadow under the door. I have opened the door to him crouching with a camera. I no longer take showers or use the bathroom if its just us home alone. Even when others are home i have to block the cracks and undress only behind the shower curtain.

What complicates things further is my fear of telling my parents. It may sound stupid, but there is a history of divorce in my family and I am afraid that if I tell them, they will each choose the side of their child and it will destroy the family. I don't want that, I just want it to stop. I'm done with feeling unsafe in my own home.
Thanks for any of your suggestions, I just don't know what to do.

196,"So for a little background, I'm 17 and I graduated from high school a whole year early. I have a job 30 hours a week stocking bags of feed and dog food. I like the job, (I don't mind it but I don't hate it) and the managers are very cheap and rude to everyone except me. I'm looking for a raise for my 1 year next month and they said probably not cuz they're over the budget limit by $30,000+ (they're not smart). After work, I go and workout with a friend for about 1 hour Monday through Friday. 


I play games and I make youtube videos from them after working out. I have 34 subs, old channel had 98. I'm not growing that much and it does suck, especially since I livestream too and my past 4 streams have 0 views and interaction. This is my goal for the future along with owning a business and graphic design. (I'm really determined and I know I'll succeed since I try to work my a** off day in and day out, even if it's not ""realistic"" to some of you.)


Starting end of the month I am taking 5 online college classes at a community college here in town. These are mostly graphic design, with psychology and personal finance thrown in. That will probably add more stress, but I don't have to pay for it. (I'll end up getting $3000 a semester for the next 2 semesters for scholarships after paying tuition and books) Soon I'll be taking business courses as well.


Another big part of my day is after work, working out and making YT Vids, is me playing competitive call of duty and streaming it late night. This is really fun and sometimes my teammates (whom I met online from youtube a year ago) play without me and it sounds childish but it pisses me off. (They don't play with anyone else, it's just they don't invite me sometimes. I think I resolved this issue though. However playing late night till 1-2 am means that I can only sleep till 8 cuz I work at 9 the next morning usually. 6 hours of sleep isn't awful, but I'm only 17 and I feel like 8 or even 10 would be best.


Another possibility of stress is that I want my dad to stop smoking and he promised me that he would quit. 3 days later he was working out of town and the manager was a real a**hole to him, it got him pissed and he started smoking again. Also, he quit that job. My mom got her wage cut in half (it's still more than most people) and is working 2 days. My dad has had (no joke) 15+ jobs the past year. We are barely making enough to pay our bills, and now I have more money in savings then my parents. It's pretty scary, but I seem to not stress about this that much honestly. Maybe I'm worried about this so much, my body forces me to stress about youtube instead? Idk.


Now for what I think stresses me out. I think it's mostly youtube because I gotta get a video up each day to stay on schedule and I might cut down to like 5 a week. Also at work I constantly stress about titling my videos the same, and making thumbnails perfect later, and much much more stuff about youtube. I think I have slight OCD, where everything (youtube and some other things, not everything) needs to be perfect. OR I think it's the fact that I'm starting to get bored at work and I'm thinking of something I enjoy (youtube) and I can't wait to get started, so I just start stressing about what I'm doing later


Thanks for reading if you did. I'd appreciate any help. I'm just wondering what could I be stressing about. There's work, college, friends on gaming, YouTube channel, lack of sleep, working out (and eating healthy), parents wages are spiraling down (might have to move), etc. Or it could be something else, but if there's any ideas as to how I can get rid of or limit my stress, that'd be awesome. Thanks!",07Aug2017,1
197,"I have been working at a small business for a while, and have worked my way up to a good position for my experience level. A fresh graduate has started and has been hinting that his salary is higher than mine and that he is surprised that he is in a more senior role than I am as I have more experience.

I am 99% sure he is not considered to be in a more senior role and I am unsure how he came to that conclusion or if it was been positioned like that to him by the business.

I worked hard to get to this job within the business and if this person really has been brought in on a higher salary, this would make my prior experience worthless in the eyes of my employer. I like my job and I like the company, and until this point I felt like I was valued.

I [19] have a wonderful girlfriend [17](before anyone asks, this is perfectly legal where i live), and we've been in a relationship for about 2 years now, and the whole time has been great. Anyways, we were having a serious talk the other day, when she basically saidto me that if we ever have sex when she doesn't want to she will report me to the police for rape. Which is fine in it of itself, but the catch is that a couple of months back, she did force me to have sex even though I didn't want to. I could've physically overwhelmed her and threw her away, which is what I should've done thinking in hindsight, but being the soft ass I am I just went with it, and so did she, fully knowing I really didn't want to. She has since apologized, but it was just after this recent conversation we had that the gravity of the matter hit me.  And now, I don't really feel that well being around her. I do want to talk to her about it now, but I know that only bringing up the topic will drive her to tears since she is really sorry (or at least appears that way). Am I overthinking things, or is there a legitimate problem. I've been thinking about this a lot but I seriously can't find a decent answer.

202,"I'm currently attending an Elementary ED BA program and I'm about to start my 2nd semester. I chose the program because it is the only college in my area and that was the only program it offered. 
Recently I found out that they are closing the branch that I go to and that classes will now be held in two different locations, one is 40 minutes away and the other is an hour. I have a car, but it's not reliable for long distance so my classmates mentioned they would allow me to carpool with them. They will be going to the hour away campus and I would prefer the other campus... but, I decided to follow them so that I could carpool. 
(Sidenote: this program has been an absolute mess of changes, horrible teachers who quit mid semester, and an academic advisor who is pure hatrid)
I also found out that the academic advisor will be teaching on of my classes. I can be civil, but this woman literally leaves me feeling ill whenever I see her. 
So, I'm faced with the decision of continuing the program, or taking a year off and working to get a new car. If I take a year off, the grants will gain interest and if I don't teach within an 8-yr period those grants+interest will turn to loans. I'm currently out $1840, but I don't have to pay that back as long as I teach within an 8-yr period. This school has made me hate the thought of teaching. I'm not sure what I should do. Should I go and rely on the carpool? What if they bail and I've got to drive the hour to the place I wouldn't have chosen if not for the carpool in the first place? I feel so insecure I don't know what to do. If I take the year off, I'll sub so that I get a better foundation in the program... but is that the best choice?",07Aug2017,1

216,"I wrote my life story down below. Please read it and give me advice.

Hi, I'm Deni.
I'm 15 and am (was?) an immigrant from Chechnya. 
I live in a german speaking country for 13 years now. 
I have always been a knowing child. 

When I was in Kindergarten I got bullied, due to me being so different. I never fought back. 
At home my parents would rant about me not standing up for myself. ""Don't talk to me"" my mom said in one of those situations when I was 6.

I don't smile on any of the pictures from age 0-6, except for one. I think it was the first day of Kindergarten, the sun is shining, I sit next to my sister in front of a tree. On this picture both our smiles have black teeth due to our parents don't teaching us to brush our teeth.

Due to me getting bullied and my parents telling me to use violence in any situation, I started abusing my brother, Mansur. I always found him weird and just retarded. That's the word I'd use later. He'd never fight back.

My brother is really socially awkward and introverted now. I hate myself for bullying him. I'm crying writing this. He is still scared of me, but only if we're alone. He enjoys my company if we're with my childhood friend Fabian.

On my 6th birthday, I got 10 bucks from a neighbour. I gave them to my mother to buy food. 

Somewhere around the age of 6 we moved to an other neighbourhood, to a bigger apartement. Around this age, my younger sister, Marina, was born, I have an older one, Diana, too. 

At this new place, a lot of life long friendships were born. I truly enjoyed myself at this time. There was always stress at home though. 

My dad. He has narcicisstic tendencies and anger issues. He beat my mother, Diana, Mansur and me. Especially me. Dad smokes since the age of 12. 

At elementary school I'd never speak. It seemed normal to me. I still had some friends there. I had good grades, I never needed help with homework, didn't learn a lot at home, school was pretty easy for me back then.

If I wasn't at school nor outside I'd play video games. I loved my Playstation 2. Kingdom Hearts 2 is still my favourite game. 

School-me and Freetime-me were 2 different persons. Everyone at school pronounced my name wrong and I didn't bother to correct them, I was extremely shy - Outside, on the other hand, I was extremely active and a leader type. My friends and siblings loved me.

I really enjoyed the age 6 - 11 even though life at home sucked. My childhood outside was just so great, I experienced a lot. 

Both of my best friends, Fabian and Leon, moved away. My older, female friends stopped going outside due to hitting teenage age. 

I found out about sex really early. I silently watched pornography on the TV in my room. I googled 'sexy games' on my own PC which my older sister noticed and approached me on. (Age 6-11) 

Due to losing all my friends when I was ca 12, I stopped going outside. I started masturbating. 
I started watching Anime and playing Online-Minecraft 8 hours a day. I'd get weirder and weirder. 
I was really socially awkward by then. 

I remember starting off on normal pornography and regurlarly wanking to hentai later. Media told me masturbation was healthy. Soon I got addicted and did it for the habit alone. 

Age 12 - 15 was my life going downhill. 

I was a fucking weirdo by now. Anime, Hentai and Pornography fucked 12-yo old mes brain.
I couldn't talk to any girls. I couldn't hold eye contact.  
I'd grow my hair out like those cool guys in Anime. I had some weird fantasies. 

This stuff is poison for kids growing up. 

My grades worsened due to me addicting to League Of Legends. 

My parents didn't teach me anything. They gave me unlimited acess to my PC, TV, sugar, anything. 

The last year of middle school was pure terror for me. I didn't know whats wrong with me. I had no motivation, I had terrible acne, I felt dumb. 

I still have problems with middleschool maths because of these years. 

My family grew apart from me. I can't talk to any of my siblings. I can't hold a conversation with any of them. 

My life changed in the first highschool year. At the end of 2016 I found Reddit and started to make positive changes like NoFap. 

At my birthday in March, I was 99% certain I was going to kill myself. I just hated my existence. Everyone I knew hadn't gone through the shit I had gone through. I wanted to take revenge on my parents. 

I didn't kill myself but I dropped out of school. 4 months have passed since then, I have summer break currently.

I stopped watching any pornography. 
I stopped masturbating entirely, last time was 91 days ago, the 6th May, I felt depressed because of my family. 
I stopped consuming any unhealthy sugar.
I started reading, have read 7 books since then.
I started brushing my teeth 2 times a day and having a skincare routine.
I started meditating. 
I hang out with frienda sometimes.
I only play 2 hours a day.
I'm relearning some Maths. 
And many more positive changes.

But I still, kind of, feel like shit. My parents aren't responsible adults at all. My family situation kind of fucks with me.
For instance, we have a Sky subcrisption we don't use anymore but they don't quit it. 70 bucks a month gone. They drink loads of energy drinks and eat unhealthy.

I'm scared of my siblings growing up to be idiots like my parents. I feel the need to improve them. To make them stop eating unhealthy for example, but my mother won't take my advice at all. I feel responsible if they later have any problems that could have been advoidable.

My second big problem is my school career. The school I wanted to go to didn't take me due to my last middle school year, pretty much, after giving me false hope.
The other school didn't take me due to me not having 2 years of italian before. 
The other school left is a technical school I don't really wanna go to but seems like I must. 
My mother doesn't really try to get me to a school, really. She can't speak proper German after 13 years of living here.

217,"To summarize the events that had occurred; I had unprotected sex (big mistake but both of us have learned our lesson)with my girlfriend during her 13th day of her 28 day cycle. I got her to take the after morning pill after 48 hours which is on her 15th day of her cycle. Assuming her ovulation occurred on the 14th day of her cycle. Is the pill still effective. And I did not ejaculate inside of her. 

So to get into details, before we had sexual intercourse I had already ejaculated, and she gave me head a couple of times before I actually did it (not sure if saliva can delay sperm from fertilizing). So during the course of intercourse (it was our first time), I was never close to cumming when I was inside of her, and I pulled out the moment I felt just a little close to cumming. The fear didn't really hit us until a day later. So we took breaks and I went to pee and we went for a second round, she gave me head before I penetrated. Again, I never actually ejaculated inside of her. 

So I'm curious to know what are her chances of getting pregnant, We are both still young and have a bright future ahead of us, sugar coating this would not help us, I would like to know the truth. Will the plan b pill work after ovulation, Furthermore, I watched a 3-d animation video of fertilization and it talked about how 300 million sperm is released in one ejaculation and only about a few dozen make it to the Fallopian tube, so the fact that I pulled out does it significantly lowered her risk of pregnancy? And let assume the egg was released on the 14th day would my sperm have already reached her Fallopian tube waiting for her egg to be release? Would taking the plan b pill even work after fertilization?  (she took the Take action one) And if the worse does happen, and she does get pregnant, she wants to get the abortion pill without her parents knowing. Is it possible to obtain the abortion pill without her parents knowing while utilizing insurance? ",07Aug2017,0

As a couple months go by, we notice that he begins to take advantage living with us. Eating our food, using our shampoo, not taking out the garbage and living rent free. He also failed his classes, declines acceptance to a school up north, goes out every night and goofs around.

At this point we're thinking he has to go. Everything he's been saying to us has been nothing but procrastinated lies just so that he can stay here longer. He rarely talks to us about his situation so we don't know how to help him, and he doesn't ask for it. I don't want to be the asshole cousin to tell him he needs to go but I might just have to.

225,"**X/Posted in r/JobAdvice and now here** I'm going to try to make this as short as I can. I am specifically looking for insight from people who have worked in commission/sales environment in department stores, but all opinions welcomed. I was recently hired at a department store in a cosmetic sales position that requires a license. I left a really shitty job and I doubled my salary before commission and all was well. The girl in my position prior to me was fired for doing services not on the menu, and not following state sanitation laws. Though she was exceeding her sales goals, and had an extremely large clientele. Fast forward 60 days from being hired and I was given a review. Basically, I was told that I am not doing well at all (in sales only, I was told everything else was perfect and commended on my cleanliness) and not meeting her goals (goals she got from ringing things I'm not allowed to do). I brought 0 clientele with me to this job (they knew this in the interview process). Most of her clientele followed her or now have no interest in the services offered because they're much more limited than what the other girl was offering. I got the feeling that I might be let go when they revisit me in 30 days if I haven't completely turned everything around. They expected me to already have a clientele of around 200 people only 60 days in. I personally feel this is unfair (I know, life isn't fair) but I'm not really sure how to handle it. I have been working quite a bit in my off time making social media accounts to advertise, texting clients etc. My question is basically are they bluffing? Should I be concerned for my job, or is this a usual tactic if you're not meeting their goals? I really do enjoy this job, I am not looking to get a new job at all. I am not a lazy worker, and am willing to do what it takes, but I also don't want to end up busting my ass for a month only to get fired. All opinions welcome, but I would like to know if anyone has experience in this situation!

229,"So, I bought a car in May. A 2006 Volkswagon Passat.

I bought the car and didn't even get to drive it until 2 weeks after they got the check, because they hadn't serviced it yet. Anyway, they serviced it and all, I drive it off the lot, 2 weeks later. Engine light comes on.

I turn around and they charge me $100 for a diagnosis fee, turns out it was a $600 fix. 

I am a college student with no money, but needed a car for school. I have a very little income and just enough to cover the loan. So, I didn't have $700 to pay everything, and now I has to open a credit card with the dealership to pay for it.

Now, it's been in and out of the shop for the same problem 4 times! Still paying for everything.

I am moving in Thursday, and the dealship has been working with me to keep costs down, but still...I have easily paid more than 10% of the loans worth into this car.

Here's The Story and I Need Some Perspective:

The other night I went out with my cousin and my girl who are best friends *very close* *twinned*

As soon as we got there we got two tables for one I stood at on my phone by myself to think because me and my girl had problems. 

I went with my girls sister let's call her *Ruh* and my bae *Ray*. So we got some drinks came back to the main table poured out the drinks into separate cups and claimed our cups, what happened after I remember, we drank had fun and so and so. I left my drink on the table multiple times before and I after I was acting erratically.

So I took more sips from my drink leaving and coming back, yet I was glued to the table as I usually am because I take care of everyone's things usually. Now from the first part I remember everything and throughout the night every little thing is to my control and knowledge. 

*I drank about four times altogether, danced once, annoyed my cousin and walked off, went to the toilet once came back, felt too drunk so walked off to sit them to lay on the ground*


Now, what is being told:
-- 


*I pushed my cousin like I wanted to fight, I pushed MY *GIRL* (Not just the fact she's mine she's also a female, which I am against giving any physical or emotional aggression to, it's not of me and my morals) so this doesn't make any sense*

I remember what I remember and I am being told what I don't know and I cannot believe was me. 

I need all of you too understand, I always hold my liquor, never give bad attitude. And am always the one is the most sober. But this time it doesn't add up. Everyone including what I searched up and have been advised is that I was spiked now it was a big party and I was with and open table and a group of people.

This really doesn't add up at all it doesn't make any sense to me. I don't act like this ever

I need some opinions? Please. The repercussions are me losing the relationship with my cousin and I have lost my girl to which she has now said *Guess what, I don't care at all now*

239,"tl;dr: dad's car was hit with no one in it by Driver X. Driver X's insurance policy sucks and only covers a fraction of the damages. How do we go about obtaining the full damages amount? Lawyer up? Independently file lawsuit? Or is it better to take the offer?

Hey everyone,

My dad's car was parked on the street and was hit - with no one inside it - by a guy who lost control of his car (we'll call him Driver X). We filed a police report and Driver X has been acknowledge as being specifically at fault - he hit my dad's car and then hit another car like 20 feet away, too, before he could swerve out. Driver X's insurance policy (Infinity) states their maximum coverage here is only $5,000. While Infinity estimated the damages to be close to 5K, Driver X doubled up and hit two cars that night. Because of this, Infinity send an adjuster to both cars and obtained an estimate for repair. The damages exceeded 5K, so Infinity took the total damages amount in $, calculated the percentage of that total belonging to my father, and offered my father that same percentage of 5K, e.g. if the total damages were 10K and Infinity only covers 5K and the damages to my dad's car were 8K, he would get 80% of the 5K as 8K is 80% of 10K.

The money Infinity is offering my father (approximately $3,400) only covers about half of the damages estimate. We are therefore thinking of suing Driver X directly. Infinity won't pay more than what they agreed to in their contract with Driver X, so we can't ask them for it. But I cannot find a vehicle damage lawyer. I called some property damage places, but they stated they do not work those types of cases.

So here are my questions. If we want to recover the full amount to repair the car, a Ford F250, then we have to sue Driver X for that money. Does anyone have recommendations? Should we get an attorney? Will it cost too much? What are the chances of recovering the total amount? Where can we start looking?

I'm an introvert by nature, but I'm not completely awful at socializing. if you didn't know me, you'd think I'm social and outgoing when you meet me. However, all that is bullshit and mostly me overcompensating since I'm very uncomfortable in new environments and I desperately want to fit in. Over time though that attitude sort of fades and I withdraw back into myself because I'm always more comfortable being alone and doing my own thing than trying to fit in a group. Basically, the only social circle I have are my 5/6 very close friends who've been with me my whole life. 

I've always chalked it up to ""not meeting the right group"" and that I would naturally want to open up more when I meet people who share my interests. Well now I know that is complete bullshit (once again) because I spent the last year in a school program with people who literally share the exact same interests as me (art and geeky shit) and I still felt like a complete outsider. 

I have trouble opening up to people, well actually i DON'T want to open up to people. This is probably close to the root of my troubles and social insecurities, but I've always been like this. I always interiorize everything and look for solutions to my problems myself (i consider going to therapy a solution as well) I feel like every human being already has enough bullshit to deal with, and anyways most people don't want to truly help you, they want to offer you the solution that seems most conveniant to get you to shut up about your crap so they can talk about themselves (did I mention I don't like people very much?).

259,"Some backstory

So one of my childhood friends and i dated at the end of school/during college, we're now 24. During that time i was really suffering from depression and anxiety eventually I sought help and im doing much better now. 
However while were dating she asked me to attend some events with her family and i ended up not going because i was in a real down spike at the time.
I felt terrible about it because we were each others first relationship and i know she wanted to show her family that i wasn't made up.
While i did some things like this i tried so hard to be a good boyfriend for the most part, i went to other events and did meet her parents and 2 much older brothers, just the thought of large gathering of people who would be scrutinising me scared me too much at the time. 

Eventually she broke up with me via email which hurt me because im more the sort of person that likes to sit down and talk about important things to get it all out and stop my mind over thinking. I was never given a real reason why she broke up with me although i could obviously guess.

Now at the same time like i said i tried to be a good boyfriend and did tell her that i was suffering with depression and had been to the doctors and was seeing a councillor. She was the first person i told outside of my parents and the only one to know how bad it was outside my parents.

Over the years we've stayed friends and also fell into bed together a lot although every time we did she always ended up saying we shouldn't have because it will make it harder to move on. To me i always thought she'd decided to give us another go which was silly after it happened so many times I admit. 

She did admit recently that its always been her that's initiated these periods of seemingly wanted us to be a thing again because although i would probably have gotten back together on the spot at anytime i never wanted to be the ex boyfriend that is constantly hounding her for a second chance. i just tried to be a good friend as much as i could. 

Recently we stayed at a mutual friends house over night and although we went to bed in different locations i woke up with her in my bed and one thing led to another but it didn't go all the way this time because we were at the friends house. 

We talked a little but she said she wanted to time to think which is what shes said a lot of times before when ive asked to talk out what we are after these periods of seemingly getting back together. Eventually she said the truth was that although she would always have those feelings for me she wouldnt want to get back together becasue she didnt trust me and when pressed she gave the fact i didnt tell her straight away that i was depressed and that i missed the important family events when we first dated as reasons.

This has hurt me a lot because i know i have my share of blame and hate myself for some of the things i did or rather didnt do before i got help. but at the same time i did try my hardest for her despite my circumstances.

I spoke to a friend and my mother about this as she noticed i was really down and forced it out of me. 

My mother suggested writing a letter as whenever ive tried to go see her or speak via anything but texting or messaging in the past when ive been confused and wanted to talk after these periods and sex and affection she has rebuffed me and then after a few days pretended it never happened and we've ended up doing the same thing again later down the line. and when ive tried to insist and point out that she was just going to pretend it never happened shes gotten mad and said im blaming her for all of it.

I was suggested writing a letter because i can put everything down uninterrupted and not in little bursts like with texts. and she cant just instantly reply and hopefully will have to think about what ive said. Do you think this is a good idea? Im just tired of going around in circles and also hurt that im being judged for something i did years ago when i was effectively ill. 

I know ive rambled here and hope this makes sense. if you want any other info or clarification please just ask . thank you",07Aug2017,3
261,My parents are really nasty people and I don't think it's essential to go too in-depth about it. I have really serious feelings for this girl (19). She hasn't met either of my parents yet and I don't necessarily want her to. I can never have her over at my house due to this too. Is this something that will prevent us from functioning properly? What should I do to make it work? This whole dilemma is quite embarrassing.,07Aug2017,3
262,I am mainly scared because it's going to happen. No matter what. And then you're gone for good. I'm not religious btw,07Aug2017,15

266,"This girl and I are into each other and this weekend, we tried to take things to ""more than just friends"" territory. Thing is, no matter how much we messed around or what we did, I just wasn't able to get past ~60% erect. I put on a condom at one point like a true optimist, but that eventually slipped off because I picked the size based on the assumption I'd actually be hard. I'm really introverted and tend to be very slow to let my walls down around people, and I've only known this girl for a brief time. I suspect my issue had something to do with that, but even after she spent the night and I felt way more comfortable with her physically and emotionally, I still didn't get hard the next morning either. She was really cool about it and hasn't really brought it up since then, and seems to still be interested in keeping things going, but I'm just so confused and humiliated and worried. She had been talking a bunch before now about how she finds me really hot and wanted to bang me, and I let her down (kind of - I did at least give her some supposedly pretty good oral and she had an orgasm that seemed like it might've been real). I kind of have the impression that her interest in me is more physical than emotional, so now on top of the humiliation and disappointment, I'm worried she won't even be interested in keeping us going anymore because I can't give her what she's after. I'm worried she's just going to find someone else who won't disappoint her. I think right now she's sticking around hoping it was a one time thing, and I hope that too, but I'm terrified that it'll continue to happen to me and that it's all going to fall apart. I'm scared to try again because I'm scared it'll happen again and she'll give up on me. I read around online and it sounds like performance anxiety and this issue are pretty common, but that doesn't make it suck any less. I don't know how to get my confidence back and keep this from becoming a self-sustaining cycle. It seems like most advice on the subject is ""just relax and don't put pressure on yourself and let it happen,"" but how the hell am I supposed to relax about my dick not working and being a disappointment to a girl I care about?! How can I not think and worry about that next time we're getting heated up? I just feel like such a pathetic excuse for a man and such a disappointment right now :( this is really fucking with my head to the point where I haven't been myself all day because I can't stop thinking about it and freaking out about it. Any advice or even just sympathy would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: tried to get sexy times on with a girl I like, couldn't get hard, she's been cool about it so far but I'm flipping shit about it and terrified it's going to happen again and she's going to move on to someone who can satisfy her.",07Aug2017,3
