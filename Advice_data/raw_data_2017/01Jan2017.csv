1,"A friend of my husband's and his buddy decided to visit us in Europe and we all planned a trip to Prague for NYE. They're names are John and Dan. They are from CA and I think they tried to do something really stupid. Dan bought a level 3 fireworks box to use it at the Airbnb we are staying at. They have never used fireworks and they think that anything is legal and possible in Prague. They did not bother to find out what kind of fireworks they got, nor the safety tips for using fireworks. The box was in another language and he found it at a random store that was open that night. My dad works at the ER and gets many cases of firework
 related injuries this time of the year. I got scared because: they did not bother to look up instructions, if an explosion occurs the Airbnb and the neighbors properties could get damaged, someone could get into an accident and idk how to call for an ambulance, we have no fire extinguisher, etc. 

I mentioned earlier that was not a good idea and then they acted like they wouldnt do it. At midnight I saw they all went to the rooftop and try to light it up. I freaked out and started yelling that was stupid, that they were acting like teenagers and then I took away the matches. Not my proudest moment but I was so afraid something bad would happen. 

My husband told me I need to take more risks and that I should had let his friends hurt themselves if they wished to do that. That it is not my place to micromanage them. And that he was disappointed that we as a couple didn't take more risks. 

After that, they still tried to light up the
 fireworks, but this time from the street in front of the apt complex. The fireworks worked well and there was no accident. 

I am terribly sad and I feel like I f-ed up NYE. Any advice on how I could fix this situation?? I feel so sad and embarrassed that I just went to bed and hid under the covers to cry. They are going to stay at our apt for 3 days after we leave Prague :$",01Jan2017,1
4,"I'm quite young and I got asked out by a total stranger, now being me, I had to say No since I didn't even know what the person was like, I could be going out with a complete physco bitch (And so I was right, turned out to be a complete bitch and bullied others, she no longer goes to my school now) 

Anyways, so years pass and people are still finding out I got asked out by this girl, rumours were spread and so forth. Anyways we were just talking in my Art class until my ass hole of a friend (who knows i hated talking about the situation) decided to bring it up. Then, out of no where, this other girl, who isn't friends with the physco bitch what so ever decides to say 
""No offence, but she could've done better""
Like wtf? What have i done to you? You're not even involved in the fucking conversation? I just shrugged it off because I'm not the loudest guy you'll meet. I don't voice how I feel about others unless they're positive. But this was what was going on in my head. God, am I really that ugly? I don't say anything mean to anyone, I don't even got that many friends and that alone upsets me. 

Was i supposed to take offence? She want joking. She had a straight face. It's not even this that really bothers me, others have been dicks to me in the past but this was different, I've never been categorised by someone (especially a girl which somehow makes me feel even shittier) before. You can say what you want to me but that just pissed me off for some reason.",01Jan2017,1
5,"Hey, 

I'm having a tough time with a decision I made and I'd appreciate some advice.

When I was young like 13 to 15, I witnessed what alcohol did to some of my family members,  and a few years later to people of my age. I hated seeing the way they acted and all, I didn't think it looked cool to drink at all and made a promise to myself at about 15-16 (16 being the drinking age where I was) that I'd never drink in my life. Not because I wouldn't be able to control myself, but just because I started to hate alcohol. Out of all of what I saw, the way my father acted really struck a cord. He never hurt anybody physically but I really really hated him for everything he did while being drunk, that's one of the big reasons I made my decision. 

People slowly asked me why I never drank alcohol but I always said it's a personal life decision, sometimes I'd go into more detail. Some would not force me but really push me to drink but I refused. 

Now I'm 23, and I still never drank alcohol in my life. It's getting harder to refuse since its slowly becoming obvious to me that not having alcohol in my blood is kinda hindering my social life. I didn't mention it but on top of that, I'm more of a shy guy so yeah... I guess alcohol could help but I have a feeling in my gut everytime I think about maybe saying ""what the hell""  and get it over with. 

But I can't keep out that thought in my head,  that I would break my ""young self's"" promise to never drink, and what kinda person would I be if I couldn't keep a promise to myself? I feel like that teenager would be ashamed of me if he saw me drinking. 


Usually on New Year's I don't go out so it never really bothered me, but now I'm on a trip with a friend and he usually doesnt drink but only when travelling or special occasions. I'm seeing him having fun and I'm just there, kinda hating myself because I think I'm boring, and maybe drinking would help me loosen up? But then what? When I wake up I'll think about me breaking my own promise for a ""possible""  good moment? 

Should I do it? Should I not? Any advice would be appreciated. If you made it to the end thank you for reading everything. 

Tldr:I made a promise to myself to never drink when I was about 15, never drank, now 23, seriously questioning if I should break own promise. ",01Jan2017,1
6,"We have noticed over the past 5 months that our water bills have been unusually high. We contacted the water company, and they came to look for leaks outside, and we looked for leaks inside. There were no leaks found. Our toilet does not leak. There is no water leaking.

July 14th to August 13th our bill was $144.93


August 14th to September 13th our bill was $107.35


September 14th to October 13th our bill was $94.83


October 14th to November 13th our bill was $119.88


November 14th to December 13th our bill was $66.63

The water company has told us that our water bills were unusually high during the dry months of the year, but they could not find any justification for the extremely high water usage. The water company told us that they suspected theft. They told us to investigate our water line and water heater.

During that investigation we noticed our upstairs neighbor has a hose hooked up to an exterior water spigot, which is attached to our water line. The neighbor regularly waters her plants during the dry season using that hose. It is obvious that the neighbor in is using our water to water her plants and has run our bill up. We have overpaid by at least $200.

We contacted our property manager and she told us to send an email and they will switch the hose over. That's it.

What are our options here? Do we have any chance of getting our money back, or are we just sol and will pay less moving forward now that she's not on our spigot?

Thanks for any help!",01Jan2017,1
7,"I applied for unemployment after 2 months of being unemployed because I thought I'd have a job by now. Quick backstory, I was a teacher but quit because one of my co workers was micromanaging me. I tried to talk to her but she got upset I told her to not micromanage me. She made me feel anxious, stressed, and depressed to the point that I had to drop out of grad school &amp;I work. I have a great rapport with the other teachers and admins but her. 

Because jobs keep telling me that I'm overqualified, I haven't been able to land a job. So I've decided to apply for unemployment after 2 months. They sent me a letter saying they're going to interview me/ask me questions pertaining to my reasoning for leaving. I'm not sure what I should say in order to receive unemployment. 

Any advice? Thank you, much appreciated.",01Jan2017,1
9,"I normally work 5-7 hour shifts in a fast food place.  5 is minimal, but around 7 if I don't take some tylenol beforehand, my upper back (center below shoulder blades and radiating upward and down my left side) aches terribly.

Next week I have a shift that lasts 9 hours. 9 frickin hours.  I'm honestly going to be crying around 8.5.  A 15 minute break is just not enough.  The most I can get away with ""bathroom breaks"" is 2-3 minutes at a time, if that, and I actually lie down on the gross bathroom floor during that time because even sitting up still hurts.

The only real plan I have is to stretch as often as possible, take a 2 minute bathroom break every couple hours, my 15 min lunch in the middle of the shift, and take a few extra tylenols. 

But is there anything else specific I should be doing to keep from hurting as badly or to help myself recover better/more quickly?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",01Jan2017,1
11,"My dad gets mad at many things, and is mad at a pretty small thing right now. I thought he went out the door but was just in the other room, and I was quietly saying to myself how much I hate him, which he heard and came out and said ""I'm sorry you hate me so much"". I said that I was saying how much I hate the situation, not him, and said I loved him and I don't really know what he believes or what he heard exactly. I kind of went off. I feel absolutely horrible and disgusted with myself. This is heartbreaking and wish I could take it back. I am panicking. What do I do now? I do not really hate him, I was just ranting and saying it. I feel horrible.",01Jan2017,1
12,"My husband has two girls from a previous marriage, 11 and 9. Our son is 14 months old. My husband isn't good witb babies and I am ok with the extra responsibility. 

The other day the baby was asleep, so I snuck off for a nap. Baby woke up while I slept and had a poopy diaper. Instead of waking me, or doing it himself he had the girls do it. 

The 9 year old is in the awkward stage where she is curious about human anatomy and sometimes we catch her staring at my son's privates when I change him, so husband and I had agreed to keep her away while he is undressed. 

I am very disappointed in him for 1. Not taking reaponsibility for it or bothering to wake me and 2. For allowing the 9 year old girl who is very curious change the baby without supervision. Husband's excuse was that he figured the oldest would do it. 

I'm not okay with any of it. I am pretty much stuck with husband. My job wouldn't allow me to pay for daycare and he always states that he will fight me for the baby even though he has no desire to be a parent. I feel like now I can't even go take a short nap anymore for fear that he will just neglect the baby or leave his two daughters in charge when he is the adult. 

Do I think the 9 year old would harm the baby or do anything weird? No. Do I think that it is appropriate for her to be involved in intimate tasks like that with a curious mind and no adults around? Hell no.

I don't know what to do. I feel sorry for them and disappointed in my husband. I wish he would have at least gotten off his ass and woken me up instead of leaving two young girls in charge. ",01Jan2017,1
14,"Hi reddit, I know that this is quite insignificant, especially compared to the problems of others, but I really need some advice from people I don't know because it seems as if all the people I do know are a lil bit biased and I don't know what to do so:
College is fast approaching, and I passed the entrance exams of my top two choices.

Here's the dilemma: One university is 1st place in my heart, with my degree program being the one that I really love, with subjects that I am in love with (plus allowing me to pursue the two jobs that I want). It's considered one of the very best in the country, but it's very expensive (especially compared to the other one) and it's far away from home. 

On the other hand, the other university is loved by my WHOLE family (grandma, mom, dad, uncle, you name it). It's considered THE best of the very best in the country, the tuition fee is so low (only about 1/4 of the tuition fee of the first one), and it's close to home. The thing is: I passed at a college/branch of the university I do not want, with a degree that I do not want either (I want to become a CPA Lawyer, and it would only provide me the opportunity of being the second one). If I do go there with the intent to change colleges/branches and shift courses, I'd have to get crazily high grades in my first year (30 units), and even then the process would be filled with interviews and numerous procedures, and I might still get redirected to another degree even if I do pass those.

FUN FACT #1: My dad literally ignored my older sister for a whole month when she didn't pass the second university.

FUN FACT #2: It's a point of pride in the family to pass in the second one, and my mom texted everyone (EVERYONE) right away with the good news, so I'm being spammed with happy messages from family members and others ((even from friends who didn't pass and actually WANTED it)and it honestly makes me feel guilty???)

FUN FACT #3: I actually already decided on the first uni as soon as I found out about the situation with the second, and as I'm actually pretty stubborn with stuff like this, I told my mom right away. She told me to think about it though, and even after a whole week of saying that I'm sure, she is still saying for me to think about it, so here I am thinking about it and as time passes by, the guilt starts sinking in (see fun fact #1 and #2).

So I guess this turned to something like a rant post and I'm really sorry about that :( Whew, that was long, but I really don't know what to do now (especially with the guilt), so I need some advice. 

tl;dr  I got into my top 2 choices for uni and there's a lot of pressure for me to go to the second one that everyone wants instead of going to the one I really love.",01Jan2017,3
16,"So me and this girl have been friends since we were both very little and have been inseparable. We've been BEST friends for about 6 years and still are but I'm always wondering if she's a good friend or not. The problem is she cares too much how other people see her and she will do anything for people to like her whereas I am the complete opposite and do things for myself rather than other people, which doesn't make me very popular. Since about a year ago, she's become friends with all the popular people, most of which dislike me. she mostly chooses me over them and always comes to me when she is upset and I know that she has my back but she lies. A lot. She doesn't care who she's hurting or what the consequences to her lies are as long as she looks good for doing it and then always slags off people who lie. She talks to several guys at once, even when she was in a relationship just because she likes the attention and being able to say she has loads of guys asking her out. 

I am a brutally honest person and will always tell it how it is, even if that's not what that person wants to hear and whenever I tell her that what she's doing is wrong she gets in a mood and calls me a bitch. For example, she's been talking to a guy who she likes although she's never met him in real life and lied about her age because he said he wouldn't date anyone under a certain age and I told her that it was wrong and sh should come clean because it's not fair on him and he'll eventually find out and she stopped talking to me and said she'll think of a lie to tell him with her other friend. She won't let any of these guys go because she wants them all. A lesbian started talking to her and instead of telling her she doesn't swing that way she continued to lead her on when I, who actually does like girls, have nobody. Sometimes she calls me ugly and other times she says I'm gorgeous and she'll always say things like ""more people would care if I died"" which really makes me sad.

Another thing that bothers me is that when the two of us are together she'll rarely take selfies but when she's with her popular friends she always takes them and uploads them on basically every social media. This might sound like jealousy but really all I wonder is if she's ashamed to be my friend? When she does take a picture with me in she'll delete it after a certain amount of time. 

She lied only today when she was with me and said she was going home to spend New Year's with her family but instead spent it with one of the popular people who has kind of had a feud with me for a while. She always says I'm her best friend but I have a hard time believing her because I don't know what's a lie and what's sincere anymore. 

However, a few weeks back we were both at mine and I was feeling rather emotional and I told her all of this, that she could have anyone and is probably ashamed to be friends with me and it ended up with both of us crying and hugging each other and her telling me she loves me so I really don't know.

I really just needed to get this out of my system and for someone to give me their opinion because I don't know how much longer I can take questioning whether or not she's a true friend or not.",01Jan2017,0

I threatened the guy back then but my head wasn't on my sholders, it ended to a cringy apologise in from of people from him, but that didn't mean much healing internally for me. I send some hate messages to the guy last year, blew some steam, although im not angry on myself anymore, i am still very much angry on the guy, i can't seem to shake it. I envision myself beating the fucking living breath out of him many times, even without strong emotional attachment to the vision. 


Now to state this corectly, i got over it somewhere 85% over it. This thing really made me improve on so many fields regarding myself, because i didnt revenge a beating with a beating so i had to rise above it, it took 4 and a half years, but it is still affecting me a little bit and i just refuse to have my life affected by that useless thug. 


Whats more important and what i just now realised it might have affected me is that at the time of the incident i was with whom i saw as the dream girl at that moment, she lost all interest in me afterwards. 


Now my advice is, should i confront him phisically? He was twice my size back then, it's more balanced now. But just the idea of training with such a target it feel very wrong and sickening to me, hatred is not something i like to enfoild myself with and it is not the medium I perform best at. 

What the hell should i do? 


Note: i've been in fights prior to that, won some lost some, didn't affect me much, havent been in one ever since 


I took a bad turn somewhere in my life and it all went to hell, im kinda out of it, burnt, whimping, still bleeding a little, but fucking walking and on my feet, went down hard more times than a man has time to imagine in a lifetime, and i got up, that's what i do, i get up, always did always will, now how can i deal with this?

I don't really have anyone else to go to. 
We met during Easter break in 2015. He's from Australia and I'm from Norway. We fell in love. Kinda.
We've been in a long distance relationship on and off for a while now and we've been exclusive (I thought). First time I noticed something was a bit off and I actually logged into his facebook and saw proof was a few months in. We talked about it and it was all ""good"". Then we kept going as usual, he visited me during the summer and I visited him again during January 2016. I borrowed his phone to check something (because I didn't have access to data or anything on my phone, being in a foreign country) and he got a naughty-looking message from some girl. Again, we argued and I cried and we talked it through. We/I wanted this to work. 
Now it's NYE, he's visiting me in Norway and I'm a bit drunk on someone's couch with him sleeping next to me. His phone buzzed. And buzzed. And buzzed again. I got curious even though I promised myself to trust him this time and leave it. I didn't. It was his best friend from back home, and I started reading through the conversation they've had. Oh boy. My heart is still pounding and I'm shaking and I'm having some sort of panic attack. He's got a girl back home. 
I'm so tired and exhausted. I don't know what to do. He's gonna stay here for three months and the plan is for me to go back to Australia with him. We were planning on buying my tickets today.

41,"I'll try and keep this short, ask for more details if you need to.

I'm a senior in HS and have just been sitting on a couple college acceptances not knowing what to do. I have this view that I want to weigh all my options and try to take the best choice but it's never clear. This has sort of hampered me throughout my life as me being very indecisive. When people have asked me what I want to do I just give a canned response that sounds reasonable.

My sister was in a similar position and she joined the Air Force and lives pretty well now with a husband and daughter. They're both officers (O3) but given how the military just puts you where it wants you I feel she just got lucky. So seeing that, I've put consideration in the military but the loss of individuality and the dedication to pretty much my entire life to the government scares me away from that path. High gain for high loss I suppose? I love the area they live in and they seem pretty happy but I don't know if I'll have that kind of luck.

In terms of regular white-collar work I've thought of IT or computer-related careers especially infosec but that field appears intimidating so maybe considering that path is thinking too far ahead or taking too large a step. Would something like a sysadmin career goal be better for me to consider?

Finally, Reddit loves its high-paying blue-collar jobs. It's really convincing seeing people talk about professions like HVAC, Plumbing, Electrics, etc. But even they have drawbacks and, like I said, I'm indecisive so I don't want to invest into this only to find myself in the wrong sort of life.

I let her know I don't want one but I respect it. An hour later she comes back and says she can't do the break and we make up (I think). I ask if there is anything else she wants to get off her chest and she lets me know that she has a crush on one of our mutual friends, she then asks me what she should do. I tell her I would want to pick me. She then ignores me and doesn't talk to me the whole day. 

That night I go out with a couple of friends, she calls me and is pissed when I tell her I'm out. I'm confused so I call back and she rejects the call. This continues and we eventually make up  (kinda). I'm upset about the friend she has a crush on, and that she keeps going on and on about him. She calls me controlling because I'm upset and somehow thinks that I'm not wanting her to go to a party where he is... (I didn't care because I trusted her). The lates friday, the morning is fine, she says she loves me and its like normal... then she starts hanging out with friends (I'm at work so I couldn't go). I was happy she was having fun! Get a call at work from her basically breaking up with me. She asks me not to tell my parents/siblings because she doesn't want them to hate her. She says she seems a future with me but right now she needs to find herself. Im crushed, but I understand. She says she wants us to act the same, with the same nicknames just without the labels right now... the next day she messages me and we talk, she gets angry at me because one of the friends she was staying with told her I was angry at her and saying she was doing it so she could hook up with the guy she has a crush on. I tell her I never said that, provide screenshot etc.

We talk, she says shes scared I won't love her when shes ready for another relationship (be it days, weeks or months). Now I don't know what to do.... does she want it to be a break up or a break? What do I do? It hurts because shes talking to me like normal... and it hurts...",01Jan2017,3
45,"Where do I begin. So I'm an 8th grader, and I had my worst NYE so far. I know someone who I will call Liam for the sake of the story, and I have been friends with this person for as long as I can remember. About a year and a half ago our Spanish teacher put us at a table together, with two other boys that went to our elementary school (I am in middle school). We didn't know these guys too well, and they were what were considered the popular kids. I was a pretty popular kid myself, I was friends with almost everyone. My friend Liam and I slowly started to develop a relationship with these two guys, and Liam invited them to his birthday party with me and a few other guys. Is been about a year or two since we all became a friend group, and my life completely changed for the better. I started to notice that Liam and the one of the other boys would hang out on their own, which was cool because our group of 7 boys would hang out on our own a lot, but it got very noticeable that they were becoming very good friends. I was always invited to parties and involved in everything, but all I see now are pictures of those three guys on Instagram together, and whenever I ask them if they want to hang out, they always answer when they are done hanging out together. Now the worst part, is fast forward to tonight, NYE. All over Snapchat is videos of almost every other ""popular kid"" in the school at a party at this one girls house. Yet I had no idea it was going on. Nobody who was there answered my snapchats until after party was over. I just sat there with my drunk parents and the rest of their drunk friends at their friends new years eve party, with my sister and her friends group. I went down to our family friends basement to charge my phone, and I was alone, just viewing the snapchat stories. I gotta be completely honest, I sat there and cried for a solid 10 minutes. I dont know what is happening, If im doing anything wrong, or what they think of me, but I definitely think I'm slowly losing this great friendship I had, and I'm especially worried about my relationship with Liam. I had to fake a smile the entire night, until I found a room alone and sat down to play guitar to try and get my mind off of things. Im not having a good time right now, and I don't know what to do about this whole situation. If there is anyone that could help me, your advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",01Jan2017,2

It usually happens near the ball of the heel (just behind the toes)  and and the section right after the ankle. I've pretty much lost hope.

I think the reason it was blocked was because I had a period where I had to report a couple of posts that seemed to break the rules of the boards (slightly NSFW stuff for the most part). My question is, are there going to be any further troubles due to this or is it going to just be, I'm an annoyance, I'm blocked, and that's it?",01Jan2017,2

But the rules are very tedious here because my step father is a sheriff. My girlfriend and I have been dating for a week now and we have been talking for over 4months. She is offering me to allow me to move into her house and live with her and her parents. I would not have to pay rent or anything I can just live there. I have a job that pays 10$/hr and getting a minimum of 24hours a week. So I can easily pay for my insurance for car and phone.

57,"I am a grandma who loves her granddaughter immensely. She moved out of her mother's house because they didn't get a long and she was emotionally abusive to her. I took her in and I didn't mind it because I felt bad for her. She's 20 now and moved in with me around 17/18 years. The first 6 months to a year were fine but I was noticing the behaviors that probably made her mom upset. She is very lazy and doesn't help around the house. I ask her to unload the dishwasher and while she does it takes her a while to get to it. She does have ADHD and stopped taking medications years ago because they made her anxious and sick. So, her memory isn't the best. Possibly anxiety or some other mental problems. She has told me she doesn't mind helping around the house it's just she's not used to it because her parents did everything for her. Also she feels in the way and anxious so that's another reason why she doesn't pitch in. She struggled in 11th grade with her grades and teachers have emailed me that she refuses to do her homework especially with Math because she has always struggled alot with Math. Not only this but the teachers have also stated that she is very uncomfortable at school and refuses to make eye contact. The counselor call me and told me she was wanting to be called AJ which I found strange. She's always hated her name and to this day talks about how much she hates it and that to doesn't feel like her. She told me she gives up on everything because she's tired of failing. She ended up taking Summer school for Math after 11th grade and worked hard to finish it. I'm proud of her and all. While all this was going on I was noticing her wardrobe was changing drastically. She always wanted to wear boy clothes and cut her hair like a boy. I don't mind her looking like a tomboy but now it's gotten to the point she doesn't look like a girl at all and refuses to wear anything associated with girls. In 2014 she worked for her dad and did a good enough job but many people made comments about how she looked like a boy, her work clothes were boys. They even mentioned how she slouches and pulls her shirt away from her chest. I've been noticing this as well. She's always done this actually even when she was younger. Getting her to fix her hair and wearing dresses was a battle. I put her in a dress and she kicked and screamed. She's always been a tomboy but it feels a bit extreme. When she was a child she got upset when she couldn't play with the boys or their toys. Her Halloween costumes were boys most of the time. Same goes for her birthday parties. She didn't mind girl things but preferred boy things. Playing with girls she was rough and wrestled them and I had to tell her that was a thing boys do. She cut off her hair when she was about 4 years because long hair made her uncomfortable.
Anyway, now that she's 20 years old she doesn't work or go to school. I've confronted her on it and she's told me she's anxious and doesn't feel like herself. She wants to live on her own but she says she's afraid and feels stuck. I understand because she struggles with doing basic life skills like cooking, laundry, ect. She feels like she can't thrive in life because she feels... ""wrong"" She always cuts herself down and says she wishes she could have a straight body and no curves, and a few times I've washed her clothes and found some black tank top and this thing was very tight looking. Another time I found a sock in her boxers. I never questioned her about it. She's very secretive on her Facebook account and hides a lot of things from me, in general. I have a daughter whom she talks to a lot and really acts friendly and social with. While with me she does do the same but gets very moody too. She has no passions or interests. Nothing motivates her. I found out a while ago she was lesbian from her mother. I'm upset by this and it does disgust me. Once I overheard her using her webcam and talking to an online friend and she said to them that she wishes she could live life but she feels fake. Now she's coming to her asking for birth control because her periods are too heavy and disgust her. I'm sorry if this sounds insensitive but I don't want to deal with her anymore. She's 20 years old and needs to get it together. Her cousins drive and she doesn't even do that. She's too scared of her ADHD and anxiety interfering. But I'm frustrated that all my grandchildren are living their lives and trying to be successful and make something off themselves but this one. Please help a grandma out I'm desperate.",01Jan2017,2

66,"Long story short. Ever since my teen sister befriended an older girl on the net &amp; now IRL, things have been hell. I'm the last person to throw around the term SJW but there is no other word to describe adolescents who have stumbled onto social theory and take it as pure gospel. This girl is the kind who thinks kill all men crop tops &amp; listening to &amp; consuming the 'right' kind of pop culture will begin the revolution. Family to her is an accessory you can discard if they don't have the right views. She hates me because she knows I don't like my sister spending time with her. She is a severe alcoholic with a ket addiction and is very sexually irresponsible. Point this out to my sister and you will be called elitist, judgmental and slut-shaming. As if our family is 'problematic' for pointing out how my sister's grade have suffered greatly since meeting this girl. The pure irony is my previously middle class in their own country but now broker than broke immigrant parents idolise education &amp; push my sister to essentially escape the hood but it's her white friend from a two home owning family who's telling her they are too strict &amp; regressive. I say white because this girl will literally reel off stats for women of colour in hostels &amp; prisons but advises my teen sister to run away from home because she has a curfew before exams. By her own socially conscious logic, what do you think will happen to my sister in the real world?


I'd love some advice on how to demonstrate the selfishness of this girl to my sister or any words really on how to deal with over-zealous youth.

69,"I'm currently a physics/applied mathematics major, but I've recently started feeling as though I'm not as invested as I should be. When people ask why I'm in this major I feel like I have to make something up. I had no defining moment in my life when I decided to follow this path, and in fact, I feel as though I didn't choose it at all. 

My parents didn't force me into this path and were in fact quite adamant that I should follow a different path, so I know that I *must* have chosen this major for myself. But there wasn't any reason behind it. Finishing highschool was like waking up in the middle of a game of chess with it being my turn to make a move, and not knowing what else to do, I just made a choice and made my move. Now I'm starting to think ""hang on, I never made the choice to play chess"". 

At every point since then I have had to make more choices, and I just make the choice that will serve me the best later on. I do enjoy my major and I have never gotten anything less than an A+ in any of my classes, so it feels stupid to be doubting my position here but I never really chose this. It was all arbitrary and I can't help but wonder if I would find more life purpose in something else. 

Given that I only have one year left of my degree, I don't *dislike* my major, and I'm doing so well, should I just stick it out and see if my passion comes back? Or has this ship sailed, and is it time to cut my losses and try something else? I don't even have anything else that I'd want to try. I originally wanted to go into medicine but I found that I actually hated the subject after trying a few classes. My life seems entirely defined by a lack of emotional investment in things.

75,"Ok so I am 17 (girl) and my boyfriend (16) and I have been dating since the first of October. He's my first serious boyfriend and I love him more than anything.

I don't know why the f... I thought again about this party now and started overthinking although I never thought about it before, let alone as cheating. It's just my stupid brain.
Basically I'm at UNI and my bf is still in HS and at the end of October I went to a uni party without him, like a small gathering with people from my group. 


The problem is, when I'm drunk, I like attention. A guy in my group had hurt me physically not on purpose (passing by) and I was like ""ouch you really hurt me"" (bc I tend to over exaggerate when people hurt me physically or when I hit myself on something, just by reflex and also because I wanted attention or I wanted to make him feel sorry idk) so I got a hug from him and I was happy to get attention. Then two other guys also did the same (well the three of them were running in circles in the middle of the small room and they're really bulk so...) and I got a hug from one of them and the other one was like ""idgaf that I hurt you"" although he had really painfully stepped on my ankle, like all I wanted was a ""I'm sorry"". However, I than had a hour long conversation with the first guy and mentioned my boyfriend in it several times so he could be sure that I was already taken in a way of ""hah you're showing interest but I already have someone"" (yes, I am an asshole to people when I'm drunk). And we were all like ""group hug yay"" and all hugged once more.

So were these hugs cheating ? Why do I still enjoy attention from other people ? They were demonstrating attention to other girls from my group so I guess I was jealous but I did not in any way want more than a hug. Is a hug cheating even though I love my boyfriend to death, even more than when the party took place (we were 2 weeks in the relationship, now we're 3 months in and going steady) ? 
I told my boyfriend about hugging that first guy yesterday (when I randomly remembered that) but I told him that when I'm drunk I'm like wanting attention and hugs from everyone yet it's nothing compared to his hugs and most of all his kisses and that is true and he was sad because we're far away from each other for the holidays and that hearing that I love him that much made him want to see me even more. 

And is it normal for a girl to enjoy attention from guys although she's in a relationship and loves her boyfriend to death ? 

TL;DR : I hugged and enjoyed having guys' attention at a party. Than I insisted on the fact that I have a boyfriend. Is that cheating ? ",01Jan2017,0

83,"Like the title says, I'm having trouble making sense of things. Especially when reading, I can comprehend the individual words, and even entire sentences, but not the entirety of the script. I have to reread sentences repeatedly just to make sense out of them. It's like things just aren't... clicking.

I love reading and it's been a long time hobby for me, so I can say with certainty that this is not normal. I've since started subconsciously applying a mental filter to whatever I read, so that I gloss over the information for only the necessary details. It doesn't really fix the problem, but it does let me ignore it.

It doesn't just affect my reading, but it is when I am aware of it most. With reading, besides affecting my enjoyment, it isn't too big a deal because the story moves on regardless of whether I understand it. What *really* has me worried is that it can cause huge problems when it affects things that absolutely require my comprehension of a situation or new concepts.

Additionally, my memory in general (both long term and short term) has declined to the point where I am constantly forgetting things. I'm also having trouble keeping logical thoughts in my head. The things I think seem reasonable and rational to me, but if I think about them a bit more or try to voice them, they start seeming irrational. I'm pretty sure that it is all related.

I understand wanting her own space, I get that. My problem is that when I wake up from a night terror or a flash back a lot of times being alone just amplifies my reaction to what my dreams had me experience, deep terror often sets in, crying, shaking, general panic attacks happen too-- that's one of the reasons why we joined up rooms in the first place-- I'd end up crawling into her bed every night with her because I was consistently waking up terrified. When I'm in her room, even in my own bed, if I wake up scared, usually hearing breathing from her, the fans, the snoring will usually help me calm down and lull me back to sleep or at least calm me down enough to avoid panicking. I'm scared to be alone during sleep since it's probably the part of the day I hate the most. 

What's worse is that she hates when I crawl into bed with her, she knows why I do it, but she hates it because she wakes up sore.

86,"Hello, I have worked with a Franchisee of Tim Horton's for about 2.5 years. I am 20 years old turning 21 in one month. I also am receiving methadone treatment for my well documented battle with addiction.

Starting mid November my parents left me in charge of the house and my sister for 3 weeks, the day before they left my Methadone doctor had also switched my anti depressant to a new brand of anti depressant. This chain of events causes me to miss about 3 days of work without calling in. This was because I was sent into a severe depressive episode where all I was doing was sleeping and never leaving bed. I was hardly getting up to even go to the washroom. After the 3rd no show they asked me what was wrong. I told my manager that I should be taken off the schedule because I was very scared that something was seriously wrong with me and I didn't want to keep letting them down before I got a professionals opinion. She then told me the health inspection was the next day and there was no one to replace me. Her expectation was that I would be on time for my shift, and work the full shift.

I went in the next morning like she asked me, I was very sick because the depression caused me to also miss my treatments for the past 3 days as well. I worked for about 4 hours before the pain and depression became too much. I was visibly very sick and not once did the manager ask what was wrong, because she did not want to have to send me home. I must admit I was scared to approach her and tell her that I was sick so on break I left for my house. At that point I think I had an emotional breakdown from the buildup of emotion and methadone withdrawal. 

Later that day I awoke from my nap to a text saying ""you must return your uniform, and your last pay cheque will be issued two weeks from friday."" During this entire process not once did I ever receive a written notice of any sort. I guess I can count the conversation where she told me about the health inspection as a verbal notice, but even then she did not come out and say that I was close to termination.

All of this took place one week before christmas, making christmas a very difficult and sad time. Due to me trying to work that last shift I also had missed the treatment that morning causing me to restart the program, so I had to go through a month of pretty serious methadone withdrawal. I have attempted to speak to a few paralegals but not one has called me back. The one lawyer I spoke to said to call paralegals, so that did not help much. 

Does anyone have advice how I should proceed, or if I even should attempt to proceed to get any sort of termination package or entitlement. I am pretty desperate for money to stay on my feet as I start to get out and find a job. Sorry for the wall of text, but if someone could help me I would appreciate it.

Or how do you feel being called ma'am? Or do people refer to you by something else?

The whole time he just asked me questions about myself and what I liked.  When the song ended he looked and me and smiled, saying ""thank you"".  I hadn't noticed that he was sweating until we separated, as he started to fan himself with his shirt if you know what I mean. Also at a party before his, he asked me if I was coming to his party, I said yes.  Then right before we danced at his party I said thanks for inviting me.

94,"So I'm going to just restart my life. I know people will tell me that ""I've gained so much from experience that you aren't restarting"", but I truly am restarting. 

- I went to school and got an associates degree. The plan was always to continue on for my bachelors but I just can't afford it and nobody can co-sign a loan for me. In high school I got accepted to every 4 year school I applied to except one, but they all happened to be too expensive so I just didn't go (the most affordable one rejected me). 

- With my associates degree I've managed to get a couple of office jobs but they've been very hard to come by. Even at that I don't enjoy what I'm doing and I can't see any real advancement just looking at the people above me at these companies. They do the same work I do just with more meetings. It isn't dead end but it just isn't fulfilling or meaningful.

- I've let all my friends just basically slip away over the years. I live in a place where it's a lot of work to meet people and do new things. Not only is it a lot of work but it's expensive. It isn't a super long drive to these places but the average commute is about 40-50 minutes.

My awful plan right now is to just find a job for whatever I can, get money, and move to a city. As for my career I really want to do something in video production. I have my heart set on a specific company but realistically I know it's an extreme long shot. I've been editing videos and learning motion graphics but I don't really know how to advance other than just doing it for myself for free and hoping somebody takes a chance on my portfolio some time.

The worst part of every single day for me is when I go to bed and my thoughts just fly through my head. I feel like I never have enough time in the day to teach myself something new while also trying to make it a career at the same time. For every idea I finish, I write about 10 more down in the meanwhile. From the minute I get into my bed to the minute I fall asleep (which can be hours) I toss and turn. It's been really hard for me to just shut this drive off and enjoy things for the last 6 months.

I'm sorry for a long ramble/rant but I was hoping people could give me better course of actions/plans. Maybe people who experienced the same feelings? Thanks!",01Jan2017,3
95,"So last night I was at a New Years party and I was sitting down when a girl approached me. 
We started talking and actually were talking for hours. Although I was aware that she had some to drink so I knew not to take full advantage. As we got comfortable she starting getting more physical such as always kissing me on the cheek, when we were isolated she flashed her boobs at me. 
At this time I knew that alcohole would have taken effect into this so I didn't escalate it. 

Although we shared some personal stories and so I started to like this person. She was beautiful personality wise and physically. I told her I needed to go see my buddies and I will get back to her in 20 mins. I kept my word and 20 mins later I found her on the couch in the party throwing up with 3 extra cans of double black that she finished. I did look after her, got her water and comfort her. 
Her friend took her home while I didn't get the chance to get her number or anything like that. 

idk if I will see her again so what do I do now?

97,"Background: I am a 19 year old female, I used to live with my dad but now I'm away at university. My parents split when I was very young and my dad has no SO, he lives alone.

Firstly my dad is an in-denial alcoholic. He drinks at least a bottle of wine/whiskey everyday. Despite this he manages to hold down his job and drive two hours to work everyday - very dangerous. I've tried confronting him about the drink but he denies it's a problem. He has diabetes too.

Over the last two years I've been suspicious that he has a cocaine addiction. He frequently goes to visit ""Dave"" the neighbour late at night to ""drop a DVD"". I've seen people on coke and I suspect at times my dad has been under the influence - although I haven't seen him use directly or seen any coke paraphernalia.

Yesterday, New Year's Eve, I returned home (my dads house) much earlier than expected. He looked very surprised to see me and kept himself busy in rooms where I wasn't. He was drunk and I suspect coked up. I'm not sure how often he's been doing it but I'm pretty sure he's done it on random week nights too.

Please help! I'm pretty sure I should confront him although I'm not exactly sure how? I don't know whether to consult my mum about this. She's very good with advice and knows about his drinking (I suspect one of the reasons they divorced). That being said she's completely against drugs and I'm not sure how she'd react to this. I've also thought about contacting my dad's ex but I feel as though I would be betraying my dad going behind his back.

102,"Hi reddit. One of my friends is the same age as me (27) and is gay. I have absolutely no issue with his sexuality, have a few friends who are gay and have never been against it. Pointing out his sexuality straight away might seem a little odd, but I'll give it some context. 



He has only come out to a few people in his life (Not his family) so he doesn't like to talk about it, but I've started to notice a trend emerging. In about 2008 he befriended a guy who was about 15 at the time (He would have been turning 19 that year) and ended up coming out to that kid which ended the friendship. He said he didn't have any romantic interest in the guy but apparently they had a big falling out, which made me think he kinda did because he insisted on buying stuff for him and playing games with him 24/7. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but in the last month I've begun to notice a few things.



He follows and occasionally tweets at a 15 year old kid who has a bunch of subs (Nothing creepy but I just found it very strange). I thought ok bit strange but whatever. Then I find out this year he has been hanging out with a kid who is 17 a lot, playing games and catching up and going to the movies. It made me think he has always been keen to come and watch my little brother when he plays football (My brother is 12 years younger than me). For instance he will drive 45 min just to watch my brothers game with me which I find kinda strange when he continually offers, I mean I love my brother and hope he does well but even I don't show that kind of commitment to his sport. I feel like an arsehole for saying it but the first thing that came into my head when I put it all together is that he is a creep. 



I feel bad for him because he struggles with his sexuality a lot and also has a lot of weight related issues, but I can't get it out of my head that my friend is into really young guys. I feel terrible for saying it because he is a really nice guy to me but I need some outside perspective on this. I just have these two voices in my head, one says he is a creep and the other says I should feel bad for even thinking it about a friend.",01Jan2017,31
103,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating almost 6 years since high school. It's been on and off but the last two years we have been for the most part, great! 

We started living together together almost exactly a year ago and it's been good. We have our ups and downs like every relationship but rarely argue. 

There's one problem that's bothering me. It's nothing I would end the relationship because of but it worries me. I'm not sure how to deal with it. 

My girlfriend has emetophobia which means she is terrified of everything to do with throwing up. It could be her, me, anyone else talking about it or doing it. She has severe panic attacks to the point all she wants to do is cry. I understand, I've done research and learned people with phobias can't control how the feel and act.

Recently I was sick and threw up at work. I came home. She wondered why I was home early and explained with the least information possible. The nausea was coming and going so I knew if I was about to get sick and even told her. Before we went to sleep I felt pretty much like I hadn't gotten sick at all. 

All night she was shaking and couldn't sleep. She explained her heart was racing. When I touched her to try and make her feel more comfortable she would jump and tell me not to touch her. I didn't do it again and tried talking to her, telling her to take deep breathes and try to think of positive things. I even gave her some examples of what she could think about and got a giggle or two but it didn't help. 

I have some anti-anxiety medication to help me sleep and offered her one because I really hate seeing her like this and she couldn't sleep. She got sort of defensive and said no very firmly. I understand people who have had drug problems may get defensive like that but she has never had any related issue.

I don't know what to do and it makes it so difficult when I'm sick that I have to deal with this. I'm also worried when I am truly sick and need help from someone, she won't be able to help me. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",01Jan2017,1

114,"
I've been dating this guy, lets call him Phil, for a couple years now. I'm almost 9 years older than him and we live together. It has not been easy. He's never really had a gf before, and there have been times when he just wasn't there for me when I needed him. I started dating him a month after my last long term bf Jeff and I broke up, who I was never really over. It didn't end well with Jeff and all our friends chose his side.

The biggest issue w Phil is that he is addicted to smoking weed, does it all the time, is high all the time, and sits around our apt (which is in my name), high, playing video games. He never wants to go out or do anything. He has a secure full time job, but there's no chance for him to move up the ranks, and he's pretty content making $40,000 per year, which is fine, except that he can never afford to travel with me. He makes just enough to get by.

I joined a sports league and found my coach, Mark, really hot, and he was flirting with me from day 1. The flirting became heavier and heavier, and things were getting rough with Phil, I was growing frustrated with him by the day and was planning on breaking up with him and giving him a date to move out of the apt. Mark and I started spending a lot of time together...first with friends, and then alone. Mark told me that he and his wife are separated after she cheated on him. Mark and I began making out and fooling around, and I started to really fall for him.

All this time Phil, my boyfriend, didn't know what was going on, he was just working full time and getting high every night. I wanted to wait until Mark could commit to me before I broke up with Phil.
Mark suddenly started acting distant after maybe the 3rd time we fooled around at his place, and I found out that he was also going to the movies with another woman on our team.
That weekend I visited a gf out of town and I felt bad because I sulked the whole time and started at my phone, talking about Mark the whole time we were out. Mark eventually sent me a text saying that he just wasn't ready for anything serious, even though he liked me. I was devastated.

I went home and told Phil everything, and begged him to forgive me, which he did, right away. He said he understood and wasnt even angry, he just wanted to stay together. Thing is, he's back to smoking weed everyday even though I've begged and asked him to stop, but he lies about it and comes home high everyday, and I don't even think I'm in love with him. But I can't afford to pay for my amazing apartment on my own and I don't want to get a roommate. I could air bnb it but I don't know. And I don't want to move because I love my apt. Also, the thought of getting back onto the dating scene at 40 just depresses me!

Thoughts? Thanks.

I went out with a few pals last night for NYE. I was having a great night until something happened. Some woman was really flirty with me and whispering some dirty shit in my ear and how much she wanted my D. Most guys would definitely go along with it after a good few drinks and obviously in my pretty drunken state I lapped it up and went along with it. 

We went to some quiet side street and started making out before she grabbed my D and I followed suit... literally. 

She had a dick.

She looked and sounded feminine as fuck. I genuinely couldn't believe it. I had to get the hell out of there so I said my goodbyes and went home because I felt sick. I've heard and laughed at people who've had similar stories in the past but I genuinely never would've thought it would ever happen to me.

I graduated with a honours degree in business and management 3 years ago. 


Following my graduation,  I applied for anywhere and everywhere.  Ended up working in a major IT company on their graduate scheme. Last year of the graduate scheme I found myself a job within the company as their knowledge manager. Kinda created the position myself as they had very little documentation management. 


The problem is now,  I feel stuck. This is not what I wanted to become...  I feel like an electronic librarian,  my job consists of managing documents, putting them through an approval process, controlling access to the documents,  and soon will also include capturing resolutions from incidents. I make just under £30k per year. A comfortable amount for the job I do, but I feel so unsecure with all the redundancies happening around me. I also have a graduate working under me now too but I get a new one every 6 to 9 months. 

I really want to move.  The thing that matters most to me is job security, and a minimum of £20k salary ( my wife is on a visa stand I have a financial requirement to earn 20k or she is at risk of being sent back) I do however feel afraid of taking a big pay cut, but there are no bonuses or pay increases in the company I work for at all,  for anyone,  for the past 5 years plus... 
 


My real skills are creativity and work arounds. I'm really good at finding a solutions to problems,  or improving on existing solutions,   but this is one problem  I can't think of a way out of.

So at first we didn't look at each other but then as I was in the party I bumped into my ex. Deciding to be the mature one I smiled at him which caused him to smile back at me which I thought meant that at least we could be civil.

I didn't take anyone's side as they were both in the wrong, however, my boyfriend was very upset with me that I didn't take his side.  We all smoothed things over and everything went on fine, until the other night. 

After some nagging and arguing, which is very unusual for us, we ended up at a local bar on his side of town.  My brother was in town with some friends, as well; and as I live cross country, I wanted to spend some time at the bar with my brother.  We were having a great time all together, my boyfriend was buying my brother and his younger friends some shots and we were dancing and enjoying ourselves.  Towards the end of the night, my boyfriend grabbed a beer out of my brother's friend's bucket.  The friend jokingly told my boyfriend that he couldn't take the beer.  My boyfriend definitely took this the wrong way and immediately went on the defense.  Mind you, my boyfriend is 32 and my brother and his friends are 20-22 years old.  So an argument starts to break out between my brother's friends and my boyfriend.  I tried to pull my boyfriend away and tried to calm him down.  As I was pulling him away, he told me it was over between us since I ""wasn't taking his side"".  All I was doing was trying to pull him away from a fight.  He then proceeded to tell the bouncer that one of kids was under aged.  I asked him why he was being so malicious and petty and to just let it go, especially since the age gap is 10 years!! Seeing that I had just been dumped in the middle of a bar, I called a ride to leave the bar.  All of the guys got kicked out of the bar.  As we were all waiting for rides, my boyfriend asked me to go home with him.  Since he had just dumped me, I refused and went back home alone.  

The next day he texted me to send back the Christmas gifts he got me and send him money for some other gifts he had gotten me.  Of course, this began an argument between us.  Basically he told me what I did was unforgivable since I didn't take his side...still not sure what that means.  And he told me I should have gone home with him since that's what partners do.  We don't live together, I have every right to go back home and he had dumped me anyways! He also told me that he dumped me in the heat of the moment and that he didn't really mean it. 

Anyways, my parents and brother were ecstatic that we broke up.  I love this guy, but how he was acting was incredibly immature and can be known to be a hot head.  All he could keep saying was that I didn't take his side even though all I did was try pulling him away from what almost became a physical altercation.  Was this just a drunken fight that I should brush off? Is it worth trying to save this relationship? I don't want to say I know I could do better, I'm not sure what I'm holding onto.  Please help.

145,"I'm not sure I can take it anymore... i've been married for 18 years and I really enjoy my wife's company. She is the only girl in the family for the boys so she really says Uncle or gives up. She keeps fighting. Over the past three years her 30-year-old son lives with us. He came home and can't quite seem to get himself together to leave again. She and him spend quite a bit of time bonding, watching television, going to museums, and doing things you do with your child who was An adolescent or so. I really hate that but he doesn't have the motivation nor does he have the money to move and she protects him. She and I get into arguments quite often about his using space and not really being able to pay for it. For the past three years we've probably made love. eight times the same spoon position with me fingering her to conclude it. Our foreplay gets into stuff like don't touch my face I've got cream on it, don't lick me there because I just Peed, don't touch my breasts they're not called titties. All of this conversation frustrates me and I just kind of roll over to the other side. After she has an orgasm, She then begins to comment about stuff like ""did you pay the insurance bill?"" Needless to say I go flatline emotionally and physically to the point where she believes I am ED. She's even told my doctor and he has given me a prescription for Cialis. I'm not ED I just don't get excited anymore. In the past year I joined a website where I meet a lot of women and I'm able to connect with maybe three of them on a regular basis. One of them even wants me to become exclusively hers. I'm really enjoying the fact that I'm able to satisfy not only my needs put the needs of someone else. I really love bring a pleasure to a woman and I'm able to kiss which I haven't been able to do with my wife, snuggle which is about all she wants to do and have great sex. I've already committed to this new lifestyle and I really can't afford to get caught.

146,"My wife has recently been laid off and when I come home from work she doesn't make food or clean the dishes. Doesn't take the dog for a walk. Doesn't do anything. She just demands that I jack off Infront of her.

We haven't had actual sex in over a month. She just watches me jerk it. It's gotten to the point that my penis is sore and I'm thinking about going to a urologist due to throbbing pain.

She quite literally does nothing all day until I come home and take it out. And lately she doesn't even get undressed. She used to pleasure herself as she watched but now she just watches... fully clothed. And it takes longer and longer for me to finish now. I masturbated Infront of her last night through an entire episode of game of thrones.

When I cum she also refuses to clean it and calls it her ""gift"" and that I'm not allowed to throw it away. There are spots in the rug where I finished over a week ago and the dogs started to sniff/lick them.

I can't talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid what they'll think of her. It's been a hard year for her. Her father passed away early 2016 and he was her only living relative.

I tried to just get her to watch porn but she insists it has to be MY member that she sees. Other phalluses make her anxious apparently. She says mine has a ""friendly face"".

Her fetish is the direct cause of my recent bout of groin pain. So I'm really not sure how can avoid mentioning it to the doctor. I'm not sure what he'd suggest other than therapy which I can't afford now with my income alone.

I've told her recently that I'm too tired and sore to do it after work but she literally started sobbing when I refused.

I bought really expensive anal lube so that I stay moist as long as possible but it makes such a mess. Also the other night when I finished my hands were so lubed up I couldn't turn the door handle of the bedroom and she refused to help open the door. She just stared at my penis as I frantically twisted the doorknob.

I'm concerned about her mental health. I feel like she only cares about my penis. I'm basically an object to her now. She won't even cuddle anymore. I just don't know what to do.

Is there a mental disorder for penis obsession??",01Jan2017,56
149,"There's this girl I work with. She is the same age as me and we've talked a lot at work. And recently have been talking somewhat outside of work. She's really nice and I like her I'm just awful at talking to girls I like in a sense. When we're at work it's fine because we talk about work stuff. I know she's single, so I feel I may have a shot. Last night I asked her if she wanted to chill and she snapchatted me back saying that she was babysitting. And she showed a picture of the kids so I know she isn't just blowing me off. I'm just not sure how to go about talking and making plans with her. I'm a ""Nice guy"" and it sucks sometimes lol. 

I think she's into me. She laughs at my stupid jokes. So in a way I feel she's somewhat into me.

For instance I'm a pretty insecure person, I sometimes talk down about myself and she'll immediately tell me to stop because ""You're a really great guy and the bad stuff you're saying simply isn't true."" We compliment each other a lot too and sometimes it can even be a little cheesy.

Example:

""You're such a cutie.""

""Am not!""

""Are tooooo!

""Nuh uh!""

""Uh huh!""

^^^We've done that to each other btw, it wasn't just one sided.

She'll tell me how much she cares about me and I'll tell her how much she means to me. The other day she wanted to get super drunk because she wanted to forget the problems she's been having. I told her she really shouldn't drink (I felt lame for saying this but I didn't want her feeling like shit later) because she'd just have a bad hangover and that I didn't want her to get sick afterwards. She ended up drinking some but not much because she told me she wanted to listen and not get drunk just for me. I told her I was really proud of her and she loved hearing that. 

She'll tell me I'm such a sweet guy and she'll always tell me how cute I am. Of course I deny all that and tell her she's the real cutie around here. We've told each other we really mean a lot to each other.

And last thing, lately when we text each other we'll always put a heart at the end of the message.

Examples:

""Heyyyy ❤️❤️❤️""

""Goodnight ❤️❤️❤️""

""What are you doing ❤️❤️❤️""

155,"This is somewhat complicated but bare with me.

Background Info:
I am a second year student studying Mechanical Engineering (at University of Houston but will transfer), and My girlfriend is also a second year student studying Chemistry and Economics (at Yale).

We have both known each other for years and are very compatible as we were both friends before we started getting romantically involved. (Since I know there's going to be that person who says ""you're young you don't know what's happening"" assume we're a perfect match for the sake of this thread)

So I'm a US Citizen but she's a Romanian, and her student visa has been extremely limiting. It only gives her a limited amount of options for work which are either working at Yale (in lab work), or using a certain time allowance called OPT that allows her to work an internship (which she'll be doing for a financial firm).

Working at Yale is pretty much enslavement (had to last summer), they make her work 70 hour weeks for a menial salary.

There also has been pushback from my parents regarding an earlier marriage, not hers though.

Pros:
If we married and she got a Green Card, she would be able to work as much as she wants, anywhere she wants. We'd be able to join bank accounts and start our savings earlier, she'd be able to get permanent residence and citizenship earlier on (which allows me to work more jobs that regard national security, as I'm sort of in aerospace this is a field I flirt with a lot). Plus anything else you guys can think of!!

Cons: My parents have pushed back to some extent (depending on the conclusion I come to from this thread I may decide to try and reason with them). Being in a marriage where I can't see my wife most of the year for two years will obviously not be easy, it's already hard enough with her being my girlfriend. Plus anything else I haven't considered already!!

If you need more clarification just ask! Other than that thank you!!!",01Jan2017,3
156,The company i work for has grown quit rapidly in the last few months. Im an intern and work directly with one of the production lines before and now 4 months later into it. I clash heads with alot of people at work because i feel morally obligated to do what best instead of just personal gain. Since this is such a new company it has grown lopsided and almost all the new hires for engineering and production are the managers and seniors personal friends. Which i might add are not great at what they do. I kind of turned my head for a while but its starting to turn for the worse. The production numbers are not where they should be. But figures since everyone who works there are personal friends and dont feel the need to prove themselves or work hard. Someone who is personal friends with the manager told me im about to get a pay cut for no reason. Mostly because im not buddy with them and they would rather hire another friend. So keep the story short. There are 3 drug dealers in my line now. Who leave and sell drugs during work hours. Also a racist manager who prefers african americans over white people. Last 4 hires were african american. And they have been altering production numbers for my CEO. Once he hired a person over finances i have noticed and logged many anomaly's that ive noticed with numbers rising higher then what we actually produce. I know this since im the one that actually logs this and was staying late one day. They were there and told someone to do  my job who isnt trained for no real reason that came up to me and asked me how to do it. I wondered why they didnt ask me and went over there to show them how it works and noticed they changed everything and hoped i wouldnt notice by getting that person to change the sheets which would happen if they knew how to do it. Im kind of dumb struck since i believe the HR knows what going on and if i tell someone i possibly wont have a job shortly after. ,01Jan2017,1
158,"Hello Everyone,

Firstly, sorry if this is inappropriate for this subreddit.  Obviously a lurker still new to Reddit.  Also, not looking for pity here, I genuinely don't know what to do.

29 years old, currently have an incredibly well-paying job.  However, I have been a socially inept ""incel"", and I have low intelligence.  Self-taught in IT at a (very) young age, hence, I was able to work with a very useless Bachelor's and Master's.  Any success I enjoy is purely luck.

Born to very poor lower class white family.  No friends (male or female) between 15 - 25, harassed and bullied constantly.  Between 23-25 lost 70 lbs. of fat, found a wonderful job, moved.

Was coaxed into drinking an driving in order to socialize within the first few months of taking on the new job.  Only went to a bar twice in my life (no money for cabs or drinks, no point in approaching women when you're unemployed white trash living with parents).   Took the risk, got a DUI immediately.  No one harmed, no crashes.  Didn't realize I was over the limit, told emphatically to never trust a breathalyzer (so I didn't).

25 - 29 used as a scapegoat and tortured incessantly over this.  Wasn't fired because it was too expensive to replace me and too amusing to coworkers to constantly humiliate and berate me.  Obviously no friends or social life as I worked late and weekends in order to survive.

Over the past few months, by sheer luck alone, I managed to become promoted.  Now I'm looking to rebuild my life, but I honestly have no idea where to start.  It's difficult to explain my situation (I don't discuss my DUI), and being constantly ostracized and ridiculed for being poor, white, and stupid from 15 - 29 isn't a socially acceptable explanation for why I have no friends and no interests outside of work.

Recently tried MMA training (I love it, but time is a factor), and attempted music (I'm terrible, not certain if I should bother continuing).  I'm obviously desperate, and I will definitely put in the years I need to in order to rebuild my life.  I just can't afford to lose another 4 years.

Let me know if I can find some way to incentivize responses (giving gold?).  I'm not looking to leech time from sincere users.",01Jan2017,8
159,"I graduated high school this year and honestly I don't know what I want to do. I decided to go to university and take a commerce degree. In my opinion, what I will learn from a business degree will help me regardless what career path I choose. I'm interested in finance, so over the next summer I plan on applying at banks branches all over. Hopefully I will get some roots set in banks or business' in my area. I'll make sure they know I'm a uni student who's interested in that field of work. I am doing this also so I can learn about the field of work too (I'm very ready to learn). I'm aware I'm taking a risk, but I'm working as hard as possible for this. Am I crazy for doing this? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Side Note: I had a recent encounter with a bank branch owner who's successful and owns his own branch. He told me that my business degree is useless and I shouldn't try. He said that they only care about business students from popular universities like Harvard or McGail. I politely thanked him for his information but disagreed with him in every way. It made me just want to try harder and work harder to prove him wrong. 

I can't help but have self doubts. Maybe I'm just some ignorant student who doesn't see that it won't work out for me. On the other hand, my lack of confidence could be clouding my judgment to see the path to succeed. Any advice would be great. Thank you.

160,"TL;DR: Got lot of things in mind, anxious and with adhd, need help organizing my thoughts, tasks, remembering what I gotta do and working smarter.

Fellow Redditor's,

You know that cliche phrase: ""get your sh* together""? Well, I'm in great need of help getting my shi* together.

I'm a very anxious person, with a little bit o adhd. Lately I've been fighting against depression because things seem to get harder the more I work towards getting them done, like a debt my mother has that I'm trying to help her pay and work stuff.

In September '15 I started working at a big four, which isn't a great deal and most people think its just like any other work, but unfortunately, the area I work at have the exact amount of workers so that there's no one unassigned to a client, but the problem is that I *always* work alone, so it's a huge load of work, little to none time to finish, a lot of things to remember, more than 2 clients at once to deal with, evidences to gather, documents to submit... the list goes on.

At the beginning, I thought I was forgetting things because I was still in college (graduated in November '16), dealing with personal stuff and working, but I keep forgetting things and losing my deadlines.

For example, this past week was the last week to finish auditing a client. I still had to ask them for evidence, follow procedures and test them, document the evidences that I got, document the procedures and the tests, submit a couple of documents to the HR, find different ways of asking for the evidences that the client didn't provide yet, report the work to the manager, talk to the manager about the half-day off we got for New Year's, plan my 3 years anniversary with my girlfriend, help my mother make a financial planning, find someone to put extra locks on my apartment's door, because a lot of thefts happened recently, and other things that I can't remember anymore.

I didn't finish the work on the deadline, so I worked 12 hours on Friday, I didn't talk to the manager about working from home due to hour half-day off so he got mad at me (gladly we are friends and he didn't scold me), I only thought about different ways of following the procedures and tests on the last couple of hours available at the client's office, I only got time to finish planning my dating anniversary when driving home, I completely forgot to see the locks to my door and I forgot to submit the documents to the HR so I got a disciplinary action...

Sometimes it seems I'm not qualified or I don't have what I takes to work at where I work, and whenever I think I want to find a better job or get my dream job, I get really frustrated because to those things. Sometimes the engagement manager asks me what I did all day that I forgot to do something, and I feel like trash.

I'm getting really tired of forgetting things, having to work my ass off when getting close to the deadline, not achieving the work quality I strive for. Seems like things are never good enough, that I should always give more than I have and still, what I give is never enough.

I really need help organizing my thoughts, my tasks, remembering what I gotta do and working smarter. I already read a couple of articles from Medium and I'm freaking tired of those ""X amount of things to do to get successful in life"" lists.

Can anybody give me a hand here, please?

After I finished school i moved away from home because at that time I wanted to study law. Sadly that wasnt possible in my hometown so I had to leave. I moved out late sommer 2015. 
All my friends stayed in my hometown. Since law school is pretty tough and I have to manage a part-time job aswell I can only visit my hometown 2 or 3 times a year. I initaly assumed that this will lead to me slowly losing most of my old friends and getting Like super engaged with the people of my new home but what actually happend was that I havent lost a single friend back Home but also made new friends Back Home while visiting during the holidays. Its incredible everytime i come Back Home I have a blast and Just generally a great time.
Point is I Just really love my people Back Home.
Compared to that things arent bad in the city where i live now but just not on the same Level. I have fewer less deep friendships which are simply way more complicated, not as nerdy and with fewer shared interests. Don't get me wrong I Like my new friends and I really value the advanteges of living alone and actually beeing able to do what i want (which is mostly Debatting, gaming and eating). 
Also i recently realizied that my interested in law is pretty small so dropping it wouldnt be as big of a Deal. I am thinking about studying something else anyway.
What am I suppoused to do? Maybe I was just underrestemating the time it takes to actually feel at home in a new city and i simply need to wait but in the other hand I really need to come to an conclusion since studies are expensive and i fear that i might waste my time. 
TL;dr: Moved away from home, realizied how much i Love Home while also enjoying living in the new city but for very different reasons. Also studying law isnt really important to me and i think about switching. 
Has anybody ever had a similar experience and can Tell me what they did? Any advice?
Thank you all!

Im quite well known and liked at my school, any tips on how to make him feel better about himself.

175,"I did pretty well in High School, graduated with a 3.6 gpa, 28 on my act, lots of AP classes. Got accepted into every school I applied for, but ultimately decided on the one nearest to my home because I got a lot of scholarships to it for being local and could live with my parents so no paying for room and board. Its a solid school but they didn't have the major I wanted, which is either software or computer engineering. I ended up settling with Biology and secondary education licensure. First semester I did well, and the start of second semester I was doing well too. Then I got cancer and had to withdraw from some classes. I chose to not withdraw from all of them because the classes important to my major were too crucial and would put me back too much so I thought I could maybe scrape by but got 2 Ds which was under the required grade of a C to pass. Well, that continued into this semester were I did poorly again, trying to balance school, work, and my health. Ever since I officially beat cancer I decided I wanted to do what I actually want to do  in life which is become a computer or software engineer. Unfortunately engineering is the hardest major to get into and since my poor grades I feel like there's no hope for me getting accepted into another school as an engineering major. Is there any chance for me? What would you recommend I do?",01Jan2017,9
179,"So i'm a 28 year old male and at the minute I'm training for a job that i'm not sure I want. I'll be qualified in June and then I have a guaranteed job for life. 
My issue is that I'm really not sure it's what I want to do. I have an interview for another job this week in an industry that i'm very interested in working in, however, the benefits and money aren't nearly as good and i'm not too sure what opportunities there could be for further advancement. 
I'm very conflicted about this and yes, i'm aware that I might be crazy for walking away from a career with a very good guaranteed pension. I'm just not sure it's something I want to commit 30 years of my life to. 
Any advice is really appreciated. ",01Jan2017,2
184,"I'm currently a junior in high school and was wondering if I should switch schools halfway through the year. I go to a small private Christian school with less than 100 kids. I'm thinking about switching to a public high school with thousands of kids. The reason I want to switch is because teachers at our school are barely qualified, we are desperate so we had to hire a teacher with no teaching credential to teach music last year. We currently have a science teacher that has only taught kindergarten level. And our AP literature teacher that has only taught middle school. I'm paying thousands of dollars in tuition for this and I feel like I'm not getting my education for what I'm paying. I just feel like there are more opportunities at a public school, and more life skills that can be learned. For some reason something is still holding me back at the private school. Like I want to stay for some reason. I have a lot of close friends and if I leave most likely I'd lose them. I'm getting decent grades at this private school. I'm close to the teachers. I just don't know what to do at this point. ",01Jan2017,0

188,"So, the other day I was perusing a certain sub on this site and pretty far down, clicked on video and right away recognized a girl in the video. ""Amy"" and I were good friends about ten years ago and I actually set her up with a friend/roommate of mine. They broke up, but she and I remained friends. She has since married and has two kids now and our friendship has somewhat drifted, although we do still stay in contact and text back and forth every couple of weeks.
Anyway, this video is her with another (MF) couple. It's very racey and no, I'm not going to post it on here, so please don't ask. While she is (was) a bit on the wild side, I can't see her doing this - but no doubt it's her. The video appears to be several years old, is in no way a professional production and I could honestly see where she may not even have known she was being filmed - the camera never changes angles and nobody in the vid acknowledges it at all.
So, my question is - should I ask her about it? I want to so badly, but don't know how to approach it. Everyone else I have asked has told me to just avoid it and never bring it up, but in the event she doesn't know, I feel like I should clue her in. Just don't know what to do...",01Jan2017,4

190,Basically I'm 18 and studying electrical engineering and I'm really hating it now and don't want to pursue a career in it anymore.

193,"So I was at a new years party, we were all really looking forward to it. I planned on trying to get with this girl I have liked for a long time now and maybe get lucky but halfway through the night when everyone had quite a few drinks one of my best friends was all over the girl I planned to get with they were cuddling on the sofa and didn't really leave each others side the rest of the night. I was upset and angry at him however I didn't say anything because I didn't want to start an argument or maybe a fight as we were a bit tipsy. I don't know if It was just a drunk night out and it didn't mean anything but he knows I like her and I feel betrayed. So should a say anything to him or her or am I just over exaggerating and maybe it was nothing. I really don't know what to do.

Any help appreciated thanks in advance. ",01Jan2017,1
194,"Just made a throw away account for obvious reasons but feel like I need to get this off my chest.

For New Year's I decided to fly across the world to stay with my girlfriend and her family. Shes originally from country ""Y"" and I'm staying with her and her family for a week.

So everything has been going really well with me and my gf and I've never felt closer to her. She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. Anyway we end up going to this couple's dinner over at her child hood friends house to eat with her and her boyfriend. So just the 4 of us.

Everything is going really well all night, another couple shows up, we all plau card games, I was having a wonderful time. Towards the end of the night my girlfriends childhood friend leans over to me while everyone else is busy talking etc, and tells me that her boyfriend (lets call him Steve) and my girlfriend have a past and that she thinks I should know.

At this point I've been drinking and I don't know what to say (my gf and Steve have nit heard this conversation)

I get up to cool off because at this point I feel very isolated as I'm the only person (in a room of 4 including myself) that didnt know about this. It hurts. I decided not to say anything until I get a better opportunity so about 40min later I say something to my gf (lets call her Laura).

Lauras first reaction when I ask about this is to say it wasn't anything big and happened a long time ago and that she didn't even think about it which is why she didn't mention anything. She says they just made out and nothing really happened. I think what bothers me was how she immediately dismissed the situation which I think is what started to eat at me all night. Anyway, 15min later Laura and I talk again and she apologies for not tellikg me.

Fast forward another 30min later and I thr combination of drinks and festering turns to me blowing up on her in the room at this house we are staying. Which then gets the attention of her childhood friend (lets call her Stacy)

Stacy, Laura and I then proceed to have an argument downstairs where I essentially just lose my shit. Im screaming, crying, blaming and overall acting like a 15year old about the situation (I'm 27).

I was too drunk to remember everything other than the fact that I felt so bad and apologised to my gf Laura after we went back up to the bedroom. I embarrassed myself, my gf and most of all made a big deal about something I shouldn't have and made a mess out of the new year. Laura and I talked today and have figured everything out but I feel so bad about the situation its a monent I feel I can never make up for.

Laura has been so hurt By this I can tell and I feel like I am in a place where I self sabotage. I dont know why I was so rude and why I tried to hurt her feelings and be so upset about everything.

In general im feeling ashamed and so disappointed with my behavior. Does anyone have any advice?

I told Laura I was sorry and that I want to personally apologize to her friend for my behavior before I leave, but I feel like this is something ive just fucked up so hard on.
