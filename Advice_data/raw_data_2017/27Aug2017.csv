0,"We've been dating for 10 months and I want to surprise her by shipping her something from amazon or something, what should I get her?

My mom suggested getting her an Air Force sweatshirt and I was maybe thinking getting her a Frank Ocean shirt because we both really like Frank Ocean and listen to him a lot. I'm more than open to things other than clothes though!

tl;dr: What should I ship to my girlfriend as a surprise?

2,"Well i was looking at a MoonMan video a couple of days ago. ( to be specific it was black lives dont matter part 2. ) and there was a comment of a 10 year old girl that triggered me. She said this 'Wtf is this shit. Anyone who hates on blacks has tiny little brain. Learn some sense of humour 😷😷😷'. It triggered because every now and then when i see the news and i see something bad that a black person did i might think to myself something racist. Is that bad? Am i stupid? And another part is that now every time i see a black person on the streets, or on TV, or on YouTube i think to myself if im against this person for being black. I do not know what this means and i need some advice for getting over it and for every time i see a black person not to overthink the situation that they exist.",27Aug2017,0
4,"Okay, so I started going to my church's youth group about two years ago.  I made friends and got settled.  My older brother started going and hit it off with this cute girl.  Later, I find out that one of my guy friends (I'm Female, 21) told her that everyone was talking bad about her, isolated her, and tried to make her feel like he was her only friend.  He was going for a prince charming kind of rescue thing, I think, which is super messed up, because the girl had problems and needed support.  And I know this isn't just my bro's girl talking him up as a bad guy, because she was smart enough to tell the Youth Leader, who got the guy to leave her alone and confronted him about it.  One of the leaders even messaged me, asking if anyone had tried to isolate me or make me feel unwanted in the group.  At the time, I didn't know that my ""friend"" was the predator.  

However, now I know that he has a past of isolating and flirting with women, the latest being my brother's girlfriend.  It feels awkward, because he's confided that he feels shut out of the Youth Group to me and comes to me for advice.  At the beginning of our friendship, I was VERY assertive about never going to be in a relationship with him, so he has never targeted me that I know of, but now I worry that I'm one of the only ""friends"" he has left.  He walks by me in church and pats my shoulder -which I really don't like, but I don't want to make a scene.

Thing is, he doesn't have many friends.  He's a cancer survivor.  It feels like he needs friends and support too, but I don't know what to do at this point.  The relationship feels toxic and I want to back away, but I also don't want to compromise this guy's mental health because he really wants a girlfriend, was torn up by my brother dating his target, and doesn't really get social cues or how to make friends.

TLDR: I found out that my guy friend targets women to make them feel isolated and disliked so he can have a better chance at nabbing a date.  I want to pull out of the friendship, but I don't want to abandon a person who has few enough friends as it is.  ",27Aug2017,3
5,"so basically I came into a friendship group not that long ago, I'm not sure if you had seen my last post about a boy but basically the gist of it was that I was catching feelings for someone i didn't know if i should have been and how he was being a bit of a f***boy. 

what my friends failed to tell me was that this boy had lost his virginity to a girl in this friendship group and it was after a breakup she had of 2 years. He caught feelings and she didn't and it wasn't until he started chatting other girls that she had caught feelings, she then felt hurt and then started chatting other guys. 

Recently those feelings he had for her have come back and she has actually found another guy that she is really crushing on. Where i come in, in all of this... I don't know but I know that I still have feelings.

With him he never opened up to people, the other night I made him and since then he won't leave my side. I don't mind that at all because I'm there for my friends no matter what but he's doing the little things again that I feel are giving me hope when there's not, an example would be was when we where all getting drunk and we where talking about turn ons and offs. I had mentioned when guys kiss on my neck that I like it and even though were sober he will do it to me on the odd occasion and he knows it gets to me. 

At the same time as doing all of this he will get serious with me and talk about the girl he has feelings for so I am confused as to whether I try again or not... 

whats your guys opinion on this? do you think I should try and get his feelings off her and on to me?

6,"For the last few years, I keep getting these thoughts and feelings of being creative. Doing something other than what I've done for the last 10+ years. By that, rather than channeling my free time to video games, TV, movies, and reading to something that helps me express myself and have something to show for it. 

I want more out of life than what I've been doing. But this is where I come to you, I get these thoughts of 'i wanna create something', but have no clue how to tap into what it is I want to make. Then comes the motivation part, I'll see what someone else made. Feel inspired but beat myself up and walk away because of personal/limitations I may have.

Ive dabbled with all major art hobbies trying to find that one thing that just clicked and felt right. But nothing stuck out, the closest I got to feeling like I was making an improvement was with photography, but the expenses and limitations of my personal finance and not being able to ""get out there"" hold me back and either I am making too many excuses or maybe that's not the right thing for me. 

To shorten this up, get to the point. What advice do you have for a guy who is just wanting to be creative, to make or build something? Also how do you find the motivation and/or inspiration to do a hobbies/creative outlet you do? 

I'm sorry if this post is hard to understand or whatnot, it's rather hard trying to word it in a way that makes sense to a vast majority but also gets my thoughts out. ",27Aug2017,2
7,"Okay so by law in the US if you work full time (40 hours per week) your employer is required to offer benefits so far as I understand it. I work for a pizza place and I am the only full-time employee other than the GM. I am a delivery driver and I work Monday-Friday 10:45 am-8:00 pm. I'm about to turn 26 and can no longer be covered under my fathers health insurance at that point. I am almost certain that if I approach the owner and request benefits of a full time employee she will just tell the Gm to stop scheduling me for 40 hours each week as opposed to giving me benefits that she is required by law to provide. Is there a way to approach her about giving me benefits without her cutting my hours just to avoid paying for what she's required to? Or is my best bet to simply find a job that will be honorable and provide benefits like they're required to? I enjoy what I do and I bring in about 450-500$ each week just from tips so I'd like to keep this job, I just can't see a way to keep doing what I'm doing and get benefits that I have to have by the end of the year.",27Aug2017,2

11,"This might be long and a bit scattered... I became friends with this person years ago, and I thought we were really good friends. I mean, they listened to me at times and seemed to care about me. (but they did that to everyone) I empathized with this person and their life story, and it became a thing that helped us bond even more. I put up with their outbursts and their dramas because I believed that this person could change, they looked willing to change, and they were in a bad spot. They sold me dreams of how they want to change and be a better person yadda yadda, and I ate it all up.

Occasionally, they would show me a kind of friendship that seemed deep. Unlike anything I've ever had before; most of my past friendships have been incredibly shitty and unmistakably toxic. This one was somewhat different, so I felt that it was special. What a fool. The things is that they would do this with everyone, but they'd tell me that they're extroverted and they like to help people. I brushed it off and was like OK. I always had a weird feeling that this person would talk shit about me behind my back (and they did gossip with me about other people, red flag). They'd also treat me a tad bit differently when I was around with her other friends, sometimes even teasing me and crap...but hey, it's all good fun, I guess. They would also dump all of their problems and negative emotions on me (and others), but hey...they listened to me...and good friends listen...SIIIGH. The thing is that they did it in a way that felt incredibly heavy and overwhelming, and dumb little old me carried it for years.

They had the most toxic and mediocre people as friends, and would regularly have them over to our house even though they knew how uncomfortable they made me feel. At first I protested, but hey, I can't force someone to not have friends over. So I put up with their shitty friends coming over regularly which put me in an even more negative mind space.

They would also refuse to do their part with house cleaning and would leave dishes lying around and pilling up disgustingly, telling me that they will clean them eventually. The excuse was that their parents would force them to do housework and now they are resistant to it...and that I can't change them to be how "" I want them to be"". You know, neater and more responsible. Everytime I'd bring house work up since they house was uncomfortably cluttered and stuff, they'd lash out at me and we'd argue for a long time until they apologized and changed a liiiitle bit. They'd always bring that up...""you know I changed from where I used to be"" and of course I'd feel bad to say that it was not enough...because it wasn't. I was still forced by her anger to live on THEIR terms and never mine...given an illusion that I did something because ""they changed a little.""

They'd get themselves into trouble that they themselves caused and refused to see it. They'd blame everyone but themselves. They'd throw tantrums overtime someone told them the truth to their face, and proceeded to call these people evil.
They would always be in financial ruin, and I helped them a few times since we were living together. They still owe me over 1,000 dollars and I don't know if I'll ever get them back tbh. It's been 2-3 years since that...

I feel gross, used, and pathetic for falling for this person's trap. I became their accommodating door mat. I'm glad I realized, but I feel exhausted now. I somehow deluded myself into seeing the good parts of the friendship (someone that listened to me and seemed to support me) and completely filtering out the quite obvious abuse and exploitation....

Now, I think it's rather obvious but....do you think I should just go ahead and cut this friend off? Even though I'll feel guilty as crap since they're in such a negative and potentially suicidal space (caused by themselves)...? I'm so confused after years of this crap.",27Aug2017,1
12,"TLDR: Friend is becoming MGTOW; he blames women for his inability to get a partner, thinks women can't be trusted, and is ready to give up relationships altogether. But I think he's the problem. How do I get through to him?

Hey everyone, would appreciate some advice on how to help a friend deal with rejection in relationships. He's in his mid 20's and has never had a girlfriend, and the more rejection he encounters the more cynical he's gotten about finding someone, to the point where he's ready to give it up altogether.

This is where MGTOW comes in. He's mentioned that over the past year or so he's been interested in Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW). If you're not familiar with this, it's an online community of men who have denounced having romantic relationships with women, especially marriage, as they see women as untrustworthy, manipulative, and forcing men into subservience. They feel similarly about friendships; they don't believe women are capable of having a true friendship with a man, since women are selfish and shallow, and will only take advantage of the man... you get the picture. 

He blames women for his inability to get a partner. Since finding out that his feelings are shared by this online community, he's just further convinced himself that women are the problem. And he's definitely starting to resemble more of what MGTOW stand for - he's talked about how women are gold-diggers, that he can't see himself getting married because even a pre-nup isn't enough security, that he feels he can't know a woman won't just leave when things get tough, that women are complete wildcards and overall can't be trusted.

But honestly, being a close friend of his for so many years, the reason he can't get a girlfriend is him. He's obnoxious, he has a hard personality to get along with (I would even describe it as abrasive), and he has little self-awareness and empathy. It's always easier to blame others rather than being introspective. 

I want to have a big chat with him, but I don't know how to go about it. I don't respect the MGTOW ideology, and I'm disappointed that he's going down that path. But at the same time, he's clearly become hopeless over something that he used to wish for a lot, he seems to have really low self-esteem now, and as his friend it's hard to see him so cynical about it all. So, do you have any advice on how to best get through to him? (Thank you for reading this long post!)",27Aug2017,26

23,"I'd like to start by saying we've been close ish friends for the best part of 2 or 3 years and he has came out as gay to me which I was fine with.A few years ago he tried to kill himself due to having no close relationships.

It started a few weeks(about 2 months ago) after he said he came out as gay to a few friends ,I had been doing one of the shitty confession things (17 year old) on Snapchat.He was the only person who had seen the story(1 or 2 in orning) and put something on the lines of ""You are perfect and wonderful,don't change"". I just ignored it and didn't think more of it.

Last month a few friends went to a theme park together and me and the friend went on a rollercoaster together that requires you to sit almost like you are riding a horse together. He seemingly jokingly wrapped his arms around my chest initially but it made me feel very uncomfortable so i made him stop for the duration of the ride.

A few days ago one of his other close friends told my girlfriend that he found it very arousing to be around me on the rollercoaster and found that he was almost orgasaming by the end. I found this incredibly uncomfortable and I'm stuck with what to do. We go back to College a week on Monday and I don't know what to do as I'm one of his only friends.He also knows that I am straight and has met my girlfriend on multiple occasions.

One channel made a video about the other channel and then the other channel tried to copyright the one channels video. The one channel deleted the video but since the one channel is bigger than the other channel the other channel is being harassed and the other channels message is fading away. So the other channel makes a video on the one channel where they accuse the one channel of doing this on purpose. So the one channel comments to try and defend theirself. The other channel accuses them of lying and say for the one channel to not talk to them again. The one channel gets triggered and says for the other channel to mention their name on twitter. This is basically causing more drama to me.  I comment on the one channels tweet saying for them to stop as it causes more harassment for the other channel. We get into an argument and in the end they accuse me for making this about me when I never said that. I contact the other channel saying to ignore the one channel and to not talk to the one channel and im afraid that they think I turned against them.

46,"I'm very angry so this post is going to long because I feel like ranting 

TL;DR 
I don't want my roommate to have her boyfriend over and I need her to start cleaning up her mess. 

I am a 24 year old female who just got a 30 year old female roommate. 
I actually rented this place on my own for the last year and I was just fine but she got into a rough patch. She moved into my city for her new job and at first was on her parents couch but ended up living out of her car. 

I offered her to move in as long as all the bills are split in half and she had to have her rent money her first pay day of the month (I have to pay by the 3rd) 

I gutted my office/spare room and made sure she had her own space.  I let her use my $60 blow up mattress until she could get a bed of her own.  

I have two dogs. One is stranger aggressive. 

When she moved in it was under the terms that she pays on time and cleans up after herself. 

It's almost a month now and of course there are problems. 
She didn't pay her rent on time and I gave her a break and said she could pay half on her first pay check and the rest on the next one but that next month if she doesn't have it she is gone. 
She leaves her dishes in the sink for weeks at a time.
She also does not put her dishes up once they are dry. 
She eats like a 5 year old and leaves food mess on the placemates. When I clean it and leave it on the rack to dry she eats on my wood table and doesn't bother to grab a mat from the other side of the table. She left a wine stain ring on my table like this. 

She leaves my stove and counters a mess after she cooks  
These things I feel like I have the ability to sit down and set some ground rules on. 

My big problem right now is she wants her boy friend to be able to stay over. 
However in the past and recently she has proven to me that she does not make good decisions when he is around. She like loses her mind. 
In the past when we went out drinking I let her crash here sometimes he was with us but they would stay way over into the next day and make out on my couch and pretty much dry hump each other. 
I addressed that and she said it won't happen again but recent events make me doubt her again. 

On Monday  I told her my mom was coming up for the weekend and that I would be watching her dog for a couple of weeks. My mom is a neat freak so I asked her to pay extra attention to cleaning up after herself especially towards the end of the week.
On Wednesday she tells me her car is leaking so her boy friend is going to look at her car. She doesn't ask if he can stay she just says ""Don't worry we won't be weird"".  I reminded her my mom was coming and that this was not the weekend for him to come over.  She was upset and insisted her car NEEDS to be fixed. She said she would drive to his place but she has no gas money. Eventually I compromise and say ""My mom is coming on Saturday at 10am. He can come over and stay as long as he is out before 10am"" 
Friday comes around. She usually gets off at 8pm and I get off at 4pm. She ended up not having to go to work because of the hurricane. I come home and I don't see her car but I see his truck. I'm concerned because my dog needs to be muzzled. He tolerates my roommate but he does not let her touch him. I message her and ask if she is home and if she let her bf in. She says they are in her room. So I said ""So you let him in the house with my dog not having a muzzle"" she responds "" Oh I tricked him into going outside so it's all good."" I go in my house don't see my dog. What she meant was she closed the doggy door and locked him outside in 90 degree humid heat with no food or water for who knows how long so he also got rained on.  I am fucking livid. I told her she should of told me he was coming early I would of gotten someone who can touch him to come over and muzzle him or I would have gone home for lunch and done it.  
So when he cools down I muzzle him and leave to my step moms bday dinner. When I come home my roommate cooked dinner for her and her bf. There is red sauce all over my kitchen wall and and stove and counters. Caked on dishes in the sink. French break and it's crumbs dumped on the counter and they are having sex in her room. 
I clean up and go to bed and fall asleep once they finish (Paper thin walls I can hear both the moans and the sound of someone humping on a blow up matress). 
The next morning I get up. Get some last minute cleaning done. It's about 9am I message her say he it's about that time. They decide to have sex again. 940 am my mom is almost here. I'm knocking on the door and I'm like he needs to leave now! They leave. She is all pissed off at me.

Right now I'm half like I want her gone but I know I'm just pissed off. 

I really want to tell her she is not allowed to have her boy friend over anymore.  I don't bring men to my home (granted im single right now but when I wasn't I still didnt)  and I don't think she should either.  
 1. It puts my dog at risk and the person. 
2. I work and got to school full time. I feel like I should be able to come home take off my bra and wear my booty shorts and relax in the living room watching Netflix and I can't do that with him staring at my nips.
3. She doesn't make good decisions when he is around
4. That's my fucking mattress and sheets he is jizzing on. 
5. They don't just stay together for one night. They do it from Friday night to Monday morning and sometimes they skip work to be with each other. I have to deal with it the WHOLE time. 

Is it fair for me to say no boy friends in the house? 
Also I am wanting to establish cleaning rules and assign cleaning responsibilities to the kitchen and dining room (not the living room because I know my dogs are the ones making the mess there) and splitting the cost of cleaning supplies. 
I'm not sure if that makes me sound like some kind of house nazi.


TL;DR 
I don't want my roommate to have her boyfriend over and I need to her to start cleaning up her mess.

47,"Little back story. I was in a pretty serious motor accident a while back that required trauma surgery. They removed a portion of my skull to relieve serious swelling and pressure on the brain. Since then it's been difficult trying to process thoughts, ideas, get words out, things of similar nature. One of my biggest problems is reading. I'm not illiterate or anything but being able to process whole books really takes its toll on my head. I picked up Stephen Kings It the other day and sat down to read it and 10 pages in I felt like I just took a SAT test without studying but still trying to pass with flying colors. I feel like because of this I'm missing out on a lot of amazing literature. Same thing with reading out loud. I can't read and speak at the same time to well and it's embarrassing. I avoid it best I can but my younger siblings love when I read to them. Again doing both at the same time exhausts me. I've worked with different therapists, both speech and occupational, on trying to overcome this but it's always the same answer, ""practice and you'll get better"". I've been practicing but nothing has gotten better. I feel like perseverance will not work with this problem I'm having. What would you guys advise to help me overcome this, if at all possible?",27Aug2017,1
48,"So I live in a college dorm appt.

I was here for the past 3 months. There was another person living with me then.

This month a new roommate moved in. The landlord told me that I would have to settle the bill for the 2 months (Jul + Aug) with him.

I had already paid the landlord a certain amount for before that (May - Jun - partial Jul).

 He (new roommate) came and asked me to settle the bill.

I made the mistake of asking him to directly give me the amount he wanted me to pay. He gave me an arbitrary amount written on a piece of paper. I asked for the bills. 

He came up with a page on his phone with 2 duration cycles like:

1.) date - date : amount

2.) date - date : amount

He gave me another amount, this one larger than the previous one.

I know that proper utility bills have usage history and an address. 
I think he have just put together a random pdf instead of the bill.

I should have clicked the link on his phone when he was showing me the date-date amount usage to see if it lead me to a proper bill.

Edit:

He's saying that since he was here for at max five days of the billing cycle so he's only paying that much, I can agree with that, but all I want is to know that I'm actually paying the real bill instead of an amount written on some random pdf. I'm used to from the previous roommate, giving me a real physical bill (which would be delivered to the house itself).",27Aug2017,1
49,"[17F] Recently I left work and kept wondering about this guy that I had talked to a couple of times there. I never really had a huge interest in him but I was curious about the attraction I felt towards him and how I was so close to him every time we talked (i dont have much experience with guys and im usually not attracted to the this way). He's a cool guy and I like certain things about him, it's just I don't know if I really liked him like a crush. Or maybe i did and i just can't admit it, that's what confuses me, but usually i would know. the thing is that he was a stoner so maybe i didnt want to like him?
I only started to really think about him towards the time I was about to leave work. 
I kept obsessing over it afterwards, but the thing is that i obsess over things like this and I dont have many friends to hang out with often and to distract myself - so I dont trust myself with these kinds of things. . 

I kept asking Reddit and my friends until I got the courage to message him online and eventually after we went back and forth a bit, I asked him to  a movie to which he said he would but he was starting osmething with another girl. 

Now i keep obsessing over it because i feel like it was completely unnecessary for me to have done that. it really hate that i did it because i didnt even have a crush on him. i feel embarrassed too because he might have found it weird that i was messaging him even after i stopped seeing him.. Do you think it was worth doing it? Why do i feel this way..",27Aug2017,1

53,"From a very young age, I knew of my dads infidelity because he would BRAG to me about it. ""In the navy I screwed so many people"". ""The prostitutes in so and so country were incredible"". ""My friends wife wanted to run away with me"". He would say my mom is gross (she's actually a beautiful saint) and compare her to women we'd see in public. All this while married to my mom. I carry the guilt with me from early childhood to this day wondering if I know something she doesn't. When they got a divorce it got worse. He told me things that were way too personal and used me and my siblings as pawns against my mom. My dad would get drunk and make up paranoia riddled stories about everyone and everything. 

In every relationship I've ever been in, I've been a paranoid jealousy wreck. It didn't even occur to my until I started going to therapy last year that my dad drove into me that no one should be trusted. He even would tell me he doesn't care if a guy cheats on me because its not a big deal (he even told my husband this). I ruined a lot of friendships and relationships over this. I'm now married and moved far away and this is a consistent problem in my relationship. I come up with wild stories in my head to convince myself that my husband is cheating on me when there is no proof or reason whatsoever. Thankfully my husband is patient as hell while I work through this. I'm so afraid of being cheated on like nothing else. I'm riddled with anxiety constantly over it since we now work together and I see him (innocently) interacting with female coworkers.

54,"So this may get confusing but I'll try and not ramble as much as I can. 

Up until three days ago I worked at a gas station up the road from my house. This is middle of nowhere Alabama so it's a rinky dink little place. The manager has recently started doing crystal meth even at work and the job became unbearable with her running it. The owner was a foreign dude who while cool and all doesn't understand English as well as he should and seems to turn a blind eye to the rampant theft and mismanagement. 

Well three days ago I had enough and quit. I went this morning to pick up my paycheck which should have been for 35 hours at 8.00 an hour. My check was there yesterday, hung up in the office as normal, however this morning it was replaced with an envelope containing some cash. According to my coworkers the manager showed up, somehow cashed my check through the store which is something we can do however WE have to sign the back, then took nearly 80 dollars out claiming I owed on my store tab. 

I have several witnesses in my coworkers proving I owed $20 even on said tab, as well as witnesses attesting to the fact she herself cashed my check without consent before removing money. The only ""proof"" of my alleged debts are receipt slips and not the special store tab slips usually used. 

To make matters worse she is also refusing to allow me to have ANY of my money until I return my key, which I did the day I quit though she claims it to be an old key that doesn't fit... even though I only ever had the one. 

I've spoken to the owner though the language barrier was harsh, and he referred me to his business partner and co owner instead. He claims that he will have this issue sorted Monday morning but I honestly do no trust him as he has already ripped me off himself by denying me overtime pay in the past. The main owner is in Italy for the next few weeks and as stated the manager is wasted most of the time and actively hostile towards me since I quit. 

My question is if they continue this nonsense to I have any legal options? Even if they do give me my check and pay stub, if they keep funds from me claiming I owe them is that legal?",27Aug2017,1

my youngest brother can be sassy and a bit bratty but he's a very sweet kid. he annoyed my dad today during church so as soon as we got in the car my dad threatened to kill him (in the church carpark, irony i know). he told my brother ""next time you ignore me i'll smack you so hard outside that people call the police and put me in jail and take you to foster care, and then i'll strangle you. my family members have died before so i'll get over it, you're an insignificant speck in my life"".

obviously absolutely shitty stuff.

he's done this before- i remember last year for some reason he told my brother to hang himself and you can tell in his tone that he is serious and not playing. 

so obviously i feel awful for my brother, no kid should have to hear that sort of abuse, its awful, especially at his age where he's not well liked in school as well, to just hear constant negativity is awful. 

i'm not sure what i can do though. i'm a bit ashamed to say but my dad intimidates me as well, and i'm scared to stand up to him because i do take his threats of violence quite seriously. 

he cheated on my mum last year which hugely scarred their relationship and my mum is still unsure if he's faithful to her - she's said before that she wants to leave but she doesn't have the money to do so and is worried about how she'll be seen - since most people we know in our city are my dads family and friends (my mum emigrated here from overseas). 

i'm in my last semester of uni, i wanted to take a break and do some travelling but in the car i thought that instead what i should do is get a full time job and earn some money so my mum can separate with my dad and i can get my brother out of this environment.

I don't believe he is clinicaly depressed however, he had two legit narcissistic/borderline sociopath parants who treated him and his brother like shit as kids because he was an accident. David exhibits narcissistic tendencies too, e.g. he thinks he is a genius because he solved a hard logic puzzle in our 7th grade class and excelled at mathematics (all credit to him but this was 5 years ago now).

He flunked highschool however because he 'didnt feel like it' and doesn't have a concrete plan to go to college either. When I ask him why, he ALWAYS never gives me a straight answer or flat out ignores me. In the rare moments when I do get him to talk, he goes back to saying he's a genius and that he **could** do whatever he wants but rather choses not to. His only clear goal he has stated to me was that he wants to fall in love and settle down but part of me doubts it. He's 20, never had a girlfriend, socially iscolates himself, never moves around or exercises, has no career goals, plays video games religiously, and spends most of his time vegetating  on his couch and browses Reddit for hours (even during movies and conversations).

74,"NOTE: I DID NOT REALIZE HOW LONG THIS POST WOULD GET. WHAT IS THIS ABOMINATION THAT I HAVE CREATED???

This might get a bit controversial, so yeah, read at your own risk, i guess? I'm literally just venting everything out in this post, so it might seem like I care too much about simple things. This is literally the only topic that I treat in this way. This doesn't really affect my life - it's just an inconvenience. 

So I'm what someone would consider a homophobe. I mean, I won't hate on a gay person or hurt them, but I feel uncomfortable with the fact that they are. I do not support homosexuality and I do not think it is normal. I see it as a choice (i.e. you are not born gay). I also do not like the fact that there is so much support for the gay lifestyle despite people absolutely hating them not too long ago. And don't get me started on the people that call this ""progress"".

Wow, that paragraph made me sound like an ass, didn't it?

Now that I got that out of the way, here's the actual question. Whenever I meet someone in real life, the internet, or even a character in a book or game, I look at their personalities first, and think of sexual orientation later (way, way later). Sometimes, I find out that that person is gay, or could be gay. I immediately flip out and enter an almost never-ending stage of denial, where I search for every possible clue that the person is straight. If I find real evidence for that, then I feel extremely relieved, and never think about it again. If not, then I stay in denial for a long time until I get tired of it and finally accept it. I continue to like that person/character, and I ignore the gay stuff. That, however, does not change my view of homosexuality at all. I still don't like it (no offense to actually gay people).

I know that I'm flipping out and being ridiculous, but that is why I made this post. What can I do to not flip out that hard? I do have an ""open mind"", but this topic completely closes it (it also becomes airtight too). On the bright side, at least I'm not going all ""kill all the homo scrubs"" or something, right? Anyone?

76,"Even being in the same room as a single bug of any species sets me on edge once I realize it's there. 

If a fly gets in the room and we don't have a fly swatter, I need to leave the room because I won't be able to relax.

If I see a single ant, I kill it but become paranoid for the next week that I'm going to have an ant infestation. Just last week I actually did have an infestation in my room and bathroom. I was barely able to sleep in my room, I woke up 2 hours early every day for fear of having ants crawling all over me, and I crashed for a day after buying Raid and traps and killing them all. 

Last year we had wasps build a nest in the air vents. That was not fun. Wasps literally dropped out of the ceiling and I found them everywhere, although mostly dead. I though I was going to go insane. I couldn't even go near the carcasses. 

I had cockroaches in my bathroom once. I went full lockdown and barred off the bathroom (and my room, just in case they tried to go in there), called an exterminator, and used a different bathroom for weeks until I was sure the roaches were gone. I didn't even want to go near the bathroom's closed door for fear they'd squeeze out and crawl on my feet.

Worst of all is **spiders**. Sometimes I find spiders in random nooks and crannies and I make someone get rid of them even if they're not doing anything because I won't be able to relax on the off chance they move slightly and I need to track their movements so they don't come near me. If somehow  the spider escapes my sight, I need to leave the room because *fuck that shit* spiders are going to drop onto me from the ceiling now. I woke up once and went to the bathroom. I looked down at the toilet and I saw a spider on my shirt. My whole body tensed up in fear so hard I *literally squeezed the shit out of me*. 

---

If it's a really tiny thing, I might be able to kill it as long as there's no possibility of it touching me, like with a large napkin or oven mitt or something, but lord help me if it touches me. I will **flip out**. 

My body gets like x10 more sensitive, like full on attack mode, and every little breeze or brush up against stuff becomes a bug and I need to scratch or straight up violently smack the spot in case there's a bug. Same thing with my head, so I'll end up scratching my scalp like I have lice. Once a fly buzzed in my ear and my hand shot up so fast I literally punched myself in the face. I got some wierd looks that day. If it goes on long enough and I can't get away or kill them, like in a public meeting area with bees flying around where I'd look like a psychopath stomping on flowers and swiping at the air and getting stung, the anxiety builds until I literally start hallucinating bugs, like I see black spots in my vision and I think they're more bugs, which becomes a cycle until it devolves into a full on panic attack. Luckily, 9.9 times out of 10, I can stop it from going that far.

---

Now that you've heard me vent about bugs, here's my issue. 

I just moved into college dorms and the bathrooms are shitty. They're relatively clean, except around the one long window near the ceiling, which is covered in spider webs and actual spiders of varying sizes. The window is positioned so it slightly hangs above the showers, so I can see the spiders clearly and some of them even go in the showers and make more webs. They aren't big tub showers either, they're the tiny rectangular ones.

I cannot find it in me to strip naked, to become so vulnerable, and lock myself in a confined box with a bunch of spiders. I just can't. It's not happening. Ever. 

Do I find a different bathroom, like at the gym? Do I ask the RAs to get the bathroom deep cleaned? Is that even something they can do?

3.I wanted to start my own business and also to be a role model to the Asian community. I want to put us on the map and making something that the Asian community can be proud of.

4.6 month plan, get a lot more content on the website from small business owners. 1 year plan, make a living from it, at least see a future in it where it can be a full time job. 5 year plan is to be a major voice in the community, host events like asian scholarship night, asian basketball charity event, also make websites and videos for clients.

5.Most memorable so far is the possibility of being self-employed and also being able to provide something of value to the community and getting hits on my website on google analytics. Most negative is not pursuing a full time job in pursuit of chasing this dream and being embarassed when it comes to talking about my career.

85,"Some of you will not understand this. I am sorry if that's the case for you, for this issue will be a bit complicated.

For years, I had tumultuous relationships and friendships. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6w2pob/i_have_a_dark_secret_i_need_help/)

People in my life came from broken homes and had broken lives. They were so messed up that we didn't have lasting friendships.

Through hearing advice from my family, I realized that people only bring misery in my life and they were unreliable. It was better to have no friends.

I tried to get used to that, but the loneliness was unbearable. I couldn't stand it. And to add insult to injury, my family pressures me to center my life on what other thought of me. You know, those who are demanding and ruthless. That led me to social mobility.

And this isn't a open door to opportunities for new friendships. They abhor such things, and they are not good for social mobility. (I don't know why.)

look, if I am going to be lonely, I want to feel good about myself for doing any goddamn thing I want to do (not doing wrong things), and living a balanced discipline. By seeking the dreams I want and step out of the comfort zone, but not so much to the brink of exhaustion.

But my family disapproves of what I do, and they want to be hard on myself on every work I do, and be very unforgiving to myself. They want me to become one with hardships and agony to be tougher and more socially competent. For what? To be enslaved by the demanding pricks they warn me about. They are strange.

This is not helping me with my loneliness because I have to work hard and earn my self-worth from these dirtbags who show no satisfaction.

So I escaped far away, but the mind still echoes my family's criticism. Right now, I live in South Korea and I don't know I might recover from this...",27Aug2017,1
86,"Ok so there's going to be a LOT in this post, honestly, I don't even know how someone can give me advice. I'm just overwhelmed. With life and everything. This will be just random fears and facts about me, in no order, but they're flooding my brain together and I don't know how to make them stop.

I'm 20. Have been depressed ever since the 9th grade. Haven't been ""diagnosed"" per se, but have spoken to multiple online professional counsellors, real life counsellors (academic ones) who have sort of confirmed this. I get very sad, and anxious. Hell, that is a good way to summarize my past 5 years in general.

At the same time, I trust no one. There is no one in this world who knows me as much as I would like them to. Relationships wise, too - I've opened up to degrees but never the full thing. Since I trust no one I don't let this sadness show. Ever. So in college and in life, on the surface I'm this tall guy who is polite and also funny. I've been told this many times before.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts and I hate myself on almost all fronts. How I look, how I'm not muscular much (i'm 6'2 and 80 Kgs) etc etc. How social tasks like going upto friends at my new college and asking to join them for lunch is a fucking NIGHTMARE for me. I am SCARED of eating in public. I am SCARED things whatever food item I am eating will get stuck in my teeth, will drip, will be smeared on my face. Often I just skip eating in my new college because of this.

Speaking of my new college (I shifted cities by the way, no easy decision because this means I am away from mom dad and my dog, and my dog has been one of the reasons I've kept myself alive, no joke), I'm making a good impression. I can't help but not make one - for if I don't, people will know the truth about me. So I have to be the happy, funny person I am not. I hate it.

And I'm doing academically well - but people think it's because I am smart. It's not. I have severe self esteem issues and objectively, I have been using marks for validation of self worthiness for years now. I absolutely kill myself for exams - neglecting my health, my being in favor of studying - because truly, I feel like I am worth whatever I get. This doesn't apply to anyone else - I have never looked down on anyone BESIDES myself for marks. 

I got asked to prom by a girl I sort of like, and I'm just scared. I cannot deal with all this - all these social events scare me, I'm so awkward, so worried. I just want to sit in a corner for a year. That's all. That is if i manage to shut out the suicidal thoughts.

I never move on from the past. I still live in my childhood home that we had over a decade ago, I still miss my brother (whom I lost almost 2 years ago, and to whom I was an awful person - I always thought mom dad loved him more, and I was banking on me growing up and becoming friends with him....but...that can never happen now.). I miss my aunt, the sweetest soul...who couldn't fight cancer anymore. I miss my sister's boyfriend, who passed away 6 years ago...he was the coolest dude, and he got me into gaming. Without him, I never would have discovered steam, and video gaming; and I probably wouldn't have survived the 9th and 10th.

Everyone in my family is so old. Way older than me. I don't think mom dad will be alive when I'm 40. Both my sisters will be in their 60's. I will be alone. Alone, and unable.

How do I silence my brain? SHould I finally bite the bullet and seek help? I don't know. I find it hard to trust anyone, including professionals...so isn't it useless to get help?",27Aug2017,6
88,"So I work in a company and in another department there is this girl with whom I've been chatting for couple months now. I've been passing by her office every 1-2 weeks and we're having good long conversation. 
Last week in invited her to grab a drink Friday after work which we did and we had a wonderful evening; Plenty of deep conversations and flirting. We agreed to do this again. 


The weird thing is she never passes by my office or never has texted me even though she has my number. I think it's kinda odd and confusing and I don't know if I should pass by her office early next week or wait the usual 1ish week.

89,"Hey this is my first post on here.


 So I plan on moving out when I get out of high school (next year) and I know it's a lot easier to have a roommate. (helps out with the rent)

 the problem I have here is my best friend he's a good friend and cool. But he's kinda lazy and shit I'm kinda worried if I do he's gonna end up not helping with bills and stuff. Gonna put a list of reasons why this is a iffy  thing


He eats a lot. (I don't want everything I get gone) even through most the stuff I plan on buying he won't like cause I plan on eating better.(healthy shit)

He  constantly games like day in day out.

This parts gonna get fucked up  cause it's defiantly weird. 

So about 2-3 years ago I was texting him and I get a text from him asking me if I would suck him off in a school bathroom. I quickly declined  cause I am not gay. I don't have a problem with gay bi people but honestly I told him that shits fucked up and don't ask again. 

I kinda pushed it off as he thought maybe I would say yes thinking I was open to that shit. 

I just don't want to move In with him and figure out that he's gonna try doing this shit.

He's defiantly a bit odd but a cool person to hang out with. (we have been friends  sense 4th grade)

I feel like he tries to leech money off of me sometimes like asking for 10 dollars for a dlc  or LITERALLY  ASKING ME TO BUY A DILDO FOR HIM ONLINE.

Like I'm ok lending money for people  if they can in some way pay me back bit no way I'm buying a dildo  for you.

I just don't know really it's like he's a good friend but does weird shit

Another thing is he can be depressing I help him with shit like this  but there's only so much I can do. He texts me about killing himself with a gun and I talk him out of it. He's done it twice  and I understand life's rough but suicides not the way to go. It hurts everyone.


Sorry if this post is a bit messy it's 3 am and I've been asking my self this a lot.

If this post doesn't belong in this section  of reddit I'll gladly take it down.

90,About a month ago one of my friends came over and talked to me about where his life is/was and broke down. Since we were kids he's had a bit of a mental illness though I don't know what it's called. He would see a man that would try to coerce him into coming to his side and it would literally scare him senseless.

92,"Hi Reddit,

There are a few guys from work that will always be commenting on my body - about how I was getting fatter etc. I'm an introvert, never one to really retaliate, so I just internalized all their comments and suffered quietly. 

Prior to encountering these guys I was already training at a gym. So, for them to make such comments while I was already in the process of trying to improve my health was quite a blow to my self-esteem. 

Long story short... It's been 6 months and I've been consistent with my training and diet. I'm in better shape and I dare say even better than them. 

Today, one of those guys happened to visit my gym. I saw him but he didn't see me. I packed my stuff and left immediately. I felt afraid and even ashamed. 

I know, it's stupid. I shouldn't need to feel this way... 

Any advice on what I should do if he does become a regular at my gym?

Thanks

My problem is the scars that still remain on my legs from my past....which yes I do regret. The problem is that I want to be able to wear swimwear without shorts, I want to forget about what I used to do to myself and what that left on my body, but I'm not sure how to.

I tried vitamin c cream, I knew that wouldn't work and it didn't. I'm currently trying derma oil.....its too early to tell if it's working, but my problem is that my skin has raised and the scars are pretty bad. Can anyone help me, recommendations or advice...

95,"I've recently become friends with this girl (everyone in question is around 16 years old, including me and her and her ex) and her ex boyfriend will not stop messaging her. He's repeatedly spammed her and she's blocked him on everything, but recently he logged into one of her instagram accounts (he'd known the password when they were together) and messaged her on that. He constantly threatens that he'll kill himself if she doesn't respond and threatens that to me and other people. Me and him used to be friends and he's spoken to me about it many times, but now he's said he hates me because I'm close with her now and he demanded that I don't let her touch me or hug me. 

Personally I don't believe he'd actually harm himself and he's doing it to guilt her, but obviously it's way too big of a risk to write off. None of us have any idea what to do about it. She has a history of depression and self harm and suicide attempts, and this clearly is really damaging her mental health.

98,"I wasn't expecting to get pregnant, but my experiences with sex was that I had sex with this one person and the condom actually broke while he was inside me. He insisted that absolutely he didn't cum inside me, and I couldn't see any ejaculation but there was some precum in he condom. I suspect that's what got me pregnant, and I thought since it was precum i had a good chance that I wouldn't get pregnant so I was pretty surprised that I'm now pregnant . 

There was also another guy I had sex with that took the condom off while doing from behind without my consent and I only realised after sex, but I did feel him cum on my ass not inside of me. 


Those are the only two people I had sex with all year, and I went on only a couple of dates with the guy who took the condom off and I stopped seeing him after that incident. 


I don't know if I should get a medical or surgical abortion. 

I have so many other problems to worry about that this pregnancy is like some minor issue to me. It happened which is annoying but fine that's life and now I'm just going to need an abortion. It was honestly either because of an accidental condom breakage or someone violating me which is not a reason to keep a baby imo.

100,"So when I was younger I realised recently that I was possibly sexually abused. I always kinda knew that what was happening to me as a child was wrong but it wasn't until a few years ago that I really took in what had happened. I won't go into the details but i was very young and it would happen quite often and went on for a few years. However, the person who abused me is close in the family and I fear telling would not only ruin the family but also just cause so much grief for everyone that could be avoided. Although the thought still bothers me and I don't know if I should talk about it? I know that telling people might make them see my differently, especially my SO. I also know that telling anyone wouldn't do anything really in terms of justice as I have no proof only what I remember and seeing as I was a minor and so was the person at the time it probably wouldn't go anywhere.

My best friend got into her first ""real"" relationship a month ago. If age is of any importance in this story, her and I are both 20 and her boyfriend is 24. She met him through work. I've noticed that once they started dating she isn't around as much, which makes sense because she should get to know who she's dating. However, things keep getting worse. She actually moved in with my family earlier this year as her home life wasn't too great. My parents allow her to live in our house rent free because when she moved in she didn't have a job. She would help around the house and do chores as her payment I guess. Now she goes to work, immediately hangs out with her boyfriend afterwards, and comes home to sleep. She doesn't help out or do chores anymore. 

My family is a really close-knit family and we've included her in everything as we care a lot about her. However, she doesn't respect the house rules anymore and does whatever her heart desires, without thinking of how it might affect others. Along with this, I know I've built up some jealously towards the guy. I never get to hang out with my best friend anymore, even though she lives in the room next to me. 

I didn't want to let myself get too upset, because I got into a relationship almost a year ago and I went through the honeymoon phase too. However, in my relationship I invited her to hang out with us several times and when she told me that she felt a little left behind, I took time from my boyfriend and put that towards her. So I talked to her about how I've been feeling since she started dating this guy. She acted very apologetic and told me that we should plan a day a week for just the two of us to hang out. I've tried to make plans with her since then, but she always gets her boyfriend involved. I have made clear my frustration about it all, but she ignores it. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. My family tells me to just wait it out because she'll get out of the honeymoon phase eventually. But I've been best friends with her for years. She is the type of person to stick with only one person at a time. I was that one person, so being replaced kinda sucks and it doesn't give me much hope that she'll grow out of it. What do ya'll think? Am I over reacting and just give it time? Should I talk with her about how I'm feeling again?

Second, I was tired; I didn't sleep the night before.

117,"Title says it all. 
Im 25 but this started 10 years back when my first girlfriend ended up being a clingy insecure psycho. Not sure if she was the best or worst thing that ever happened to me, all I know is the relationship slowly sucked the life out of me. Then within 2 weeks she went from saying she wants to be with me forever to dumping me - I cant blame her, she could probably sense I wasn't ready for it. But then afterwoods I found out she had been round my brothers mates house behind my back - this stung like a mother fucker after all the dog shit I put up with her (her begging me to stay with her, saying I'm the only good thing in her life, general psycho clingy girlfriend stuff- even though she kept breaking my boundaries). 

Then the year after that my dad told me he's got blood comming out in his piss and it could be the end for him (hes old as fuck) he starts cleaning out the shed, the loft, etc saying if hes not around whos going to be here to help my mum out. - This sent me into a whole load of confusion - At 19-20 the last thing I wanted to do was be around my mum and dad, yet if he was dying I wanted to get closer to him, and be there for him in his last months etc. His age was also showing greatly and things were happening like having to repeat myself a hell of a lot, or the occasional fall over etc. Then my mum was rushed off to hospital at 3 am with chest pains.
Turns out my dad had prostitus I think its called? and he got pills and all is well, my mum had a gaul bladder, she had an operation but all is well. 
But this all happened at a crucial point in my life - I had just come out of a 4 year relationship, outgrew old friend, and I had to take the next step in my life and get away from parents. - That didn't happen because I was holding myself back thinking one or both of them were about to die. 
Should I note during this time I was at college 3-4 days a week, working 4-5 nights as a delivery driver at local restaurant, playing in a band, and trying to startup and run my own streetwear company. 

It felt like so much of my life was begininng to come together, but so much was going wrong. 
I then went from shit job to shit job with no luck. I never made it out my parents house. 
I feel absolutely broken - I had more balls then all my mates growing up, and now I feel like a shell of myself. 
I feel like Ive been sucked right back to being a kid again and its fucking killing me. My life has been turned upside down on so many levels. 

I feel out the 'game' if you will and no matter what I try and do I cant get back into it. 

It also came to my attention how much believing in jesus means to my dad. How when he thought he could be dying he approached everything with humility and a sense of humour like a champion. 

But this conflicted me even more because I was young I hadn't really given god or jesus or any of that any thought. And here is my dad at 80 doing things out of the kindness of his heart for people and utterly content with life. 

I wasn't ready to slow my life down, I was at a completely different side of life so its really conflicted the fuck out of me. 
Realising how much my Dad means to me as well as how much I don't have anything in common with him. 
And how much our times have changed. And how much I have lived the least christian life imaginable, yet I was happy with my life completely prior to all this, and I might not of been the man I was without my Dads upbringing he gave me. 

I now don't really fit in with old friends, don't fit in with new friends. I don't feel like the man I could of become had I not had a crazy girlfriend and managed to get out of my parents house when I was young. 

I feel jaded. On one hand I feel old like I've lived too much - on the other I feel I haven't even got started. 

For a while I felt so deep into my life, I was the most popular guy I know, had solid integrity and had it all going for me. 
Now I'm lost, confused. I can't trust people anymore, I cant open up, I don't know what makes me happy, or what gives me a purpose anymore. I feel like I went through some kind of anticipatory grief - running through my head how much my life would change without my dad here etc etc. 

In a way it feels like my life has just gone full circle this last 10 years and I'm back where I started. 
For a long time it was as though I was getting somewhere, making progress. Growing as a man and living. 
Now its like everything has stopped and I'm back at square one. 

I've tried living for 'god' but I see through people so much now I cant rely on 'faith' to get me through life anymore. 

My dad is constantly happy, he feels blessed every day he wakes up. I on the other hand don't. I don't feel like I have become the man I'm meant to be, and don't feel like I can as I ruined my oppotunities to break out of everything. 

I see my friends on facebook, all of them are doing well for themselves, they've all moved on, all got new social groups. All found where they fit in. I on the other hand feel like I have gone backwards. 

Part of me feels like I had my life figured out before them at say 13-14 years old, and I just didn't realise how much I had things figured out and I ruined it all, trying to carve my own path through life. I now see the error in my ways and how it all backfired on me. 

All in all, my head is a mess. I hate feeling this way, I used to have so much honour, pride, integrity, But these last few years it feels like thats all gone out the window and I am lost no matter what way I turn. ",27Aug2017,1

Right now, the only two gifts I can think of are alcohol or food. I'm already bringing my gf flowers when she gets back so thatll prob sit in their kitchen but i'm not sure what else i can get.

119,"Hey everyone,

Im a 17 year old guy, and over the summer I met this wonderful girl let's call her E. I also met a pretty cool girl name M.

Just for clarification, if I say camp, base, or summer training it all refers to the same place and time.

I met E almost two months ago now. We have gone on a few ""dates"". The reason I put quotes around this is because we are both cadets and we met on a military base so nothing really happens until we are both off base. We made out a few times and I really enjoy spending my time with her. She tried to hook up with her ex boyfriend when she left the base for the summer and went back home. She told me she was going for him so I told her it was over because I didn't want to be that guy.

Now let's talk about M. I met M around the same time but we were strictly friends because I was wheeling E. I didn't talk to M much until near the end of the camp. We got along really well. She got really flirty and being the guy I am, went along with it. She is pretty fun to be around with so I invited her (because E didn't want to go) to a camping trip (trip is happening soon) with 6 people including myself and M. M said she will come. Now she leaves base for the summer and we start snapchatting. She got drunk one night when I was talking to her on the phone and started to get even more flirty which ended up with her saying we are going to smash at the camping trip and she sent me some nudes on Snapchat. We are both virgins (E is not). She confirmed the day after that everything she meant was true.

Now yesterday, after not talking to E for a few days, I finally replied to one of her messages (I told her I needed space and she was messaging me on Snapchat for streaks which I ended.) We ended up talking and she apologized for leaving me. I told her I need time to think and I would talk to her in a few days. I told her everything about what happened with M and what might happen because I'm a firm believer in communication. She told me that I make her mad and jealous (Which I get from what I told her) but she will come back. I told her before I don't talk to her for a few days if she had anything else she might want to say. She said ""love you"" and ""bye"".

Sorry for the long post but this isn't even all the information. If you want more details I guess you can pm me.

I need advice on what to do and who I should stick with.

TL;DR I need to pick between two girls named E and M.",27Aug2017,2

126,"I'm currently serving as a conscript in army and during my holidays I've noticed how shit and empty life my is. Most of my freetime goes something like this: jerk off, do nothing and maybe on a rare occasition see some friends. I don't know why but it just feels to hard to keep in contact with my friends. That's why I usually don't. During my holidays (usually 16.30 friday to 22.00 sunday) this 'routine' has been going on for about 8 weeks now, but in total it's like 12 or something (4 weeks before army). One big contributor to this might be the fact that I studied really hardcore last year, so now I have a sort of 'power vacuum'. Back then I could justify my life because of the studying, but now I'm facing the reality of the situation. Even though I consider myself to be mentally though, I would be lying if I said that I'm not feeling down etc. Also what doesn't help is that my relations to my parents are well... My father is narcissistic extrovert who has problems with alcohol. This has been going on for basicly my entire life, but he started to drink even more when he had a stoke 5 years ago. Now his temper is even more up and we often have problems with communicating because the speech area of his brain got damaged. Why am I pointing this out? So that you would know that I have both internal and external pressures. I can handle only one at a time, not both. That's why I'm trying to improve my life. Also because I got into a university to study CS, it is in my best interest to not to let this situation to escalate any further so that this will not end like me shooting myself. I know, an overexaggeration but when you have meaningless life, things can happen.

So what have I done so far? I've started to exercise a lot during my freetime. Gym + the PT of the army will get me in a good shape in no time. What else? I've started to read books more. Not in the purpose of studying, but just for the sake of reading. This has been slow because usually the days are so intense that I don't feel like sitting down and reading a few chapters. But still sometimes I can ace a book in few days.

**A quick addon:** I doubt that I have any depression. I'm feeling down because my life is shit. My life isn't shit because I'm feeling down, it's shit because it has almost always been and I only realized it some time ago.

So there's the general situation. Got any suggestions for what I should start to work on? What to do? Been on the same situation sometime? Please tell me what you did. I appreciate every answer!",27Aug2017,1

130,"I've been with my, now Fiancé, for over 3 years now. We started living together (due to certain circumstances that happened in her life) around a year and 4 months into our relationship. We got engaged last September and plan on getting married in may of next year. 

When I first met my fiancé she was so smart and funny and was a driven person. I was single for a few years before I started dating her because I never met anyone who was so dedicated to becoming a better person and doing whatever they can to make a better life for themselves (because that's how I am and that's important to me). She worked a job as a manager full time AND she went to school full time and had a 3.5 GPA and planned on becoming a Science Teacher. 

About half a year after we started dating I noticed a change in her. She started seeming like she cared about school less, she quit her full time job (which I supported) to get less hours to work at a somewhere that may help her career more. But as time went on she kept changing jobs more frequently and caring about school less and less. She changed her major 3 times because it was ""too hard"" once again, I supported her. I told her that even though I'm behind her decision she should make sure she is focusing on jobs when she graduates because that is the end goal right? She's also has had about 6 jobs since that manager job.

During this time I've been supporting us fully financially. I make really good money and I have the luxury to do that, but it's adding pressure to me, that I constantly tell her about. She says she'll work harder (if she's in a good mood) or tell me that I'm being unreasonable and I expect too much from her. 

She graduated school in May and since then she's quit her last job and hasn't worked in 2 months and still doesn't have a full time job. I've told her not having a full time job in her field she's got her degree in is totally fine, but told her she at least needs to do SOMETHING right now for money. We've also been fighting a ton since roughly around the time we became engaged. 

My family recently, unprompted, told me their concerns. They have said that I seem different. I seem more on edge, I seem angry, distant, like I'm just going through the motions. For a guy who is making good money and is getting married to someone he loves, I should be the happiest guy in the world, but I don't seem that way in the slightest. Now, I do suffer from depression which they are aware of, but they are saying it seems worse than that. And they are afraid at any moment I'll snap. They don't want to attribute it all to my Fiance, because that'd be unfair, but they've seen a difference in me throughout our entire relationship and they don't like it, and they wanted to tell me they are concerned. I also asked my best friend and he told me that he's noticed the happiest he's seen me is usually whenever my Fiancé isn't around. 

But, I love her. She HAS changed a lot since we first started dating and she's fighting with me a lot more over stupid things. But I still think back to the woman I first met and how great things were then. I still see glimmers of that person there, but they pop up less frequently than they used to. I've tried talking to her about my concerns before, and then they'll get better for a few weeks and then go right back to the way they were before.

**If anyone has any questions or would like any more info before helping out, let me know! But what should I do here? I still love her; I wouldn't be engaged if I didn't, but with all the above what should I do?**


Also: I will say, obviously this is one sided. I tried my best to inform of what I've noticed her end, but it could also be me changing too. I haven't felt it, but it obviously could be a thing. I know I'm not perfect, and I don't expect her to be. I just don't want the rest of my life to be a battle field and having to live in fear of arguments everyday. I just want to be happy and I thought she was the one to do that, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I can't see it because I love her.

Thanks so much Reddit.

131,"Having a terrible day so I feel I should write up what's going on and the advice I am looking for.

So in most of my life I am happy. I am successful in my career, I help people a lot in my job, I have a decent social life, I go to the gym, I have a lot of free time, not so much money but no debts so I'm ok financially, not great but I'm ok with it. Mostly good so far.

Anyway, I really lost the genetic lottery in the facial department. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but my face sucks. I have an overbite which with correction could help matters a bit, I can't really afford the treatment though, not yet anyway. One eye is a bit droopy. My face is long and thin which with the overbite is exaggerated a bit. My nose is nice so I guess it's not all bad, my hair is thick too.

Anyway, I know through all the therapy I have been through and CBT how to not look at things so black and white, nothing is either good or bad e.t.c. I can genuinely accept that not everyone is perfect, including myself. We all have good and bad things.

This however doesn't stop people from making comments as I walk by them in the street. Not everyone sure but more people than you think will say something as I walk by. Stuff like eww, or he looks creepy, one guy a few months back actually spat on my back.

I don't give in to it when I am walking by, I just act like they are not there. But honestly I feel like shit inside because of these sorts of things.

My question is probably a hard one to answer but how do you truly accept how you look like? No matter what you or anyone else thinks.

I will probably head back to therapy soon as I'm guessing it will be more helpful overall but I am hoping for some others advice as well, I don't want to talk with my friends about it because they will just say that there's nothing wrong with me, which there really isn't I'm just unfortunately below average in the face department, I just want some outside opinion from anonymous strangers.

Very few things would bother me and I was very emotionally stable irrespective of what happened. I could spend ages on my own, with very little, if any, interaction with other people. In fact, I often enjoyed and looked forward to these periods of isolation. They were relaxing and gave me time to think, sit back, and just enjoy the world around me. 

More lately, however, I have found that I dislike being alone for long periods of time (a few days), that some issues are starting to have lasting emotional impacts, and that my ability to control any emotional response is weakening. I don't feel as confident as I used to. I feel weak.

In the last couple of years, I have made some very meaningful connections with people, and contrary to what I used to do, I have become somewhat open with them. I can't shake the feeling that this has opened the floodgates, if you will, and I can't seem to stop it.

145,"This is going to be a fairly long post, so I appreciate it if you read all the way through. I don’t really know what I’m asking except for some opinions and perhaps a new perspective.

I’m a 31-year-old man and I am having serious difficulties deciding on what direction my life should take.

Here is some background/context. I am my own boss, working from home on a very flexible schedule and making very good money. This gives me the opportunity to live essentially anywhere in the world. I was born and raised in an Eastern European country which I always hated. It had always been my dream to leave said country and move somewhere to the west. Well, in 2011 I accomplished this by moving to France with my girlfriend at the time, where we lived together up until December 2016.

In December 2016 my girlfriend and I broke up (amicably, and we still keep in touch, although our issues are irreconcilable and realistically there is no way for us to ever get back together; we have no kids). Ever since the breakup, I have lived by myself in France.

I *LOVE* France and French culture. I prefer it immensely to my home country and I feel like it is the country I was meant to be born/live in; but I am alone and lonely. My family and friends (including my parents in their mid 60s) are back in my home country. 

I want to find a new girlfriend and move on with my life, hopefully settle down (again), have children, and so on. My dream would be for this to happen here in France, but I’m not a master of seduction, and my limited French skills make this an even more difficult prospect (given the nature of my work (at home) and my generally introverted nature, I never really got to master the French language very well; I can handle any and all day-to-day matters and light conversation, but that’s about it). I am fit, fairly good looking, and I would say a level-headed and integrated member of society.

I’ve spent some time back in my home country, and meeting and talking to people there is much, much easier. I’ve gone on a number of dates, and while I haven’t entered into any exclusive relationship (partly because I don’t know what I want to do with my life), I feel like doing so wouldn’t really be that difficult for me to do.

So here is my problem, if it wasn’t already obvious: I feel like I need to choose between “giving up” my dream of living in the west/France and returning to my home country in defeat to settle for a life I never really wanted and staying in France to try to “make it work” (improve my spoken French, my social skills), all while being alone and cut off from my family. I was always close to my parents so it pains me to be away from them; when my girlfriend and I were “making our own life” in France, it made sense… now I’m struggling to see that same sense.

Here two of the alternatives I have considered.

1. Move to my home country and try to meet someone who would move to France with me. This seems like a terrible idea not only because meeting someone with a strict requirement would be difficult, but also because I don’t exactly think it’s a very healthy attitude (and it could risk attracting “gold diggers”).
2. Move to my home country “for a few years” to try out life there and always move back to France when I feel like it. This seems like the easy way out, and I’m worried that it would fail because I might never bring myself to moving to France again (my parents might be ailing by then, I might be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t want to move). That and even now having been outside France for only about a month, I really, really miss it. I honestly feel like I'm in love with a country...

For the record, I do know what I want from a relationship, from a partner, and from life in general. I have no lack of hobbies, interests, and I enjoy many activities that keep me busy.

Thank you.",27Aug2017,2

148,"Ok so I'm in college and live in a dorm with three other girls. We all have own own rooms. 

I'm friends with all of them as we had the same Chem lecture last semester and we all hung out with each other.

One of the girls is the type that is very outward about her looks and very confident which I have no problem with. However, she will walk around topless and have conversations with you while topless and it's awkward. She also sleeps on the couch instead of her room a lot and snores loudly- loud enough for me to hear from my room down the hallway.  She's up late and invite people over often and I hear her laughing and talking up until 5 am in the morning.

This morning was really awkward though. I went into the kitchen to get something and look to my right into the living room and was stunned when I saw her laying in the couch fully naked with nothing covering her, boobs and everything out while she's there snoring away. 

Imagine if someone brought over a guest or had their parents coming to visit. 

Now so know there will be those people that say ""We were all born naked."" and ""You're all girls so what's the problem."" but there's are things called decency and modesty which have lines that can be crossed. 

I've had to complain to her about cleaning up after herself and multiple things before but this by far will be the most awkward. Like what am I to say ""I saw you naked this morning and don't think it's cool for you to be sleep ok the couch with your whole body exposed.""?

150,"Basically, I really need some advice to get back on the horse and continue the right trend I was on. I'm 27 years old, live with my parents, single and I sell houses and invest in cryptocurrency. I'm asking for advice because I always wanted to have massive success but find myself subconsciously cushioned where I'm at financially and it's very frustrating and contrary to how I envisioned my life to be. I don't want to be stagnant but that's how it's been the last 4-5 weeks. I feel as though i'm paralyzed by the comfortable situation i'm in. I don't have a lot of money. But I feel like sitting on $40k at my age and doing better than most is a contributing factor to this recent laziness I've been experiencing. 

At the first half of 2017 I was EXTREMELY driven. I was going through financial hardship back in January and had just been dumped by my fiance. I had a ""Nothing to Lose"" mentality and went balls to the wall. I worked everyday and immersed myself in my business 10-15 hrs every single day. It was almost as if I was driven by the emotions of vengeance for the betrayal that I just went through and being at the lowest point in my life. I made a conscious decision to never be put in that financial and helpless situation ever again. As I started gaining traction, the more motivated and confident I became. However, this proved to be a double edge sword. 

I never took a day off. I answered calls, emails and text 24/7. I kept getting more and more aggressive with my marketing to the point where I can't even keep up with incoming business. To put into perspective I went from spending around $500 a month in advertising back in March, to spending $7000 a month in advertising starting back in June. I'm stuck in this advertising contract until the end of the year as well. My original thought in this was to put my back against the wall and force me to produce more. Which it has, but now I'm so stressed out and burnt out to the point I don't enjoy my work anymore. I ignore 50-60 percent of the incoming calls I get a day.

I haven't taken a full day off since February. Everyday I'm bombarded with leads, appointments, task, commute, constantly pleasing others, etc. I've also realized when I drink I get really depressed. Like a "" why am I doing this again?"" attitude. I thought part of it was because I was lacking a lot of genuine interaction. I started dating someone that I really like and she helps take my mind off things the one day a week that I see her. However, now i'm thinking about stopping that because I crave daily that distraction she gives me from my business and other responsibilities that puts pressure on me every single day. When I'm with her I feel like i'm in a dream I don't want to wake up from. Which logically I know is something I don't have time to entertain if I'm going to get where I need to be.  

I've Hit A Wall. I want to be very successful and reach my goals, but I'm stuck. I'm not progressing how I was two months ago and that realization is wrecking my mental center. I'm burnt out. I need help. Any insight would be immensely appreciated. Thanks for reading.

156,"My grandfather passed away last week, but I couldn't make it to the funeral because I am currently studying abroad. When I heard the news over the phone I was of course shocked, because it was only recently that he had contracted cancer. Hearing the news over the phone I did shed a few tears, and that night I spent the whole night thinking of him.

But that was it. I just went back with my normal life - school, social life, etc. Nobody in the world would suspect that there was death in my family. I did not call my parents once after hearing the news - justifying myself that it's better to wait for them to call me, and at the same time not wanting to face the drama that would come if I do call them. 

My mom called today. She was very angry at me, shouting at me for being inconsiderate. Turns out my grandfather was buried today (it was a three-day funeral), and she told me just how unsympathetic you were being to the whole thing. I replied that I did not know that the burial was today, as she had never told me. She then told me how shocked she was that I would not call my parents once during the funeral proceedings. I shouted back at her that I did deal with emotions on my own, and just because I hadn't called doesn't mean that I am inconsiderate or whatever.

But maybe she's right. I don't know what to feel, or how to feel. It's not so much that I am numb - it's just, I don't know, I feel as if I've just forgotten that the whole thing ever happened. My grandfather and I weren't like super close, but we still saw each other once a week (we live close by). I am very sad at his passing, but my response to the whole thing is not as dramatic as I thought it would be. I'm just living my life, hanging out with friends, studying, drinking, whatever.

Is there something wrong with me? I'm worried that my mother may be right - that I am so oblivious to everything other than me, that I basically have a wall when being with others (I've been accused of that a few times before). But what? Am I supposed to be overflowing with tears? I really am lost here.",27Aug2017,4
157,"Hi Reddit,

I'm hoping there are some experts in electronics that can help me enact a bit of petty revenge...

Background: I live in a rental unit on the main floor, which includes a deck and a backyard. When I moved in last year, the yard was unkempt and weed-ridden. I love to garden so I labored over the summer to clear garden beds around the base of the deck, cleaned up all the little bits of garbage that were buried in the soil, and planted several perennial plants. I was really proud of it, it looked sooo much better than it did before. I had plans to do even more next year.

A few days ago, some workers came by to erect a new fence. Somehow it was noticed that our deck needed some structural repairs. Obviously safety should come first and I completely realize that they had a job to do, but I asked them very politely if they could try to mind the plants and not trample them whenever possible. They just looked at me, blankly.

After they had left for the day, I took a look at the damage. Guys, I was devastated to see what they had done. Like, I'm not unreasonable here, I understand that shit happens. But the decimation of my garden was gratuitous - they had tossed tools, bricks, and building supplies on top of my plants when they could have just as easily put these items a foot in another direction and leave my babies be. Talking to my landlord was of no help (he empathized but that's it). I still have several potted plants around my deck that are, so far, unscathed, but I don't trust them not be to be motherless fucks when they return on Monday.

So here's the thing: they left their plug-in stereo behind. I'm normally not a vengeful person, but I really want to destroy something of theirs. You know, enact a bit of justice for my dead homies.

Any ideas on how to render the stereo to an inoperable state with no signs of tampering? Would setting it in a bowl of water (not plugged in of course) for a few hours do the trick? I have no idea what I'm doing here...wrecking electronics on purpose isn't something that I've ever felt the need to do before.

159,"I (F17) swiped a tea towel in my dad's direction in joking annoyance. I did not mean it maliciously and as far as I could tell it did not touch him. However he immediately lost his temper, dragged me out of the room by the arm and said I hit him and nearly knocked his eye out. He told my mum this is what I did also. I defended myself and it escalated somewhat into an argument. 

After a while he left and shut himself in his bedroom, but by this point I had gotten angry and went after him. I banged on his door and asked him to come back out. When I did this he grabbed my throat and held me against the wall, and said to never bang on his door like that. This didn't leave any marks though I felt like I couldn't swallow properly for a few hours, my mum thinks this was probably just anxiety though. He hasn't spoken to me properly for three days since and says he won't until I apologise to him. My mum agrees that I should. He leaves the room if I go in there and won't look at me properly.

161,"I'm in a tough spot, I'm 27 years old and I feel like I've hit a wall in life. I have some good things, I won't deny that, like I'm super fortunate in some areas and I am ultra appreciative. The thing is, my job situation and the future of it, don't look too bright. However, the one silver lining about it is that, they have a program that they're sending their employees to school to get a degree or a certification in something, to help them improve their life.

Now, on the surface, that's a fantastic opportunity and I'd be stupid to pass it up, the problem is, two fold. One, it's retail and honestly, with how Amazon and the like are taking over, I have to worry if I'll even have the 9 months or whatever they're projecting to go to school before we shut down because brick and mortar stores are on the way out. 

Secondly and more importantly, this job stresses me out so much and it makes me angry. Now before I go on, it's not the job itself, the people, or anything like that. I'm grateful for what this job has given me, it's helped me make friends, be more independent, I met my girlfriend, and more. The job itself is labor intensive, but I enjoy it. If I could, I would do something like this for the rest of my life, without problem.

The issue is, since we're a thrift store and our business is supported by donated items for the most part, I've really become bitter at the people who bring us stuff. Now you may think ""but why, they're helping you out"" but and I've spoken about this before, after 5 years of being there, I don't see it as a ""good deed"" or people being generous.

People abuse it, people are only ""donating"" things because they can write it off on their taxes. I find it disgusting, I think it's sad that people can only be bothered to do something ""charitable"" if they can get something out of it. Not to mention that it's not just like ""oh I have a few items"" or ""Here's a couple bags of clothes"" It's people bringing us trucks filled with moldy boxes, people cleaning out dead relatives houses and just bringing things that are decades old and have no real value to us, all so that they can  pretend this is a ""good deed"" and get something out of it.

Like, it's hard to explain without you guys seeing it day by day, but when people are giving me knock off Coach purses and pretending that they're the real deal, so that they can justify slapping a huge value on that piece of paper to give to their accountant or whatever is sad. 800-1000 transactions a week, some of those are people coming multiple times a week, and out of the say 500 to be fair individual, unique encounters, I'd say 300 of them want receipts for their taxes. 

I think in a month, we'll see like 1,200 different people and most of them are only doing this so they can write it off. Bringing whatever they can to justify those numbers. Literal trash, animal feces, urine soaked clothes, broken items, and so much more that they feel is worth the time and effort to bring here.

Do we get some nice stuff? Sure, but we see more garbage and more stuff that we're forced to put out just to have stuff on the shelves because people don't want to be honest and say ""you know what, only half of what I have in my basement is even worth the effort to pack up"" and instead of throwing away the garbage or at least giving it to us without needing anything in return, they ""need"" something in return for this.

I just don't know what to do, continue to be angry at the fact that I think people abuse what should be an act of charity and kindness, all for some selfish gain, to better my life. Or take something else and hope that either A)It's not replaced by technology or something and I can do it for the rest of my life or B) Take a new job, but go back to school for something on my own time and my own dime and hope it works out for me.",27Aug2017,3
162,"It's impossible for me to do things by myself. 

By that I mean that I am not confident in myself to do something successfully. I curb the fear of failure by inviting someone to fail with me. 


Back in my hometown this was easy as I had a shitload of people to count on to just do stupid shit with. However as the years have gone I have less and less people to count on so I'm doing less and less. 

Now I'm away in college and I have no confidence in myself. I've come to realize any confidence I did have was completely wrapped up in the knowledge that I had friends who would have my back no matter what.

I still have them, they're just 200 miles away. 

So all the advice I've gotten to make friends, join clubs, etc etc. is lost on me because I'm too scared to put myself out there, or really to claim interest in anything.

One thing I always get told is that people are surprised how much seemingly random shit I know, and how varied my interest are, but this seems to be the worst place to be for that.

The school I'm in is fairly competitive and I'm a transfer so most people I'm interacting with are way into their subjects. 

That being said everyone seems to know a lot more about what they like than I do. I can hold a conversation but I feel like I tend to bore people because I don't share their enthusiasm. 

At this point I feel like my desperation is obvious (although it might just be in my head), and I tend to be too casual with people that I actually want to spend the whole day with.

169,"So let me back the trolley up.

My friend from grad school and her boyfriend were getting kicked out of their on-campus apartment a few weeks ago because they had used up all of their years of eligibility even though they are still finishing their PhD programs. They had an ""eviction party"" to ""celebrate"". I was originally going to go but then couldn't because I had to go to an all day meeting the day after for my job and so I couldn't make the 100 mile each way trek.

I did still want to give them a housewarming gift for their new apartment, so I got their new address and was getting ready to send it when she texted me and told me that her address was changing AGAIN because they broke up. 

I am seeing her for lunch next Saturday. Just trying to be a comforting friend.

How do I give her the gift without it being weird? I mean, she is still moving. It's nothing fancy, it's just a USB powered Plasma Ball. I did consider just not giving it to her but when she texted me about the break up she specifically asked if I had sent it yet, and told me about the new address, so I think she is sort of expecting it. 

Also, I'm just going to admit this for full disclosure: I have had a crush on her for about three years now. But I am not doing this looking for any sort of ""action."" I am her friend first and foremost and what I want is for her to be happy.

I didn't post this in the relationship advice forum because of their rules about gift giving posts.

170,"Hi guys, I've never really done anything like this before but I've hit a point where I don't know how exactly to confront my current situation.

So for context, I live in a small apartment with my longterm SO and my roommate (we have been friends for over 10 years). We split all of the bills 3 ways and although our space is very limited, we do our best to make ends meet and live comfortably. 

However, my roommate can be very inconsiderate. He doesn't clean nearly as much as my SO and I do, he drinks heavily, and he doesn't really think about the constraints of our apartment space-wise. Recently, we found out that he was seeing a girl in secret because he didn't want anyone to know about her. After we found out, he started bringing her over to the apartment and she is there often, even at times when he is not. Now, don't get me wrong, she is a nice girl and all, but she's a few years younger than the rest of us and has her head in the clouds with her head-over-heels feelings for my roommate. When they use the kitchen, they somehow ALWAYS manage to use every pan and like 17 different utensils and don't clean up after themselves until way afterwards. 

My SO's mom bought us a $60 ceramic pan for our housewarming and my SO has kept it in near-perfect condition since we moved in months ago. My roommate's girlfriend decided that she wanted to make a big, elaborate breakfast for him yesterday and she ruined the pan, which really upset my SO and she wants the GF to pay for it.

Now, I would like to talk to my roommate and his GF about boundaries, cleaning up after themselves, and respecting the property of others. I also don't like how often the girl is at our apartment. It makes me uncomfortable to come home thinking that I'll have to see someone who doesn't even live there. My issue is that I don't handle confrontation well. I tend to be very blunt and I don't really sugarcoat the things I have to say, which other people might be sensitive. I want to approach this conversation in a way that doesn't seem like I'm attacking anyone because I don't want to hurt any feelings. My roommate is also a very reserved person in the sense that over our entire friendship, we never butted heads. I just want to be treated with the same respect that I give and knowing myself, if I don't approach this conversation in the right way, I will get frustrated and end up saying things that I don't mean in an effort to get my point across.

So my question to all you is, how do I frame this conversation? How do I start it and how do I say ""you guys are being very inconsiderate and disrespectful"" without sounding like a dick?

Thanks in advance!

171,"I'm currently in the corporate sales world doing a 9 to 5 job almost 5 to 6 days a week, with weekends in the middle of the week. The job requires me to be on call even at home. I don't mind the workload but it gets quite repetitive and boring. I've made sales already, but the workload does not have any substance at all. From handling documents and constantly talking to clients, there's just no thrill to it anymore. However, the good thing about this current job of mine is that it has a slow but steady pace in building a career path. The problem with it is its repetition of work, my team's settlement for mediocrity, and my incompatibility to jive with them. 

On the other hand, I have a friend whom I met in the same corporate field who invited me to work with him at a start up, along with an acquaintance that he met through me. Both of them will be partners, and I will basically be the third guy doing the overall operations assisted with their guidance and training. Both of them are very competent in their separate fields: one has 8 years in experience in sales; the other a Harvard graduate in the field of e-commerce and financial modeling. 

The problem with this is that I have not been invited as a partner, understandable due to my lack of expertise. It would seem as I would be working for my friend, which somewhat bothers me a bit. But on the brighter note, I find this a good experience to learn all the operations of handling a business, just not as a shareholder (yet, hopefully). 

I'm bothered by this transition, and I don't know what I will get myself into if I ever decide to take the leap. I know the risks of start ups: lesser salary than expected, more workload, risk in time, risk in effort, risk in general. Overall, the business idea they proposed is something I feel as though it has potential that it would work out fine, and this is me judging their expertise on the field; considering the guy is a graduate from Harvard and has a lot of experience in the business side of things. 

Would it be worth the leap? I really want to picture myself out as a partner/equity holder, but they said that it isn't really the priority to think about now.

176,"I have worked for 6 years to get into this program of my dreams.  It’s starting tomorrow.  Trouble is, I smoked weed on Thursday night, and I found out Friday morning that I will have a surprise drug test on Monday afternoon.

I have pretty bad anxiety and panic disorder and headaches.  My primary care doctor had told me that weed can be helpful for migraines, but he did not give me a medical card or any documentation.  I’m coming from a state where weed is legal recreationally.  I have smoked six times this month, but one hit each time.

The drug screening is for a hospital that I will be doing a rotation in, not for the program itself, so I have no idea what the consequences will be (if I will be unable to work at the hospital or kicked out of the program itself, or something less severe). 

Now, orientation and the drug test are on Monday (tomorrow), so this will be a crazy day. I am going to call my doctor and try to ask if he will give any sort of documentation that he said that smoking can help migraines, but I’m not sure if he will (he’s pretty cool though).  I have tested negative for THC on 4 home drug tests, with three different brands of tests.  I don’t know how that will compare to lab testing. I also have a detox drink that I bought from a smoke shop that I will take on the day of the test.

These are the options that I think I have.

I could go to my advisor before I take the drug test and explain the situation with my anxiety and migraines.  I have proof that I have anxiety and a prescription for the controlled substance that I am also on.  (And if my Dr promises to give a note, I can bring that up too). The downside of this is that she will know I smoked regardless of whether or not I turn up negative, and that might affect her first impression of me. She's a middle aged white lady, I don't know much about her or her views on weed.


I could not go to my advisor, and only deal with the subject if I turn up positive.  The downside of this is that I may seem suspicious and look like I was being sneaky, and might have worse consequences.

#1 and 2 are very messy/angry/entitled people, but when #1 is in a bad mood, she cleans everything and then rants that she is always cleaning after everyone and no one does anything and lumps me into being part of the problem mess. (I used to clean the house top to bottom after everyone but got finally got fed up and only clean my own messes now.)

So I believe if this confrontational meeting does happen, it's going to be about everyone needing to clean up messes (I already do with my own) and that we all need to take out the trash more than just same person (which I agree and know I am guilty off not taking it out). 

I do not like being accused of not doing things, such as the cleaning, when I already DO and HAVE done them for a long time. So if I am accused of this, how should I respond?

Her fiancé is Christian and his ex is Christian and he is a pretty liberal guy but was raised by strictly Pentecostal and conservative parents who he lived with after his divorce until recently when he and my sister moved in together.  Because of the time he lived with his parents, his daughter has been influenced greatly by them during her visits with her father.  

My family is very liberal and pro lgtbq*, and when my sister first started dating her fiancé she struggled with some remarks and judgements he had made towards our younger sister who came out around the same time they started dating.  This was also around the time he was introduced to our Uncle and his husband and their son, so he felt overwhelmed by religious guilt; however he grew as a person since then.  I myself am pansexual, so we understood how someone raised the way he was could be overwhelmed by our family and react the way he did and we did our best to maintain a low key demeanor around his parents and his daughter when it came to celebrating holidays like Halloween and birthdays and speaking about other things like pride and politics.  Also we are all Puerto Rican including his family, so there is also a cultural aspect to all of this.

Worried, I start to console her and after a long while I convince her to tell me what's wrong and she starts to ramble about how she thinks she might be bi because she thought she liked another girl until she got to know her.  She then says she can't turn out to be bi because gay people are hated in the world and she doesn't want to be hated.  

Then she started to cry again and then told me she had another secret to tell me but ""he"" told her I wasn't allowed to know and that ""he"" is in a position of power.  She also said ""I shouldn't say anything because this has happened before"" So now I'm REALLY freaking out, I really really convince her to tell me, saying I don't care who it is and she looks me straight in the face full of tears and says she sees and speaks to angels and that two were in my bedroom and pointed them out.  Then she told me she died before and that her spirit left her body and she went to heaven and spoke to God.  Then the angels took her to the border of heaven and hell and she saw all the people burning for eternity.  She said that because I was a blasphemer I was going to go to hell unless I accepted Jesus as my lord and savior.  That being gay and trans were choices and that she can choose not to be bi (she was sure of it), somehow she was being tested and that God has a plan for everyone.  She told me my room was covered in idols and symbols (I have a Buddha statue, a hamsa hand carving that I put jewelry on, a purple tapestry of the tree of life, many crystals/rocks I collect, and mala beads I make for meditation) and that God is a jealous God and that no other God can come before him and that I am a sinner because of how I live my life (even though I'm in a serious long term relationship with a straight man) and because of the idol I worship (Secular Buddhist) Then she started to hysterically cry again!  I just sat there rubbing her back absolutely stunned.  

She is 12 years old!  I went to catholic school for 15 years, I know exactly what's going on.  But she's too young to be having an existential crisis like this.  I don't know what to do!  I asked my parents if I should tell my sister and they think I should say nothing, but I can't help but feel like doing nothing would cause more harm?!  In a god fearing family that worships a jealous and vengeful god, seeing angels and talking to him is much better than being gay isn't it?  She was trying to convince me to join her religion while crying in emotional turmoil and self hate!  

Help me, what should I do?!

Edit* 

I want to add, she has been getting in trouble lately for using social media inappropriately behind her parents' back like secret snapchats and other apps meant for chatting or exploring social environments.  She also has been exploring music and artists like Selena Gomez in particular and her new song Bad Liar and has been talking to me about the symbolism behind the music video obsessively.  Now it makes sense why.  I really don't know what to do, as outing another person on their journey is NOT OKAY.  But being reckless on social media apps and seeing angels and all that other stuff?",27Aug2017,3
185,"Hey!
I am about to enter my freshman year of college (starts tomorrow), and I have never felt so unsure of myself. I am entering the general engineering field (you declare after freshman year), and I am really not as into the idea of being an engineer as I thought I might be. I am totally okay with being lost in college as long as I figure it out along the way. 
Here's what I need advice about.
I have been super into music my whole life. When I was young, I was always listening to music, singing in the shower, dancing around my living room, etc. As I got older, I joined band and got really into it. My happiest moments are when I get to play and share music with my friends. All last year, I was planning on studying music education, but due to some complications with paying for college and just not having my heart into teaching, I decided to try to find a new field.

I want to work in the field of music &amp; entertainment when I get older, but also be able to develop new skills in different areas. What are some fields where I can work near the music industry? I want to be near my passion, but also having new responsibilities that won't suck all the life out of my favorite thing in the world.

tl;dr- I want to work around the music &amp; entertainment industry, but I also want to develop and use skills that aren't purely musical.

I figure I'll have to stay at this job at least a year to get enough experience to move up in my career to jump to another place with better pay and opportunity. 

Another problem I'm having is that the place I'm living now is where old people go to retire in south Florida, so finding things to do here is nonexistant.

205,"Long and short version 

Had insurance threw the bank I was loaning a car threw. It got hit. Took forever for them to send someone and had to pay on it and that paid it off. Damage worth 2300. Deposit the check and take the car to shop. Shop says way more damage and send someone else out almost 2 months later. That say new damage is about 9k totaling the car. I'd be getting about 5k for it. Bank owns the insurance and says since we paid it off the insurance is void and they're no longer interested in it. Call insurance and they have no idea what bank is talking about and still waiting on papers from the bank. And the car has been in the shop for like 2 months and they don't pay storage but it's only been in there so long because they take their time and don't answer calls. 

Okay. So, I have a Honda Element ex. O4. The battery was dead or started was going out and I haven't drove in in about a week or so. Friday I went to get something from my car and Sunday I drove my gf car to get some coffee and when I came back home I seen my car had been hit. (Think it happens sat night) so I'm thinking of what to do and I call my insurance the next day (may 1st)  because they're closed sundays and few days later. They answer and tell them about the accident and it was a hit and run. They say they'll send a adjuster out. Waiting.. my brother pays the load off .2 weeks later he shows up while I was sleeping. Leaves a voicemail saying he looked at it and it was the damages are around $2300 and to take it into a body shop to get it fixed. They sent the 2300 in a form of a check.  My brother got the check and deposited it. They order parts that it needs and take it apart and notice there is way more internal damage and need a adjuster to come look at the new found damage. Takes a month and a half for him to come back out. (Cars been in the shop and insurance doesn't pay storage) they look at it and price the damage at around 9k making it a total and that the car would be worth around 5k and they're waiting on the bank to send a few papers over so they can send the remaining money to cover the car. I called the bank to tell them to send the paper and they don't know what I'm talking about and a week later call me back saying that they own the  Insurance company and  that they don't know what papers they need and that my brother payed the loan off it wasn't their car anymore and the insurance got cut off and them or the insurance wasn't interested in the car anymore. I told them to that the accident happened while we had the insurance and before the car was paid off. So we still had a claim threw them and had paid for 6 moths extra and still had 4 months till the next payment. So I'm on the phone with her and my brother and take the phone to the body shop and they're pissed because they're trying to screw us and they tell me to report them and if they don't pay sue them. We call the insurance right after that. Still in the body shop and they have no idea what the bank is talking about and say our account is still open just waiting on the papers still. ",27Aug2017,1

214,"So I have a girlfriend of a little over a year who has recently opened up to me about the way her step dad treats her and I am horrified.

First, let me explain her situation. She is 20 years old, but is unable to move out of her mom and step dad's house due to the fact that she attends school full time and works a part time job, so she doesn't have anywhere close to a good enough financial situation to be able to move out. She is essentially trapped in the house with him, despite being of age.

She has recounted to me instances of full on sexual assault, but luckily that has not happened for a few years from the sound of what she tells me. I am still scared it may happen to her again, though.

Most recently, she told me that a few days ago, he came into the bathroom while she was showering and pulled back the curtain and forced her to have a conversation with him about mine and her's sex life. She has aksed him not to do this and he says stuff like ""don't be childish"", ""You're acting like a baby"" etc. and refuses to stop.

I told her I thought she should lock the door when she's showering and tell her mom that he is doing this. Her mom apparently just told her not to lock the door because he would probably pick it or break it down, and told her that he would probably stop if my girlfriend told him to. She has and he will not.

I am trying to figure out what to do, or to tell her to do. My options seem to be getting limited to teaching him a lesson with my fists. I don't want to do that because A. He owns guns and I may just get shot, and B. I don't have any previous criminal record and would prefer to keep it that way.

What would you all suggest in this situation? It's causing me a lot of distress, so I can't even imagine what it's like for her.

215,"We've been assigned groups for our semester long group projects, and in a group of 6, 3 of the students in our group are non-native English speakers. In our small bit of communication (basically just introducing ourselves, and splitting the work up), it's pretty clear that they have some trouble with English, especially written. I can't say I don't empathize, if I had to write an essay about something complex in another language, I'd be hard pressed to write anything. However, as it's a group project, I'm also worried about my personal score.

I have maintained a 4.0 throughout my college experience (beginning of Junior year now), and ideally I'd like to keep that up, however I'm pretty concerned with the quality of work we are going to be able to produce in this class. The class requires about 20 pages double spaced, for 3 individual presentations on the project (all about a month apart). We are graded on grammar, spelling, and the overall cohesiveness of the work (ie. It shouldn't sound like 6 different people wrote it).

How should I go about ensuring the quality of the paper, without either writing it all myself, or having to damn near re-write 3 parts of the essay? Not to mention having to go through about 60 pages of work, throughout the semester...

Just feeling a bit overwhelmed by the issue, and feel I'm in a bit of an unfair situation. The class overall should be very easy, and 20 pages between 6 people really wouldn't be a difficult prospect at all, but with the addition of 3 people who seem to struggle with English, I feel as though my group has a heavier workload, as we will either have to write more ourselves, or spend extensive time editing and rewriting large portions of the paper.",27Aug2017,1

218,"This is long winded because I'm stressing out. TLDR at bottom. 

I entered college at the age of 18 bright eyed and ready for anything. However, at the time I didn't really have a plan, I entered as undeclared. In hindsight I wish I took a year off to think about what I wanted to do, but I did what my parents expected of me. 

I eventually joined the graphic desgin major because it was a fairly popular major at the school I went to and it seemed like a great way to use my artistic talents to their fullest. I fully enjoyed the core art program: drawing, basic design, color theory, etc. However, I quickly fell off the wagon when the time came to take the graphic design courses. Where I used to excel I now struggled, and quickly learned that illustration does NOT equal graphic design. I hated it, honestly. What was expected of me was so corporate and bland. It seemed like everyone was doing iterations of the same thing, and I eventually gave up in trying and just tried to finish the degree. 

However, I couldn't handle the negative looks, negative grades, negative everything I experienced from that school. My teachers didn't respect me. My classmates thought I was a joke. I didnt deserve their respect, really. I fell into a deep depression and after a year of struggling I finally dropped out. 

Since then I've been carefully considering what my goal in life is. Even with the graphic design major decision, I had no goal. I had a major, and nothing to do after that. 

I've come to realize that I really, deeply enjoy video games. I hate admitting that because it sounds so childish, but it's true. I would really enjoy getting a job as a game developer, writer, or even an animator. My problem is that tuition for art schools are so god damn expensive. I'm currently living with my parents, and there's a school nearby where I plan to get some kind of degree. There is also a nearby art school, in the same city, where tuition is 3x as expensive. I can't put any more debt onto my parents or myself. 

My current plan as of right now is to finish at the regular university (for the cheap tuition) for Creative Writing. I could get a wide variety of jobs with that; teaching, journalism, writing in general for games, ad companies, whatever. Then after a year of two of raising funds, move to Vancouver for Vanarts and get either their Game Devlopment Certificate or Animation Certificate. I have heard great things about this school, and while the tuition is expensive the certificate about the same for one year at most art schools. For art related jobs, I know it's better to have a great portfolio than a degree. So while this is all going on, I will personally push my skills as far as they can. 

I was just wondering, does this seem like a valid plan? Is it far fetched? Are there any other options I could take?

Thanks for taking the time to read. I just need to know if this is just another childish dream of mine or if I should really go for it. 

TLDR: dropped out of graphic design because I hated it. I want to work with video games, hope to become an animator/developer. School is is expensive, might try out Van Arts if it all works out.",27Aug2017,2

222,"I've been working there for nearly 8 years now and I've put my education on the back burner for last several years now because my boss doesn't like anybody else working besides me, which is flattering, but I don't intend on working in a convenience store my entire life. 

I'm currently working Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, but I'm hoping to get Saturday off and only work evenings, so that I can focus on school during the day. He offered me Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, but then I wouldn't have any days side by side, much like my schedule is now, which I find is already too exhausting, because I barely get a break. My co-worker coincidentally wants to change his schedule as well, since he currently only works two days and is going back to school as well. He's asking for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which I know for a fact that my boss will never allow because even though he only works with the two slow days he's barely able to keep up and Friday is our busiest day. Giving him 3 days in a row would be an absolute disaster!

FYI: Quitting is an option. I could very easily afford to be in school without having to worry about working, but I enjoy working, so preferably I'd prefer not quit.",27Aug2017,3
223,"Hey guys,

i'm in a weird situation at the moment. I desire and aspire doing so much (working out more frequently again, improving my language skills, starting martial arts, reading the books that lay in my shelf since months, being more active, watching good movies, getting my life together etc.). However I don't do shit. I want to but I just can't start because the thought itself makes me bored. For example I read like 25 pages of a book I bought like 2 months ago recently and I enjoyed it but I haven't opened it again since weeks. I forced myself to watch Fight Club lol and I ended up enjoying it as well but since then I didn't watch any movie.

My opinion is that we have short attention spans nowadays with the internet and all the information we face everyday. I add so many videos on my Youtube playlist and I don't watch them. Videos about my issues as well but my mind says no everytime. I can't even listen to an full album like I used to.

When I'm at work I want to go home so bad and when I'm home I just don't do shit except eating, surfing on the internet and playing PS4. 

My life got better in the last months actually. There is some improvement in all aspects. I fucked up college last year and now I got accepted at the university I always wanted to go to. 3 years too late but better later than never. I earned some money as well and I'm more active socially (not too much though). When I'm outside with others I feel not bored. Probably the only time I'm not and when I manage to workout. I'm the happiest person fridays when work is done, then I end up doing nothing special at the weekend. One of my main activities is watching entertainment videos that don't challenge me or enrich me intellectually. I can watch like hours of useless shit like interviews of rappers etc.

I don't know what's wrong with me. It seems to be a mix of fear of the future, having a short attention span and not being satisfied with myself (physically, mentally, career wise). Well at least thats my theory. I don't think that I have ADHD because I listen to others carefully. I just don't want to do shit, can't focus and I get bored quick. I need to fix this otherwise I will not study for university again and fuck up big time. 

What do you think ? Sorry for the long post. BTW My age is 23 if it's important in anyway. ",27Aug2017,1
224,"I work at an small advertising firm full time; there are four of us that work full time and one intern. I mostly like the job but there is not enough work to justify me there full time. I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk wondering what I'm supposed to do, and when I do finally get work in, I'm still waiting on other parts and can only do so much. Then I'll suddenly get everything in at one time and I have to get everything done ASAP and then I'm suddenly without work again. 
If I ask my boss for clarification on something I don't understand, I get attitude back 'what part of this don't you understand' and 'I'm sorry, was I not clear?' At first I thought I was being overly sensitive but my boss gets an attitude every time I come to him with questions. 
If my boss gives me a vague assignment and I ask for more direction, I will go to him asking for more direction on what he is looking for. I believe in efficiency over creativity when it comes to fulfillment; basically I don't want to waste two hours trying to figure out what exactly he's looking for, do the work, only to have him pick it apart and finally tell me what he wants. When I go to him for direction, he tells me he wants me to take ownership of the assignment and come back to him with something, instead of giving me clarification. 
There's so much more than this, and I could probably deal with it, but I also have a 45 minute commute one way as well. So I am away from home almost 11 hours a day and getting paid for 8, and I'm barely getting by.

I found a position in town that pays a little better/around the same. It's a completely different career field but there are better benefits, more discounts, tuition reimbursement and it's in town. I'm just worried how to tell my boss that I'm leaving, because he will take it personally when I just don't feel like the job and the commute is working for me.  Any advice? ",27Aug2017,3

228,"Tdlr; hurricane whiped out our rv.
We evacuated to goliad for a few days, now in beevile where theres power and cell service.
We have a little bit of money left, but i really don't know what to do.
I work in dead center aransas pass, so im not sure if ill have a job. 
My fiancee's job is okay. 
All help is appreciated, especially people with experience dealing with fema. 

I don't really know how active this is but i figured it was worth a shot.

Me and my fiancee had just moved back to aransas pass to get back on our feet. It's been a rough two years, after my dad died i took about six months off of work from construction and haven't got back to working at the new corpus christi liquification project at betchel. Well my mom helped us move back down from oklahoma, where my dad lived in tulsa. 
Weve been here for about a month and a week. We were having trouble finding a place because me and fiancee dont have perfect credit, (im almost 24 and had an eviction when i was 18 but have since paid off a truck loan, shes 22 and had a late loan pay off but we got it caught up.)
So we went to individual owner, and met an old 86 millwright who luckily had put up an ad on Craigslist that i had seen so we headed from flourbluff (where my fiancee is from.) I had to take a loan from my mom to be able to move down and find the place. Shes not worried about me paying it off but she's sent me all that she can.  Luckily Thursday my job paid us a day early. I made right at 500 for my first biweekly check. My fiancee just started her new job at a car dealership. Shes salary and they had said they were going to pay them early, but they haven't deposited anything yet. She gets i believe 500 or 600 on the 30th. 

Our rv is completely gone. We wont have enough to get a place more than likely. 


We evacuated to goliad tx thuraday and we lost power in goliad friday night or Sat early morning.  We stayed in our hotel room anyways because at least it was a place out of the rain.

On the way to goliad my fiancees tire popped, luckily another person navy reserve from corpus stopped with a jack and i put the tire on. Then when trying to get food, my radiator hose popped on my 94 jeep Cherokee.  I worked in the rain to fix it (a firefighter was behind us in dairy queen, luckily he had an extra hose because the auto store hose was too curved. ) 
Right now we're getting a tire at walmart ( the manager made a special request so my fiancee wouldn't be driving on a dumby tire until monday or tuesday.)

I have 150$ on me, and hopefully my fiancees check is going to be deposited soon.   

Were in beeville texas for tonight because they have power and cell phone service near us. I think our hotel is 70 a night. 
We have two cases of water left. Some food left. 

Our home is gone and we're not allowed in aransas pass right now.  

A few questions i have.. Where can i find information to go for emergency help. Who can i go to for help?  Fema red cross etc? Are there places i have to go to for food and water help, and different for housing help? 

I'm not sure exactly how to set up anything like a go fund me or anything either.

Backstory: my mother has a serious case of bipolar disorder with a psychotic touch to it. She sees a lot of visual hallucinations. Family member died, we're cleaning out the house, so we're running a yard sale for weeks.

So this guy keeps coming back from the yard sale. Me and my dad have noticed him so many times, and the guy noticed my mother was talking to something that wasn't there. He seen it, I seen him see it. It was clear as day. What happens? He asks my mom for her number. My dad obviously decides to step out with me, and we ask him a simple question. (Due to privacy I won't say the question I'm hella paranoid someone related will see this post but it wasn't something to heat someone up.). Next thing you know, the guy returns and walks torward me and my dad, in a threatening manner on our own property. He had a friend with him and his friend stopped him by holding him back. That got us so fucking pissed, so we threatened to call the police if he didn't leave. I'm super pissed at him, my dad kinda mellowed out. I just seen him today and the dude is lucky that there were people around, or I would of kicked his fucking ass. I don't want to get violent with him, but my adrenaline, anger, and mostly, protectiveness (anyone could take advantage of my mother) kicked in. At the moment, violence is the best answer I have. I'm not gonna be living with my mother, and I just want her to be safe when it's time for me and my dad to leave. I need advice, I can't think of anything else to do, I just want to protect my mother. Thanks

233,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post and it's something that's been bothering me for a long time (~5 years!!!) that I really need to get out, so this post will be a bit (read: extremely) long, but thank you to whoever reads. 

I'll give a little background. I'm 16 and my brother is 25. He has a different father, however that never affected my family at all as my dad legally adopted him. The biggest problem was always the age difference. As a child I was never really close to him, he used to bully me as a typical older sibling does, but as we got older and he went into college we started to get closer and form a legitimate relationship. We bonded over things like music, we'd play Rockband all the time, he would actually hang out with me when he was home from college. 

Fast forward to about 2011 or 2012, a little before he graduated college. He went to Israel on Birthright. Now nothing out of the ordinary should have happened here, as my father is Israeli and we've been to Israel plenty of times and have lots of family there. However this was at a point in my brother's life where he was searching for a purpose, a direction in life, something to make him happy. I believe he was depressed when he was younger (I'm not 100% sure, due to the large age gap I didn't know what was really going on in his life when I was younger). At this time he was dabbling in Buddhism, he was a vegetarian. 

Anyways, when he visited the Western Wall, he was approached by some Orthodox Jews. (Disclaimer - I'm in no way against religion, but my whole family is very secular, my parents are atheists and I'm agnostic, and we're more culturally Jewish than we are religiously.) I remember the exact moment when he called to tell us that we ate meat; we were all shocked because he was vegetarian for the longest time. Instead he was starting to become kosher. 

For a few years he started to become more religious, but nothing too extreme. He wore a kippa, ate kosher, and prayed a little. He would still visit home, talk to us, do things with us, spend time with me. I honestly can't even remember where he was living or what he was doing, I think he was still in college, I don't remember him having a job or anything. 

Fast forward to now. He's extremely religious, black hat, all black clothes, very strict lifestyle. He has been living in Israel for a while, again I don't remember exactly when he moved but I always remember him slowly drifting away. He got married last June, to a girl he barely knew and that my family only met a few days before the wedding. I remember feeling so anxious at the wedding, so sad, so lost. My brother, marrying a girl he barely knew. Sometimes I wonder if he even loves her and I know the answer is probably know. Because that's just how it works in the orthodox community. 

When I heard his wife was pregnant, I felt like my whole world was being shattered. My brother was already so far away, in all senses of the term, and to think that he was going off and having his own life was terrifying, confusing, and upsetting. His wife has a miscarriage, and I felt horribly guilty for thinking this, but I actually felt so relieved. 

My brother doesn't talk to us. He doesn't even talk to my family that's right there in Israel with him. He calls, but rarely, and when he does he just mumbles incoherently and says very few words. I don't talk to him; I talk at him. There's nothing to talk about. I don't know what he's doing with his life, I don't know if he has a job, if he's still studying to be a rabbi, I don't even know. I do know that he doesn't take care of himself, he doesn't see dentists or doctors. It's been this was for months, years, I don't even know. The time just all flows together. 

I have next to know memories of spending time with my brother. I had such a short few years with him because I was very young and then he went to college and that's basically it. The only thing I sort of remember is playing Rockband with him all the time on his Xbox. My parents are trying to get rid of the Xbox which just makes me so upset because it's basically the only thing remotely close to a memory of spending time with my brother, besides pictures, which just make me upset looking at them. 

I miss him. I don't have any other words. I miss him terribly. I'm so upset. I've dealt with this for years with no major problem but it's just been hitting me really really hard this summer. I see all my friends with their siblings, hanging out, driving around, just fucking around doing whatever, and I get so insanely jealous. I'd give anything for that. I'm so lonely at home. I'm not that close with my parents. My friends have pretty much never been around this summer. I did just come back from a wonderful vacation with my family and my boyfriend but the minute I came back last night I started bursting into tears because the loneliness hit immediately when I dropped my boyfriend off. He hasn't been free much either, because his parents aren't letting him hang out until he finishes his summer HW. But I digress. Bottom line is, I'm lonely. Unbearably. And I can't focus on anything, I have so much HW but I legitimately cannot stand being alone anymore. I've had pretty much next to no social interaction this summer besides for the camp I worked at and my vacation. I can't focus on anything anymore because I feel so lonely and I miss him so much. I wake up anxious and on the verge of tears every morning. I mess around on the internet/social media all day because I need a distraction and it's the closest thing I've been getting to social interaction. 

I have his number, and I want to call him, but I know it won't even be worth it. He won't say anything, as usual, and we'll end the call within 5 minutes. I want to establish communication, to rebuild some sort of relationship, but I know I can't. In an ideal world this never would have happened, he would never have became religious, he would have done something with that arts management degree he graduated early for, he would live somewhere else, even if it was far I wouldn't mind because he would still talk to me and my family, he would visit and call often, he would know everything happening in my life, he would have fun with me, do things with me, I would talk to him whenever, text him, ask him for advice. I would have a brother again. But I know none of that will ever happen. 

So, tl;dr, my brother is 5,000 miles away and doesn't talk to me. And I'm lonely and very very sad, and I can't focus on anything, and it's becoming unbearable. I can't talk to my parents because I've never felt close to them and I just can't bring myself to do it. I know they're hurt too. They miss him just as much. 

Any form of advice would do. I'll take anything. I just need something. I can't stand this anymore. 

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading my ramblings. This has been on my chest for many many years, and it's nice to finally be able to just get it all out. Again, thank you. I hope you have a wonderful day/life :)

234,"Every summer my apartment has an issue with fruit flies. They explode out of nowhere and the only thing that kills them is winter. I've tried the DIY traps more times than I can count. Vinegar managed to kill a couple dozen. Red wine was laughably ineffectual - less than 5 dead in 2 weeks. Chasing them with a vacuum, while good exercise, is not feasible. Apparently it's a problem not isolated to my own apartment as a few weeks ago maintenance came by and sprayed our drains in response to all the complaints the front office got. But I looked up the product they used and it's just some run-of-the-mill drain cleaner gel. 

I've tried pouring bleach and hot water down the drains. I've sanitized every surface in my apartment. I pour bleach into my trash bag and scrub out the can when I change the liner. I even change the liner outside so if there are any inside, they fly out and escape outdoors rather than back into my apartment. I keep produce in my fridge. I've cleaned out my pantry.

These little fuckers always seem to wait until I sit down at my desk to start attacking me. They seem to be drawn to my face or the light from my monitors or something. They also seem to like the vodka drink that I've just set down on my desk.

242,"There are so many elements that contributed to our current state that I find it hard to edit - but here it goes in the bluntest way possible:

My boyfriend of 4 years and I decided a few months ago to cut ties to our home city and move out to a remote desert location. We intended to renovate an old family home for his father to retire into next year. This home now lies in the heart of a senior mobile home community,  but it has been in the family for 4 generations and it was here before there was really anything else around.  It's been vacant for years since my BF's Grandma passed, so we figured (foolishly)  that it wouldn't be a problem for us to stay for 6months-1year and use the time renovating the house to save money for our future plans - to travel the states by RV. So he transfered to a new location through his work and I eventually picked up a part time job in town. 
Everything was going well until about a week ago when we were informed by the property manager that there had been several complaints about us from people in the park. We honestly have tried our best to be quiet and friendly to neighbors. We never invite people over and always try to wave to and chat with the community members,  so it was a shock to learn so many of them had complained - not to the onsite manager - but straight to the board of directors for the park. They said we had 4 people living here, many questioned our dogs licensing (you have to get one for our area), said that we were using members only amenities (we have used the community jacuzzi twice in 3 months), and a bunch of other nonsensical jibber that bored old white people come up with. Now, because we're not technically contracted employees or members,  we are being formally asked to leave. We've managed to convince them to let us stay until the 7th of next month, but after that it's GTFO or they will disbar his father as a member. 
Even though we never planned to stay here long term, my boyfriend and I both agreed we should try to find another house in the area for continued job security. We dont have much saved at this point,  so finding a property that fits our barest of needs in our price range has been incredibly challenging. 
We did find a house at one point and rushed blindly into putting a holding deposit on it so we could buy time until we came up with the full security deposit - only to find out shotly after that the crime rate in that area was scary (as in multiple shootings on our street within the last month) . To make matters worse,  the backyard of the property was a short chainlinked fence and 10 feet away from a wash commonly known as ""tweaker highway"". 
So we noped out of that shit, lost most of our deposit, have been unable to find anything else since,  and now here we are. We can maybe scramble $2,000 between us by the time we have to leave. We've tried exploring alternatives to stay in town for our jobs,  at least for a few months, but nothing too promising. We're out of options,  and I'm out of optimism. Advice?? ",27Aug2017,3

In this group, I have one really good friend who has also became my gf's best friend as well. 

The first problem is that in the group, there is an absolute instigator who throughout the second semester, tried to run each person in the group out one by one. with each person, someone convinced her that she shouldn't or the current victim would try to get on her good side. so eventually, it came around to me and my gf. she started talking behind our backs saying we were ""inseparable"" and so and so, even though most of the time we would be together alone only when everyone else said they were busy. this got them talking about us. Next, their RA had an event in the lounge (where we usually hung out) which involved a big mess which the group in particular made the biggest mess out of. I come later and have some of the candy there and stayed for a bit. I eventually clean up my mess and head back to my room. at 1 am I get messages from the instigator who is cursing me out claiming I made a huge mess and I shouldn't come over anymore if I do that. I defend myself saying I didn't yet she keeps blaming me. I'm not taking her bs or kissing up because I know she's just looking for an excuse to argue, so I call her a c*nt for blaming me without proof and tell her I know she's talking behind my back. She plays the victim and tells everyone I started verbally assaulting her and now, I'm the bad guy. Only the close friend believes me and the rest of them on her side. So now our friend wants to be friends with us while not losing her 5 other friends. The final blow is that my gf is the RA for a freshman dorm this year while the rest of the group are all staying in the same dorm room together. While I don't want to lose the one friend, idc about the rest of em. I learned from my mistake of having a lot of girls as friends and want to start searching for more guy friends,  however my gf really doesn't want to lose her best friend. The others will still talk to my gf and I, but you can tell they all are on the side of the instigator. Now, after the summer, the instigator is still acting hostile and I'm starting to think I'm the first person who stood up to her, because she has been very rude to my gf and I'm prob next. Anyway, like I said, I learned my mistake, and I want to find a really good guy friend. which leads to...
 

The second problem, which deals more so with me. As I said the program I'm in only has so many people, prob 30 guys or so at my age. I had some guy friends who I wanted to become better friends with but there's one guy who is an absolute weasel in the group. He is a spoiled brat who got everything handed to him in life and thinks he's the greatest think since sliced bread. He likes to ""roast"" everyone, especially behind their back, and most of these people are kinda soft (there nerds and bit of push-overs in a way, but I don't view this as a bad thing and like them a lot), so they just take it. Me on the other hand, went to school with some of the greatest ball busters in the world, so when someone says shit on me, I fire right back, but never with ill intent.  He could not even handle my good willed humor which I only used in retaliation to him ""roasting"" me, even though I was very mild with my comments, he couldn't take critique. so he acts like a child and sits in my seat in class so I can't sit near our friends and other childish things like that. Like, You would think I'm in 5th grade with this shit.

I'm not here to fight with these people, I know for a fact drama is more important then anything else (even their classes) and there's no beating them at it. I know the group of girls are gonna fall apart, and I know the weasel won't ever have close friends. That's not my problem though and that's not why I wrote this. I just want to ask how I can deal with people like this who are proactively trying to take shit away from me and keep the friends I want, As well as how my gf and I can make new friends despite only running into the same people everyday. I don't know what we did to be treated like this, but I just want it to stop. Any help will be greatly appreciated, Thank you.",27Aug2017,4
252,"I'm a girl and I'm 16, I used to live with just my mom, but then she married the guy who is now my step dad. We moved into his house with his son, Nick (17). He has a bunch of really strict rules for me, and pretty much none of them apply to Nick.

•My curfew is 10 on weekdays and 11 on weekends, Nick has no curfew whatsoever. 

•As soon as I get home from school, I immediately have to do an assload of chores. Cleaning and scrubbing, vacuuming, doing EVERYONE'S laundry, and then making everyone's dinner and setting up the table, and guess who has to do all the dishes? Me. All Nick has to do is take out the garbage and take care of his dog, but even then sometimes I have to take HIS dog out.

•I have to answer to him and my mom as ""sir"" and ""ma'am"", while Nick gets to talk to them like they're friends. 

•I have to leave my door open at all times. Guess who doesn't? But that's not the worst part, I also have to keep the door open when I'm using the BATHROOM (unless company is over).

•I'm not allowed to have friends over or go out with friends. Guess who is allowed? 

•My parents pick out all my outfits for school, Nick wears whatever he wants. 

•Obviously no dating, I'm assuming this doesn't apply to Nick but I've never seen him with a girl anyways. 

I've asked about these rules before, and the usual answer is ""his house, his rules"" and his reasoning for why Nick has more freedom is that he's a ""mature adult"" even though he's completely immature, and as far as age goes he's only like 4 months older than me.

253,"I'm an 18 year old male, trying to find girls. The problem is I am not getting positive results. I mean my two months of summer was a bummer, I only hung out with one girl. It didn't really go to well. I'm going to my senior year of high school, I'm not that popular, in school tbh. I am worried that I'll be alone, but I have a few friends. But idk if  I even would consider them my friends. I do not consider my self attractive I might be a solid 4-5/10. At work I talk to the people around my age and we seem to get along well, I make people laugh too which is good. When it comes to asking girls to dates, etc doesn't go to well, I don't know what to do... please send some advice on what to do, greatly appreciated!",27Aug2017,2
254,"Due to a variety of reasons, I dropped out of high school years ago and have been living with &amp; serving as a babysitter to my mother ever since. I held a job briefly for a few months, but had to leave it over scheduling/babysitting conflicts with my mothers BF. 

They (family) tell me I'm too old now to begin college, as I'd be too old by the time I graduate and no one would hire me. But without education, the only jobs I see available to me are retail &amp; fastfood, and they don't offer livable wages, on top of my social anxiety making these jobs difficult for me. 

How can I become financially independent to live on my own? I've already started selling what I have to get a bank account, &amp; studying for the drivers test. I have my GED.",27Aug2017,3
255,"So for a few weeks, I've been really taking a liking to the idea of journalism and how I can use it to improve my own writing skills. I've decided that I'm going to combine it with my passion for politics and the world around me to create a blog with the goal of entertaining and educating a younger audience by strengthening their awareness of the world around them. 

I'm not going to link my blog as to avoid possible self-endorsement rules but if you'd like to give me a bit more specific advice about my blog just pm me and I can link you there.

257,"I live in a crazy abusive household and I am trying to move out. I have an insane father who would hunt my ass down and try to bring me home despite me being 18. He would literally attempt to kidnap me and would attack me. He has told me recently that if I ever tried to call the police on him then he would lie in court that I hit him first. Lol. And I have a mother who he would pressure/force her to look for me and force her to tell him my boyfriend's address (he doesn't know where he lives and tried to get me to tell him but I never did). He will automatically assume that I am moving into his place so that will be the first place that he will check. So I will not be living at his home at all. But I am still afraid for his safety. I have no friends, no family, nobody to help me. And I do not want my boyfriend to help me due to the fear of my father hurting him thinking that my boyfriend has taken me away from him/influenced me to move out. So any advice would help.",27Aug2017,1
