3,"Long, loaded story here. My mom and dad were never married but she got pregnant very early in their relationship (like 2 months) but tried to make it work. Long story short: it didn’t. I used to see him off and on when I was a small kid (think like ages 3-8) but he stopped coming around for his visitation weekends a long time ago. Until recently, I hadn’t seen him since I was 12. I’m 23 now, and I saw him again for the first time when he showed up unannounced with my grandfather to my medical school white coat ceremony this fall. 

A few years ago he took my mom to court (again) to try and get out of paying his overdue child support. It didn’t work, but he told the judge a sob story and the judge ordered my mom to give him my cell phone number, despite the fact that I was 19 or 20 at the time and no one bothered to ask me how I felt about that. Since then, he would text me happy birthday and merry Christmas and whatever but I usually didn’t respond. Since he injected himself back into my life at the white coat ceremony, I’ve been talking to him a bit more and I’m supposed to have dinner with him, his girlfriend, and my grandfather tomorrow night. 

I’m nervous about tomorrow and just how much I should allow him into my life. He’s not a good person, historically speaking. He raped my mother when she tried to leave him, stalked and threatened her for years, been in and out of prison for parole violations, manipulated and mooched off of my grandfather because he couldn’t hold down a stable job, the list goes on. I can’t tell how much he’s changed, or if someone like that ever really does. I also have suspicions that he just wants back in my life because he knows I’m going to be a doctor and thinks I’ll make a lot of money and take care of him.

Sorry for the long post. Thoughts?",29Dec2017,2
5,"I have been working for a large organisation for several years on a number of short-term contracts. I had been renewed several times before, but was told my latest contract would not be renewed two weeks ago. I suspect this has something to do with my manager, who has less qualifications and training then I do and would frequently tell me in front of others that my ""classroom training"" had no value in our workplace. I was secretly relieved to be out, and because I had a good reputation with my work, was offered a higher position with a different team in the same organisation.

I am now working out my existing contract, and my manager is making things as unpleasant as possible. This included demanding I finish my entire outstanding workload within a week and when I could not do so, demanding that I work unpaid over weekends (which would include Christmas and New Years) to do so, pointing out every possible error I made to the head manager which resulted in me berated multiple times etc etc. I keep telling myself I only have a short time left (one week) and I should just suck it up but I woke up this morning feeling shakey and stressed, and don't feel I should be feeling this way. I am also worried as my manager keeps sending me detailed emails accusing me of performance issues which are not at all accurate. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I should cope with this?",29Dec2017,2
6,"I've always been pretty introverted, but it's more than that: I have avoidant personality disorder. So going out, socializing, all that jazz really, really takes a lot out of me. That doesn't mean I don't want to socialize, just that it is a lot for me.

I have one friend who wants to hang out daily. I can't. I need a break. I am willing to socialize but I can't do it daily. However, any time I text or call him, even if we hung out that day, he will bring up doing it again tomorrow. That's fine, a lot of people enjoy hanging out a lot. But if I shut him down, he will get a super dejected tone, text sad faces all night, and ask why I never want to hang out. That built up, and since I know how conversations will go, I talk to him much less now. Despite that, he continues to do the same if I do reach out, and thus I reach out less and less and less. It has factured our relationship to where we talk only a few times per month. I like him. I want him in my life more. But he wants to socialize daily, and I simply can't.

It's similar with family, too. My mom wants 2-3 hr calls every other day and for me to visit for 2-3 dinners per week. Even ignoring my social issues, that's a lot for ANYONE who is a grown adult. And it has gotten to the point where she does not plan with me; she TELLS me when I will hang out with her. If I shut her down, she cries. I hate talking to her because of this. I feel so guilty.

Dunno if this is the right place for this??? 
Where can I go to volunteer (hopefully virtually) to do data entry or something computer based? (I'm aiming for spreadsheet work.. light coding.. checking data for accuracy... things similar.. really low on office scale for skills / experience necessary) 

I have found nothing that fits well.. on VolunteerMatch. 

Im trying to gtfo of food service. Im in a $9/hr job at 40 hrs a week (+) and I hate it. (I truly only hate weekends and holidays but weekdays are not so great either but weekdays &gt; weekends ).. Terrible money but makes sense since it lacks the need for skills. I just feel like an idiot doing such a sucky job when I am such a fast learner for computer tasks &amp; I already know Microsoft Word / Office / Excel
 (but I dont know how to put non-job experience on a resume).

I have only a high school diploma and I am most likely going to be in a wheelchair soon..plus I don't want it to be my career but I want a job I can stay at for AT LEAST a year &amp; isn't too hard on me physically.

I do want a job but I'm trying to take the middle step by volunteering for stuff to put on my resume. I've been searching VolunteerMatch and haven't found anything worthwhile... while I can't find a temporary service for office jobs that don't already want experience in my area. 

Points for small business opportunities so that I can feel like I actually helped something.

10,"I'm 24, F. I see most girls my age having girls holidays, going shopping and having nights out with their friends but I don't have any of those things. 

I was very good friends with a girl from school, we'd been friends 10 years and part of a larger social group, but she recently fell out with me, just completely ghosted me and nobody else from the friendship group would reply to my messages. This was 3 months ago and despite asking several times, nobody responded to me or told me why they'd fallen out with me. no argument, nothing. My ex friend dates my old housemates friend, and I see them all hanging out together but I don't get invited now. It's hurt me unbelievably and I feel really down about it. 

I have a boyfriend and we are very happy, looking to buy a house and we have a lot of fun, but I don't have anyone else that I can connect with. We do everything together which I love, but I think it would be healthy to go out with friends separately too, but I don't have any and his friends live miles away so we don't see them often. 

My parents are divorced and live about an hour away, so I see them once or twice a month but I'm not close with either. I don't have any family my own age or people I'm close to. 

I feel so alone. I have no close friends, nobody to gossip with, cry to when I'm down, moan to, go to for advice or have fun with. I feel like if I broke up with my partner for any reason, I'd be completely alone. I go on holiday every year for my birthday because I don't have friends to go out and celebrate with. I dread haloween, new years eve etc because everyone's going out with their friends and I don't have any. I dread getting married and realising I don't have a bridesmaid or anyone sat on my side. 

It's wearing me down now, I can barely look on social media without feeling horrible and lonely. I imagine my funeral, just close family and maybe a few people from work who felt bad for me. Nobody would really miss me and most people probably wouldn't notice. 

I've had lots of people come and go, from school to college and various gym friends or work colleagues but they're more acquaintances or people id chat to occasionally, not friends.

Because of the way I've been feeling, I've tried connecting with people I used to get on with. I messaged a girl from college a few times, but suggested going out and she didn't respond. A guy I used to chat to lots, had a brief convo and said we should go for a beer, no response. I'm feeling more and more pushed away and it's not just loneliness, but rejection now too.

I don't know what I'm doing or what I've done wrong. I was a good friend, I'm fun and outgoing, always up for adventures and going out, I'm loyal, and upfront, I don't slag people off behind their backs and try not to offend people, but I can't maintain or make new friendships and it's making me miserable.

19,"Hello! I am a forth year medical student who is at a bit of a crossroads here and need a neutral perspective.  I am starting to work on a rank list for residency programs.  When you apply for a resident position you rank programs and they rank you and then you get matched.  There is no guarantee that I will go to the program that I rank first, but since I have done quite well in medical school, have excellent board scores, and have chosen a less competitive specialty the likelihood of getting my first choice is quite high.  

My husband has up until very recently been working at a retail job that he hated but just got a job in his field that he really likes. He has been looking for a job like this for 4 years and is afraid that he will not be able to get another job like this anytime soon. In addition he has certifications but does not have a degree, so he is often overlooked. In fact he was overlooked for his current job but they brought him in for an interview after things weren't working out with the person they originally hired.  Prior to him getting this job, I had made up my mind to rank whichever program I liked the best first, regardless of location, and he agreed but now he is pressuring me to rank the program in our current city first.
Right now there is a program that I would rank 4th that is our current city but I like the top 2 programs on my list so much more. 

The city I'm currently in also happens to be where I'm from, most of my family is here, and I like living here but I wanted to try living somewhere else for a few years to have a new experience.  The programs in my top two are closer to his family one is less than an hour away from his family.  We also have friends who live nearby in both locations so we will have support if we end up at either of them.

My main concern for me is that residency is hard so I want to go to a place that I think is the best place for me.  I don't want to have regrets about where I chose and I don't want to have resentment about picking a place I didn't like the best for the sake of my husband. My main concern for my husband is that he won't be able to find a similar job and he will have resentment about moving. Also he was really excited to get this job after so many years. My practical side says to stay in current city (husband has a job, I know the area, my family is nearby, we will only have to move across town) but my heart says I want to rank my favorite place first.  So what do you think? Should I go with my favorite or should I stay in current city?",29Dec2017,4
20,"Hey Reddit, so I don’t really know where to start this. About three years ago I cut one of my best friends out of my life completely. He has schizophrenia bipolar disorder, and this had made him into an angry violent person. I stayed friends with him because I truly cared about like family. Then one day he said he was going to kill my other best friend if he did something. So I stopped talking to him for a while. Then a few months after that he called me and said he was in town and asked if I wanted to hangout I said sure. So he went to my parents house and waited for me to get off work. I then get a call from my mom saying that he was acting strange. So I get home and talk with my mom while he was upstairs and he seemed to of had a psychotic episode. After that I cut him out completely. About two years had passed, a few months ago he tried to get in contact with me and I ignored him. I fell angry and sad about what I did. Every time I think about forgiving him I get mixed feelings about it. So I guess my question is should I forgive him or let it go.",29Dec2017,5
21,"This year I started a job which started out okay but quickly became problematic. There were so many issues, not really important for this context, but I'd sum up the problems as bullying. I went to work each morning an anxious mess and would often cry when I got home, just to get some of the bad stuff out of my system. When I had been there for a little while, a guy came to work there in a different area. He was very friendly from the get go, and not seeing the politics of the workplace (I was pretty unpopular because I didn't gossip with others and stress made me very reserved), he chatted to me about everything under the sun whenever I went into his area. 

This was his way with everyone, of course; he's a friendly person. In my case though, chatting with him became the difference between an unbearable day and a tolerable one, and then an okay day and a pretty good one.

Long story short(ish), he was a temp and left. I resigned not long afterwards. He did get my number (under the guise of a silly thing he was going to tell me about) and we mooted the idea of hanging out outside work. It's crucial to point out that I am in a relationship. I admit that I got a little crushy with this guy but I wouldn't do anything. We did text a bit, but I was pretty freaked out about how much I liked him and shut it down with short answers. I sent him something after he left, along the lines of 'weird to not see you around, thanks for the chats' and got something tokenistic back.

That was the last contact we had. Thinking about it now that I'm largely healed following that job, I want to text him to tell him that him talking to me was the only good thing I had during that time. Do it or not? I need some advice.

Anyways , I’ve had a major crush on this girl for a while and I’m not sure if she has similar feelings towards me . To start , I think she might have a bf, but I don’t know . I want to ask her , but I don’t really think that’s something I should ask. I’ve been with her outside of school , but only at school events . One time at a cross country race she asked if we could go on a walk together and we ended up in forest kinda lost but we found our way out . Another time I was in the hallway and she started chatting with me and ended up pushing some one out of the way to get to me , and the person goes why why’d you push me and she replied , to get to (my name), he’s worth it. She’s also hugged me a lot and skipped around with me but I think that’s just normal girl behavior . 

My theory is that she was showing all these signs of affection to me , but I didn’t reciprocate the feelings , until I realized I had a crush on her . Since then I’ve tried to show her that I have a crush on her by asking her for phone number and trying to be more “close” to her but I don’t know if it works .

Another major road block is that the person who I think she’s dating or has feelings for is my close friend , and I’d hate to “steal” or “take” her away from him, as I don’t want to lose him as a friend . 

I just want to ask her on a date or do something to show I have feelings for her , but I’m not sure how . I’m not even sure if this is the right sub to ask on , but r/advice , I need your help.

29,"Ok, so, I met someone. Someone who I get on with very well, someone who other people comment that we have good chemistry with one another and are surprised that we aren't already together. I'm 20, she's 23, we've only really gotten close to one another in the last few months, but I've known her since May this year. And yes, before go any further, I have started to begin to have feelings towards this person. Anyway.

Truth is, we got talking because I was going through a really rough patch due to me getting used and then basically chucked out by a girl that I had quite strong feelings for. It seemed that we could relate to one another on a deep and meaningful level, we understood each other, and we both made one another laugh so much, so often. I felt myself slowly falling for her. 

Except she has a boyfriend.

Now, normally I'd just be a bit bummed out. I'd sorta shrug my shoulders and say ""well, there's not much I can do"" so I'd never get overly attached to someone, and I'd never really end up pursuing them for much longer.

But this... This is different.

As I previously said, we understood each other at a very deep level. This meant that she often confessed a lot of what was going on her love life. Believe me, I heard some concerning stuff. 

Now I'll just explain what happened first, and then I'll explain the repercussions that occurred as a result. 

So, I'd gotten close to this girl without even thinking of taking it beyond a friendship. She created a group chat with me and a friend of mine (but he has a girlfriend, so he never really said much in it), but we ended up pretty much talking to one another on it instead of being like your stereotypical group chat. One night, she was out at a party, and sent quite a hilarious video of her singing in front of a mirror inside a toilet (bathroom). Pretty normal, right? Just living life and having fun.

Next, I added her on snapchat, after her boyfriend finally allowed her to after explaining to him how she knew me. We got talking on it, and again we ended up chatting very frequently, to the point where we became best friends on it, and the red heart symbol came up beside her name. Again, normal stuff. Just two people chatting on an app, who happen to talk to each other more than anyone else. Doesn't mean shit.

And lastly, we both went to a party together not that long ago, and we had s fun night. She wasn't drinking, since she had to drive back to his afterwards, but I had been drinking (not to the point where I was being stupid however). She asked me to take a few selfies together, we got our photo taken together, aaaaand for most of the night, she kept grabbing my arm and pulling me onto the dance floor. Once again, just normal behaviour between two good friends who get along, right?

And here's what happened in the background between her and the boyfriend:

- The first ""incident"" aka the group chat being created by her, and the harmless video being sent to me and my friend in it? Her boyfriend saw the chat, and had a huge argument with her. He overreacted, asking her was she going to run off with one of us, calling her the c word multiple times during the altercation, essentially leaving her feeling like shit, and forcing her to delete the group chat due to it having ""unprofessional banter"" in it (i.e. she lied to us in order to not portray at the time that her boyfriend behaved in such a fashion that it gave her no choice but to do it). I obviously found out the latter when she decided to confide in me about the whole thing. He was paranoid to the point where whenever she got a message from someone, even a close family member, he'd think that it was me messaging her again. 

- Secondly, the photos/selfies incident, because that actually came before the whole snapchat thing, but only by a few days. When she got back to his house from the party, the first thing he did was ask if was there. Naturally she said ""of course"". She thought nothing of it. Yet he, once again, decided to start a whole argument with her in the middle of the night, for about 2-3 hours. This time, he forced her to show him the pictures of me and her, commenting that we ""look like a cute couple together"". He proceeded to provide a barrage of verbal abuse towards her, commenting on how he had other women in his job after him, and that he ""could have slept with them"" if he wanted to. He made out that he didn't like her going out with her friends without him, regardless of the fact that she always let him go out, even when he promised her to go out, and he instead left her out altogether. This got to the point where she almost drove home to her house, because she had gotten fed up of being up at 3am, arguing with him over this.

- Finally, the snapchat altercation. Now, as I said, the both of us got on well. He kept on seeing that we were sending messages to one another. It was harmless, we were simply chatting like two normal humans. Anyway, after the whole party thing as above, I got a message from her saying ""Hey, I'm gonna have to delete you from this. I'm so sorry, we can still talk in person, but I have to do something to save my relationship. I'll see you soon."". Turns out, due to the argument, she felt like it would be necessary to delete me from it in order to calm him down.


Now to summarise, this guy seems to be very paranoid and controlling towards my friend. I asked her why would she sacrifice the majority her friendships with people who aren't mutually acquainted with her boyfriend (which accounts for about 95% of her friends), just because he keeps getting angry at her? And she simply sighed and said  ""I don't know, it's difficult"".

She's been with the guy for 3 years, and it seems that at the moment, she's trying to look for the good in him. I don't blame her for doing this, since I've done it myself, but in this instance it feels like it's just wrong from an outsiders perspective. 

To make matters worse, she's bought a house with this guy... They're moving in soon... And she is essentially gonna have to potentially put up with this for the rest of her life.

I don't know what to do. I know I have no place to dictate or try to influence someone else's relationship.... But is it me, or has this whole thing just horribly toxic in the last 3 months??

I mean... Sure... I like the girl... And some people think she might think something positive about me too... But she's going to be parting her way in life with me due to her moving in and changing her job. I feel like I have very limited time to do anything and try to make things better for her... Equally I'm scared shitless about confessing to her in one form or another, and ruining everything for our friendship. 

Whenever we speak of hanging out with mutual friends, I have a feeling that she wouldn't be allowed to do so, An example of this, is that we wanted to go out for drinks over Christmas, but she was always very apprehensive in doing so, fearing she'd annoy the boyfriend again. Another example even, is that me and another male friend might not even be welcomed at the house warming party, because of the tension between himself and us. 

I just don't know. I've never been stuck in such a moral dilemma in my life. I know society and logic states that I should not interfere... But my heart just wants to save her from living a life with someone who treats her like this...

I understand it's perfectly rational to be paranoid that someone is interested in your girlfriend, but still, there's no need to act like so. 

On a side note, whilst in conversation with her, she revealed that she looks for the good in him, and tries her hardest fight for her beliefs. 

Forget the whole part about me liking her, at the end of the day, I only want what's best for her and don't want to see her unhappy a few months down the line because of all this.

But still, advice needed. ",29Dec2017,1

My mom died of breast cancer when i turned 3, and I have very little memories of her. my older sisters and dad do, but my dad remarried a year after she died and the subject was always very taboo so i have not talked much about my mom but am really trying to start making a mission to know her as a person as my therapist says. Just wondering about any ideas that would help me? I know I was only 3 but the life with my stepmom showed me how much happier I would be today if I had an awesome mom who loved me unconditionally would be. Also, she had me in May and in November was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Now Im starting to think that I might have had a cause of this, because having a baby can cause a lot of complications in the body. So this hurts too.

So what's the best way to get over grief? My dad *never* talks about her to me but I manned up and got him to do a bit last week but yeah anyone who has lost a parent or has experience with death, Id love to hear the best methods I can do to not feel the intense pain of not having a mom who was supposedly just amazing as a person and mom. I know it will always be hard but Im not sure how to make it easier.",29Dec2017,1
33,"My sister has been dating a guy for just shy of two years. He has been in jail for short stints (one month or less) three times over the course of their relationship. Most recently, my sister told my family that her boyfriend couldn't attend our Thanksgiving dinner because he was out of town when, in fact, he was in jail. He keeps going to jail for breaking his probation by using drugs. My siblings and I are worried about our sister and don't know how to help. Unfortunately, my dad thinks we need to mind our own business and let her live.

38,"My sob story is this:

A few months ago, my friend (we’ll call him E for whatever reason) got a girlfriend.  As I should be, I was really happy for him and not really jealous.  As the weeks went on, he and her split up.  I asked him if it was okay, but he said the feeling was mutual and he didn’t really feel sad about it.  I was there for him and he was fine.  A few weeks later, my other friend asked out this girl I have a major crush on.  She responded that she felt like it was way too early in her life to be dealing with relationships but “maybe later on.”  I don’t know whether or not that means she’s interested but I sure hope it doesn’t.  A few weeks later, E starts going out with this other girl who I also like a lot.  And just last night, this giant asshole of a person started dating with another girl.  And then I learn that he was actually crushed on by a girl that I used to really like but then she stopped going to our school.

Now I’m really depressed because I can’t help but think that I’m a loser.  I’m never invited to parties anymore, I’m really antisocial, I’m not happy with myself, and I think I’ll die alone.  How do I get out of this depression?",29Dec2017,4
40,"So idk where to start. My girlfriends mom has been over controlling and honestly psycho to the point that when we started dating (about 8 months ago) she moved into her dads. Well now they have to do 50/50 custody and she gave her mom another chance. She’s completely lost it now. Messaging me with paranoid and disrespectful tones and attitude and then getting butthurt if I don’t respond within 10 min. I had to block her eventually today while she said i can’t come to the house. (Like I’d wanna go to someone who should be in pine rest anyway) She’s so controlling that they have an alarm in their house and every time a door opens they get a notification on the phone! (Is that not insane?)

Basically she’s trying to go to court to get emancipated and be a legal adult so she doesn’t have to live there. She’s also saying she wants to move to another city ASAP and I’m in college with 2.5 years left. It’d be impossible for me and I’m not doing a long distance thing.

Right now my mental health is suffering deeply and I feel like this is basically the only cause for it. She says it’ll get better but it’ll take almost 3 more months if she does get legal. I don’t wanna leave her because I do love her and wanna be with her and I cannot imagine leaving her during a hard time. But at the same time I struggle with  good mental health and this doesn’t help...at all! So I’m torn. Idk what to do.

Lately, I've noticed this has been yielding fewer results. It seems like more women aren't frequenting the site. Is there another site that is better for this sort of thing, or are fewer women simply engaging in this type of thing in general?",29Dec2017,3
45,"Before I start off I should probably give you a brief history of some of the issues i've faced/am currently facing. I was born with a really rare medical condition that affects my organs, and I will need a transplant at one point in my life. In addition to this, my medical cause chronic pain that I constantly experience, but I have learned to cope and deal with it over the years. As you can guess, having all of those issues growing up made mature a little faster than everyone else and it caused me to have extreme anxiety around death, but thankfully i've learned how to cope and deal with it to the point where it doesn't really affect me anymore.

So onto my problem now that you have a little context. Well I have always been a people person and enjoy talking to people and just meeting new people in general! Due to my medical condition, i've learnt to not care what others think and am a very outgoing/extroverted person. 

Although this is the case, I have no friends outside of two friends i've known since I was very young (they're more like family) and over the past couple years they have become busy with life to the point where I only really see them once every 4-6 months, but other than that I am always by myself. 

The people at my school are not your normal type of kids and even though I know that I am socially capable, I am unable to make a connection with any of them (The fact that there is only like 35 kids in my grade doesn't help either).They have just all formed their little groups over the years to the point where I am unable to really socialize with any of them. The fact that I miss a lot of school (because of my medical issues) doesn't really help either, and no one ever asks where i've been even though I can be gone for two weeks at a time. I have very very high grades as well and have always just been seen as a smart kid by the other kids at my school, and this has kinda isolated me even more. I know I can make friends though and socialize because I have taken courses during the past couple summers and basically became friends/talked to all of the kids I met, but they all unfortunately live far away and have become busy with their own lives, so I don't really ever talk to them anymore. 

I am just so sick of always being alone. Besides the 10 or so minutes I talk to my family a day, I am completely by myself with no contact from anyone in the outside world. It has really eaten away at me over the past four years (more like 6 years because I didn't have friends in middle school either) and I don't know what to do about it. I have tried to keep myself busy by taking up many different activities outside of school (music is the main one for me), but unfortunately it is more of a learning experience and there is no-one my own age at any lessons/activities I go to. I have just tried to keep myself so busy so that I won't be able to think about how I am feeling. Unfortunately this can backfire because whenever I am not doing any activities and am by myself, I start to think a lot, and then get really sad when I see all of the people I know constantly doing exciting and fun things. 

Whenever I am by myself, I start to pick apart everything about myself (appearance, personality, etc.) and think about every possible way I can improve myself (I have always been a perfectionist/someone who wants to do the best he possibly can). People have always told me I am good looking but I still can't see anything positive in my appearance, only the negative aspects of it. But when I start to pick myself apart I just get even more sad because I start to hate everything about myself and can't see anything good in me. This can cause a lot of anger/pain to stir within me and on several occasions I have hurt myself on purpose because of it (I never want to die or anything, but I have hurt myself on purpose before due to how angry I was with my situation). 

Anyways, i'm just so sick of being in pain 24/7 both mentally and physically (Because of my medical issues). It's really hard to find any motivation to do things, although I still somehow manage to get everything done to the best of my abilities. I just am sick of my situation and want to be a normal teenager like my friends and do normal things like hang out and just have fun. I always find that I am most happy when I am with other people my own age and socializing. Even when people I don't know talk to me for 5 minutes it makes me feel so happy (but then sad because I have no one to talk to). So thats basically my situation. I'm in my last year and am almost done school but I am just so tired of everything, and want change now. I know things will get better at University but its still very hard to deal with my current situation right now. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts/advice you could give me, and sorry for this being so long!!

52,"Hey everyone! New here, but I need some help.
I was friends with a guy for a really long time (let's call him L), about 4 years actually. During the 2nd year that I knew him, he told me he liked me. We had a thing for a week, but he both decided it wouldn't work out so we ended it. We were still friends after that, I stopped liking him, but he never stopped liking me. He made it clear that he liked me, and I told him that I don't like him anymore, and that it'd be best if we just stayed friends. I was really respectful, and an amazing friend to him. I made sure not to be insensitive because I knew that he liked me, and I made sure not to do anything to lead him on. He took any ounce of sympathy toward him as a sign that I liked him. He would buy me things, which I never asked for. I appreciated the gesture but I told him to not spend his money on me, because the only thing I really wanted was his friendship and nothing else.
I started dating a new guy about 3 years after I dated L, and L got really upset. Upset enough, that he decided he couldn't be friends with me anymore. I understand that he felt upset so I told him that if that would make him happy, we don't have to be friends, and I will still be there for him if he ever decides to come back. I was really happy with this new guy, and my friend saw that. He said all he wanted was for me to be happy, and yet he decided he didn't want to be my friend because he couldn't stand me being with someone else. I was with this guy for a few months, but he went off to college and we decided it wouldn't work since he was moving really far away. L finds out that I broke up with this guy, and all of a sudden...L decides that he wants to be my friend again. I am a really understanding person and I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I understood that he was probably upset and going through a hard time so I accepted him with open arms. L continued buying me things--flowers, clothes, chocolate, electronics, etc. Despite the fact that I told him to stop buying me things, he kept doing it. Things went like this for awhile. I was still a great friend to L, I pushed him to do better in school, helped him write resumes, told him about job opportunities i'd heard about, etc. I was there for him when he was having family troubles, school troubles, and struggling with his mental health. 
Then, L started acting weird, distant. I asked him what was wrong, and he said he doesn't want to be friends anymore. He said his feelings for me are too strong, and he can't stand being my friend anymore. He said that every time I talk to him, I remind him of what could have been and he can't deal with that. He again said that if he eventually gets over me, he will come back. I again, accepted his explanation and understood. My birthday rolled around, and he didn't even bother to message me to say happy birthday.
Now, I'm just bitter. At first, I was understanding, but it's not fair. It's not fair that I was such a good friend to him, and he decided that he wants to end it all. I've had other guy friends who have liked me as well, and when I told them I didn't feel the same way, they understood and respected it. They didn't think ending a friendship over their feelings was worth it. 
It makes me feel like he bought all of those things, and was nice to me, for the sake of me liking him. I'm extremely upset about this, and I feel like I was too understanding for too long. I let him walk in and out of my life multiple times. He only wanted to be friends with me when I was single, and when he thought he could gain my love in a romantic way. 
My question is, should I message him? I need closure, i'm so angry about this. No matter how much I talk about it, it makes me angrier. Am I right to feel this way? Help ",29Dec2017,2
54,"I'm 15. Came to Brazil from Spain because my parents divorced and my mom is Brazilian. Back in 2015 my aunt told my mom it was a good moment to come to the country. Not even close. This country is GARBAGE. Taxes are way too high for the income. Salaries are way too low for the prices you have here. Public things basically suck here. You need money to have a decent life here. And my mom doesn't have it, that's why she came here. And well, she hasn't find a job yet (also, she's 55, it's kinda hard, but however) so my life just kept getting worse since I came here and that's one of the reasons why I hate the country. So well, I came here being 13, and I've ended the equal to high school in Europe (Don't know about the US, I mean school that goes from 13 to 18 years old). And made the entrance exam for college. The point is: I don't know if with the certificate of ending high school here may I go to University in Europe (My main goal is to go to study in Denmark) because I've only studied 10 years, while regular people study 12. I mean yes I have an IQ certificate and had decent grades but I don't know. And before even trying to apply to any university there's only one thing I'm sure I need: English Certificate. I will start in February/March and hopefully will end in August or so. And since I don't have to go to school anymore, I feel like my life is so empty.

60,"Hello Reddit, I'm posting on a throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious pretty quickly. Also, WALL OF TEXT INC sorry, tl;dr at the bottom I've gotten myself into some pretty deep shit. If you'd have met me in highschool, I seemed like a poster child for future success. I took an entire load of weighted classes, had straight A's, had a job, did community service, and seemed like I was going places. That all changed the day that I graduated. I had planned on attending CU Boulder, I was admitted and had a decent amount of scholarship money lined up to help me pay my way through. I was so excited to start this new life, and I thought that I could afford to stray from my ""Mr. Perfect"" path for just a little bit. I spent the summer after senior year partying and wasting time with people that had no aspirations other than to get more fucked up than the night before. Somewhere during that summer I was convinced that attending community college for 2 years would not only save me money, but it would let me continue living a worthless drug abusing lifestyle and still achieve success in the end-- I have never been so wrong. I decided to give up on CU Boulder for the time being, and attend my local community college to get general education credits. During my time at community college, I received a 1.5 GPA. PATHETIC. This came after a perfect fully weighted high school GPA. I don't think I went to more than 5 or 6 classes in my entire stay there. I'd attend on syllabus day, and on the day of the final. That was wake up call number 1. After that failure I realized that the party lifestyle wasn't sustainable, and knew that I needed to get away from my hometown to escape it. I enrolled in a university with a 96% acceptance rate knowing that I'd be able to attend, and basically ran away from my problems. While at that University, I met a group of friends that was just like the group from home-- someone would always have weed or alcohol, we'd (kind of) go to class, then party it up every night. Somewhere during my first semester at said university, I discovered hard drugs. No longer was I just smoking weed, but I would trip mushrooms, acid, do cocaine, snort bars of xanax, etc. Basically, I would take whatever I could get my hands on. During that semester I truly lost myself. I lost my ability to interact with people, became a reclusive hermit (thank god I didn't have a roommate that semester, if anyone had seen my living conditions that would be truly appalled), and once again failed in school. I said to myself ""next semester WILL be different"", and enrolled again. Sure enough, next semester (which ended about 2 weeks ago) was different, but not in the way that I wanted it to be. My lifestyle habits had become unsustainable. I have a car payment and insurance that I'm regularly late on because I spent $100 that I didn't really have on weed or whatever it may be. To supplement this, I started selling drugs. I sold a total of 4 sheets of acid, an amount of weed that I probably can't count at this point, and some cocaine. If you had told me in highschool that 2 years later I'd be the local acid plug, I'd have laughed in your face and told you that I'd never touch that shit. I wish I could still say that now. Not only did I start selling drugs, but I became a sort of petty criminal. I've swiped things from friends to sell for gas money, I even broke into a friends apartment when I knew he was out of town and took everything that I could. I can't believe the point that I've reached, and the shame wears so heavily on me every day that I can't sleep until I've hit the point of total exhaustion, which usually means being awake for 48 hour periods and sleeping 12. I've failed once again in school, and this time I'll be losing my financial aid. I have no idea how the hell to get back to where I was, and I fear that I've totally lost myself. I have no desire to be an immoral person-- I want to make it in the world legitimately. At this point, I just don't know how.

TL;DR My past is weighing too heavily on my conscience to bear, and I don't know how to become a ""good"" person again. I've failed in school, but I want to go back. I want success, but I'm making no steps to achieve it. How the hell do I start?",29Dec2017,1

I reply ""I don't really like anyone at school, i don't know anyone enough. Why do you ask?"" to which he responds with ""Because I know this girl who likes you but i can't say"". On a later date he can't keep his mouth shut and tells me who it was. Early December I went to a Christmas Parade with the same friend Jerry (At this point he hasn't told me she likes me yet) and she of course is at this parade as well. I'll skip the pointless information so later on at the parade Jerry, The Girl and I all go to a restaurant. At one point Jerry leaves to get money from his Father so i'm left alone with this girl. I'm interested in her but she is really shy and i'm not so good myself. I'm also really bad at small talk so that doesn't help.

68,"So I have this problem where I feel too self-conscious when I approach people, and my mind just seems to lock up. I've also developed this sort of thing where I seem to have absolutely no confidence in myself. I think this has to do with having been diagnosed with OCD and the worrying that goes along with that. It's hard to feel confident when you're struggling with bizarre worries. I'm not even that bad with it.

I'm not the most social person ever, but I want to be able to do social things without the hangups. I don't have a lot of those ""best friends"" like you see on tv, and it seems like I have a lot more acquaintances than friends. But maybe that's just me.

69,"Since I left school my friend group got smaller and smaller each year passed and now I'm left with no one. I did have a really close friends group it was 4 of us with one being someone I'd known for 12 years but once we left school we kinda just had nothing in common anymore 2 of them left for another group, another for drugs and and we just split apart. This happened probably 2 years ago. Now I'm left with no one anymore and I feel so lonely all the time,Ive tried hanging out with 2 of them occasionally but it just doesn't feel right and I think I just keep forcing it because I have no one else, there's zero connection anymore and I'm left just feeling uncomfortable around them with nothing to talk about. My previous BF the one I'd known practically all my life just doesn't seem to share my same interest and I'm not sure if I should try to rekindle the friendship.

I'm outgoing I can spark up a conversation with people fine. I did once suffer social anxiety and that seemed to be during my friend breakup but now that's gone.  

So I'm at a stage I'm pretty sure I should just cut my ties completely with the remaining 2?

There's a few guys at work I really get along with and I'm sure we would be good friends but outside of work I just feel like it would be odd catching up and seeing if they want to do things.

Directing movies has been my dream ever since I was 11, and me and my friends would make shitty horror movies and upload them to YouTube. The only thing I’m really good at is being creative, but I don’t know if I’m good enough to make a career out of it.

To try and cope with failing so often I accepted failing as the new me and began not caring, or trying in other parts of life like my youtube channel, i came up with a few ideas for videos but ultimately turned them down for thinking it would be too much work to fail and not get anything out of them.

79,"TL;DR: read last paragraph 

I’m not in college yet and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I want to make a good amount of money. I’m willing to work for that. But all the possible careers I want have low salaries. A career in graphic design, music, basically anything art would be great, but the salaries just don’t pay well. 

I have mad respect for people who follow their dreams regardless of how much money they’ll have as a result, but those people aren’t me. Yearly salary is an important factor for me. I would also want to be a skin care specialist, but that doesn’t pay well either. I don’t think I want to be a dermatologist because while it has amazing pay, I don’t like the idea of doing surgeries, and it is so damn competitive that I have a really low chance of even getting a job in the field. If it weren’t for the low salary, a skin care specialist would be a perfect job. It involves everything I want to do minus the surgery, and it’s not nearly as difficult to find a job. 

Every single job I find that I want to do pays ridiculously low. I thought about giving up on looking for jobs and starting my own business, but I don’t even know what I would base a business on. 

I don’t know. I’m all over the place. I don’t know what to do with my life. I have such a drive to be incredibly successful, but I don’t know what I want to do to achieve that. All the jobs I like don’t pay well. I’m willing to work hard, but I don’t even know what work I want to do. I want to make enough money to travel to all sorts of places and live in a nice house in a nice location. I have dreams of becoming rich, I know it sounds crazy and dumb, don’t remind me.

82,"The title is a joke but yea let me explain 

   Im a highschool student  (junior) and I've been developing feelings for my female best friend (sophmore).
We met in middle school while she was still dating a colse friend of mine after awhile she started texting me and i would listen to her problems.

   She has a rough home life
Her mother is neglectful and spiteful
And her father is a piece of shit human being her ex (my friend)  confused and toyed with her (to his credit though he helped her gain more confidence and self respect he's just hard to relate to and is emotional vacant alot).  the more she told me about her life the more i wanted to help the only problem is im introverted as hell and i never know what to say besides ""it'll be alright "" i hate the fact i have nothing i can do to help

  I know all she need ismy support (and she very much appreciates that)  but i always believe i can do something more and that i should. 

   A person so optimistic and sweet and smart doesn't deserve to havet he life that she has.  Worse part is she just trucks through it like a fucking soldier. when the most minor inconvenience messes up my whole day, she just takes the blows and keeps going.  My grades have been slipping since 8th grade but she's in pre-calculus and robotics while wo dealing with all this bullshit.

  The more i began to admire her the more  my feelings became more than platonic .
The problem she considers me her best friend and im actually happy with that. 
Im satisfied being her friend and so when these feelings began to pop up i felt conflicted. I want to take it the the next level but i don't think it's worth losing my friendship over. 
Im her best male friend and she would complain how her guy friends are always confessing to her.

   I don't want her to go ""not you too "" you know?
Idk if i can loose her for such a selfish reason 
Lately i felt like asking her out 
Should i give in to my feelings? 
If not how do i let them go? 
How do i go about confessing/asking her out?

86,"So for a long while now, I've had this person who I'm close too and I to her, however she is pretty much a fuck buddy. (We both mutually agreed that we wouldn't become anything more then that) but we've been having sex with each other only for basically a few months now, and hanging out a lot to the point where we are almost a couple. (We don't really like the idea of each other sleeping around cause we aren't TOTAL sluts), anyways, here's the cat outta the bag moment, welllll that person is actually my 24 year old manager from work... yea... I know. (And I'm only 18 too make matters even better!) the entire time that we have been ""fooling around"" I've been convinced that this is only a temporary thing and that neither of us would believe that we could actually go on to marry etc, especially since we both talked about what we meant to each other at the beginning of the ""fooling around"". Before u ask (no she didn't get pregnant) but as I've said it's been a few months and I've recently gone away over-seas for about a 7 weeks, currently in my 7th week from today. And I've told her that I would be moving locations to somewhere that is much further away then my previous household, and that means it a lot further from her. She knew the move was coming but she's obviously surprised about it coming so soon. So she doesn't know what to do and neither do I, she won't be allowed to drive to where I am because ""her"" car isn't hers as she's only allowed to use it for driving to and from work and it'll be really expensive and time consuming for her to go all that way just to see me. So she says ""end it?"" And I say something like ""well, I guess, Idk what to do?"" (I think she was completely taken back by this because she wanted me to disagree and beg her to come see me) but I've always seen our relationship as something temporary and that it was going to be forced to end eventually, and I believed that she had as well. A few more minutes of talking later and I find out that she didn't see the relationship as temporary ever and that she thought I was going to be there with her for the rest of her life or mine, depends who dies first u know. So I'm stuck there  thinking omg she's infatuated with me even tho we agreed not to be in love with each other. But I know that I love her aswell! and now I know that she loves me too! but there is no way on earth I could ever agree to be with her, through marriage and the rest because she's 6 years older then I am, and I have dreams and aspirations that I want to achieve, I'm going to university next year and I cant lose the 6 years that's separated our lives in order to catch up to where she is in her own life. (If she was my age I would date her, but I can't loose that time) anyways tonight's ending of our relationship has been extremely difficult and emotionally draining for me, her as well, I'm sure. But idk what to do next, I never wanted to hurt her ever but if we keep on dragging this on and on it'll end up hurting me even more, and for the person of achieving my dreams in life I can not sacrifice that amount of time. Basically that's it, idk, if anyone has any advice for me please bring it forward now, I guess I half just wanted to get this off my chest",29Dec2017,3

89,"There's a girl in one of my circle of friends, and while she is nice, she struggles socially due to her depression and her difficulty in becoming friends with new people. Recently, she and I have been butting heads because of her know-it-all attitude on many things.

When I'm playing video games (yes, I acknowledge that I suck), she tells me, ""Why can't you just go 2 against 1? If I were you, I'd attack him instead!"" I tell her, in order to fully understand, she has to play the game because some mechanics are difficult to explain, and she would get annoyed and say that I'm treating her like a child. Or, when my friends are having a discussion on a movie, she would jump in and say how the movie was bad, despite the fact that she has never seen the movie before and is only basing her opinions off of one review she heard online.

The closest we've gotten to a fight was when I was drawing and she kept telling me how I should be shading instead, and what she would do if she were me. Of course, everyone has different opinions on art, but it does insult me a little when someone who claims to have no experience keeps criticizing my work and disregards my explanations of why her advice wouldn't work.

My other friends and I are afraid to be too harsh on her, because she talks about her depression a lot. She does have medication, it's not just an angsty teen phase.

Her boyfriend cannot do much either, as she always responds, ""Why aren't you on my side?"" whenever he tries to explain the situation. I am not one to judge, but she does control him quite a bit (that is, she often tells him how his anime hobby is weird or criticize his gaming skills), and I am afraid that it would one day become toxic and affect the rest of the friend group.

So my landlord called my roommate yesterday and said that every single door in our apartment was wide open (we live on the 2nd floor of a townhouse) - there is our door on the 2nd floor, the door to the sunroom and the backdoor. Not open just a crack, WIDE open (his words). Now sure maybe by some INSANE possibility I could have left the backdoor that I exited from unlocked. But I know for a cold hard fact that I locked the 2nd backdoor that leads into the actual apartment. And our front door locks automatically as well as the door to our town house.

My roommate and I are still aren't back at the apartment so we don't know if anything else is missing, but I'm really freaked out. We live in a nice neighborhood in DC with low crime. It should be noted that my roommate lost her keys back in November but there was nothing identifying on them and she said she knows that the key to unlock the door to the sunroom wasn't on that chain.

94,"Hello, Reddit. 

It's my first time posting on here and I'm doing so as a last resort. I don't have close enough friends to get feedback from, and I would like the opinion of as many people as possible.

I am in my mid twenties. I've been dating my boyfriend for seven years. It's my understanding he is to soon propose, as we've been talking about it more frequently and, hello, it's been seven years. We had planned to live together and get married at two years, so it's a long time coming. 

I love him to death. We've been through TOUGH SHIT together like a parents divorce, moving twice in three years, a major surgery, failed school, and failed jobs. (I failed two years of school, but am now going steady in a medical field major, with one year left to complete, and he's graduated but is struggling to find work). We've always had each other's backs. For the longest time I was convinced we were soulmates. 

But now, I'm questioning everything. As strong as my love is for him, I find it ever hard to continue being here with him. I absolutely hate his family. His parents abuse him and guilt trip him. His dad and I do not talk what-so-ever literally because his dad just plainly chooses to ignore me. And his mother is an absolute mess who acts like a child. Neither give him money for anything ever since he turned 16. No one feeds him, but no one taught him how to make any type of food. 

Lately, ever since the major surgery, he's been off. His willingness to try and put his life together has diminished severely. He's been looking for a full time job for a good portion of time and he can get a certificate that may improve his chances, but he's not taking it. He bought the study book, but has yet to open it. 

With the thought of his proposal comes a doubt. Have we been a couple at just a bf/gf stage for too long? Should we have gotten engaged at five years? The doubt isn't love. The doubt is a concern that I've had to pretty much be his mother since we got together. His mother never taught him how to do anything - he didn't know how to fry an egg or how to sort laundry. He didn't know how to care for a wound or how important water was for the body. I taught him many basics he should've already known when I met him. 

I'm wondering how to stop being a mother to him and go back to being his girlfriend. I've been being his mother a little too much these last two years. I've tried backing off and letting him do things himself, but he often forgets to do the chores, so I just do them, or he still doesn't know how to do something like cook meat, so I do it in order for him to not get sick. 

I feel terrible. And guilty. As a girlfriend, and soon to be wife, I feel I NEED to take care of him, but at which level is it maybe too much? I don't want to embarrass him. It's not his fault how he was raised. His parents were never there, but he also doesn't take any initiative to do anything or to make himself better. 

I need advice from any other person who has to take care of their spouse and who maybe is living on the blurred lines of spouse and parent to their s/o. 
I want to marry him, but am I just setting myself up for a lifetime of being married to a child? I don't want to call him that. ",29Dec2017,2

98,"I think I was cursed with a big heart. Naturally, I work in healthcare, as a nurse. Being a caring person comes in handy at work because I'm there for people who actually need it, pretty much the only thing that gets me out of bed...But in my personal life it sucks; it makes me vulnerable to being used and taken for granted...which happens too often by family, friends, lovers etc. Usually, outside of work, I tend to isolate myself from the world but then miss social interations sometimes so I put myself out there again only to get burned. I simply care too much and I was once told that this is the wrong generation for people with good hearts. So, any advice on how to be completely numb?

Had my first panic attack in August, this was before spending two weeks crying out of nowhere. Ever since I’ve been losing control, I no longer hang out with my friends, because they are “work friends”, pay day stresses me, people stress me. I can barely sleep, I have hallucinations, anxiety and recently I have been feeling hopeless. 

Every day I believe that I’ve found the right path, just to realize that it won’t work and I end up crying. Please note that I haven’t been a sensitive person so this is extremely weird in me.

My parents are divorced and unemployed, I’ve got a small business that is doing okay, however it’s not enough. I pay my stuff, my car, my gas, sometimes food and pay the house services.

Next year, I am supposed to start college but I don’t think that I am mentally ready to do so, also with a job I can barely afford to pay it. I haven’t been studying for two years and it also frustrates me, because I love learning but I am not sure if I want to learn with this condition.

I can’t work in this place anymore, because they are unable to provide the schedule I requested for University. I tried requesting another schedule and they denied it too.

I really need the money, but I really need to stop feeling this way as well. I have gained 13 pounds in a month and half, I have chest pains, I am tired. 

I’ve been thinking about applying somewhere else as a part time employee, but I am afraid that I will encounter the same things that I have encountered so far.

She told some of her friends recently after it happened but they just said that she probably ""wanted it"", classic response to this horrible assault.

I'd like for her to:
- tell her parents (her father is a bad ass and would likely kick the guys ass).
- confront him and his family about what he did (try to get an apology so we can all move on).
- inform the police.

I'm going to go to counselling with her, I think that will help.

What I really want is for her to be able to move on and from what I've read I shouldn't push her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.
Possibly just moving on and doing counselling is all she needs.
Personally, it just boils my blood that he'll got off scot-free.

What annoys me even more is that he waited until I was gone then pretended like nothing happened after, we even spoke a few days later and he was all jokey with me.

That night keeps looping in my head of what I could have done differently; if it hurts this bad for me then I can't even imagine what it's like for my girlfriend.

Do any of you guys have any experience with a situation like this?
What would you recommend I do?
Do you have any ideas on what would help us both move on?

Thanks.

She, however, hurt me many times like saying
-She criticizes my vision/goals
-She body shamed me for being skinny
-She does all stupid stuffs like leaving the whatsapp group often (me, my brother, her) and if i do the same (leaving the group), she says im taking little things seriously.

However, at times, she'd nice and buy me stuff and shit.

She justifies all that by saying she's my sister and that's how she behaves with her own sibling.

But I guess she crosses the line and I was done with all the bs and distanced myself.
Now, she blocked me everywhere and she said to someone i know that im behaving like this because im an only child.

111,"Forgive me if any of this sounds vague, but I am rather bad at writing my thoughts. Often, when trying to talk about this, I'll type a whole post and delete it all because I feel that its uninteresting and not worth anyone's time. This is a bit ramble-y and unorganized, as its 1:30 am and I promised myself I'd post at least something. 
In High school I was quiet, kept my head down 90% of the time. I just wanted to do my work and leave. I didn't have many friends, and the ones I had, are down to 1. Made a bunch of friends in College though. 
One of my fears is that my friends will eventually leave me. People I once thought important just drift away. Work, school, breakups, they'll all go.
Another fear is that I'm annoying them, interrupting their day with a text or post on social media. Even a ""hey, sup"" feels like I'm bothering the. They could have more important things happening, and along comes me, adding one more to the pile of obligations. 
Both of these have lead to a slight isolation. Its rare that I see them twice a month. I feel great when we do hang out, but I can never get the energy to see them again because of work or hobbies (tv, mtg, streams)
One of the few friends I had in H.S. used to use me as a stand in for a therapist. Boyfriend issues, school stress, home stress, she'd talks about almost everything. I'd listen, indifferently, because it was better than listening to the kids behind me make a drug deal. I think this is why I have such horrible luck with meeting women. I'm constantly thinking ""no, that's creepy."" ""wow, that sounds jerkish"" ""she's not gonna like me"" ""no, she said she hated when he would say that."" To the point where I don't know how to just begin and sustain conversation.
I guess the core of these rambles is on how to stop the self talk that has lead me here. How to, in The Doctors words ""SIT DOWN AND TALK!"" please DM me if you feel you can help, not holding you to anything here. I don't even expect this to get any comments or views. I just needed to stick to my ""new year, new me"" goal I set a month ago.",29Dec2017,2

Apologies in advance for formatting as I'm using a phone.

I've gone home for the holidays, I brought most of my stuff home with as well, like my laptop, chargers and my bong. Etc. 

My bong is dismantled into a small case with locks each side that youd ""flick"" open like a small briefcase 💼. 

I inconspicuously left it in the corner of my room, I haven't used it at all over the holidays. 

I have went into town for the first time this year to see old friends that I haven't spent time with in a year.  Had a few pints and a few laughs. 

Came home to tuck myself into bed to find my room tidied by mother most likely, with the added shock of the small case to be gone out of my room.  No doubt when I wake up, I'm going to get an ear full of crap from both my parents. 

Seeking advice on how others have dealt with the discovery of their parents finding paraphernalia.

I'm one foot in and one foot out about coming clean and telling them that I enjoy having a gnite smoke than anything else to aid me sleep. But I'm weary of what to say.

My parents are quite against drugs and such, they refuse to understand most things in life and this will certainly be another example,

I'm quite irritated as to how mum went snooping and doesn't respect my privacy.

My mother handles most situations poorly as she has undiagnosed bipolar and OCD.  

My father has poor insight of drugs and such as the media has a terrible outlook on drugs and of course if the news reports it, it's clearly never wrong... Right? 

They may see this situation as me being a drug addict etc.

My drug use is minimal compared to others, I no longer enjoy alcohol, I have long grueling days, by the time I come home, I just want dinner, watch a 30 min comedy with a smoke followed by bed.

I may try to spin a story that I recently received it as a gift from a family member, or that it belongs to someone else and I agreed to drop it to them when I see them... Of course they'll also give out to me for being a ""drug mule"" In that sense... 

But I have no idea on how to handle this situation in a positive light when it comes to ""reserved "" mind sets. 

I live in ireland where weed is illegal and the media has made such an image on weed that it's compared to meth.  

I smoke weed to aid my anxiety, depression, aid my sleep as well for nagging pain in muscles of my back etc. 

I haven't disclosed to my parents that I suffer from bad depression or anxiety due to struggling in college and general life. 

I am also fearful in thinking that they'll associate my drug use and my struggles in college as a correlation which is not the case.


I do smoke socially with friends. 

I'm off to sleep, I'm looking for a reasonably good way of handling this sour situation.

Thanks

127,"So in short, My MIL whom is stay at home mom and wife married to someone whom is not my husband or her kids father. Her previous husbandnot my husband's dad) died and left her with 2 kids whom the government gives her a monthly check for them until they turn 18. The daughter turned 18 a 2 years ago so she no longer gets the help, needless to say the 19 year old has 3 kids of her own and has been to jail twice and has various issues of her own. So she only receives payment for her son, she gets roughly a thousand dollars a month to help take care of him. So she started this online romance with someone who tricked her and told her he was in Europe and he was a very successful businessman with multiple opportunities for business overseas and blah blah blah. She ended up falling for this guy and sending him money and not paying her rent for a few months and managed to get her and her family evicted from the apartment. She made no effort to try and house her kids (the 19 year old is getting housing from the government) but she basically tossed her kid onto us. He's 17, has no high school credits doesn't care about school, smokes all day and does nothing productive. We offered and accepted to help her and bring him in. He was with us for nearly 3 months and everyday was anightmare. We continuously told him the rules we expected him to follow, not many and he followed none. Simple tasks as communicate when youre getting home. Figure something out about school or a GED or a trade, something to keep him productive. we made him apply to a few places (we asked for months and wouldn't take initiative on his own so I told my husband to force him). We kept reiterating rules and explaining to him that he was in our space and needed to abide and help out and try to do his best to change his ways and live up to the standards we were asking of him. Needless to say his mother (my MIL) never called once to see how he was doing, to see if he needed food (she gave us 200 for 2 months) or if he needed anything else for that matter. This kid was difficult, I would cook and he would be picky and always say he didn't like eating that. he would starve all day to complain to my husband that he was so hungry and if he could please get money to go to the local fast food joint which he ate for nearly three months straight. I have a young son and he wouldn't constantly wonder why he couldn't have said fast food for dinner every night as well. It seems so insignificant but it was becoming a problem. He never did laundry, his clothes piled up and stunk up the house. We constantly told him about it and constantly brought quarters for laundry and told him where the soap and dryer sheets were. the list goes on and on, things were growing tense in the house directly resulting from this. On top of this my husband and I were having our own marital issues, I have been having huge mental health breakdown due to my job going out of business (when this started my job was closing down, I am not unemployed). Other issues were hurting our marriage also, we fought constantly, I decided to reach out to my MIL and explained to her how this was an unhealthy environment because we were fighting on a nearly daily basis and that her son wasn't being cooperative with anything that we asked of him. She constantly said ""I will talk to him, I will bring him with me"" This went on for a month and nothing changed. One day I was extremely frustrated it was three AM and  one of the things I hated the most about him is that he would leave the living room TV blaring all night so I would have to get up and turn it off EVERY DAY for MONTHS. I was becoming insane, so I texted her and literally said ""HI, I think you should be awake too since this is your fault and all. I wake up every single day to turn off the TV I've asked your son to please stop doing this EVERY DAY and he still doesn't listen, so I think you should be awake"". The next day the kid was gone and she's now telling everyone that I ""Kicked Him out"" . I was willing to take him in and try and help, he was extremely unnapreciative and simply took advantage of the situation. both of them did, his mom and him. Am I in the wrong?

151,"Hey r/advice. I'm recently separated from the military after 8 long years and will get a couple more paychecks before they're through with me. 
I'm currently somewhere in Hawaii and have been thinking about trying to get some extra money on the side to kill time. Oh, and possibly some kind of volunteer work. 

I actually did submit a volunteer application for a local veterinarian office earlier this week, but haven't heard back from them. 

As for my future potential career, I'm debating whether to go for nursing first, or whether to try and dive into Cardiology right away. Long term I want to be a cardiologist. 

I'll be able to enroll in the summer semester, and I'll have my SAT scores before then. (I bought like 3 huge study books to prepare.)

My GI Bill will cover 36 months, or 4 years of being a full time student, UP TO a certain amount of tuition. Books and fees along with additional licensing, certifications, and even a tutor if I apply for it. 

I know it would cover my schooling to become a nurse. Though I'm pretty sure it would only cover half of the required schooling to become a cardiologist. So what do you all think I should do?

What about the temp work? I can do whatever in person, and would even be open to something online if it paid well enough. Advice?",29Dec2017,3
152,"I'm 36 mother of a seven year old. I just had a huge fight with my mother, 67 yr old. My husband, son and I were out of town to visit in-laws. We just returned, and my mother and I were planning our Christmas here. I wanted to have our Christmas at my mom's instead of my sister's (35). 

My sister's boyfriend (30-something) has been arrested for belligerent drunken behavior, lies, does illegal drugs, has attacked her, yet she's letting him live off of her after everything. After traveling all over the state to protect my sister, after the attack she took him back. 

While my mother and I discussed having the family Christmas, she called me a hypocrite for having dated a guy with a drug problem in my twenties. I kept reminding her I had no kids then. She told me I was punishing my sister for not allowing my son to be at her apartment. She kept saying she wanted it to be at my sister's because the family Christmas tree is there. I kept repeating that I don't want my son there. The last time I was there it smelled like smoke. A horrible fight between my mother and I took place, over the phone. Both of us said things that were horrible. I assume my mother called my sister because she (sister) wants to meet up with me tomorrow. 

I am all for the legalization of marijuana, as a chronic sufferer, PTSD, major depression, anxiety suffering person. We live in a very red state that will not legalize it until its federally legalized. Our state will take your children from you for marijuana, as stupid as that sounds.

A month ago i got together with this girl and we're still in a relationship. The problem is I'm always worried about not messing something up, that she'll get bored of me, sick of my shit etc. 
I get these anxiety attacks and I'm overthinking everything. The fact that she's joking in these manners doesn't help.
She once told me that I'm living in a lie when i said i believe she loves me. 
She told me that she doesn't really give a fuck about anyone except her little sister.
She told me she didn't need all this (us).
But she has had a history with this and can be quite self-depricative sometimes. She reassures me it's just jokes and I believe her when she says she'll try changing. Recently, she's toned it down a bit.
She loves me, and I know it. But I'm scared that because of my constant anxiety and paranoid thoughts about everything going wrong will truly make her leave me.
Sometimes my head just imagines scenarios of her breaking up and I get super fucked up. And I always consider myself a boring idiot who's nothing special and has nothing to offer.

I've been used and dumped before, that might have an effect.


I've already been to a psychologist, he helped a bit. I was supposed to go a few more times but stuff came in the way so i couldn't. 

I'm scared of losing her, and she knows this. 

I'm also a bit clingy. 

I'm overthinking every single detail, and I just have to stop somehow. 
I've been advised to ""fight negativity with positivity"", which is in my case music, but it's not working out the best lately and I've been under a lot of pressure.
My mom is also sick of seeing me bummed out nonstop, so she just puts more weight on my back by threatening to cut out all the communication i have with my friends and girlfriend.

I also have problems eating anything when I'm anxious like this.

All of this puts weight not only on me but on others whom i try talking to. I don't really get better after the conversation and they just get worse because it's ALWAYS THE SAME STUFF.

I also know to get jelaous when her attention is on someone else.

Sad when i see her online, but not sending messages, which makes me think I truly am annoying, because she's definitely talking to someone better than me.

The idea of ""When convos get shorter with you, they get longer with someone else"" makes me especially paranoid about everything.

And most of these are irrational thoughts, which I'm fully aware of, but can't stop.

So, here i take it to you, r/advice.

I really need to sort this out with myself, but I don't know how. I want to make it stop, but I'm not succeeding.

I know all of the things in this post are a bit mixed up, I'm sorry. If you don't quite understand something, ask me about it.

Thanks in advance.

They live with a family with their step-father I believe (didn't want to disclose the details to me), and for some reason, cannot live with their mother who they regard as one of the few people that actually like them. They have mentioned suicide several times and I have tried my best to convince them otherwise and tried to encourage them to try and sort things out with their family - they called their family (they are away somewhere now) to potentially arrange a meeting to discuss the problems, they never showed up despite an ""ok"" on the phone apparently.

I'm not quite sure what to do in this situation, I was hoping that maybe they'd be able to at least sort something out but it failed evidently. I've recommended they talk to a counsellor about these issues and explained how it would help with the depression, but apparently the nearest place to see one is many kilometres away, as they live in a fairly remote region.

184,"Hi there, so I have realized over the years I became a really toxic and horrible person. Now, I think I have been getting better over the past couple of years but while I used to be kind and want good things for everyone (when I was 17 - 18) I now feel very selfish and uncaring. 

Long backstory:

When I was 16, I was doing my best to get good grades at school so I could go to university to study engineering. I remember my mum saying to me, before a parents evening, if I get a really good report (i.e. all A's) I can get some pocket money (woohoo) so I was really happy about this and my birthday was coming up. Usually if I did well at school they would be a little nicer to me etc. 
So, I got all A's but they didn't give the money they said they would. I also one night overheard them talking/ My mums partner said something like ""we can't tell your family I bet they blame it all on me.."". I had no idea what this was about at the time but, a week or so later they revealed the problem. 

We were being evicted because they hadn't made mortgage payments for months. They had a warning of a couple months but waited until a couple of days before the leaving date to tell me or anyone in my family. So, my 17th birthday was spent packing up my things and going to my grans house. I really believe this is where I started to become the the hateful person I am today. 

My mum and her partner went to live with his daughter and they took my cat with them. So, I felt very alone. I had a cousin staying at my grans house at the time too but she wasn't a very nice person. She was really a really angry and jealous person. She stole money from my gran, stole from me and anyone else she could and screamed at me daily. I would go to school and come home where my gran would ask about my day and as soon as I mentioned grades or any ""long words"" my cousin would scream at me for ""showing off"". 

My mum constantly told me things like, this situation will change in a month, then a couple months, then six months. It ended up being the longest year of my life. It only ended when my cousin got pregnant and I begged my dad to get his house a little earlier to get me away from her. And to his credit, he did just that. I moved two hours away from my home city and then commuted to uni by bus every day for four years and then the fifth year I commuted by train which shaved off half an hour of travel time but doubled the cost. 

The first year of uni wasn't too bad, I went to uni to get away from my cousin and didn't have to travel. After that though, the traveling made me constantly tired and ill. 

During this time my mother got a bedsit with her partner and my cat, thereafter they got a one bedroom flat and my cat passed away. It doesnt sound like much, but that cat was one of the things that gave me joy when I was younger. They really werent fun to live with, they both drank a lot and fought a lot too. 

My mother was offended I would rather move to my dads and commute to uni instead of living in a small one bedroom flat with her and her partner, but I ignored these complaints because I knew it was unhealthy for me to live with them. 

Anyway, while I was living with my gran I started dating a guy from school who was a few months younger than me. I started uni the year before him and moved to my dads after I started uni. Everything was great before I moved but then after he just stopped replying to my messages during the day, wouldn't want to meet up etc. This really hurt me, so I brought it up and said I think I want to break up. To this, he asked me to stay with him and said he would do better. 

The hurt stayed with me though, after weeks of that I felt really worthless. I think my mum taking my cat and leaving me alone right before it had some sort of affect because I became clingy slowly but surely with this boyfriend. I would get anxiety attacks when he didn't reply or when he disappear for a few hours. He would message me then wait hours to reply again after and it made me feel really fucked up. I remember waking in the morning and waiting for him to come online on facebook. Until he did come online I would just be sitting feeling very anxious. Most days he would come online at about 5pm because he would sleep all day and play games all night. There are other things like, we would arrange to meet up and he would cancel because he had stayed up playing games all night and wanted to sleep. This happened frequently. I really should have broken it off earlier but the anxiety got to me and I clinged on more. 

Eventually I did break up with him and I think thats when my recovery started but I feel like a toxic person. I constantly complain about things and now look for the bad in people instead of the good and get quite territorial about people. For example, if a friend goes for lunch without me I feel slightly sad I wasnt invited and I feel annoyed they are having a good time without me. I really shouldn't have any feelings about someone else doing anything really.

185,"So here’s the full story:  I’m a high school student who has had my “friend” follow me for the better part of two years.  Since I moved into my middle school a couple of years ago, this guy who I’ll just refer to as “Joe” instantly began following me.  At this point I wasn’t very interested in making friends, so I let him tag along since I’m not really the kind of person to tell people off.  “Joe” grew exponentially more clingy.  He’d consistently spam my Skype, which I only gave him after he begged me to for over a week, with messages and those annoying gifs.  This happened in seventh grade, and my school let me skip eighth grade and go directly to ninth (high school).  Since he was still in the middle school, I had a wonderful freshman year without “Joe” to focus on my schoolwork.  Of course, when he graduated middle school and was offered a choice of five different schools, he chooses the one I attend and promptly signs up for every single extra-curricular I’m part of.  “Joe” gets worse.  By worse I mean weird.  Before high school I thought he was some sort of sad student without friends and I was nice to him, but I really should have heeded my middle school peer’s warnings.  In high school, he began trying to prove himself physically and mentally superior to me, did very weird things such as bringing a crowbar to school for one of his art class’s projects and flashing it around at students, thinking he’s being funny, or picking up a very irritating “ladykiller” persona (note that myself and various female friends can describe “Joe” using words such as “disgusting,” “creepy,” and sorry if this offends anybody, but also “fat”).  Despite this, what really does it for me is his constant “stalking.”  Like I said earlier, he chose my high school out of five and joined all of my activities.  Everyday at lunch, he waits nearly 10 minutes behind a door for me while I get my items so I can’t see him, then when I walk into the cafeteria to sit with my friends, he follows me there.  I’m starting to think he knows it pisses me off to no end, and now he just sits there and does nothing simply to bother me.  At every single event I’ve had the displeasure of attending with him, he makes it his priority to literally stand within two feet or stand touching me *at all times.* I swear he’s used my location on snapchat to follow me after school.  As a sophomore who’s spent his last year too nervous to make any friends and is only now fitting into a group, talking to girls, etc., “Joe’s” presence has really ruined this first half of my year.  I know this whole thing might sound really petty, but I can’t stand “Joe” any longer.  I’ve been too nice.  I also understand all of the things that go along the lines of “your friends in high school won’t affect you later in life,” but I need this to stop.  I’d really like to hear from somebody who’s resolved a situation similar to this one or knows how to help.

190,"Okay, so I need serious job advice. I'm at my breaking point.

I'm a retail manager and I was hired into my current position to run one store in my mall. 

The *week* before Black Friday, our sister store's (which is a higher volume store than my current and brings in about double the profit) Store Manager found a different job and quit. 
They immediately gave me no choice and told me throughout the Holiday season, I'd be standing in as their store manager. They have my assistant manager running my original store with barely any proper training, as they want ME to solely focus on the bigger store. Okay, fine.
They initially mentioned the possibility of promoting me to a multi-store Manager if the season went well.....

However...
Things are not going well.
The store was a catastrophe from the moment I got there. The entire staff was BRAND NEW, i.e. within their first 2 weeks at most. Not to mention, I had to hire on an entirely new Assistant as the old one quit the moment the old SM did.
Even staffing aside, the old SM left the store in shambles as far as store presentation AND sales numbers. 

As you can imagine, the Holiday season is already a terrible time to hire on anyone new, let alone an entirely new staff..

Because of this, we have not had a single week where we've met sales plans.
I'm training every day of my life during the busiest time of the year, which leaves me no time to do basic store operations tasks.
Basically the store has no experienced or fully trained staff besides myself, and is becoming even worse than when I initially got there. I'm pretty much running a store alone. 

On top of everything, my assistant who is running my original store is also at her breaking point because A) she never asked for this responsibility, and B) she was never properly trained to take on the responsibility to begin with. Therefore, she just informed me that she's looking for other jobs because she can't handle it anymore, and my DM refuses to listen when I tell her what's going on. -- So pretty much, my original store is also falling apart because I'm not there to keep things in check.

On top of everything, they are not paying me any other compensation than my original pay, even though this store is double my original stores volume. And I'm doing them the favor!!

191,"Technically I own a car, but the headlights don't work (you have to hold in the button on them to get it to work, and it's a manual). Through a long string of events, I foolishly bought this car from a friend whom I trust for a lot of things, but I should have known better then to buy anything from him. So the fact stands that I need a car, and that one is kind of a bust, for the most part. It's also loud, junky, and not nice to look at. 

It's negative tempatures here and there is a girl I want to ask out but she lives about twenty miles away, so I need something kinda fast. What should I do? I have a big fat Zero on my credit score and I really don't want a massive car bill haunting me. Is there anything I can do? ",29Dec2017,2
192,"  **tl;dr**: My best friend is moving into our apartment later this week, out of nowhere she now wants her ex (whom I didn't even know she was officially back together with) to join us. Really seems like he's taking advantage of her at a low point. Need advice on how to say no.

First off I’d like to apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes, this situation has kept me up most of the night so I’m turning to you guys for some much needed advice. My (22F) good friend (24F) is set to move in with my boyfriend (22M) and I later this week into our two bedroom apartment. Yesterday I get a call from her in the morning saying she’s going to stop by to drop off the application and tie up some last loose ends with the office blah, blah, blah, all sounds well. That’s when she hits me out of nowhere with this:“Hey so Jake just found out his roomate is bailing on him in February when their lease is up and he’s kind of shit out of luck; what do you think about him moving in as well?” I told her that we weren’t completely opposed to the idea, but that seeing as neither of us had ever even met the guy, we would have to get to know him before making any decisions. She seemed to accept this and suggested we all hang out later that night as he was going to help her bring over some boxes and stuff anyway.

 For some background, jake is her ex boyfriend of about a year. They broke up around this time last year, which was before she and I became super close, after dating for a little over two years. They just started talking again after running into each other at school a few months back. Before yesterday, the last time we talked about him was earlier this week at work sort of in passing, and they were still just “talking” and “hanging out” at that point. She made no mention of being back together officially, which makes this whole situation all the weirder. 

It really feels like this has gone from zero to sixty in a matter of days. As I said before we weren’t super close when they were together so all I know about their relationship is what she’s told me. According to her they dated for either just under two years or just under three years (I can’t remember which), during this time they were super close, he was her “best friend”, her family loved him, and they “practically lived together”. When they first started talking again a couple months ago and she was asking my advice on whether it was a good idea to get involved with him again I asked her why they had broken up in the first place, her answer was “We didn’t ever really fight or anything, I ended things because I realized I wasn’t really attracted to him, I felt more like we were best friends, there was no spark for me, no real chemistry, he was way more into me than I was to him.” These are not issues that magically go away, it’s not like he was a bum while they were together and got his shit together over the last year after they broke up and now everything’s gravy. These sound like fundamental incompatibility issues.

Given all this, I’m basically at a loss as to what to do. They both came over last night and we all had a good time together, he seems like a cool dude and everything, I’ve got nothing against the guy, but toward the end of the night, my friend made a comment-- I don’t remember exactly what she said, but it was something about “when we all live here…” and neither my boyfriend or I corrected her because we didn’t want to make it awkward, but Jake kind of took that and ran with it, talking about how we should divvy up grocery money and how cheap everything will be with so many of us living here. Obviously this made both my boyfriend and I super uncomfortable as we feel like they’ve just made this decision for us and we have no say in who moves in to OUR apartment. 

I’ve tried to give it a little time for us to cool off and step back and see if we are overreacting or making more out of this than it is and I don’t think we are. I’ve come to the realization that even if she wasn’t moving in with us, as her friend I would still be super concerned about how fast she’s moving with this guy who is not only her ex, but also, according to her, moving halfway across the country to the PNW for a job when he graduates college this spring. Why would you want to live with someone you know is going to leave in a few months for a relationship that already hasn’t worked out in the past? Also her comment about “practically living together when we were dating” concerns me as well, she was living at her parents during this time and there’s a HUGE difference between living with someone full time and spending most nights at their place while still having a place of your own to escape to. The dynamics of breaking up when you live with someone versus when you both have your own places are immensely different. I really don’t think she’s thought this through at all. 

She’s had a really rough year, she moved out of her parents house in to her first apartment by herself, has had a run of really bad luck with guys, and has been expressing to me for a while how lonely and unhappy she’s been feeling. I think that this Jake guy is in a tough spot with his roommate screwing him over, and is taking advantage of her vulnerable state to not only get a super cheap living arrangement for his last semester here, but also get back into her good graces. I just don’t get what either of them expect to happen when he moves away in June, it just doesn’t make sense to me. 

So for those brave few who made it through this entire novel, please, please help me come up with the best, most tactful way to tell her that we don’t want this random dude moving into our house, and moreover that I don’t think this is a healthy decision in her best interest at all. As I said, even if she wasn’t moving in with us, as her friend, I would feel obligated to voice my concerns over this anyway. Thanks in advance x.

When my parents finally split up, I went abroad with my mom. Almost 10 years later he hasn't taken a single initiative to come in contact with me.

195,"A couple of days after Christmas, my dad came over to install some gas fireplace set that he got us for Christmas. Then the freakout began... 

A little backstory - he was always a drinker and an abusive bully growing up.  He emotionally, verbally and physically abused my mom, my brothers and I.  In about 2005 or so, when his brother died of liver cancer, he stopped drinking and seemed to mellow quite a bit.


Now, his other brother is in a nursing home - very, very sick and mentally disabled / being abused by staff, etc. So he is definitely under a lot of stress about that... he had mentioned he was going to go over to the nursing home and ""bust heads.""


Flash forward to when the incident happened...he was having trouble installing this thing, and my wife and I were in the kitchen talking to my mother when all of a sudden he starts slamming his fist on the floor, then he chucks a wrench across the room and smashes a flashlight on my brand new coffee table.


I said ""come on, please dont do that"" and he said ""fuck you"" and I looked down at my coffee table which was cracked, and said ""you broke my new table"" and he says ""I dont give a shit!"" and then I looked at my wife and mom who were both stunned and on the verge of tears, and I said ""you need to leave."" 


He said ""I am, and I am not coming back!""



Now, I want to maintain a relationship with my mother, but I am basically done with my dad. My wife has never been exposed to that kind of behavior before and I dont want to subject her to it again. My phone rang yesterday and I could see it was my parents house phone so I just ignored it because I didnt want to talk about it yet - and if it was my dad calling, I didnt want to talk to him.

How can I maintain a relationship with my mother but completely cut out my father? She is very co-dependent on him and not very mentally stable herself. They dont have cell phones, etc.  Just not sure what to do. ",29Dec2017,5

201,"I’ve lived with my roommate for 6 months now. We have a really nice place close to grocery stores and a few shops and to both of our jobs. We are in different departments so literally never see each other at work, which was ideal for me. I previously lived alone for almost two years before moving in with her, but as I was relocating across the country and starting school, I wanted a roommate for companionship and to share expenses. At first, we spent a decent amount of time together talking and sharing household tasks, but she needs much more alone time than I do and has recently gotten a boyfriend so most of her free time is spent with him. I’m really happy for her but it also makes me feel sad and lonely because when she is home she goes straight to her room to work. 

On top of that, I pay 2/3 of the rent, as when I toured the place she told me a price and coming from a larger city It seemed reasonable to me, but now that I’m here and making significantly less it eats up more than my paycheck than I’m comfortable with. I didn’t realize that I was paying more until I saw the lease, and she said that was the arrangement she had with her previous roommate because she (now I) have the bigger room with a balcony. Ok sounds fair. 

But now I’m starting to feel like living here is too expensive and since I’m also not getting the companionship I wanted, it’s starting to wear on me. She has been away for the last 2 weeks and I’ve felt much less lonely than I have when she is here. I don’t have to worry about making sure the place is to her standards and can just be me. Next summer she wants to pay rent for the entire summer at once since she is going away, but I will also be going away and if I don’t resign the lease I can use that money to pay for things during my travels, and come back and start a new lease. 

After living in this area I’ve realized for what I’m paying between rent and utilities, I could have my own one bedroom apartment with even less utilities because it would be a smaller place. I’m concerned though that if we no longer lived together I wouldn’t hear from her again, and I really truly enjoy her as a person, so I’m torn. ",29Dec2017,2

I said okay but had no idea why and what to be worried about. But apparently it is about my upcoming wedding, they do not understand that I want a small one only with my closest family and no big party. They also find it weird that I only got a small ring (I picked it) because apparently to them I always wanted a big princess wedding and a ring as big as a mountain.
Last month we all went to a cabin in the woods and one friend talked to my fiancé in private about how she thought I changed and that he would make me unhappy with a small wedding and other things.
I now have a feeling that they are just mad that I won’t invite them to my wedding or getting married before one of them because she and her fiancé are saving up for a big one. 
I also have the feeling that saying we are worried and you changed are just nice phrases for saying „we don’t like how you are and you have to be like we want you to be“

So there is a known bias against men when it comes to custody issues, and groups exist to support them. What is less talked about (and where my friend comes in) is the women in their lives.

Women who have been the parent to the child, sometimes for years, before the divorce happens and now find themselves being lied about and exploited by the ex wife. Who exists to support them?

225,"I stared blankly at the screen for almost 5 minutes trying to come up with a title and a nice summary of what I'm trying to ask. 

I've undergone a lot of personality and moralistic changes over the years. These changes have brought me these feelings of weightlessness and empowerment. However, I've noticed that I am now a lot less likable than when I was, say, 16 or 17 (I am now just about 22).

I was diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) when I was 15. I struggled with self-esteem issues that largely had to do with being homosexual. Once I had analyzed myself enough and finally forced myself to confront my truth, I realized that I was my own biggest obstacle - and, looking back on it, people seemed to be *drawn* to that. 

To summarize, I was the kid that everyone knew *of*, but hardly anyone *knew*. I was so caught up in my own mind that I didn't see how easy I could've made my adolescent and teenage social lives. 

Now that I feel as though I've removed (or at the very least, deconstructed) this self-made anchor, people seem to become *repelled* by the new way I carry myself. I am no longer pitiable, or even cute. The phrase ""misery loves company"" was never so relevant before in my life. Since this change, I've found it harder to maintain a social life, and can count my friends on one hand. Though, I don't see that as a bad thing.

I want to know how to passionately pursue what I desire, attain the know-how to do so, and make and foster new friendships. I've noticed as I've entered the doors to adulthood, adults are not nearly as friendly as children. I feel as though I've retained some of my inner child, though I've let most of it go due to me associating it with depression and misery.

We had plans of marriage, desires to buy a duplex to live in and rent the other unit, have a dog, and just got a cat over Christmas. Our finances are intertwined. I'm self-employed, and she often worked with me, despite recently picking up a job of her own.

With all that in mind, I've never had doubts about our relationship. We are both good at communicating, and always brought up issues when they arose. I was blindsided when two nights ago I realized she was acting strangely. I asked her what was on her mind (we have been struggling financially, so I thought it may have been that), to which she replied she was gay and was going to be moving out A.S.A.P.

This rocked me. She had previously identified as bi-sexual, and has had issues with sexuality because of some previous rape trauma, which are all things I knew about and we have worked on. It was not uncommon for us to go four to six months without sex, because of the trauma, but because we had discussed it at length, and it didn't hinder the other parts of our relationship, it was fine. I'm not a highly sexual being anyway.

However, she's been in therapy since moving here (which is a good thing), and evidently these issues have been leading her to the understanding that her issues with heterosexual sex is half her trauma and half she's just not into dudes. I empathize with her, and I know that there is nothing I can do to change this, but I am horrendously saddened by this. Every couple of hours I get hit with waves of despair, and I'm really struggling.

I can barely afford the apartment if she leaves, and I will be taking the dog and cat. I cannot move, because I can't afford to break the lease. Also, I have no money saved up to put a deposit on a different apartment, nor do I have the money to hire movers (I don't have a driver's license--crippling driving anxiety has left me quite useless).

Then there's the whole disparity of realizing that I've been living a completely different life than she has. My whole world is built on the foundation that we are a strong couple. My short term AND long term plans almost all involve her to some extent. I have no friends in the area. I've been having a hard time figuring out how to make friends as a mid-twenties self-employed person who doesn't go to school. That's a whole different issue. My nearest family is nearly a thousand miles away, and it's just my mother, so I can't really put too much on her.

I don't know what I'm looking for here today. I tried calling a suicide hotline, but they just parroted back what I said with a concerned voice. ""Wow, yes, that is very hard that she's left you when you were just starting in a new place."" That sort of talk made me feel a ton worse, so I hung up. I'm not necessarily suicidal. I just need someone to talk to, y'know?

tl;dr: Long term gf got the gay, and I'm poor and terrified.

238,"**I am scared of being stupid or of seeing my identity as the identity of someone who is stupid**

I am not really sure how it came into being but I have always noticed on how **terrified**  I am *(emphasis on the bold letters)* of being as stupid as I perceive myself or being identified as a stupid person by other people.

Even right now as I am writing this, I am finding it difficult to concentrate and think accurately because my fear is so deeply embedded in my own self-schema, I actually do believe it eventually turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

*(there is a weird irony because I often think a lot and I feel a sense of enjoyment when I think but I often get caught grammatical errors and that frustrates me and often even scares me that I am slowly proving to myself how stupid I really think I am)*

There could be many reasons why I am afraid of being stupid *(it's almost like a phobia, really)*.

I was bullied a lot **(a lot!!)**, I was emotionally abused by my parents and I had an eating disorder *(to name a few)*. Those three together led me into a long period of emotional turmont and self-destructive thoughts that me cognitively very limited in critical thinking *(we are talking about a lifespan of approximately 10 years)*. I ended up doing a lot of foolish mistakes because of my severely dysfunctional thoughts and emotionally unstable life and I did not do well in my academic achievements and I was alone for a long time in my life and the these factors even reinforced my emotional turmont and made me even more cognitively inferior and incapable and the cycle kept on continuing for years. There were times that even a comment from a teacher that I saw it as a bit demeaning was very emotional for me *(maybe I am quite sensitive but I am not entirely sure)*

I am often very terrified of making a mistake or not knowing something because those groups of people who we like to call ""stupid"" are often targets of severe humiliation from others *(right now, people on the internet LOVE to make fun of the anti-vaccine movement and the flat-earth believers or some people still love to laugh at American people on certain videos on Youtube as they are being portrayed as dumb or with poor IQs)* and as time goes on and the more I learn the more complicated details of life, the more I seem to forgot the simple ones and that in the end brings about the deep fear of being perceived as stupid again.

Almost every waking moment I often feel like I have to be on guard but at the same time, I feel like I am on the edge of giving up because I feel like I am given the idea that there are stupid people in the world and not-so-stupid people and they should not mix and the weak must perish so that the strong will persevere.

I know that everyone is stupid in many things and nobody knows everything in the world and I know that everyone is prone to many tiny sins of humanity like pride and egocentricity *(referencing the Dunning-Krueger effect where those who think too highly of themselves are actually not that great in terms of intellectual ability)*, making impulsive and risky mistakes, not taking the rational or calculated approach, etc, etc ...

But in the end, I am very terrified of this kind of judgement because it is the only judgement that I am familiar with 

*(""You are this. You are incapable. You stupid moron"")*

*(probably any kind of warm positive reinforcement feels like a mystery to me)*

I know that I am probably behaving and thinking like a stupid person because I **REALLY** do believe that I am one and I know that I am acting even more as a stupid person because I sometimes act like an egocentric moron to cover up my insecurity and ""lack of intellectual ability"" 

*(it is as if I am overcompensating for something like when a man with a small penis overcompensates by driving fancy cars, I feel like I am overcompensating for my stupidity by buying books but I never actually read them because I just feel that I cannot learn anything or often too busy fighting against myself instead of actually directing my attention towards the book)*

Can someone please help me? I cannot keep living like this. It is killing me *(and I mean that literally because I feel very prone to just jump off the top of a building and maybe this constant anxiety and depression and self-ultimatum feelings during my adolescence have had a permanent effect on my brain development - which may explain why I am often very stressed and even feeling like I am actually as stupid as I think I am)*

I am well-aware that everyone has their own gaps of knowledge and nobody is competent in everything and I know that even geniuses or intellectually gifted people are prone to making mistakes. But I often get frustrated when a mistake occur and I sometimes hold onto it",29Dec2017,7

243,"I signed up last night, was a little drunk and decided to take the plunge. I can barely talk to people face to face. How it works is initially someone does a text based interview and then tries to find matching therapists for you to work with.

The initial interviewer asked for my preferences and I said I didn’t want anyone who does religious based therapy. He asked for my demographics too. Then you get assigned three potential matches and I assumed they were based on my requests and demographics and googled them quickly and chose the one who I thought had an orientation that would fit best. The other two did not fit at all (they did art and play therapy) but some of the profile of the third person I thought would fit, it was more CBT.

After I picked her I googled her again and scrolled a little deeper and see that she does religious based therapy as a specialization and specializes in a group that is my polar opposite in every way in terms of demographics. Couldn’t be more different demographic wise, I don’t want to say but it’s pretty funny. I immediately put in a request for a change but that takes up to 72 hours and I’ll have to pay for these days. My fault for not checking better before picking but missed opportunity for Talkspace to use an algorithm to get better matches. It’d have been better to just have a catalog of people instead of recommending 3 completely random practitioners.

So I guess the system they have for matching people doesn’t really take demographics or your preferences into account when recommending practitioners which I’d have thought would be easier to implement in an app with so many practitioners.

So I’m not having the best time with the service right now and I’m a little nervous about the next month, but what do you guys think, what are your experiences with it?",29Dec2017,1
244,"A few weeks ago I was in a bad car accident. Other party decided to play “beat the yellow”, hit me as I was making a left hand turn and totalled my car. It is a complete write off. Since I was the one turning, I’m at fault. He was speeding but it doesn’t matter apparently. My baby was in the back seat and we are both fine physically but I’m still shaken and flinch a little when turning.


I allegedly turned down a waiver of depreciation when I bought my brand new car, a literal month before the accident. I don’t even recall knowing that such a thing existed.


Now I feel like I’m on the verge of a serious mental health crisis. My car was destroyed and I may be hosed for thousands of dollars if and when insurance offers me a fraction of what my brand new car was worth. I have some savings but probably not enough to pay off the difference AND replace it.


What’s worse, I really cannot socialize with one of my close friends right now. All of her expenses are taken care of by her rich parents and the fact she has no financial stress has me feeling really resentful right now, and I don’t like that feeling.


I don’t know. I just want to see if anyone else has experienced similar, and what you may have done if so. I feel so trapped and overwhelmed. I just can’t seem to catch a break lately.

Tl;dr: car was totalled, insurance isn’t going to cover a new one and financial stress is pushing me to my emotional and mental capacity ",29Dec2017,2
245,"**Background:**
My parents argue all lot and it's hurts me a lot emotionally to hear it.

My mom is making me choose between my dad and her. It's so hard to choose and by staying neutral, to her that is saying I prefer my dad. My dad has cheated and done other things in the past but he has never asked me to choose. My older sister hasn't had to deal with this as she is currently living near London. My mom wants me to move to Wales with her and I'm currently living in Dubai. 

By staying with my dad in Dubai, I am familiar with my friends and school. I have him but I am without my mom and sister. That would upset my mom a lot. I've stayed in the UAE for 10 years so I am kind of bored. 

By staying in Wales, my dad would be pretty upset and I would have to start again. I don't know the feeling of starting anew. My whole educational curriculum would change. I am introverted and autistic so my social skills are not the best. I also have ADHD, depression and anxiety so a change of environment might help or it could make things worse. I do like my friends a lot but in this day and age I can message them wherever I am. 

I don't get why we all can't move to Wales and I'm sick of letting people down.

I'm more qualified, in terms of experience and credentials, than almost everyone with my same title. But they're paying me more than those people. Job will be a challenge at first but will probably become very mundane. No room for advancement. 
 
- Job #2 - Title is the same as #1, and is for a trendy start up company (that is doing very well). Between $5k and $9k more than job #1. Tons of overtime expected, since I'll be helping to build the department from scratch. My peers are probably a little more qualified than me; we have different backgrounds. Job will never become mundane. Super fast paced. Tons of work.

I was best friends with her, THEN i got feelings for her. /// My friend got into a relationship just over two years ago with this girl. I first met her about two weeks after they started dating. I never really talked to her until around the first summer they were together. Me and her would hang out all the time during the summer. Crazily enough, it almost seemed like we hung out more than she did with her boyfriend. Since then we have become very good friends and we even refer to each other as “Best Friends”. We hang out just about any time we can and I think I started catching feelings for her a couple months back. I do just about anything I can to make her happy, and she does the same. And every once and a while she’ll bring up problems she has with her boyfriend. (Reminder: her boyfriend is one of my closest friends) I let her vent about their problems to me and I kind of stay neutral on the subject. I also notice now that they get into arguments more than usual recently. I’m around her more than her boyfriend is around her, though that is for a logical reason, I feel we have a bond. She always tells me she loves me and if I’m gone for more than three days she tells me she misses me so much. This friendly relationship has transformed in my mind into a love for her that is truly deep. She’s honestly such a beautiful person with an amazing personality. I can’t express how lucky my friend got. Sometimes I feel like she is taken for granted by him and that makes me angry. Sometimes I do things for her just to make up for his faults. I’d get so jealous of him and it would cause me to get mad at them both and I could never actually tell them what was wrong. I’ve actually witnessed two times, them getting into a extremely heated argument, and both times it happened she knew i was there but he didn’t. I wanted to blow up on him but i couldn’t. We were at the point now, that we literally hung out EVERY SINGLE DAY. She would come to my house, i would go to her house, and we did everything together. I guess my feelings become obvious because this month things got really crazy, and she once told me she feels too comfortable around me even though she has a boyfriend but she says she’s in too deep with her boyfriend to mess anything up between them. I respect her choice because I am friends with both of them and as much as I love her, I don’t want anything to happen to them. Just two days ago, though, she called me and asked if I had feelings for her. I straight up told her yea. This opened up a whole new scenario. My current situation now is that she said she cares for me a lot but that her boyfriend doesn’t want us around each other at all. Her boyfriend is also a good friend of mine but she said he is very upset over it all right now and she said he told her that we all need some space. It’s been two days now and I’m driving myself absolutely crazy because I cannot talk to either of them, even though I know she cares about me deeply. What can I do in my situation? Do I leave them be? I want to try to talk this over with them but her boyfriend doesn’t want any confrontation between me and her or me and him. I need help.

Hope you're having a great day.


(Background information; 
My ex and I were each other's first significant others, but I ended it after a week or so because I just felt uneasy that we started dating while she was traveling and I felt no real connection, as I was peer pressured by my best friend as I used to have a major liking towards her.)


Recently I've gone on winter break, and right before that, me and my girlfriend broke up. The night before her and I broke up I hung out with a close mutual friend of ours, my ex, and a couple more people. During that day I spent most of the time vaping and cuddling with my ex. It was fun. The next day I was on the phone with my ex and then my girlfriend called, keep in mind that I was intending on breaking up with her for maybe a week. We talked, and I ended things. Now a week later my ex comes over to hang out, and the mutual friend between me and my now ex girlfriend was there for like the first 5 hours. After he leaves we were listening to music and cuddling, and we started kissing. Today, over a week later we kissed again when she came over. The only problem being that she doesn't think I genuinely like her because she has trust issues, I only started liking her around when my girlfriend and I broke up, and her now ex boyfriend had to leave back go his country. We now kiss and she says that hundreds of guys try to kiss her, but I'm the only one she would kiss, which is true because she is drop dead gorgeous, and we more or less act like a couple, but for the reasons above she isn't going to date. She sends mixed messages and just shuts off everything I say with this one phrase of ""time will tell."" I am utterly confused about what I should or even can do, if she even fancies me like I do towards her and it is frustrating that we do everything we never did, but still aren't together.

278,"I've been wanting to execute this idea for a little while but wasn't in the right frame of mind to do so and had no cofounder. In 2016 - early 2017 my personal life really got in the way so I couldn't focus or find motivation to do anything, let alone start a company.

Now after sorting myself out and going to therapy I'm ready to start networking again in the new year. I have started working on a vague plan on ways to engage users as well as campaigns to raise funds and I'm going to use the book SPRINT to solve and test my idea.

I've been reading various blogs on entrepreneurship and I came across one entrepreneur who said that if an idea they've had has already been done then they won't attempt it as they would prefer to be the first. I've read conflicting points that says it is all about the execution; branding/marketing/user engagement etc. That it's good that someone else is doing ""your"" idea because it means theres a market for it.

Only thing is I'm feeling very doubtful about going ahead - there is a new start up doing something very similar to my idea, they haven't even launched yet but I'm already interested in using it myself. I like their branding/marketing, team and the market they have engaged (celebrities are using it too).

Overall it makes me question whether I should build mine into a niche or scrap my idea altogether and just think of something else....",29Dec2017,1

I'm not studying anything I'm particularly passionate about or interested in. None of my classes are any fun. I want to be a paleontologist when I grow up. I'm really in love with fossils and I love hunting for them, but I never get to read about them because I'm always cooped up all day studying for subjects I don't care about at all. This winter break has been so much fun because I've gotten to read about paleontology every day. I wish every day could be more like this. Also tbh studying is so depressing. Like I put hours into studying for every test, and I had like 3+ tests every week for the entire month of December. 


Also, to be quite honest, there was a test I took a few weeks ago. I studied literally 2 weeks straight for this test. Every second I had to spare I locked myself in my room and studied for this test. Then, I went in and took the test, and I got an 89 on it. When I got my grade, I cried for 3 hours, and since then, I just haven't seen the point. I pour my heart out into these exams and get almost no results...I just don't know how I can keep doing this. :(",29Dec2017,1

286,"I mainly shoot portraits and my clients are people who want to have nice photos of themselves or even kickstart a modeling portfolio. A while ago, I was approached for a boudoir** shoot, the client and I had a blast, and I've picked up a few more similar shoots. I don't consider myself a boudoir photographer but I do have a small boudoir portfolio separate from my portrait portfolio and receive inquiries for such shoots. 

Recently, a prospective portrait client told me directly, ""Your work is beautiful and I'd like to book with you, but I won't be doing so, because I'm not comfortable being associated with a boudoir photographer."" It turned out that her world view of artistic nudity is ""everything uncovered is smut."" I let it be at that and we parted ways.

The general feeling among photographers is that if a prospective client is not on board with something you offer, then that's not a client that you would want to shoot anyway. However, I often see this applied to something fixed like price. A luxury market or destination wedding photographer probably serves a different set of needs than the ones a bride has for a small courthouse ceremony. I get that. But I can't help to think, and perhaps I'm overthinking this, that if there's one person who will straight up say that she's not booking me because I have a certain type of portfolio on my website, there might be others who feel the same way. How much does me shooting boudoir-type photos affect someone's decision to hire me as a portrait photographer?

So, I have a two-part ask for the good people here. 

1. Let's say you're browsing for a portrait photographer and you find my page. You really like my work and you see the section of my portfolio page where it talks about how some people wish to show a more intimate side of themselves. You scroll down to my boudoir work and you see tasteful topless or implied nude photos of women. Does this cause any internal dissonance for you, not necessarily in world view but in your search for a portrait photographer? If so, how can I alleviate or prevent that? If I may lead the witness here, ""this guy is awesome at capturing all forms of the beauty of the human body"" vs. ""portraits and boudoir marketed together is like mattresses and swimsuits marketed together, wtf?""

2. In more general terms: I'm passionate about shooting portraits and watching happy clients see themselves in a new light. I'm passionate about shooting boudoir for the same reason. Do I stick to my passions and say that I shoot both portrait and boudoir, or do I simplify things and only say — and show — that I shoot portrait?

** The first shoot was a client who wanted to feel sexy again after a breakup. Other shoots have been clients wanting to gift their partners with photos of themselves shot in this way, and clients who want to show off a post-diet or post-baby body. No porn, no spreads or insertions, nothing out of the ordinary like chocolate syrup or whipped cream. Just lingerie, topless or see-through tops, or implied nudity (nude but covered up).

My mom really never tells me anything. She carries all of her burdens and doesn't involve me with them as most moms do. But earlier today, she opened up to me with tears running down her face- she told me how my own family used us and how they're not what they seem to me. The situation has my mother heartbroken and seeing her this way makes me feel the same. I'll try to summarize the situation up:

5 years ago my mom lent my already wealthy aunt her car title. My aunt asked for it since she was struggling to pay her husbands medical school loans and that the paid car title will enable her to soften the debt.  My mom let her use the car title in promise that she will return it once everything was paid off. This was 5 years ago. Now my mom wants to buy a house for our family and wants the title back. Last month she asked for it and was promised it soon. Now when my mom asked again- she finds out that my aunt had used the car title once again. But not for paying off the debt of her husband, but for buying her own house in the mountains appraised at $1.5mil. To make matters worse, this is her second house. While my mom, 6 year old brother and recently me again live in our rented house struggling to make ends meet. My whole entire family now thinks of my mom and our little family as selfish for wanting our car title back because we want to buy a house. None of them know what is really happening within the scenes. 

I feel utterly useless as I had no idea any of this was happening behind my back. And my whole perception of my family has turned 180 degrees.


My mom tells me there's nothing we can do now that she had made the purchase and will be moving in to the grand house next year. I refuse to believe that. Can someone please help me and my family get out of this situation some how?

293,"Here's a little background: I've barely seen my sister throughout my 24 years of life. She had a lot of problems--drug related and otherwise--and was dealing with them while trying to find her place in the world. I was always annoyed by this, because our father wanted to see her, but she hadn't been around in over a decade aside from the very occasional phone call. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, she finally decided to show up from Texas, teary-eyed and full of enthusiasm. Everything about her put me off. She was so happy that it made me sick, and she acted like nothing ever happened. She went on and on about her family--she especially talked about her 'bad-ass' husband. It was surreal, because her demeanor seemed so fake, like what you'd see in a Sitcom. She stayed for a few days, and left. When my dad was emitted into the hospital due to severe pain and discomfort later on, she came back. She would spend all night there with him, like what she was doing was special. Things changed days later, when it was obvious he was going to die. Our entire family was there, and my father was in and out of consciousness due to morphine. That's when she did something that angered me more than anything in my life, something that I truly resent her for--she started taking pictures of him on his death bed. I was enraged, and yelled at her, which caused her to leave the room in anger herself, saying, ""I hope you're happy with yourself."" Throughout that day she would do stupid BS like that, such as playing music loudly that my father didn't care for, but said he did to appease her. I couldn't be in the same room, I couldn't stand her. My father died that night, and to this day I resent her for the shit she did (please excuse my language). However, I feel guilty because I know my father wouldn't want me to feel this way.

I know that these feelings I have for my sister will probably never change within me, but I needed to get this off my chest. If someone has any advice or something, it would be appreciated.

I don't even think clearly what I want to say because I am already panicking at that point.

My reactions get sloppy and even though I sing, my voice becomes so dull. 


This does not always happen in my everyday life. For some reason, it only happened again yesterday when we were talking about a videogame with my cousin (which I just reunited with after years not seeing each other). I contradicted myself, saying I played the game until the end when it seemed more like I just made that up. He mentioned stuff about the ending but I really couldn't remember and was embarassed to say that. Even I myself am unsure whether if I actually finished it, but I think I did. Funny thing I had no idea what he was talking about so I looked like an idiot. He's like ""Wait didn't you finish the game? You don't remember what happened to X?"" And I respond so unsurely ""I think I just watched in on youtube.. maybe.."" and later on I would say random things that made it seem like I was not paying attention on the storyline, and he literally laughed at me in an insulting way because of that. 


To be honest, because of what happened, I asked myself whether if I actually remember the story of the game. I realized how bad my memory is. I literally can't remember the exact storyline, and he says he played it about a year ago too (same as I did). He mentioned two games that I played so hard and enjoyed the story so much, so why can't I remember $h!t? As a result, in our conversation it seemed like I  just made it up that I actually played these games consideeing I never told him anything about what I know of the storyline.


I think I always unsubconsciously want to impress people, or at least make them think I have some self esteem or good social skills. I'm not sure why this exactly happens but I have ideas.

I went to many diffrent doctors, but still have no treatment for it, because none of them could find the issue (i've got some more appointments this january, so there's still hope.

Guess what, the police showed up some minutes later. So, while having about 2-3 panic attacks, I told them my adress, my name, etc., and now i'm waiting for a letter from them. Since that event, I can't sleep at night, and I'm still traumatized from the moment the policeman said (they were undercover): ""IT'S THE POLICE, GIVE ME ALL YOUR FIRECRACKERS. ALL OF THEM"".

Back to the hair story: she did it. Today (technically yesterday) she came into my room at about 11 pm. Her hair was almost completely gone - but she asked me to ""finish the job"", because she couldn't reach certain places. I was totally stunned. She grabbed my hand after 2 minutes, put the razor in my hand and kind of forced me to shave her head.

Even my hobbies are not stereotypically black. A lot of the time I feel completely disconnected from other girls of my race and I feel that it will only get worse as time goes on.


My mum has alluded to the fact that I tend to idolise women who are not black even though my favourite famous person is Maria Borges, a famous angolan model. She's gotten upset at the fact that I've chosen to learn japanese and not the native language of our tribe (which is a language that is rarely used outside of the country, and a language that I have no reason to learn as I have no intention of using it.)


I can't dance, I've always been so shy to dance in front of others. I haven't found music from my country that I've enjoyed, rap doesn't interest me, the food that I've tasted hasn't appealed to me at all. I'm completely out of the loop when it comes to pop culture, it also doesn't help that I'm my parents come from two different countries and I've never known one of them.
 

This is mostly just a vent. Sometimes I feel like a whiny baby who just needs to put more of an effort in, but I don't want to become someone who pretends to like things as I'll just come of as fake and patronising.",29Dec2017,17
317,"Ok, I'm sure there's lots of posts about this and I can only apologize for that, but basically I have feelings for a girl who has a boyfriend. I didn't think anything of it until we had a staff Christmas party and, with the help of much too much alcohol, she seemed to give me hope. She was quite touchy feely and she seemed to sorta give me the vibe that she's not exactly unhappy in her relationship, but she's not exactly happy either. Should I tell her I have feelings or should I just leave it?",29Dec2017,1
319,"By May next year I will be 33 years old. My current job is an easy job in retail that I can forget once my shift has ended. After work I spend my time browsing the internet, watching movies and playing video games. I slack off a lot. I got nothing I could be proud of. I got no passion or things I really want to do.

When I was a kid I up until middle school I used to love anime and comics and draw them. I used to have a large collection of comic magazine but I have sold most of them. I still got a few leftovers in my collection that I rarely read. Although I seems to lost interest, I'm still admires amazing illustrations and those with drawing talents and wished I could be like them. Even while waiting to fall asleep I sometimes daydream about being a successful comic book artist. And that ends there. It's been a few years that I haven't watch anime or read any comics. I used to love doing those things and thought I could be a comic book artist but I got no passion or intent to go further. That is me; I want but won't do it. 

I spent nearly 6 years doing nothing other than wasting my youth years in internet cafes playing video games. Then I got a job in retail before quitting to attend college at 26 for a diploma in Multimedia. My graphic design skills was ok-ish back then and I got good CGPA but I know pointer means nothing in creative industry. Before I realized it I already back working for four years in retail.

Recently I got a bit of interest back into anime and comics. I remembered how I used to love them back in the day.

Then two days ago I woke up with sudden bombardment of regrets and fear for my future. I realized I don't want to spend the rest of my life doing my current job. I want to do something better and meaningful with my life. Comics and anime were the only interest I had back then. I'm thinking of rekindling my interest again and see if possible to pursue a career in comics. Please advice.",29Dec2017,4
320,"My fiance and I are getting married next fall, and very early on in the wedding planning process, we determined that we don't really want to have alcohol present - not even a champagne toast. 

It was an easy decision, because neither of us drink much at all - probably a dozen times in the 5 years that we've been together - and we both grew up in families where alcohol was (and still is) a problem. We never go to bars, and we find it extremely off-putting to be around people who are drinking. It was as simple as ""Full bar?"" ""Ew, no bar.""

So imagine my shock when all of the planning materials and websites that I've reviewed outline thousands of dollars in minimal alcohol costs for 100 people (50 bottles of wine, 200 bottles of beer, 12 bottles of hard liquor, etc.), reiterating the horrors of having ONLY beer and wine, and it's frankly overwhelming and a little gross to us.

I've planned social gatherings in the past that were ruined by friends or family who had no sense of moderation and either became disruptive, destroyed property, became ill, or simply derailed the planned event. If I tried limiting the amount of alcohol I served, they would simply leave on a ""beer run"" and then come back to drink themselves sick and tear down the decorations I spent hours putting together. I no longer have parties, and when I celebrate I tend to do so in the daytime, in public places where little to no alcohol is served - and we always have a great time! It's more of a whimsical, let's-play-board-games-and-listen-to-The-B52s kind of fun than a let's-drink-until-we-can't-walk-straight-and-listen-to-EDM thing, but that's how we live our lives.

There have been a few situations so far where people have asked about champagne toasts, signature cocktails, or a bachelorette party, and I've mentioned that there won't be alcohol. ""A wedding with no BOOZE?!"" they exclaim, ""What will we DO?"" I'm not trying to preach and tell everyone that they need to lead sober lives or anything (what people do on their own time is none of my business) but for one day I would like to have my loved ones around for the kind of good time that doesn't require a bottle, especially if I'm the one paying for bottles. We're happy to serve water, lemonade, iced tea, and sodas.

My concern is that if we *don't* have alcohol, my fiance and I will be happy, while a lot of our guests will be annoyed, some will be unhappy, and a few will be miserable. On the other hand, if we *do* have alcohol, my fiance and I will be annoyed/unhappy/miserable, while our guests will be happy but also potentially obnoxious, disruptive, aggressive, etc. But it's *our* wedding, and I feel like we have more say in It.

Is it absurd of me in this day and age to ask a group of people to gather and have fun eating food, munching cake, playing games, and celebrating a relationship without the aid of alcohol? I don't want to be a Bridezilla, but it was such a natural decision for us that I don't feel comfortable compromising. 

Can I pull this off? Do I need to warn people on the wedding website, or the invitations? At the door? Are people going to flat-out refuse to come if I don't give them the keys to the bar?",29Dec2017,0

323,"When I try to go into the account I've been using for months now, it says ""Sign in with your email and password?"" and then two option boxes that say ""Can't access your account?"" and ""Continue."" The Xbox I use is pre-owned, and the account I have been using is one that was set up when I first bought the Xbox, so it might have been someone else's profile before. There was an email associated with the profile, but I just brushed it off when I saw it. I've tried changing the email to something different, but I don't seem to be doing it right.

324,"I'm an English major, first-gen college student, and not exactly well-off.

I go to a very expensive, private, for-profit university that advertised small class sizes and a great English Dept. After spending 3 semesters at this school, I have a very different opinion. They're going through a ""budgetary crisis"" and have cut my plenty of classes and the English Dept budget. They've cancelled classes on me the week before the semester begins. Costs keep rising while I get less and less. I feel hopelessly stuck.

I'm afraid to tell my parents I want to transfer -- I guess I'm not entirely sure. They've worked hard to make this available for me. My parents never went to college, they assume that paying more means a more worthwhile education. They love the beautiful campus and friendly staff. They have a strange idealized version of my school stuck in their heads.

Additionally, I've struggled a lot with mental health recently so I'm not sure if this is just that. I'm afraid I'm projecting my unhappiness onto the school.

A lot of people have transferred out of this school and I can't help but feel I'm on a sinking ship. My closest friends are here, but I don't think that they should be my only reason to stay. 

I've been looking at state schools that are cheaper and have larger English Departments, but I'm still unsure.

What are your thoughts? Is it worth transferring? How do I tell my parents? Should I leave my closest friends behind?

(Also, if anyone has any experience with English Departments in Kutztown, University of Pittsburgh, Shippensburg, Temple, or West Chester, please let me know!)",29Dec2017,1

327,"I've gone out at the disco 4 or 5 times, but I always feel like I haven't enjoyed and I don't  know if there's something about it that I don't understand. I don't like the music, but most of my friends neither and they end up enjoying and making out with some chick. But when I'm in the middle of the crowd I don't know where to place my eyes, where to move and what to do and I end up frustrated. How can I have fun there?",29Dec2017,2

331,"I am angry, lost as to what I can do about my sister and their child, not sure I can come to terms my sister will not come around and get her life together.  New to reddit and not sure how to post.  This is my edit:  He killed himself August 2016.  Why?  Drugs.  My sister does not know how to be this person that has nothing anymore.  She is missing and no longer calls her son or has anything to do with him.  He is on the autism spectrum and my mother has cancer.  My father is living on the last two vessels in his heart.  I am not sure she is even alive at this point.  She didn't even call her son on Thanksgiving or Christmas this year.  My relationship with my parents is rocky because I accepted her into my home and well, that didn't go so well.  I believe as long as they didn't have to deal with her, it was okay if I had to.  But I wouldn't.  She and I are very, very different.  If something happens to my parents, I will take custody of her son I believe.  I am afraid.  I chose my career over having children or a family, but would give up everything for him.  How do I let her go, though?  I am not even sure why I am posting.",29Dec2017,6
332,"I was molested by my brother as a child. Tricked into thinking that it was normal. Years later he apologized, but it still remains a secret everywhere else. He has his life pretty well together, while I'm battling depression and substance abuse problems. Every year around holidays it is really hard to be around my parents with him. He has always been the golden boy while I've been the black sheep. IT DRIVES ME INSANE. I feel like everything is a competition for him, when I could give a fuck less. I can't tell my parents about what happened because the last thing I want to do is hurt them. I'm at my ends though. I don't know what to do. The little voice in the back of my head that says ""just end it"" has been screaming alot lately. I NEED HELP. I don't know where else to turn, as I don't have insurance or money for psycoligical help. WHAT SHOULD I DO?",29Dec2017,2
