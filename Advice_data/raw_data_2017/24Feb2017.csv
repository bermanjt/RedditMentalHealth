2,"Just wanted some advice. When I met my now husband I was a virgin, the only other sexual encounter I had was giving oral to a guy he was also my first kiss. About 2 months after this I met my now husband. After my first sexual penetration I was so sore down there that I couldn't pee. I went to get tested and found out I had herpes, soon after my husband had an outbreak too. My husband thinks that I gave it to him as he's never had an outbreak and his previous gf said she got tested but it came back negative. She could be lying or maybe she didn't do the full viral test who knows. But she has also had multiple sexual partners and so has my husband. My husband had a sexual partner after his previous gf but he hasn't asked her. My husband also had cold sores on his mouth previous to us being together and the only reason I knew was because I found the medication and asked him, he verified this. I have never had a cold sore in my life. is there a strong possibility that I gave herpes to him because he thinks I did

3,"I am 20 years old and still living at home. I am in desperate need of advice for what to do. I do everything I'm supposed to be doing, I pay rent, go to college, and do chores around the house. I've been trying to please my mom my whole life. Everything she tells me to do, I do it. But it wasn't until I was a junior in high school I realized there was something mentally wrong with my mom. 


I took the ACT and scored a 14 my first time. She told me to study and take it again and even got me an online program to help me study. I studied hard and about a week before the test she told me she wouldn't let me take the ACT again because I hadn't studied. I argued with her about it for a long time and insisted that I studied and she knew I studied because she was in the room when I was studying. But she still wouldn't let me take it, and it was one of the saddest moments of my life when I realized I wouldn't get in to the university she had picked out for me. So she told me I would go to community college. 


I have been going to community college for the past 2 years and only need 2 math credits to get my associates degree and transfer to the university that she not only works at but picked out for me to go to. I have a college fund that would help me pay for it, and with her discount for working there I would even have enough to go to grad school but I told her she can use the left over money for my younger brother even though the account is in my name. 


She tells me that she doesn't know if it's worth it to pay for me to go to the university because I don't ""make good enough grades"" because I don't ""care enough about school"". When I make good grades for a college student I have only had to drop out of one class and it was a foreign language class. 


She tells me all the time that I don't love her anymore because I don't do enough for her, I don't clean up enough around the house, or I don't do anything I'm supposed to be doing, or I don't love her because I'm not committed to school enough. But I am committed and I'm even on student government and I have good enough grades to be on it. 


I take care of my younger brother when she decides to go away on a spontaneous vacation by herself. Like last weekend when she decides to tell me the day before that she was going to Arizona with her boyfriend. Which is when I started having medical problems. 


While I was driving at night I felt like I couldn't breathe and began to pass out at the wheel. My friend who was with me had to control the wheel for me because I lost consciousness. The same thing happens to me every time I drive anywhere now. I can now control it until I can pull over. I made a doctor's appointment and gave my mom a head's up. 


She wasn't supportive of me instead she freaked out. She called me a liar and said I was only looking for attention and a way to get out of going to school. She said that I always lie about everything and that when I go to the doctor she said that the doctor will know I'm lying. But my brother was with me when it happened and vouched for me and she didn't believe me still. 


I told her she was being selfish and she told me to stop expecting that she would be there for me. I went to sleep and in the morning she told me she would drive me to my appointment. 


Then today she needed me to go run an errand for her and I absolutely had to go with her. So u what around for us to go and she decides she doesn't have enough time to go so she's going to send me to go. And I told her that it wasn't safe for me to drive. She said that I needed to stop lying to her. It was after I talked to my dad on the phone who is a nurse but lives on the east coast. He said I have symptoms of epilepsy and I could try getting prescription sunglasses. So I tell her I can't leave without sunglasses. And it ends up that while I'm driving there I have to pull over because I almost passed out. And I get there after closing time. When I call her and tell her she is very very angry. I go home and she has thrown all of my clothes outside in the snow. She tells me I am crazy and all I do is lie and she does everything for me, and I do nothing for her but disappoint her and be a lesbian and I have to drive to a spot where I can freak out for a while and talk to my dad. And I'm not gay but even if I was she always talks about how she supports gay people. My dad says I can come live with him and either come over spring break or wait out the semester. But I feel like my mom is going to kill me if I stay, I don't think she's sane anymore. Or she's going to drive me to kill myself either by suicide or dying in a car accident because I pass out while driving. 


So my advice question is do I leave over spring break and go to my dad's? Or wait out the semester and live with my dad. My credits will transfer to the college that my dad teaches at and I only need 2 more math classes to get my degree. If I stay here I will probably kill myself. ",24Feb2017,13

10,"So I started working for this company back in August. I was told the on-boarding period was approx. 6 months. My manager is very 'hands off' he works from another location and I rarely hear from him. When I do hear from him he's extremely passive aggressive. Often asking me extremely specific questions and being a jerk. I'm told that's his personality. 

I'm at the point where I'm past the onboarding phase, but am not getting assigned projects. Anything I find to work on is stuff I've had to generate myself. My mentor has been trying to get my involved in more, but it gets shot down by our manager. 

When we came back from the holidays they restructured the company and got rid of 17 people. I was not one of those. I've never been reprimanded and last week I asked my manager what I should improve on and I wasn't really given a response. 

So I'm now 7 months into a jobs where I'm not being assigned to projects, which makes me nervous. I was told my manager told my mentor that ""He thinks he knows more then he really does"" last month when he requested me for a project. 

In the past month its changed a little bit, I'm starting to get a little bit more to do, but often my boss calls me to make sure I know what I'm doing and questions me on each step I'm going to take. 

Thoughts on if I should be worried about my job?",24Feb2017,3
11,"So I bought my first car today and literally got in an accident less than 8 hours later. I got it in a ditch and got it stuck against a tree. So I called a tow truck, paid the 100 bucks to get it out of there. The tow truck driver gave me a receipt and told me to take it to my insurance agency. The driver didn't call the agency, didn't take any of my information other than to just put it on the receipt. There was basically no damage at all, just the smallest dent that you probably wouldn't even be able to notice. 

The thing is, I don't want to go to my insurance agency for two reasons. 1.) Very very little damage that really doesn't need to be worried about and I don't want to have to spend anymore money if I don't have to. Already spent more than 7 grand for the car and another $100. And being a poor college student, money isn't something I have a ton of. I understand that insurance might cover it, but it's possible there would be some extra charges I would have to worry about right? I don't want it taken to a body shop and have to wait for it to be fixed. I just got it today. And 2.) I don't want my mom to find out. Pretty silly right? Well I have her name signed to my car because it made the insurance so much cheaper in the long run. She wasn't there when everything went down. It would be SO embarrassing to tell her and I know she would be really really mad.  

So the advice I'm looking for is, can I get away with just not going to my insurance agency and not letting them know? I know the reasons sound silly, but I am just feeling SO embarrassed and like such an idiot, I don't want anymore to come of it. And there is such little damage, that it shouldn't even really matter. Like repairs are definitely not something I would need to worry about. The dent is no worse than anything that came with the car when I bought it. So I feel like there isn't really much of a reason to. I hope you understand what I mean. 

Thanks for reading, I hope someone can help me out. 

Edit: I also ask because I don't know very much about insurance and all the details involved. I've always had my mom and my grandpa worry about those kinds of things. I've learned quite a bit these past couple days, but I'm still confused about some details I guess. ",24Feb2017,3
12,"Today was pretty much a wake up call. I was walking with my friend today, and she got 3 guys numbers. I'm not comparing myself to her, but physically she is pretty thick and does have a nice body.. and likes to show it off. But she is also very smily and walks confidently.. lady like kinda. Now I, of course, could do the same.. and I have before. Guys used to come up to me all the time, but it was not the attention I particularly enjoyed. I personally do not like being cat called or stared at in a sexual way, but she seemed to like it. She was just acting very lady like and nice and sweet. But myself, on the other hand, has a pretty opposite personality. I am much more laid back and casual. This makes me wonder if I am doing something wrong or if this is why I've been single for 19 years lol. She has a lot of experience and I have none.

22,"My step-brother, let's call him Moe, is a 34 year old, medicated schizophrenic, who's been unemployed for as long as I can remember. He lives off of a disability pension and he moved out before I was born, but he visits often. When he does, he eats a lot of our food (which is an issue because we're poor, he's also quite overweight), gets drunk routinely, gives off a repulsive odour, and is particularly needy. If I or my other brother (20) don't entertain Moe, give him a laptop, or set up a TV for him, he'll bug us until we do. We gave him a TV for his apartment a few years ago, but it broke and apparently he would just stare at the walls/ceiling for YEARS until we got him a new TV recently.

He's deteriorating mentally. I have to teach Moe how to use email every time he wants to check it, we have the same conversations every week. He can't really carry out an effective conversation. I have a job, my other brother has school, and it feels like Moe wastes our free time, when he has absolutely no responsibilities or place to be. Every day he wakes up at ~3pm, smokes, drinks, watches TV, eats, and goes to bed.

He makes more money than my family does with his disability pension, but it all goes towards his smoking and drinking addictions. And yet he's still really resistant to change, won't let anyone talk to his psychiatrist, and insists that he's happy.

My mother just wants him to be a happy, fulfilled person with responsibility. Her plan is to see Moe's psychiatrist to get a letter of  recommendation to have him moved closer to our home, where she can be his carer, because he's showing signs of deterioration. But I'm quite sure that if he lived any closer to us, Moe would visit us daily, and then my brother and I would have to move out, very far away, at any cost. 

Mum got really stressed out this week, because a mother of an adult in a similar situation (schizophrenic) told her that there is no fix for the way these people are, and that they take advantage of you because you have no other choice. From growing up poor, I have a similarly cynical view on the idea of family. One of my brothers, after his degree, moved out and cut off all contact, which seemed to serve him pretty well.

(Oh and by the way, if you've watched the film 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' I'm basically in that situation, without being as handsome as Johnny Depp.)

23,"There's this thing I've ALWAYS wanted to try, and as a New Year's resolution, I've vowed to myself that this year is the year I'm finally going to do it, to hell with what anyone thinks of me. 

Easier said than done, let me tell you.

The summer before I started seventh grade I had this itch to get enrolled in dance class. So I did, and I actually really enjoyed the dancing aspect, I ended up quitting at the end of that school year because, being an introvert, I really didn't like being obligated to be in a class each week in addition to school. 

But looking back on it now, I still can't figure out what lead me to actually do it. I am naturally a very shy and reserved person, and I am often embarrassed to try things that are unusual for me, even if I really want to. I now find myself desperately wishing I could be brave enough to try this new thing. 

I know that the minute I announce it to my parents they're going to be all like, ""Where the hell did *that* come from?"" because this is certainly not something I have ever really expressed a desire for before. Like I said, I've always dreamed of doing it, but it's always been like a sort of secret wish, one that I've never confided in another soul. 

Now, let me be clear, this activity isn't inappropriate or wrong in any way. It's actually quite common and normal. But for some reason, I'm so embarrassed to tell my family I want to try it. I wish I knew why.

My anxiety and lack of self-confidence has held me back from doing *so* much in my life, and I've decided that I can't let it anymore. The way I see it, every day I put off pursuing my dreams because I am afraid, or because I don't want to appear a certain way to people, is a day wasted. And in reality, nobody is guaranteed tomorrow.

So, yes, I am *finally* going to make this dream of mine happen, and soon. Probably in two or three months when the weather warms up and I have enough money saved. But I really need to find it in myself to be open and honest about it, and the first step is to contact the instructor (and that alone is going to be extremely difficult for me. I feel sick just thinking about it.)

I know it's kind of a general question, but do you guys have any tips to not caring what people think of you, and how to have a more ""go getter"" attitude? I feel like my life could really be improved if I wasn't so anxious about these things. ",24Feb2017,3
24,"So I recently moved across the country for a job opportunity at a large corporation. I have been working there since May 2016, and have enjoyed my time since. The manager who hired me recently resigned and bought his own company. He offered me a job as the company's office manager basically the company's go-to person.

I am torn on the decision since I do not dislike my current job. I like the field I am currently in (Medical Device), however I am not sure if the position I am currently in is what I want to do in the future. I really enjoy who I work with, however there is of course the office politics that I do not care for. I am getting a new boss, and I am not sure if I will like/dislike their management style. I am also concerned about the company as it is rumored we will be acquired. 

On the flip side, I have no interest in the field the small company is in. However, the job could be a great training ground to figure out what path I may like (marketing, accounting, sales, etc.) since the owner is open to me taking these paths. The environment will be very laid back, and I will be in control of what I do. There is only myself and the President (my former boss) on the admin side, the other employees are all manufacturing. 

Has anyone made the switch between large and small company? I am young and fresh out of college, so I know this is not a big decision in the grand scheme of things. However, I am worried about the paths that both opportunities could lead to.  ",24Feb2017,1

39,"Hi I apologize in advance for the long post. Im currently in my third year of a Computer Sciences major and I'm not sure if it's for me anymore. Out of high school I started off doing engineering but after a year I didn't think I would be able to handle the continued workload so I transferred to different Uni into a Computing Sciences major (first school was more of a college with not a lot of pedigree, was always planning on transferring out after a year). I know CS is also tough but it's not 5-7 classes a semester. I did well in my first year programming course(c++) but it was laughably easy as I think it was designed for the engineering program and I guess it gave me false hope. I also did very well through my second year of CS and I was pretty confident about it going forward however I only had a couple programming courses in the second year. In one of the more code heavy courses I had a very smart partner for all the assignments and the exams focused more on theory so I did well. In my third year now and it's very coding heavy, obviously as it's Computer Sciences, and I am struggling. I failed two courses, one of them twice, over the past year and before this the lowest grade I had received was a C+.

40,"In 2016, my life got really bad. I almost died twice from health problems, witnessed two major crimes in my neighborhood one of which resulted in the criminal trying to run me down with a car. Because of the health problems I was kicked out of my living space where I had lived for 8 years. I ended up homeless on couches while sick and while working a job that was 14 hour days every single day for three months. No days off. My boss took advantage of me, used my best friend and coworker to embezzle money, and told my entire industry I was crazy. My pet died. My best friend stopped speaking to me because of the stress from work. Once we figured out what was going on, our boss screwed us over and tried to spread rumors in our industry that we are both too crazy to work. Obviously also we were not welcome back at our job and I was left homeless and jobless. 

I pulled my shit together as best I could, I got a new job, I didn't bother the ex best friend, I found a place to live. I'm still struggling but it's getting a lot better and I'm working really hard to get my shit together. But since everything has been nothing but survival for the past year, I don't have anything nice about my life to talk about. 

Well meaning people ask what's up, and then I have two choices. I can either completely lie, or I can try to calmly and non emotionally give a tldr of my past year. But whenever I talk about any aspect of my past year, people basically act like I'm crazy and diseased, tell me to get therapy and stop burdening them with ""problems no friend should be burdened with."" 

I just want people in my life, I don't want to have to lie, some really bad things happened but I'm handling it. I'm just really lonely. When I keep things on the down low, I feel just vague and empty, instead of living a year of my life, I have to hide everything just to be considered socially acceptable. I don't want anyone to try to fix anything, I'm fixing it, I just want to be able to talk to people without feeling like a gross, disgusting diseased dog. 

I feel like such a social liability that I've started avoiding all people all together because I'm really sick of never having a conversation with people that didn't end in ""your problems are too big for anyone to be friends with you until you abide by what *i* think is right for you"". Every conversation with old friends or new turns into a scripted dialogue where people refuse to talk to me like I'm me, and just give me the standard politically correct party line responses for dealing with depressed toxic people. 

I got this label of ""toxic"", and now everyone who was close to me is gone even though most of what happened was outside my control, and I am doing everything right as far as getting my life together and healing. But people still treat me like a gross but friendly dog, and I literally have to put so much effort into fixing my life that I don't have other things going on to tell people when they ask about my life. 

I don't know what to do, I guess I don't expect anyone here to know what to do either. I just feel super lonely. ",24Feb2017,7

It turns out my friend also had a crush on this girl and he chose to tell her how he felt after I had asked her out. And he had the idea to lie to me.

When I guess he felt guilty because he decided to tell me what he did one month afterwards.

Except he didn't seem to be doing it for our 'friendship"" rather he needed to forgive himself (he literally said he forgave himself just for telling me, like that totally rights your wrongs). 

I don't whether or not I should try and move past this or not.

46,"This girl in my math class this semester flirted with me and I got her number and started texting her. I felt like a stud and was super into her but she ended up rejecting me about five days later by telling me she was ""seeing someone"".

A couple weeks later, she is still acting interested. She turns her whole body towards me when the teacher is on the other side of the room, watching me out of the corner of her eye and quickly darts it back when I look at her. I'm not sure what to do. I could be misreading the signs but then again when I got her number a couple of weeks ago she was acting the same way. I remember that I was really into her a couple of weeks ago and she rejected me in a really shitty way. I want nothing to do with someone who told me they were ""seeing someone"" after they had been texting me and flirting with me, but she has a way of playing with my emotions and if she is flirting with me I'll probably start dating her again.

When she walks in, the first thing she yells without asking about details or anything is ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?!?!? I DID NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO DO THAT. GET OUT OF MY FACE AND MY ROOM AND DON'T COME BACK EVER AGAIN."" This left my class and I stunned, my friend even thought she was joking because he never thought a teacher would say that. This isn't even the first time this has happened. When someone visited my class 5 minutes before class ended to give someone a teddy bear for valentine's day, she acted in similar fashion by yelling like a child in front of our class, embarrassing this poor girl in front of my classmates. Also, she acted like a 7 year old girl when I fell asleep in her class, yelling at the top of her lungs that I should not sleep, let alone in her class. I'm not sure if everybody who has her agrees with my opinion, but I believe she has taken it too far and is being far too disrespectful to the students that have her. Has she taken it too far? If so, how should I approach this problem? I'd prefer not to talk about this with her 1 on 1 because she might even yell at me too.

She is already really down on herself. But then my mom gets mad and super antagonistic... Today, for example, my sister asked about seeing a friend tomorrow afternoon. She has a piano performance the day after next, and my mom started antagonizing her as soon as she asked, claiming that she should forget about being a professional pianist, and that she doesn't take being a musician seriously enough (to clarify: my sister loves piano, my mom isn't forcing her to play, but it also isn't her entire life, like some other kids). My sister tried to respond, but then my mom started claiming that she (sister) doesn't even understand what she (mom) was saying, and telling her that she was just being a smart ass. Given that my sister is already having friend problems, I thought it was great that she was asking to have someone over. My mom antagonizes other people in our family (she consistently complains about being tired and working super hard, and then goes around saying that I don't work hard enough and that my college schedule is super easy, even when I feel like I am working my ass off. She does the same sort of thing to my dad) so my sister is not the only one treated in this way. I just don't know what to do.

Drake never fails to get on my nerves. Since I have known him and Anna, he has shown only disrespect for me and my relationship with Anna. The friend circle including them both, he has no problem with anyone else... Long story short he hates me. I don't know why. When I knew him (I don't talk to him anymore because of how much of an asshole he was to me) I haven't done anything that deserves mistreatment -- I tried being friendly and he rejected that. He's just an all around prick. If it illustrates my point, he helped his friend hit on Anna in while I was there next to her, and laughed at me like I was going to lose her. (I almost did)

What drives me nuts is how my girlfriend thinks of him. She still thinks he's a cool guy. I've talked to her about his attitude to me and she still didn't change her opinion. She speaks highly of him and whenever she's not with me, she's hanging out with him. I don't think she's cheating, I don't have a reason to.

Hey, well I have some weird sleeping problem that I've had for years and even though there's ""national"" (kind of) health care in my country, I haven't been getting adequate medical treatment and I had to battle through years of not being taken seriously and the like, or being misdiagnosed as having a ""mental illness"" all of the time and apparently not taken seriously because ""sleeping disorders"" are not real or something to most of the medical community. A lot of doctors have told me ""just stop doing it"" and even ones that kinda understand still think i am just lazy or something.

Anyway, I used to think it was delayed sleep phase syndrome and why it's a bit of an issue I have, I think it's more like sleep apnea or something, or something weird like that. Actually yeah, pretty sure it's sleep apnea, the most common of them all. I um...it's kinda ruined my life.

Today, a customer came in and wanted to do a 2 line activation (first time I ever did a 2 line). Anyways, you can only do 1 line at a time. I ran her credit on the 2 providers we do, and she didn't qualify. I then logged into another store in our market that had Sprint (way more lenient on credit), and she was approved for that line with the deposit. I told her I can meet her at another store.

I met her at the other store, the systems were down. So I sent her over to another store. When she got there, she found out that  she has to put the down payment on BOTH phones. I ended up telling her (because I thought so) that if she put the down payment on Line 1, than Line 2 should be good to go.

79,"First off, I want to apologize in advance for this long explanation, but it's the only way I can get an honest opinion about this situation.

I've been renting a lower flat for about a year within a large metro suburb, everything seems normal enough, except for my neighbor. When I first moved in, the house next door seemed abandoned. There were cars with flat tires, the lawn was left unkempt, and otherwise no activity whatsoever. It was obvious that some sort of family has lived there prior, with children toys, and junk about. After a few months, suddenly an entire family moved in. They did this weird pattern of moving into the house for short periods of time and then they go somewhere for a long time. I noticed my neighbor acting strangely, and mainly is active during the late night, indiscriminate of weekday or weekend.
(About us) I have tried to interact with the guy, but he puts off a very unfriendly vibe, stare and all. For your perspective, I [25/f] live with 2 others [24/F][23/M], all of us are college students living pretty basic lives. We also have a small puggle dog. Himself and others '""living at the house"" pretty much keep their distance, (and for the record hate our dog). We respect their privacy as much as we want our own.
(My suspicions about them) -On the earlier side of their residency, they would burn some sort of campfire thing on their porch. The little stove would burn this awful stench of burning rubber or plastic, and would leach onto clothes. They burn this shit consistently on their porch only at night when there is no reason for them to burn it at all.

-There are so many random people coming in and out of the house, all with different cars outside. This is more odd, since there are many days where there is no activity at the property.
-There is only one man that I have seen on the property consistently, we can call him Zeke. Zeke is a mid/late-thirties ""construction worker"". He is either with his ""wife and child"" or a group of male peers.

-The wife and child have never stayed at the home for more than a day or so. When they are there, they are picked up by a car every morning and taken somewhere. The only reason I know this is because the car honks a few times as soon as it pulls up, and then drives away. This goes on for a few days, but then you won't see her for weeks, almost as you forgot Zeke had a ""wife"".
-When the wife and child are not home, Zeke takes on another persona. There are groups of women that come over. They are either smoking hookah in the garage or smoking on the front porch. It seems so random to see these people here and they are definitely not friendly, judging by the stare they give you. It's just odd that you don't see the wife more often being active on the property, except you see groups of women doing random shit. (I'm not judging their family dynamics, but there's something really off about this man aka Zeke)

-He brings men over too, and they do random construction on the property. They have all these particular building materials laid out in front of the garage, since forever. They only work at night as if they are hiding whatever they are building.

-I mentioned how they are very active during late hours of the night (11pm-4am). They would be drilling and cutting random shit in their garage, and they built some make-shift wood burner out of (no joke) scrap metal.

-They seem to spend almost all their time on the property in their small garage. Living in your garage is not exactly a seasonal thing here in Michigan. It has been freezing this winter. What is most concerning of recent is that they are outside in the garage in the cold with a few young babies.

-This leads to an even more suspect behavior. All winter long, their fucking air conditioner has been running non-stop. During the snow and ice, it's on, as if they really like the cold just live outside, oh wait. Either way, it makes no fucking sense to have it on.

-Some other things I find curious; when the wife and child are at home, a car alarm from their Beatle goes off constantly. You will hear this thing go off during random times at night, then go off so fucking early in the morning.

-I really just want to reiterate that none of this behavior is normal to my neighborhood. Even a previous renter that lived upstairs would tell me how weird our neighbors would be. My suspicions have first lead me to think this guy Zeke is doing something drug related as he is running the air conditioner constantly. Or could it be something else besides drugs? It is obvious to me that this house is being used for something, and the people here are putting on some sort of apperance.


Reddit, I'm asking for your help. I want to call the police, but I'm afraid of wasting their time on something that could all just be justifiable. Is there something fishy going on here? Should I contact the police to investigate? What would I even say?


tldr: Neighbors acting super weird. Random people doing construction, led by one man, Zeke. Suspicious activity makes me wonder if I should call the cops or forget about it and mind my own business.

81,"I've had roommates and shared living arrangements in the past, but they were always imposed by a dorm so I never had to seek out my own roommates. I've been planning to just live alone because I'm *so* introverted and particular about my personal space, but I really need to save money.

I'm a 29/F grad student, a night-owl who likes to be in her own room or the kitchen, but happily wears headphones and generally makes very little noise. In fact, I *despise* noise. I also don't like anything unannounced, so in the past if a roommate has a friend over that I wasn't expecting, even if just for an afternoon study session, it throws off my groove and makes me very uncomfortable in my own home. While I consider myself a friendly person, I am not usually looking to make friends and past roommates have described me as stand-offish, cold, and always seeming to be annoyed. (Which is true in many instances . . .) I'm also a neat-freak and obsessive organizer. 

So given this I've always thought ""I can't live with a roommate."" and maybe that's true. My ""expectations"" regarding noise, company, cleanliness, socializing, etc. are probably unfair to anyone who isn't just like me. In which case, is that what I need to do if I find a roommate is find someone just like me? Tips for my situation?

82,"I am a 22 year old who is having really bad problems with my family as of late. I must warn you, this will be long but I shall leave a TL;DR at the bottom.


My life has always felt far from normal. My mom was 15 when she had me, and my dad was 18. Its under my suspicion and my friends that she was the ""other woman"" in a relationship with him as he has a daughter I have never met; though I have never met or spoke to him either, and she is little younger than myself. 
She and my family never spoke to me about my father even when asked until I was 15, I was going through a rough time and she only told me after my first visit to a mental hospital after I tried to kill myself at a railroad. My mother always visited me and everyone thought she was the greatest mom ever, but any subsequent visits to the hospital she always yelled horrible things at me and by the time we got home never bothered to ask how I was doing or looked into the matter really.


At a young age, she wasn't home often and when she was upset or I did something bad she would put me in the trash can as punishment. Throughout elementary school she reached points where she would chase me around the house with her fist raised and punch and slap me if she caught me, she even threw me in the garage and locked me in one time though this was temporary at the very least. The last thing that really happened with her was after we moved into a new house, she did the same chasing stuff and locked me out of the house for roughly 5-7 hours because I was almost done watching a tv show I wanted to finish (it had 2 minutes left) but she wanted to watch a tv show when it came on time even though she was recording it anyways. I also remember she came off as cold a lot. I didn't know it but I think I was very depressed and would often ask her why she didn't kill me already when we fought, she simply said ""It's illegal to do and if I did kill you I'd go to jail.""


Eventually I started getting very depressed in between school and bullying, having reoccurring sexual and physical abuse for 2 years on and off with a family friend a year older than me, my mom's words and actions, and the loss of contact with what friends I had. She pretty much stopped after I couldn't stand it anymore and threw a text book at her chest as hard as I could one day, we were having a huge fight and she just left after that. I realize that was not the right way and have never been physically violent before otherwise. We made up eventually, but she was distant as usual and always put on a face in front of everyone and me like things were great so people would like her. There is no love from her really, she doesn't seem to like me calling her mom so I had always referred to her by her name since birth and I can't think of one time she has ever hugged me or told me she loved me, though this kind of attitude was never encouraged in my family anyways and hugging anyone for whatever reason was always something seen as really awkward or very strange. It wasn't until later too, I learned a lot more about things with her, such as how she had loan sharks coming to our house a lot and that I wasn't really allowed to leave in case they kidnapped me or something for one example.





My grandmother has also contributed to things in my life. She had spoiled me throughout my life, thinking she could buy my love and attention with money and material things. She always had this pessimism and passive aggressive attitude towards things. If I didn't do something for her she'd say she was going to die soon and that this would be the last thing I remember, not helping her with whatever she wanted. She guilt trips people into doing things for her, and when I met my wife she pointed out to me how I was something like a pet or houseboy to my mom and grandmother. Neither of them have been supportive of me, I was big into anime and wanted to cosplay but they frowned upon it. I was never interested in high school or college really because they acted like my education was unimportant and didn't encourage me to do anything. When I had almost no contact with friends for 4 years and was living hotel to hotel and eventually settling in a room I almost never left other than to see my grandmother, she was content with that because I would always be able to do what she wanted and talk to her, though she never took an interest when I talked about something that I liked. She wanted me to learn to drive, but no one wanted to help me learn. They said I should do it on my own, and get a car. They never encouraged me to get a job, and they didn't want me to because I wouldn't be home to be at their beckon. If I ever did get a job or something though, they wanted me to buy them a house.
(Also I must add; and apologize for being all over the place with this, I have a grandfather who is a workaholic. I rarely see him but he is a great man who also frowns upon my grandmother and my mom and has been very helpful and encouraging during this time in my life and actually wants to see me succeed. I do not see him often as he works very often all over the place and sleeps as soon as he gets home.)


Eventually I met my first real girlfriend after having a ""relationship"" with someone who wanted to cut me open and drink my blood, impregnate her asap at the age of 16, but didn't at the same time as she was constantly seeing other men at parties and telling me about her experiences every time we hung out and how cute every guy she saw was besides her 64th boyfriend, me.
Then I got in a ""relationship"" with someone who didn't really care much about me, sent nudes to other guys, and only got with me based on a friends advice to get back with her ex and in exchange if she got back as a result of his plan, she would do stuff with her friends dog and let him watch. After I broke up with them, my family never cared or wanted to know much about them, never asked how I was doing, it is kind of the same with my marriage to this day.


Anyways, when my girlfriend entered the picture she also came from a toxic family and ended up moving in with my family. From day one my mom hated her and my grandma was less than thrilled. We ended up getting into a relationship over time and although things were very rocky for a few years we have worked them out very well and eventually got married last year.
Anyways, I do not know where their mindset is here, but my wife and I believe they may be a bit racist, I could be wrong though (she is not white and they kept emphasizing they were okay with it though we never asked them if it was okay). We had many problems early in our relationship, lots of arguing and fighting but we always got through it together. Her mother and our friends were there if we needed someone to talk to and they wanted to hear both sides of the story, they never judged and gave great advice. My family would take a offensive stance and say to kick her out and break up, she is not worth the time and is a horrible person.
Outside of these things my wife was surprised by how my life was going, and noted I seemed to dissociate from reality often for the first year of us knowing each other like as if my mind completely left my body and I stared motionless at nothing in particular for long periods of time. She taught me how to drive, got me to get a job, get into college, and turned my life around. Eventually we moved in with my wifes mom and my family was very upset with me, and they were already upset because they didn't like the job I was at and wanted me to quit or the time I spent in college. Car was fine though, because now I can drive them around.


Right before our marriage date, we learned we have a baby on the way too. For both accounts, my family was less than thrilled or excited, not really any congratulations and a lot of comments like ""I could use a great grandchild, sure would be nice to do things together, yeah."" (I had gone out with them from time to time every so often still, so it's not like I was ignoring them) and overall just a lot of unpleasentries. My grandmother eventually demanded after our baby is born to drive about 700 miles to take a family photo with my great grandparents before they die or she would disown me completely. She wanted me to bring the baby but not my wife. After a bit of talking she retracted that though I imagine reluctantly, it was really... It didn't sound or feel right to me. My wife is a very kind hearted and amazing person. She has no car currently and that's only because over a year ago she gave all her savings to my mom to pay an expensive bill for the gas because my stepdad (who I hardly know and my mom already dropped in less than 5 years (also first dad of any sorts in my life other than my grandfather) was doing something to bypass them from blocking our gas, cutting the lock or something.



Anyways, we eventually discreetly married a few months later, but as we couldn't do anything big and fancy we decided to hold off on telling people or anything. After a few months, she said I should let my family know, they would be the first people to know this after also complaining they weren't the first to know of us having a baby. I told my grandma who seemed alright with it and was taking it actually pretty well. We made plans to have lunch with my wife as well and in general just work things out as my wife wants to have some sort of positive relationship with them. Then my wife noticed I got a text from her 30 minutes after I left saying she doesn't want lunch, or to talk to me or have anything with me anymore.
I feel so betrayed and lied to, and at a loss of what to do. I want things to work out and to get along with them, but I feel like they won't be okay unless I move back in and divorce. My mom has called the cops on my wife a couple times for absolutely no reason and nearly almost physically attacked her, its making it so difficult to do anything with them doing stuff like this and it's making me depressed. I have been doing great, for the last few years I am over my depression and the only things that bother me are rude people and financial stresses, I have friends now and a loving wife and her mother who cares a great deal about me and actually asks about my day and likes to hug, but I feel like they will only get along with me again if I give those things up.





TL;DR
Have had a pretty shitty life up until I met my wife, then my family started falling apart once they lost their ""pet"" and have now reached a point of wanting to disown me because they are against me being an adult and taking charge of my life and what I want to do with it and I don't know what to do about them.",24Feb2017,1

&amp;nbsp;

Since arriving in college, I've had a tough time physically and mentally. I came into my own and lived completely on my own, the only support I got came once a year in the form of a woman who saw me as a charity case. This woman has now disowned me since I came out as a transman. 

Because my life has been a hot mess and taking a semester off was/is not an option unless I never want to come back to college given my circumstances, I've been a bad student. I'm smart and I prove it over and over, but deadlines and arriving on time and anxiety over perfectionism still trip me up even though I'm in recovery. Well, I was. I see managing mental illness as the same as managing alcoholism. I've had 3 mental breakdowns within 2013 - 2016. Now, I feel genuinely happier for the first time ever, but old habits die hard. I'm fighting off a relapse (not breakdown level, but still not good), and I feel that the professors who know me well are disappointed in me.

Professor A sent out a passive aggressive email about me to the class. She didn't name names, but when she said ""those of you who didn't turn this in ..."" followed by a linguistic expression of a headshake, I knew she was talking about me. I saw everyone else hand in something, even if it was a single page. Professor B is now curt with me. Still polite, but I can tell he's faking it. And this isn't me being paranoid. Those with me when he and I bump into each other agree with my observation. Both of the aforementioned professors are two of my advisers. 

I've been given so many breaks at my college and its to the point I feel ashamed, even though catching up is entirely possible as of right now. 

It's my junior year and I'll soon be needing recommendations for internships and jobs. How can I get back into their good graces besides the obvious ""Do better""? Is it too late? 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Throughout college, I battled mental illness, which impeded my academic functioning. I had the smarts, just not the stability. I'm in my third year, and after going through a successful rehabilitation, I'm battling a relapse and already my old bad habits are showing up in the classroom. Two professors in particular, both of whom happen to be two of my advisers, are showing attitude because, I assume, they've given me so many breaks yet here I am again being a poor student. I need good recommendations for jobs, internships, MFAs, etc. What can I do to win them back besides the obvious ""Do better""?",24Feb2017,1

I live in western Pennsylvania, USA in a small town about an hour north of Pittsburgh. The economy is fairly poor here with few jobs, but my family has been here for generations. I am currently employed as a Direct support professional taking care of the mentally disabled in group homes this is a very high stress and physical job. I love helping my clients but after a year it's starting to wear me down mentally. I am often working 16 hour shifts at completely random days and times, my daily routine is non existent and I only get sleep on days off usually. However this job is one of the few good paying jobs in my area and I have a retirement plan and steadily getting raises that keeps me going other than the cause. I am also in two bands which are both becoming a hassle with my schedule, being away from home and dumping my free time into my passion is somewhat sacrificial between all other things I could do with said time. I live with my girlfriend and mother, my mother runs an upholstery business from home and at times we are slow at business and barely make ends meet. My girlfriend moved here in June from Phoenix,AZ and is becoming homesick and feeling the backlash of unemployment and lack of opportunity here. She also can't drive yet. The other catch is that our home is shared by the entire family it's a historical 'mansion' almost Adams family like but it's all heirlooms of my family yet we are struggling with upkeep. My mother has paid for it since the title was split however so we have more right to live there yet it has divided the family with greed. My car is also on it's last leg and I am at a loss of how to replace it in the near future. The potential good news is that our state might give my career a raise to 15 an hour minimum but I am left pondering if I should just sacrifice and try moving to Phoenix or Pittsburgh for a better opportunity. Phoenix would leave my mother in hardship but give me a better life with my girlfriend. Or I can stick it out here first in hopes of a raise. I am also a type one diabetic and when I started this job I lost healthcare due to my income bump, got obamacare but immediately lost it when my company got their own insurance and ended up being hospitalized in between the transition for a diabetic ketoacidosis... because I was left at work for 24hrs and couldn't get my meds.

Problem is, (well, not only did I sleep poorly), but his house smells like he is farming cat urine for use as a biologic weapon. He complains that no one wants to visit, so I wonder if he's just become inured to it.

129,"*This is a throwaway account, so in terms of location and such I'll be rather vague*

So, I've lived in the same state my entire life (I'm twenty-seven, for context) and I've always had aspirations to move, but I've never really settled on any one area - Well, at least until somewhat recently. For a short duration now I've been in talks with a friend about moving near them. We can talk all day about the moral quandaries of settling near someone you've only had dialogues with online, but I've known them for over ten years, and as such, I feel comfortable doing so. Not to mention I just feel myself becoming distanced from my current friend group and have felt this way for quite some time. The people I got along with the most have either moved or have embraced a new level of cynicism that makes it incredibly difficult to stand being in their presence for too long.

Currently, I'm rooming with three people that all share this way of thinking. My only source of income is that of freelance writing - It's not a huge chunk of change, but gets me by considering how many roommates I have. Though I don't drive, our complex is close enough to civilization to the point where walking to acquire pretty much anything you need is incredibly feasible. I'm in the process of looking for another job to make the whole 'moving thing' more expedient. At this point, you may query exactly what the problem is, as it appears that I've everything figured out.

Well, I really don't.

-As mentioned before, I've never lived out of state before and really don't know the first thing about preparing for it. I realize I'd need a job in that location, I'd need to look for an apartment (That part has been somewhat discussed with those I plan on living near) and I'm unsure of exactly how to go about relocating my stuff.

-This is more of a personal problem, but I have bad teeth and do my best to hide such a thing even around those I've known my entire life. I bring this up not only partly because of shame, but also due to financial reasons. I haven't had my wisdom teeth removed yet and my family has a history of gingivitis. I feel as though I should probably take care of all this before moving, but my only worry is that it will prolong the moving process by quite some time. I realize that's a childish way to look at it, but I guess at this point I just have my eyes on the finish line.

The primary reason I bring this up is because I'm very much interested in changing my diet and focusing on fitness. This has proven to be very difficult as my roommates are effectively slobs and having their food/beverages in the apartment more or less coaxes me into just giving up my own goals. But all in all, I suppose this is a problem that can only be fixed by sacking up and ignoring the less healthy options. Water is an obvious choice for what to drink (and I got us a filter a while back, so I suppose I should use it more often) but in terms of food, I'm aware that fruits and vegetables exist and that's essentially it.

-I'm not on the lease for the apartment. So, I've been here far longer than is allowed and if the landlord were to find out (she never comes by, apparently) I would be on the streets as I have absolutely nowhere to go beyond here with the income I have. The plan right now is to get an apartment close by living on my own, but of course before I can afford that, I need another job. You may ask how I got myself in this situation, but without going into too many details; I'm just lucky to be alive and I'll leave it at that.

With all that being said, there may be something I've overlooked in terms of bettering myself and in that case, please bring up anything that may be considered helpful. ",24Feb2017,1

133,"I've been song writing for eight years now as a hobby with the last two, taking it very seriously. I know I'm a very good song writer. I've received acclaim from friends to musicians/record labels (famous/not famous) commenting/liking my posts on Instagram. I feel really confident in my work and know my best could match any best. I have received praise from fellow song writers on reddit as well saying I should hit record. How should I go about showing my work directly to a label or another successful writer in hopes of working together. Mind you there are a couple of dilemmas that are stopping me from getting my work recorded and out there on my own. 

First is I can't sing. My voice has a New Jersey accent so anything doesn't sound appealing to begin with, I've tried adopting a south western accent (currently in Colorado) but you can still hear the shore in my throat. 

Second I don't know how to read music, and barely can play guitar/can kind of play drums. It's funny I'm a science major and gen chem 2 makes total sense after hours of learning but music notes doesn't. I've accepted I don't posses that trait to pick up a sheet of music and go. I've also accepted some of my 3 thousand writings don't fit certain scales as a result. I've tried very hard to learn how to play an instrument but it doesn't click at all. So all my song writing is done to an instrumental or works similar to a song that I've been heavy on all week but not similar enough that others would notice. I bought myself a guitar last year thinking maybe I can just make up my own notes with help from youtube videos yet I can't get it down because... 

Third, my hands are too large for the guitar. This plays into appearance as well. I'm 6 foot 6 225. I'm in great shape, not fat but everything is long about me. My fingers wrap around the guitar and I can't find pics large enough to hold that don't compromise the chords I'm attempting to play. Another issue with my size is how does someone like me who looks like they have no business in this field make that first impression that says I fucking know what I'm doing lets just get to work. 

Not a man of excuses just want to know how to work my way into a room and show my confidence without these technicalities kicking me out. Thank you. ",24Feb2017,2
134,"Hi guys.

I grew up with a friend who was as close or closer than a sibling. She ditched me once she moved away and never contacted me, just said she wanted to not be friends anymore and never gave a reason. We went from hanging out daily, having fun and laughing all the time, friends for 10 years.. to being cut off.

I was destroyed. It's been five years. She blocked me on all social media. I reached out to her on Instagram recently which she didn't block me on. She told me that she left because I was always stressed and took out my stress on her.

I apologized profusely and told her how regretful I was. I grew up with an abusive home situation and was in extremely hard college courses. I took out a lot of stress on her, despite our countless fun moments. I was so comfortable with her that I vented all the time. I to this day regret this so bad.

I told her how bad I felt. I told her how sorry I was and how much I have changed. She told me she was very jealous of me because I was doing good in school and she hated school. That hurt too. She told me that she thought about me all the time and went to therapy because of the guilt of cutting me off. I've since graduated college and am very happy. She's got a great life too, she has kids and a great husband and I told her how happy I was for her. She told me deep down she is extremely stressed.

But then even though we talked and laughed on the phone for hours when we reconnected, she cut me off again a couple days later and said she's not ready for a friendship. I haven't heard from her since.

I regret and sometimes cry and pray for forgiveness from god about how I was back then. I wish I hadn't of vented or acted stressed or mean at times. She was closer than a sister. I have since learned how to be a good friend.

But how do I get over the guilt? Do I need therapy?",24Feb2017,1
135,"Story (very long story) time: I met a girl out partying through some mutual friends two weekends ago. We go home with said mutual friends, I crash over at their place, and the next day they go to run some errands leaving me and Susie there alone, no vehicle. We had kissed the night before, so naturally things spark back up. She puts the brakes on because we don't have a condom, understandable. We discuss expectations, she has two kids and no time to date seriously, I'm gearing up for a move across the country in six months. Cool, once a condom shows up its all gonna be casual fun. Yay. After some more conversation, I'm starting to see some red flags that she's a bit immature and say that once Oscar and Helga get back I'm heading home, no sex. 

Now shit hits the fan.

She gets super confused (she's very pretty and I'm guessing she doesn't hear that often) and goes into full blown seductress mode. Climbing on my lap unsolicited, biting my neck, nibbling on my ear, telling me how I know I want her. This goes on for two hours. Finally I snap, throw her down, two minutes of angry sex ensues, I come to my senses, pull out, no orgasms, get dressed, she's pissed. Against all fucking odds, now she's pregnant. 

I've spent the last 24 hours begging her to look objectively at this situation and be smart about it. She ""doesn't believe in killing innocent babies,"" so abortion is out of the question in her mind, as is adoption (that would be ""abandoning the child""). She likes to think that her current two kids are well taken care of (they're not) and she can handle a third. She's 21 with no education and waits tables at a breakfast cafe. She basically gave me an ultimatum of two options: I stay involved in the kid's life from a distance or I just leave altogether. Rational thought is completely foreign to her, so I really don't think I can talk her out of it. She's also planning on not telling our friends or her family, which I'm going to do myself and deal with the impending shitstorm. I feel so insanely guilty even bringing a life into the world in those circumstances, but at the same time I'm willing to admit that I can't provide for one myself yet either. I've just never felt so powerless in my life. Yesterday she even told me that her life won't get any more difficult from this, only mine will and I need to get over it. 

Right now I'm leaning towards cutting ties altogether and just swallowing the guilt of feeling like a complete degenerate father, but I don't want that to come back to haunt me down the road. Idk. I'm probably just venting at this point, but thoughts or ideas would be appreciated. ",24Feb2017,11

139,"I am currently a university student also working part time at a car dealership in a sales role.  This is not want I want to do as a career and the longer I am in it the more I realize what a crapshoot it is most of the time (not always)...for anonymity sake ill just say that my dream job may be calling me in the next couple of weeks (they select from a screened and accepted applicant pool) with an offer for training.  The failure rate is quite high but I feel confident I can handle it as it really plays on almost all of my best strengths, and the job would be incredible (the pay is also quite good).

However, I just started at the car dealership and if I get offered training it will be starting within the next 3 months, and there is an extensive amount of preparatory studying that needs to happen  prior to my beginning training.  In addition, I have a baby who is due in June hence why I began working full time while in school to save up some extra dough (my wife makes good money in her profession).....

I know if I get offered a training spot I am taking it, no question about it.  HOWEVER, this is my dilemma:  Because of the long working hours car sales requires and my 3 classes of university and the prep work that I need to do for this dream job,  I dont feel I will have the energy/capacity to do all of that at the same time.

Here is my question: Do you think I should do one of these? (if not please say what you would suggest)

A) Quit my dealership job (only been here 6 weeks) and focus on my university and knowing the dream-job material in and out before training. (this means no more income until training starts)

B) Drop my 3 classes and focus on work and studying for the dream-job until 2 weeks before training when I quit the dealership anyways. (I would lose out on all the work I have done thus far, and would have to start repaying student loan in 6 months, and I would lose the $$ paid in tuition for the semester).

C) I have the option of working on my in-laws farm as a truck/equipment driver, I could do that and have time to study in the evenings, they would probably also work around my schedule.

D)  Maintain status quo and try not to burn out with my 50 hour work week, 3 classes, prep studying for the dream job, and any small resemblance of a social life I can cling to

TL/DR: Should I quit my short term job to focus on school and prep studying for my dream job (I will give up income till then), should I quit and work for in-laws till training, or should I just drink lots of coffee and minimize sleep? lol

143,"So where to start... a couple weeks ago my cousin found out her mother.. my aunt had died. This aunt was never around much.. basically left the family years and years ago for unknown reasons to me. Anyways.. there was never really a lot of contact, but my cousin found her obituary online about a month ago. Fast forward 2 weeks ..

My cousin contacted the embassy and cremation service in the US to confirm if it was really her mother that had past away.. as well as my two Aunts ""Lacy"" and ""Tracy""did the same..

I just found out yesterday that my Aunt died November 16th.. my one Aunt and my grandfather still dont know.

""Lacy"" and ""Tracy"" dont want the information being spread around because according to them. The file hasnt been confirmed. But according to my cousin and her husband.. it was 100% confirmed.

So at this point; I smell bullshit pouring from somewhere... And Im so angry.

The family who does know about her death.. is being silenced. And at this point im not sure who knows and who doesnt. I dont know enough to act.. but I know enough to know this wrong.

149,"I'm worried I'm becoming a bit of a neckbeard. Not in the clothes I wear (unless you're one of the blues brothers, fedoras are dorky, especially if not wearing a suit) but in my attitudes towards women. 

I'm not quite to the point of ""Ugh women only want assholes why don't they like nice guys like me"" but I fear I'm drifting that way. 

Now I don't believe I'm owed anything. I'm not entitled to sex, relationships, dates, any of that. Women owe me nothing.  

But my repeated failure in dating and such has started to convince me that women pass me over because I'm not wowing anyone in qualities they are attracted to. Girls are drawn to specific qualities in a guy that I feel like I honestly kinda lack, namely, a strong sense of confidence, a silver tongue, and good looks/a strong fashion sense. 

Now again, I'm not strutting around in a stained t shirt and a grubby fedora with unwashed hair and such. I'm not a total schlub when it comes to how I dress. I'd love to dress better but I don't have a huge amount of financial breathing room to splurge on clothes. And I have a little bit of a gut (I'm about 5'11"", 195 lbs) so even if I wear nice clothes it only goes so far. And losing weight is tough. I've been working out more and I have come to realize how tough it can be to actually change what I look like substantially. 

It's just frustrating. My confidence is not great, my self esteem is not great, I'm not super silver tongued. Those things may not make a relationship or anything but they ABSOLUTELY make that spark of attraction happen. 

And that's where I strike out. I'm not terrible, I'm not great. I'm average. In most aspects of my life. I'm not ugly, but I'm sure as hell not making girls swoon. I'm not totally shot of confidence but I'm nothing special in that department either. I'm not terrible at conversation (Most of my dates go at least half decently) but again, not knocking anyone dead. I have a decent job that pays the bills but again it's not amazing. 


The point is, I feel like girls, when they think of me, think 

""Oh well he's nice, but...""

As if something else better can and will come around. And it can. It does. 

Some of my friends tell me to stop prioritizing it. I feel like dating is like voting-you don't participate you can't complain.

I really felt I was qualified for the position (relevant experience, excellent grades in a related field, felt my interview went well, etc.) and I'm beyond upset.

Upon arriving home I put my pizza in the microwave and fed my cats as I waited for the pizza to warm up. After eating the pizza really fast, I wanted to go back to work. As I was leaving my garage I saw two hooded people in my alleyway with backpacks digging through trash. I thought it was weird but drove past them to go to work.

The two hooded people were headed towards that direction so I anxiously worried about the possibility of them stealing from my neighbor. There was no car in my neighbors garage and it didn't look like anyone was home. I thought they might have just left the garage open for some reason but the presence of two hooded people with backpacks was unsettling.

I called the cops and told them the whole story. I went back home and waited because they wanted me to. They asked me questions and eventually said they had to search the house.

I was confused.

I didn't think they would search the house. I thought maybe they would maybe send someone to monitor the area and look for the hooded people. I was shocked and confused and didn't know what to do so I just waited. They said everything was fine and they left. I left. I also never mentioned it to my neighbors.

Ever since I was young, I have always had trouble with social situations, I am not mentally ill in any sense of the words, I just really... really suck at it. When talking to people online I can talk to them for hours without much of an issue, as long as I have a topic. Ever since I was young I've also been very quiet, never talking unless I needed to and when I did talk it was often about stuff other people might find weird, and as such I became what I perceive to be the weird kid. My lack of talking also means a lack of much visible emotion, this has led to my peers often either thinking I am depressed (I have an amazing life as far as home goes and have 0 reason to be, so I am not) and ultimately undermining me. I haven't made any new friends I hang out with outside of school besides one (who doesn't even go to my school) since kindergarten. To come back to talking to people, when talked directly to (unless they are people I talk to on a regular basis) I freeze up, get very quiet and have no idea what to say or really how to start a conversation, I can talk to people for hours through, as long as I have a topic. (I am currently in grade 10) basically what I am asking is for help. How can I start to suck less at this kinda thing? And how do I stop people from undermining me? I am not by any means depressed (as I have a great home life) but my situation could obviously be bettered if I could just get better at talking to people and preventing them from undermining me (and to seem less depressed).

I was homeschooled up until high school. I didnt make many friends or have a lot of girlfriends during my high school days. I was nice and talked to a lot of people but never really made any deep friendships or stayed connected to anyone. The one friend I did hang out with most is an alcolholic and somewhat verbally abusive. We have stayed in contact and continued to hang out, but honestly Im kind of tired of him and he is joining the military anyway. There is one other person from church and I love them to death, but all we really do is eat and watch tv when I go to his place. 

I love working out and being active and I would love to have a group of friends that is interested in the same stuff I am. Not just a workout group that meets x number of times a week, but true friends. Ive never made friends naturally, and I usually spend my days either working, training, or reading at home. I still live with my parents btw.

My girlfriend and I are off on a couple of trips over the next few months. The trips will be the kind that involve a lot of waiting and sitting around - trains, flying, etc.

What are some good games we can play during our trips?

I'm looking for suggestions that don't require intense thinking (we'll be jetlagged, underslept and travel-weary), but still have enough intrigue to keep us entertained.

To narrow things down a bit:

- Pen + paper games would be great.
- We're seasoned board game players, so those work - as long as they're light and don't need a large surface to play (we've loved [Star Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102104/star-fluxx) but I've played that far too much).
- Mobile games work, though internet would be limited during flights and data roaming is an issue.

So today is my SO 39th birthday. He told me he was coming home for his lunch break so I decided to surprise him a little. I decorated our kitchen table with some candy, balloons, and the 2 small gifts I got for him. A little cheesy, but for some reason I was super excited for him to see it. I greeted him at the door with kisses and affection but for some reason he wasn't very receiving. Confused, I simply brushed it off; assumed he's having a bad day at work or something. This is where things took a turn towards the unexpected. He sat at our kitchen table and started crying. Not saying a word he just began sobbing. I sat there watching and I didn't know what to do? He got up, walked over to me and started crying on my shoulder. I asked him what was wrong and he proceeded to tell me everything was ok and he really appreciates what I did. Finally, after about a minute he sat back down and said everything is fine and began eating his lunch. At this point I was thrown off guard and wasn't sure how to approach the situation. So I began to make jokes and made him laugh a little. When I felt he was in happier spirits I offered my gifts but he told me he didn't want to open them, any of them. Not even his birthday card. My feelings got a little hurt i'll be honest, but I just ignored it. I asked one more time if he at least wants to open his coupon book I made for him (thinking the sexual contents might make his mood better) but he took one look at it and started crying again. 
Not much happened after that, he finished his lunch and left back to work. I'm confused. I don't know if what I did made him cry or what. I'm sitting here emotional looking at the untouched gifts and I can't help but to get a little teary eyed for some reason.

202,"Hey everyone so I'm wondering about what to do here. I'll bullet point a few things to save some time.

Dating for two weeks.
Connected and had good chemistry.
She's sometimes distant but put it down to nerves.
Slept together second date.
Basically radio silence from her.
I ask her about it, she says there's nothing wrong and is affectionate.
Message her about next date and she isn't sure of what she wants.
We meet up to talk, she tells me all her serious relationships ended up with her being cheated on.
She's confused and doesn't want to hurt me.
End up going back to hers, we kissed but there wasn't anything 'there'.

So then I left, my bus was late so she wanted to come outside and bring me back to hers. I tell her it's fine and that I can wait. She responds with ""I'm sorry I'll leave you be"" I ask her if that's what she wants to do and she said she doesn't know but ""wants to know me no matter what"".

Honestly I really don't think she's ready for any kind of relationship, she's tried dating but always ends up getting scared but thought it would be different with me. She's a nice girl but I don't think dating her is a good idea when she probably needs to be single for a while. I messaged her today asking if she was okay,  got one response and ignored me the rest of the day.

Am I being a dick by not wanting to continue with this. Like I'm finally over my last relationship which was a train wreck so I don't want to get into something else which could be just as unstable. Should I just leave this be for a while or tell her that I don't think this is right for either of us.",24Feb2017,1

205,"Back 3 years when I had no friends, I met this girl and felt alive again. It gave me the confidence to make new friends when I joined college a couple of months later. She has been a good friend of mine, probably my best friend, even though we spoke mostly online. 

Eventually I fell in love with her and it didn't work. We had some bumps because I was too stupid to giveup and when I finally thought we had stabilized and could move forward, I asked her to hang out casually and the bubble popped. She got mad at me because she had asked me for some space 2 months back (I seriously thought she had forgotten the situation in those 2 months, she just spoke like she normally does), she pointed out some stupid things I did in the timespan we have been friends (some of those things were really clingy and desperate, I actually regret it) and she asked me to not text her. She said she didn't want to stop talking to me, because she actually enjoyed talking to me, but she said she needed some time to move forward and she would text me back when she felt like it. 

I regret the fact that I kept trying after she rejected me, I regret doing those desperate and clingy things for her, but deep inside I was just scared of missing her. For the first time in my life I had a friend, in 19 years of my life no friend had ever invited me out, but she did... This friendship was and still is really important to me, she was my best friend... I feel like I've done so much mistakes she might feel better without me, I'm afraid she doesn't actually talk to me ever again...

 I respect her decision and will not text her even if she never texts me back, I will not go back on my word, but I really hope she puts past aside and talks to me again. I know I should stop being so clingy, otherwise she will get mad at me again if she ever talks to me again, but I really am suffering right now and can't do anything to boast my confidence back. I mean, I had to go through so much to forget my romantic feelings for her just to see the friendship ending right after. I have endured so much already, I really just wanted to be happy at once...

I know I have to forget about her and that I shouldn't be waiting for her text because it might never happen, but she left a hole in my heart that no one else can fill, someone else might be able to patch it up, but the wound will still be there.

212,"I used to work at company A, it's been about 7 years I've spent there in various departments so I am pretty familiar with systems, people, etc. My father also worked at company A and had originally gotten me the job there, although as time passed I moved departments and eventually felt as if I had earned my job through my own work ethic. (He was never my direct). Recently, about a year ago he started acting as a go-between for an outside company (lets call them company B) in an official capacity for company A. He heard that Company B was looking to hire someone to work onsite at Company A, as a sort of Liason or Client relationship person. I interviewed and got the job.

Its a good job and it pays well, but it's not working out for me. Specifically, my ""team"" is located on the other side of the country and the people I work with on a day to day basis is the client (company A). I don't have a normal workflow and I eventually found out that the position was created at Company A's request or as a part of the work contract Company B had with Comp A. I'm not performing well there, not as well as I was in my old job. I'm pretty sure both sides see it.

My instinct is to stop dragging out the inevitable and leave, but right now I'm living with my dad. To make matters worse, he's actually left Company A for Company B and is also working remote for a team that is states away from us. He loves the job, near as I can tell, and I can't in my right mind quit my job and continue to live with my parents.  

I want to move out but I'm hesitating because my position at work is precarious.  Here are my questions:

Should I tell my boss? The catalyst for this question is the fact that I think I'm being mailed a written warning and my performance review is on Monday. I think he'd be understanding but if I express that I don't want to work with them, or that I want to look elsewhere, won't that just cause them to axe me sooner?

I feel stuck. I think what I need to do is move out and look for work elsewhere but the risk seems so high. To be clear, my underperformance is a combination of lack of enthusiasm, vast amounts of inexperience, and a feeling that my job is an expense of doing business with Company A. Or a feeling of uselessness.

213,"My wife and I have had a rollercoaster relationship. Married/divorced 3 times, and the last time my son and daughter moved in with me. Ever since the last one he's been different.

We separated for the last time in 2011. At the time he was playing hs football and baseball. Had lots of friends. He was an amazing athlete, very very intelligent when it came to math and science. Around the time he was ~12-13 he abruptly lost all of his friends and alienated himself from the family. From that point he's never been the same. In almost 7 years he's sat on the couch/computer and done nothing. No friends, no one, not even me. He wanted a dog when he was younger, and I finally got around to buying one for him, which he gave away when I gave it to him.

He kept talking about killing himself around 13 so I had him see a bunch of therapists. Throughout highschool I probably sent him to 20 different therapists/counselors/psychiatrists and he hasn't changed one bit. He gave it up entirely junior year and I thought it was because he was getting better.

He graduated a year early from high-school to get a jumpstart on college by taking his 4th year of math (calculus) and 4th year of science (advance chemistry) a year early (and they weren't even required courses to graduate) and was on track to working towards an engineering degree. Then we found out his mom stole his college money and we had to alter the plans.

When he graduated he just started doing what he did every day after school; full-time nothing. Got a part time job after ~6 months of doing that at UPS. He's been there since. Doesn't want to go to college, still won't talk to me, still depressed. He sleeps all day, works night, sleeps all day. Doesn't even have a phone anymore.

We've fought a couple of times and resulted in me telling him to respect me or leave. He said he hated me and didn't want to live here anyway, but he still does. When I asked him what I had to do to make him happy he said give him my gun and drove away. That was a few weeks ago.

I don't know what to do anymore. I see him/talk to him about twice a week. Usually because I try to force myself to stay awake so I can say bye to him before he leaves for work at night. The rest is to give me money for insurance. I've talked to therapists myself and they just hand me happy pills and say everythings gonna be fine. I'm at my wits end and it's killing my inside.

This year, I moved to another country, and as expected all the friends I made during my last two years of high school (not a lot, and I've known them for two years only) seemed to have forgotten about me. But then again, I was pretty much the third wheel in this group of friends. I tried keeping in touch at first, but they seemed like they didn't really want to talk to me, so I got tired and stopped trying to message them. 
Now, I have an internet friend I've known for around four years, and looking back on our conversations, it feels like I'm the one messaging them first all the time. Sometimes they don't reply. I have to admit that my messages can probably get a bit annoying, but it has started to feel like they don't really want to talk to me, and don't make efforts to keep the conversation going. I noticed that I wished them a happy birthday every year, and these past two years, I'm pretty sure they haven't done the same for me.

Sounds lovely enough, so we brought lotion and what not. But when we were there, it was so dang awkward to give a half-assed manicure while everyone in the room watched... Idk I guess my family has never been touchy-feely so under the glare of everyone in the room (and lack of pleasant conversation, because everyone feels they have to maintain a solemn demeanor), I felt incredibly self-conscious. And then I felt my grandma was just humoring me and letting me finish, and I wasn't actually making her feel better or relaxed.

216,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a pretty good, but honestly a somewhat tricky situation. I'm a freshman at a division one school playing football on full scholarship. I want to be an engineer, but the school I am currently at does not offer a complete engineering program, only a 3-2 program. The problem with this, is that with my scholarship I am not allowed to do the 3-2 program, so because of that I am majoring in physics. My question to you is, what should be my path after undergrad? 

Should I go and try to find a job in the workforce? Can physics majors find jobs as engineers? 

Or should I go to graduate school for Mechanical engineering? A positive of this would be the fact that I have no student loans right now, although I would have to pay for that myself. A negative would be not entering the workforce and earning money right away, plus taking on student loans from that.

219,"Hey r/Advice!

I'll try to keep this brief. My family consists of 6 cats and my Fiance and I. We've been together for years and grown our family as such. Our last apartment complex knew and approved of our large family. We had to move out suddenly due to work and money issues. (we completed our lease, had about 2 months to find and move to a new home.) We searched for another location that would take our family, but couldn't find one. We wanted to rent a house, but those that were in our price range where in the part of town that you don't move to. So, we moved to a place and didn't tell them about our 6 cats, only two. Thankfully we didn't have to identify them, or put pictures on record. 

Now, we're getting ready to move as I've applied for grad school for this fall. Our lease ends in the middle of summer and we're prepared to move as soon as we find out where we'll be going.  In the meantime, our large and shitty property management company is showing our place from time to time. We do our best to hide evidence of our cats (bowls, toys, etc) to appear more reasonable for 2 cats. We hide them in a room and claim that I'm sleeping, 'because I work nights'. This works well.

Today, they showed our place with no notice. Unfortunately it isn't required by state, county, or local law and there's no provision in our lease for a more reasonable notice. 

We hate living here for many reasons, but most for fear of being discovered for our cats. If life were different, more money, better housing options in a college town, etc we wouldn't be this circumstance. Of course giving up members of our family for the sake of a lease is simply not going to happen.

I need help finding a way to feel a little bit safer, and to help get cats out should another showing or inspection happens.

Thanks!

p.s.- We take care of our home and maintain it well. The home is fairly run-down but we've done more than any tenant in the last five years to improve the place. Our family doesn't have a negative impact on the home in anyway.

Edit: I re-reviewed the lease. It gives them the option to charge a $250 per additional pet fine or terminate the lease immediately.",24Feb2017,1
220,"Long story short, I am 24 and have been graduated college for 2 years. I have an entry level job in my field, and good friends. But I've always felt the desire to move to a big city. My hometown does not have many opportunities and I don't want to settle down in the town I grew up in. 

I recently got out of a relationship two months ago and am still recovering from that. I have some friends who might want to get an apartment together and invited me in on it. I like the idea of this, but I'm torn because I feel like I should be somewhere else, in a different area. Is it silly for me to want to move somewhere new where I don't know anyone, despite the fact that all my family and friends are here?

My job is OK, but it's my first professional job and I know it's not what I want forever. Am I a failure because I'm already 24 and haven't moved out? Am I gonna have a lot of catching up to do as an adult? I've always been a late bloomer but things usually come to me eventually, which I'm grateful for, but idk about this. Any advice or opinions? Thank you in advance.",24Feb2017,5
221,"So I told a friend who is known for being a bit of a gossip and we sort of have a love hate relationship, a secret. She may be a bitch sometimes but we have known each other a long time and we can always confine in each other when it comes to personal stuff, she has never said anything personal that I've told her but the stuff I have told her isn't like this secret. I was going through a tough time so I told her my secret, she understood and was really supportive and nice. We also messaged about it. I asked her not to tell anyone about it and to delete the messages, she said she would. But I can't help feeling like she might one day tell someone or her boyfriend. She might keep photos of the messages and have proof of it. How can I stop worrying about it and just trust her to keep it? I'm not good on having to rely on another person to keep something personal about me. But sometimes you can't deal with thing on your own.",24Feb2017,1
224,"I was recently told that I would be receiving an ""outstanding student leader"" award for university graduation. This award is given to students who show excellence in service. 

Now, I have done some service work. I volunteered in Panama, the food bank, in an adult ESL course, and I currently intern doing advocacy work. However, I don't come close to comparing to last year's winner. Last year the winner was a kid from Burkina Faso who started his own NGO helping vulnerable teens get jobs. I don't even come close. 

I want to talk to my advisor (who gave me the award) and tell her that I'm clearly not qualified, but I don't want to insult her. The whole thing is making me incredibly anxious. I work alongside my advisor as her assistant, so I don't want to ruffle any feathers or come across as unprofessional for not accepting an award she gave me. 

Any advice?",24Feb2017,2
226,What did you do to help get yourself through a breakup? Her and I parted about a month ago. We still remain good friends. But I'm still upset and it feels weird talking to her. Any advice you got?,24Feb2017,1
228,"Hey /r/advice

I'm not a fan of asking for advice, I feel like a habit of hesitation and pondering can have the same result as not doing anything at all. Life's a challenge and it's one that I usually enjoy, but I'm here because I'm concerned my mental health is clouding my judgement and is going to lead my life into a ruinous heap. I'm at a point where I don't trust my own decisions in a time where things are slowly getting worse, and I need to do something to get ahead of all of this

I'll try to bullet form some of this so this doesn't turn into a rant:

-In October 2013, I had a minor breakdown at my university. GPA was 2.5, dropped at least one class per semester, words can't describe my depression. Was also in a bad relationship. Decided to take a break for semester 2, end things with girlfriend, work full-time while I cleared my head

-Worked a variety of jobs, never staying for more than 3-4 months, enjoyed the experience but knew that none of it was for me. I was a bartender, uniform deliverer, lifeguard, forest firefighter

-Career counselling, weeks of internet searching, talking to everyone I knew and didn't know, nothing interested me. I kept an open mind, I gave a few opportunities a shot just to stay engaged. The pay wasn't important or the steps required to get to the job. If I knew I wanted to be a rocket engineer, I would make it happen but nothing ever really holds my interest

-I decided my place must really be at university, work life is depressing and grating at this point and my degree was still waiting. I became a hard worker during my time off and acquired an ability to push through fatigue that I just didn't have before. Working 4:30am outdoors in the winter can do that, so I knew I could stick to an after school study schedule

This was between 2013-2016. I enrolled back into my sciences degree earlier this September, tired from constantly working dead-end jobs but truly motivated by the possibility of finishing school.

-Hard to focus at school, only 3 classes but I make it work. I remove distractions by studying at the library, going home when it's time to relax

-My mom gets diagnosed with IBC in October at 60, 5 year mortality average though she's confident about treatment

-Car crash 2 weeks later, icey roads and I do the mechanical work to replace the lower control arm in time to move 2 weeks later

-Old group of friends since Jr. High, they've become overweight unambitious and extremely negative in the last couple years. The kind of friends who judge others instantly but always have an excuse for themselves. Tried to talk it out but had to let them go, we were like brothers

-Dropped down to 2 classes, seeing a doctor and a psychologist now. I read the same sentences over and over again, my stomach hurts sometimes and I have at least one night a week where I don't sleep thinking about people I've hurt in the past and how worthless my efforts are

-The economy is bad where I live, and although I've finally managed to get a job the money is terrible and debt starts to accumulate

-I'm usually friendly, but get defensive and snap at others for disrespect whether real or perceived. I can't tell when anyone is joking sometimes and I start to withdraw socially so I don't burn any bridges

-Older brothers have their plates full, Dad is retiring early and trying to figure out money, Mom is chemo sick and fighting her own battle. I can't burden these guys too much but we talk when we can

-I no longer attend class and try to get all my work done from lecture notes in the library. I can't focus in either case, my GPA sits at 0 this semester because I haven't handed in any assignments and had a full blown panic attack when the first midterm came. I just sat outside for an hour feeling like shit

-Doctor sets up Psychiatrist meeting in June, suspects ADD, started Concerta 18mg ---&gt; 36mg over 5 weeks. Meds help productivity slightly but the crash can mess me up in the evening

-Psychologist usually hears my problems, tells me I am strong, and gives me useless techniques to ""ground myself in the moment"" when I'm considering my floundering social life, mother's health, and failing academic situation

-I wake up early at my friend's house last Sunday, drove home and lost control of my vehicle, complete write-off that could have easily killed someone but luckily I managed to control the spin into some trees. This was a car my Dad gave to me only 8 months ago as a way to help, he's disappointed but doesn't say much

This is the bottom and the end of my post. I haven't had sex in almost 2 years, I blow up at any friend I see as toxic, I'm basically cooked for university (I haven't given up, I'm going to speak to my professors on Monday), I'm an idiot to my family because there just always seems to be something going on with me. I NEED to smoke weed daily just to stay calm and go to bed in the evenings. I NEED to exercise to get the aggression out of my body. I used to compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu intermediately as a blue belt but between my rising $24,000 in debt and failing grades I decided to give it up

When I talk things out or ask for advice, the most I get is Keep Calm and Carry On. When I think about my future, the most I can hope for is to slowly trade my life away for someone else's dream in exchange for money. I'm lonely but I'm so fucked up that I can't even get erections anymore and I'm scared that I'm going to be an enormous cunt with whoever I date. I'm not a quitter now, but I think I'm going to kill myself when I'm older if I can't figure this out. I want to self-destruct my life, quit everything I'm doing and just roam the world in the hopes that I find anything better than what is going on with me right now. 

I have to go to work. It's really hard bartending like this, I'm usually charming as shit but I'm a robot at work now and coworkers are starting to notice. Sorry for the long post but I'm so fucking tired and it's hard to get all of this out smoothly

Any advice, criticism, similar experiences would be appreciated. I don't need comfort just want to feel like life has a purpose again",24Feb2017,18
229,"At 14 years old, I was a dumb, unsafe Internet user. I was on the OpenFeint forums, which was a little obscure place connected to apps like Fruit Ninja and the like. I spent a lot of time there for the year it existed, and made some friends. Some friends that I, being dumb, trusted they were who they said they were, and with many of them I shared my face, name, and phone number. As I started to drift from OpenFeint to reddit, I told some of them about it, and probably told them my username too. It was shortly after that I started getting messages from some user. I believe it started out with him just replying to ""fuck you"" on all my posts. I posted on OpenFeint about it and a user I hadn't met before (though most likely an alt account of someone I had met), with the same username as the reddit account responded that he was just messing around and he'd stop.

Time goes on, OpenFeint is a distant memory now, the same user comes back, and starts replying with really weird shit. Like, *really* weird. Random dirty sexual things. Never threats towards me, but just bizarre and gross. I may have egged him with a couple of ""go away"" responses for a while, but I then just ignored it.

Then there was a name drop. He said my first and last name, and then typed ""I love you"" in all caps 50 times. At this point I just straight up blocked him, and assumed he'd eventually notice I blocked him and get bored and move on.

Yesterday I got a message on Facebook from an unknown user, but his name was a lot like the reddit username. He sent ""y do not respond to me? do u hate me?"" or something of the sort. I decided to check some of the reddit accounts that he stalked me on (there were a few I blocked). I logged out and opened up the user page of one of them, and sure enough he didn't stop, as the most recent post was just 2 days ago. One that caught my eye was from just 4 days ago, and ended with ""YOU'll see when WE MEET EACH OTHER!""

So now with knowing my Facebook (I obviously blocked the account that messaged me), and that last thing about meeting each other. I'm kinda freaked the fuck out. What's the best way to handle this? Can police do anything? Is he just pulling my leg to freak me out?",24Feb2017,1
230,"-don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask, please let me know if there's a more appropriate subreddit as I am looking for the closest possible answer-

I'm a 21 year old female living in California, born in South Korea, am a permanent resident in the US, hold a green card, and have been living here since I was 5 years old. Last year I got a DUI as an underage minor. All fees have been paid, all classes attended, and I am on the road again. Since I was underage when I got it, they are keeping me under informal probation for 3 years but I'm not sure if that's relevant. There are no other criminal records. 

I am planning to visit S. Korea with my parents this May. My parents are worried that I might be deported because apparently a Korean man living in Texas has been deported because of his DUI, which was convicted 10+ years ago. He had the same resident status as me and has been living in America longer than I have. I was surprised because I thought after 10 years, the DUI wouldn't be relevant. 

Should I take the risk? Not sure if there are other cases like mine... if you know of any news articles covering deportation of Korean Americans please let me know. Thank you. ",24Feb2017,7
231,"Hello all and thanks in advance for any advice you may have.

Following high school I decided to forgo the college route and enter the workforce.  I sold knives for Vector Marketing (Cutco) and later held a few retail jobs (American Apparel, Eddie Bauer, etc).  In the summers I worked at various summer camps over the years as a counselor which was fun and enjoyable for work in my early 20s, I like kids and the outdoors.

At the encouragement of much more economically successful friends and family I decided to go to college.  I was 25 and a bit older than my classmates, but I dominated the classroom.  After 4 years I graduated from a major state university with a 3.88 GPA and a Bachelor's in Public Policy.  While in college I worked for 2 years in the on-campus library to help pay the bills and have something to put on a resume that wasn't retail.

Upon graduation I had no jobs lined up, 29 years old, I was older than the normal graduate and with no real work experience.  At the time I had the desire to work in the government, make the trains run on time, improve efficiency, that sort of thing.

3 years later, I am 32 years old, and my jobs have included selling software (note: I have no technical expertise in software design), a stint as a construction worker that just about destroyed my knee, and right now I'm a driver for a limo company to try and make ends meet.  It actually isn't the worst job, but it pays barely enough for me to pay bills despite 3 roommates.

I feel like such a colossal failure at life.  I'm not unintelligent, but very unsuccessful.  I'm on several job websites (Indeed, GetHired, etc) but the only thing to come back to me from them are either retail jobs or shady ""Are you an energetic self-starter?!"" shady commissioned based sales jobs.  

I know that, based on my employment history, I don't have the requisite experience for much else, which is my problem.  I'd love to have a simple $15 per hour job working in Human Resources or back in the Library environment.  Yet every HR job is looking for years and years of HR experience and you need a Masters of Information Science to even get a look from a Library.  

All I want is a steady income at a job that isn't retail or sales, and somehow it feels like I'm asking for the world.  I'm of sound mind and body, don't do drugs, don't have a criminal history, am reasonably intelligent and personable... yet it feels like due to my work history there is this invisible wall where every time I look for a job the only thing that comes back is Papa Murphys Pizza looking for an assistant manager or some ""Leonidas Salesforce"" looking for someone to cold call people.

I feel like there's a boat and everyone else got on it and left me behind.  How do I bridge that gap and get a ""real job""?",24Feb2017,10
