3,"Some background info first, i've been on Zoloft (sertraline) for about 9 months and am currently taking 150mg. I've noticed that every time i skip a dose, i seem to feel a lot better than usual the next day. I usually struggle with brain fog and not being able to think and feeling totally not like myself, and when i skip a dose it seems like all of that goes away. today especially, i feel like i can think, i've been ranting about philosophical things on twitter as i used to do before starting the zoloft, etc. Does anyone have a logical explanation for why this could be??

5,"I just finished my first year of college as a computer science major. My first semester went well with a 3.5 gpa, but my second semester severely tanked, and it's likely that I'll be on academic probation next semester. This was due to a variety of problems, including a dependency on weed, what I believe to be depression, a seeming loss of interest in computer science, as well as external stressors like being sick, adjusting to college, and other factors.
Because of my poor performance in school, my parents want me to raise money this summer ""if I plan to go back."" I have two options - One option is to work for a family friend in the computer science field. With him, I'll get certifications that would be useful in the future, but the job doesn't really pay too well. Because of the pay, I'm concerned that I won't be able to pay to go back to school if I stick with this job. My other option is to go to dc with my dad, and try to work there, but nothing is guaranteed and it's likely that it won't contribute to my knowledge in a particular field (as in computer science.) However, if I take a job up there, it's likely that I'll be paid more consistently with the figure I'll need to make it back to school.
One issue that compounds these other issues is that I'm terrified of starting over again - I had a lot of difficulty with my blank slate that college had given me, and it resulted in the loneliest year of my life.
My parents are telling me to take it step by step and put one foot in front of the other, but I don't think it's that simple, because I feel like this is a determining moment for the rest of my life.
I guess what I'm getting to is, what should I do? Is it worthwhile to gamble with my income to earn a certification that would make me employable, or should I try to get a higher income position that won't really contribute to my future intellectually?
Essentially, I feel like I'm screwed no matter what path I take. I really just need options.
Thanks in advance for the help.",07May2017,12
6,"I'm currently working at a middle to high end restaurant as a busser and food runner for a little bit more than half a year. 

Recently, different department managers have approached me and offered to join their department; the two that have interested me is the kitchen and bar. In the kitchen I will start off as a salad tender and work my way up. On the other hand, at the bar I will start off as a barback and try to work my way up as a bartender.

The dilemma I have is which I would rather pursue, on one hand I would really like to pursue the bar but shifts and opportunities are very limited although the pay is probably more. Also, friends, coworkers and I have put a ton of effort to try and get me this position.

On the other hand, the kitchen is something I always wanted to pursue and I will be guaranteed shifts; the work will be more difficult but I will receive more opportunities.

My question is which path should I pursue, the barbacking position and potentially bartending or the kitchen? ",07May2017,2
7,"I have a child that has a condition that requires significant funding to deal with and keep them healthy.  I have a job where the health insurance if great for her, so on that end I am lucky and understand that there are so many out there that do not have this option to them.

That being said, I am beginning to deteriorate mentally and physically due to personal medical reasons that are exasperated by the job (not looking for medical advice, please don't offer per rules of the Reddit).  It is beginning to incapacitate me as a parent.  Looking for other work may help the issue some, but with potential upcoming changes in healthcare laws, it is increasingly looking like a risky financial endeavor for their well-being.  I just want to be the parent they deserve and still keep them securely medically funded.  I worry my state will eventually get to the point where I will lose this job anyways if I can't get my self righted.

So... my Catch 22.  I have been unable to find another job with comparable health insurance and research for other funding methods have been unfruitful to say the least.

The advice I am seeking is a way out of my job that does not detriment my child.  I will not leave this job without an option until I am told I have leave, but I have not found any options.

15,"Hi Redditors, 
I am currently 32. Ten or eleven years ago, a high school acquaintance who went on to attend the same college and was on the debate team with me, ended up in prison for a violent episode. While he was a promising debater and person, his anger issues led to him being kicked off the team, and from that point on we had some contact (running into each other at parties, our friend Venn diagrams overlapped), but that was it. 
When he ended up in prison for this episode which I will not get into, my mother decided that, since he was now getting help for his anger issues and had been so promising through many of his past adverse circumstances (she knew him when I was in high school), would write to him, and try to support him. For the past ten years, she has written him letters, called him on the phone, and she and my dad even took a trip to visit him several years ago. She is the classic mom where she sees the good in people, and wants to help people in any way she can when she feels they need the help. 
Anyways, when he gets out she has now offered to let him stay with her and my dad as he gets back on his feet. 
This person, let's call him ""Mark,"" is thrilled that my parents are wiling to help in this way, and will most likely stay with them if he gets out this year.My husband and I live about a fifteen minute drive from my parents. 
My part in this is that I have kept in some contact with Mark. I have spoken to him several times, three tops, on the phone when he has called and I am visiting my parents. I have written 4-5 total letters and sent 3-4 Christmas cards over the past ten years. We were, and are, acquaintances. 
Most recently, when I sent a Christmas card this past year and congratulated him on potentially being released this year, I recently received a three page letter back. 
The letter is too personal. It basically explains that he will need lots of support and that he wants that support from me and my husband, and how if we are to give him that support we will hopefully be able to be mentally supportive and be his close friends. He goes on about how he wants to know everything about our lives, and how we will basically be very close, or how this is his goal. 
Reddit, Mark and I were only acquaintances in college with our friend Venn diagrams overlapping. My do-gooder mom has taken this to the next level, and I am starting to freak out. I am not sure if I even respond to this letter. I am nervous about Mark living with my parents and then trying to basically become part of our family. 
Currently, I have a decent commute to work, little free time, and will have a baby later this year. I feel like, once Mark moves in with my parents, every time I go over there, he is now a part of my environment and world, and I feel stressed and uncomfortable. I will be cordial, but do not have the time or mental energy to support this person that basically has asked to be heavily involved in my life when we were never friends in the first place. I am not sure if I write this guy back, or how I interact once he gets out and is living with my parents. He has definitely picked up good job skills, and was always very charismatic in college. I think he will work and not be around all the time, but overall I am not sure how to respond or interact, and would love advice. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",07May2017,2
16,"Hey, all! Sorry for the wall of (con)text, but here goes:


Right now, I am a junior in high school. Last year, I almost completely isolated myself from talking to people at all, largely because I didn't share any classes with any of my friends and they all stopped talking to me for the most part, so I figured they must have stopped liking me or something. It wasn't until the very end of the school year that this girl who was in a few of my classes started talking to me (after that point I started talking to my friends again), and I fell *madly* in love with her. I had obsessed over and fantasized about her constantly, even when I stopped seeing her when school let out.


One day, about a month into summer break, I decided to text her and ask if she liked me back; if the title of this post is any indication, her answer was equivalent to ""no."" I decided that the best course of action would be to stop talking to her for a while and try to let my feelings die. Eventually, I thought that they had, but when the school year started again, I realized that wasn't the case. I found myself thinking about her a lot again, and I thought that I would just be setting myself up for a world of sadness if I kept it up. Also, she had also been asking a lot of favors from me around that time, and I was growing suspicious that she was just ""using me."" So, sometime around October or November, I decided that I would just stop talking to her completely to kill my feelings for her. She's one of my only friends, so that probably wasn't the smartest thing, as I became incredibly depressed again for a few months, but it felt like a good idea at the time.


Sometime in February/March, she emailed me asking if I would like to help her with a project for school. I figured that it would probably be a good thing to do, and would most likely help a bit with my depression, so I went for it. After that, we started meeting up after school every once in a while to study for AP classes, hanging out at lunch here and there, etc.


Last week, I decided that it might be a good idea to ask her out on a date, and I finally worked up the courage to do so last Thursday. She said that she wasn't focusing on anything like that right now, and when I asked her if she might in the future, she said she'd email me later. Fwiw, I've just decided to take this as a resounding ""no,"" since that's what it seemed like.


Obviously, I'm kinda bummed out about getting rejected (as well as the fact she hasn't emailed me yet, but I'm used to her not emailing me when she says she will), but I'm more worried about being able to stop obsessing over her. It's killing me inside, as well as seriously harming my work ethic and my overall motivation/ passion to do anything. Does anybody have any advice as to how to deal with this? I'd love to be able to stop obsessing over her, but I don't know that I can. I don't think a day has passed where I haven't spent an unhealthy amount of time thinking about her.


But yeah, any advice? I'll be checking back in about an hour and a half",07May2017,6

21,"My cousin wants to me to make a poem for a love spell that she wants to try (I kept telling her no but she doesn't listen and is kind of blackmailing me with a secret) I never made one so I am not sure if this really is considered a poem. 
Here it is: 
Dear Goddess, 
I wish to achieve happiness
to replace my loneliness. 
To do it, I require someone to love me. 
I want someone to set me free from the cage I have been in for a week. 
His name is Lucius 
and I want him to be with me
and love me. 
I want a relationship
to replace our friendship 

I wish to move to LA to see my friends 
and have a long distance relationship
a relationship that might last forever 
One where we would go through life together

Thank you my Goddess
Even if this is not effective 
You would still have your personality be gorgeous

22,"I am a good caring person who has a perception of being tough, scary, listens to gangster rap, funny, care free, popular but I don't socialise much.
I am 36 and married with 3 kids paying off a mortgage with a reasonable job.
I used to be very well known in my area through sport and I guess I still am which is why I choose not to socialise much because I prefer my privacy.
Basically I feel like I am changing in a good way. I now prefer to listen to more calming music like Hans Zimmerman, I hate confrontation and all I can think about these days is my future for my kids.
The main issue I face is being the type of person that I don't like to admit is caring what people think about me. I used to also have a bad rep growing up which I can still see in people thinking that way of me when I have conversations with them.
So in a nutshell this probably doesn't make sense but I really want to be different than what I used to be but I still get these urges to listen to gangster rap, urges to still walk down the street and get into a fight, still try and put up that tough guy wall.

27,"18/M on lexapro/depakote/invega

On February 1st I had a scary experience. I had been eating very poorly and had missed multiple doses of my Lexapro. I got a taste in my mouth, then my legs got wobbly, then my entire body was shaking and my heart was racing. I sat on the couch for about an hour feeling horrible until I fell asleep. For the next couple of days I had heart palpitations, I was shaky, etc. I then got a stomach virus mid February. I then got epididymitis.

Late February I decided to start eating healthier and getting more exercise. Early March I started getting headaches/visual disturbances/dizziness, which are still going on.

I'm constantly worrying about my health ever since early February. Having that experience really nailed in the thought that I'm going to die one day, and I keep thinking about it. I have so much free time and I am always worrying about it. I am awake when everyone in the house is asleep a lot, so I'm often alone, worrying, sad.

I've been to the optometrist, who said ocular migraines, the cardiologist, who said orthostatic hypotension, and the neurologist, who said tension headaches causing migraines.
The past three months I've been miserable. My parents don't know what to do. I don't know if it's all in my head or if there are problems which are making me worry.

I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and he upped my medication. 

Everyone is saying I'm fine. I keep worrying about my health and just worrying in general. I start getting anxious constantly and have to go do something to stop it, then it comes back a little bit after I finish. 


tl;dr - 18, Anxiety/Sad. Nothing I try fixes it. Some health stuff but everything comes back fine. Don't know if it's hormones or lifestyle or what.

Our parents don't have the best attitude about mental health. They take the approach that he is just ""going through his teenage years"" even when it got very serious and scary. I discovered that he had been self-harming a year ago and forced him to go and see a psychologist. The psychologist didn't work out. He never opened up to her. They spent most of their weekly 2-hour sessions discussing stress from school work and formulating schedules for better time-management. It was so shitty. Because I knew that he has so much he needed to talk to someone about and she wasn't asking the right questions.

After 6-months of this, he said that he was fine and didn't need to see his psychologist anymore and my mother, thinking that he was finally over this ""weird period"", cancelled the appointments.

It's been half a year since him and I have had a major chat about suicide but it came up again today and he sounds as angry and upset and visceral as I have ever heard him. 

I am so worried. I don't know what to do. He doesn't want to see any other psychologists. My mother and father won't hear me out when I tell them that he is definitely depressed and suicidal because they feel like I'm crying wolf now.

The worst bit about the whole thing is I know how much he will love his time after high school. He's just not built mentally to deal with the day-to-day shit that comes from being at a school where people don't understand you.

Basically I'd like to enter the IT world, back during high school (12 years ago now, sheesh i am old) I was amazing on the whole Macromedia Suite, Dreamweaver, Frontpage and the usual web/graphic design.  I really thought I'd go into that field right after high school, but my school of choice was the Art Institute, after going to the tour I came to the realization that it was wayyy out of my price range.  So I went to community college and I started working in restaurants.  &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I worked in restaurants, because I was one of the millions of ""illegal"" aliens living in the USA.  So naturally the easiest job to get was restaurant work, it went well for close to 10 years, I started in fast food and by the time I was forced to leave the US, I was a bartender in an even hall and a GM of a small night club.  The money was great and I enjoyed what I did.  In the middle of all the work and money I slacked in my education so much so that I did not complete my Associates Degree till 2011, after starting and stopping since 2006!&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Present day, living in Mexico with my USC wife, who works remotely for a marketing company from the states.  She writes those click bait articles everyone loves :D  Needless to say between her USD salary and us living in Mexico, we don't have a bad life. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

The rut is that well work in mexico for english speakers without at least a bachelors degree comes down to call centers or elementary school english teacher, both which pay at most roughly $400 USD a month, thats about what my wife makes in 2 weeks, so it really makes no sense for me to go to work and make ($10,000) Mexican Pesos, since I'd have to pay around half of that to a baby sitter for our son.  Therefor for the last year and a half, I've been a ""stay at home husband"" I know laugh..go ahead. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways I've always enjoyed IT/tech work and would like to advice on the direction to enter this field, as I know this field is somewhat well paid down here in Mexico as well.
&amp;nbsp;

I've started doing some courses on codecademy but what else can I do to find work in the field?  Or what other courses, online schools can I enter to study the field? I have random free time in the evenings which is when I do the codecademy courses or do online gaming. &amp;nbsp;

53,"Hello. If you have time, I would really appreciate if you could read this and give me some advice, because I need it.
I'm an 18 year old guy, that ends high school in 7 months.
This is a summary of my life:
My grades are good.
I'm an introvert, and I fucking hate being so.
I have friends, but I feel like they're only ""school"" friends, as I never participate in the activities that they do outside of school. As an example, I can tell you that I haven't gone to a party since August 2016 yet all the people in my school go to parties like once or twice during the weekends. Also, apart from playing football matches with friends, I haven't done any activity with them (apart from parties) since more than a year, if I'm not correct.
As I don't go out with friends, I usually have a lot of free time (when I don't have tests at school or homework) and I spend a lot of this time gaming (PS4)
I'm tired of being excluded from all the activities that my friends do. I get excluded mostly because, when I was young (14-15), I didn't really like going out that much, so I think that basically my friends assume that I'm not interested in going out (plus I feel like they aren't even THAT interested in inviting me to come with them) 
At my school, there are basically two groups of people that I talk with. One of them is the group of ""cool"" guys, composed of (extrovert) people who usually do well in sports and not-so-well in terms of grades. The other group is the kinda ""chill"" group, composed mostly of people who do well at school but not so well at sports. The second group is the biggest (in terms of how many people they have) in my grade. 
Btw, when I say groups, it's not like they're defined, it's just a classification I did.
I used to be 100% part of the ""cool"" guys group, up until like 3 years ago when I started feeling that I didn't really like them. They were very mean with me most of the time and I feel like I was just a guy that they had fun with but I wasn't really their friend. 
In the last 3 years, I've been part of the ""chill"" group mostly, and I have like 2-3 close friends that I spend most of my break time with, and I do think that I ""fit"" in better with this group than the other one. The problem is that I NEVER participate in any activities that they do (those activities being mostly parties, and I never go to parties), and this 2-3 close friends just go with other close friends to this parties.
I feel like, between the people of my school, I'm considered as a nice guy that you just see at school and maybe have a good time with during the day, but that's it. I usually have a lot of patience with other people but in reality I hate being like this, because this mostly leads to people laughing about me more than they should or pranking me and then I don't really do anything and I just do a fake laugh.

Since I'm an introvert, I really struggle to make things that can potentially fail and humiliate me. For example, most of the people would just tell their friends that they want to start to go to parties and they would eventually be included into social activities, but in my case I REALLY don't feel capable of doing this, I would just feel so insecure and uncomfortable after telling them that I feel like I'm not capable of doing so. Also, I feel like they are not even interested in me joining them, specially because they don't show any interest at all in me going to parties with them, so my plan of being included could totally fail and I would get into even a more uncomfortable situation after being rejected. 
Also, in 7 months, when I'll end high school, in my country we do a special party where you need to invite a girl to come with you. I don't have any female friends (my school is only for boys) and whenever I think about I start feeling worse and worse.
Can you give me some advice about this please?

54,"So here is the dilemma. My friend, we can call him Bob, is an actor at my high school. He took an audition at SMU and was able to get in with an incredibly good scholarship that basically gave him a full ride. The acting program is very good, and it is where he wants to go. His parents want him to go to USC (South Carolina) for Pre-Law, but USC didn't give him a very good scholarship and he doesn't want to do law. His parents are forcing him to go to USC, so my question is, is there anything that he can do at all? What options does he have?

Thanks much guys I appreciate it.",07May2017,1
56,"Hello all, first time poster here. Sorry if this is too long.

My S.O. has just finished his Sonic Arts Degree. He is unsure about where he wants to go, as he feels his degree hasn't given him the skills he needs to break into the industry. He talked of wanting to get into sound design for games, tv and film. Doing mixing and mastering for bands, that kind of thing. He has just been let go of his casual waiting job, and is now on Centrelink (unemployment benefits, Australian edition). 

I want to help support him through this difficult time. I've tried help by setting up a plan to help improve his skills, a contact of mine asked him to produce some background music for a video he is doing - paid work. He's so unsure of himself that I'm worried he will let this opportunity pass him by.

I want to help him, but I'm worried that I'll push him away from me. I'm an artist myself, who went through a similar time when I left art school. I found that the way through these feelings came only through forcing myself to create work, and take on every opportunity I could get related to my field. To feel like I was good enough, I had to learn how to be good enough. However, maybe what worked for me isnt right for him? 

He cares about sonic arts, but the idea of failure is so terrifying to him he cant face it. It tears me up seeing him like this, having gone through it myself. Im trying to be what I needed when I was in that situation, but it seems to only make him upset and distant.

Any ideas on the best way to support him during this time?

These days, I'm trying to be an example for him, by practicing what I preach. Improving my skills and taking every opportunity I find. Hoping that he sees this and feels inspired to do the same.",07May2017,1
57,"I'm dating a 40 year old Korean guy and he is coming to visit me.... we have not had sex... what should I expect with this? Does anybody know specifics about their culture and what is considered ""ok"" or ""acceptable""??",07May2017,1
58,"Hey reddit. As a very socially inept kid, I've never had many friends before. Starting from pretty much 2nd grade to 7th grade, I kinda cemented myself into that nerdy kid with no friends that would sit in the corner doing math or learning some other extracuricular all day. My pretty stereotypical Asian parents further imposed this belief on me (you need to be good at math in order to get into a good college to get a good job).

So conversations sometimes went like this: 
""Hey, what did you do this weekend?"" 
""Uh... I did math, went to Chinese school, and played some League of Legends..""
""Wow... your life sounds so boring...""
""Yeah, I know... but its going to be worth it at the end.""

And so that firm belief, along with my daily dose of reddit, kept me going for those 6 years. That is until one day, one of the slightly more popular kids looked me in the eye, and said something along the lines of: ""Hey, I know you're worried about your lack of friends and your social anxiety and whatnot. It's fine. We all have these worries. But you see, it's necessary to remember that you won’t ever fit in anywhere. No matter what, you’ll feel like a different being, peeking in from the outside but never, ever permitted in. Your family, your future SO, your lack of friends… none of them will ever come remotely close to encounter what you feel on a daily basis…  what eventually drives people just like you into drugs and despair and eventually dying alone. No one will remember your name, let alone any mathematical legacy you fruitlessly tried to create during your existence. I’m sorry, but all the students at school know that, all of your teachers know that, it's just that no one has the heart to tell you the truth."" 

And so with that, I started considering, ""Hey, is it actually worth it? What is the point of putting myself through this, removing me of any sort of childhood that I should have had? Why can't I be more like my happy, healthy, friends who have parties and sleepovers and social events every week?"" Hell, I didn't even have friends, not to mention all of these social events on a constant basis. And so I set off to change myself in 8th grade, I stopped doing a bunch of my extracurricular activities. I started sitting next to the new kids at school, the kids that were in the same exact situation as I was in, with no friends. And that worked out pretty well. I started actively hanging out with more people, I started inviting kids over, and I felt a general improvement to the quality of my life. That is, until halfway through the school year, all of them decided to move on. Some decided to become friends with other people. Some decided to create their own cliques. Others stopped actively hanging out with me, and eventually, abandoned me all together, and all of a sudden, I landed at square 1, back where I was at the beginning of the school year. Except the thing was, I *wasn't the smartest kid at math anymore.* I wasn't the kid the juggled around multiple extracurricular activities, I wasn't the kid that studied all day, none of that. I was just a normal kid, except with no friends. And all of that has led me to believe that I was just a cringy, socially awkward kid the entire time. None of that could have happened by coincidence. It all happened because I'm a horrible and boring person to hang out with. And all of this has led me to believe that there's no more meaning in life anymore. There's nothing l that I could wake up being excited to do, whether it be to get one step closer to getting into a dream college or being able to chill out with friends. I could have continued with my path and continued to land in a good college and perhaps get say a better job with it, or I could have been been more socially non-awkward and be life everybody else and live a slightly more normal life, but no. I decided to attempt to be a normal kid, and it cost me everything. 

I know I've ranted a lot throughout this post, but how can I improve the quality of my life, whether it be through catching up to those smart kids or being more social? It feels like everything is just over for me now. ",07May2017,3
59,"I won't go into detail, but here's the gist of it. I have a friend from a somewhat conservative culture, I'm a full blown American teenager. My friend gets so mad at me whenever I drink or smoke weed, more intensely passionate about the weed part. I really don't understand why he gets so up in arms about it, even to the point of ending our friendship. You might say he just cares a lot about me, but he drinks and smokes (cigarettes) with his friends  from time to time too. We're the same age and known each other for some time. I try to explain to him doing these things doesn't make me a bad person. (Keep in mind, I have perfect grades and I'm the top percent of my class, going to a great university this fall.) It's my culture and I love them, and I can't just ignore or push aside it all because you don't like it. I guess my question is, would a real friend actually do all that? Or would a real friend understand the difference in culture and realize it can't be changed. Honestly, I just want to know what to say.






And no I'm not going to stop having fun. And don't say its going to ruin my life, because we all do it and I'm not a maniac. 
















EDIT: I forgot to add a whole aspect to this problem. Sometimes he'll say he wants to die and eat pills and drink. I say don't!!!!!, he says, ""Don't tell me what to do, If you get to do whatever you want, I can do whatever I want. Don't judge me and I won't judge you."" Basically he's trying to make me feel the way he does when I smoke, it's so unfair. I know he's definitely not suicidal, like I know him, but his logic is so dam annoying. ",07May2017,1
60,"I spend pretty much every waking minute on my PC when I'm not busy cooking, cleaning or attending to urgent things (work etc.). It's pretty much what I live for. My parents always comment on this (my father once told my extended family that my PC was my girlfriend when they asked me if I had one). It doesn't really bother me that much because I don't live with them, but I've realised I get zero enjoyment out of anything else in life other than sitting in front of the computer.

I'm not kidding when I say this. Tonight what limited friends I have dragged me out to a nightclub and I left half way through just go go back on the PC because I was so bored without it. This happens all the time, nothing can ever keep me entertained for long enough for me not to get bored and want to go sit at my desk. 

I can't even go home and visit my family for prolonged periods because life without my PC is just so mind-numbling boring.

Is this dependence on my PC something that's bad? Life without the internet and my computer seems not worth living to me.

61,"I've never been interested in school. English is the only subject to catch my attention, but I don't much care for anything else. In spite of that, I've gotten fairly good grades throughout elementary school and middle school, but through HS, my increased Independence backfired on me. I nearly failed my freshman year, getting the absolute bare minimum in credits to be allowed to pass, and that story was just persistent through my sophomore, junior, and senior years. 

For most of HS, I've been focused on sports, getting high, and playing video games.  My parents aren't a big part of my life, so they never exactly cared (when my dad found out about my grades, I believe his exact words were ""your life, if you want to fuck it up, that's your business""), so I just kept feeding my own habits. I played a lot of football, basketball, and baseball, and practically centered my life around my teams, and we'd spend the days smoking weed and playing video games. At school, I'd barely pay attention to my teachers, would barely touch the work (I often turn papers in half-finished, would sleep during class, and play on my phone during lectures), and though my teachers tried their damned hardest to get me to not ruin my life, they never got through to me. 

Looking at my past grade cards, I can't help but cringe. Ds across the board, a few low Cs, and a single A. *One* good grade. Over four years. A few failed classes on there as well, mostly math. I'd get my grades, laugh it off, ignore lectures where they'd tell me that after HS I'm going to be unable to do much, and go back to my usual routine. Quite surprisingly, my test scores aren't half bad. Above average and accelerated. 

It's gotten bad. Outside of school, I've never worked a day in my life. I'd wake up some nights, unable to remember the day before, with empty bottles around me and a blistering headache. I've probably tried more types of drugs in my life than everyone around me combined at this point, and not all of it ended well. I've been nearly arrested once, but managed to flee the scene and the officer had none of my information, so as far as they know I've never existed. I've been a sort of wanna-be gangster, and that took me to a bad crowd. ""Friends"" would introduce me to different drugs, I'd help them deal and make a cut, and I'd spend all my money on more drugs. 

So, there's my life. Until a few months ago, after a horrible car accident. Now I'm disabled, unable to run and it takes a lot of effort for me just to stand up and walk. Can't play sports anymore, so all of my ""friends"" have decided I don't exist anymore. No more drugs because I don't have anyone to get them anymore, no more drinks because my parents don't keep liquor in the house. Been clean since the accident, got tested, had a moment of profound relief at me being rather healthy. But most of the past few months has been me in my house reflecting on my life and figuring out that I don't know where I'll go. 

I'm in my last semester of HS. Surprisingly, I'm on course to graduate. For the first time, my grades are fairly great (As and Bs!) and my teachers are commenting on my participation in class. It's clear I'm turning around, but this is a single semester, and my last to boot. I'm going to graduate with a GPA that'll probably be under 2.0. What the hell is that good for?

My parents aren't of any help. They're always working, and when I manage to ask them for help, they're generally unhelpful. My councillor still doesn't take me seriously, and will blow off my questions. 

I want to graduate, then study in college. I'm still juggling what I should do, but I do want to go to college and study something. But it'll be a flurry of rejection letters, won't it? I won't get into anywhere but a for profit university, assuming those still exist (do they? I hope not). At least, that's what I can't stop telling myself.

69,"This is going to be a long post and I apologize in advance. If anyone here could bother reading it thoroughly and giving me any advice, I'd sincerely appreciate it.

For years, I've wanted to become a railway conductor/engineer. Last week after returning from a year of working away from home in my secondary career field (environmental conservation), I was offered a conductor position with a tiny railroad in my home state, about an hour or so away from where I grew up with friends and some family close by. Sounds great, right? It's the chance to do exactly what I've dreamed of for years. The company is good, work is stable with a consistent schedule (a rarity in the rail industry), pay is better than I've ever made in any other field, and with it I can become a full engineer in about a year and save enough money to both put myself through school and help my family financially, as we have been struggling to get by for a long time. You'd think I'd be super excited about this opportunity, but I'm honestly not. Here's why.

During the year I was away from home, my stepfather was killed and it left my mom an emotional wreck. I came home to deal with it as soon as I found out, as I was the closest to him (being the youngest) and I was the only one of my siblings available to help her. It changed my plans also, and eventually ruined my chance of sticking around in conservation (another long story there). After his memorial I had to leave Mom and return to my job, which just ended last month. I promised her once that job was over, I'd come home and be there for her since he no longer could be. I began looking for jobs close to home (we live in Oregon), but nothing turned in my favor. The only thing that opened up was this railroad job, which is two states over in Montana, close by to other family and friends like I said, but in a crappy area and far away from Mom. She really needs both emotional and financial support right now, especially as she's also taking care of her elderly father alone with no supplementary income, and it's been awful on her. If I leave for the railroad in Montana, I can help her financially but not emotionally.

There's more. Like I mentioned before, Montana is my home state . We only moved to Oregon a few years ago: Mom, her father, my stepfather and myself. I like it out here because it provides me opportunities to be myself in ways I never could be in MT. I have gender identity issues as well as emotional baggage I need to have sorted out, and there aren't nearly as many resources for that where I'm from/about to go back to. Adding to that, railroading is a hypermasculine field and I'm a very non-masculine person, hoping to transition sooner rather than later (MtF). If I take this position, not only can I not support Mom emotionally when she needs it the most, but I may end up stuck in a job and place that won't let me transition or do what I need to without some serious risks. But if I stay back home with Mom, my career won't advance at the one point when I'm getting to restart it properly, and I won't be able to contribute much of anything financially. This just feels like a ""damned if I do, damned if I don't"" scenario and I'm not sure what to do, and I only have a few days to figure it out. My job starts on the 15th, and I have to be in MT before then to take it. Not only that, but I've spent years trying to leave behind the life I knew in Montana. It wasn't who I wanted to be and I have a lot of bad memories from there, many of which contributed to years of depression. I don't want to go back to that, but I might have to. I honestly have no idea what to do anymore.

TL;DR: Starting a new job in Montana basically next week in the field I've always dreamed of, but torn because if I take it, I do so at the expense of my grieving mother in Oregon and I might lose my chance of transitioning genders in the process. Please help.",07May2017,3

fast forward to age 21

finally catch a break

friend gets me hired at dominbros making pizzas

do well with a promotion to manager at 6 months or so.

1 and a half years in they want me to become a general manager at a store:
quarter pay bump to 9.50 on a salary for 55 hours
been working an average of  70 hours a week and GM usually works 80 with a 1% of store profit as a potential bonus they make very difficult to achieve

not worth it

buddy works at a liquor store

me and other friend go there

pay cut and less hours but buy car and get license 

start giving more money to folks cause younger 
brother starts high-school at same school I went to

get girlfriend

things looking up

saving a little money here and there

unfortunately years of watching porn give me 

ed(unless it's something else. am overweight but otherwise healthy)

relationship sours over time cause no real sex

gf dumps me

work becomes overly dramatic 

leave and bounce from liquor store to liquor store

become more and more depressed

find cool mechanic job

feel a bit better

make more money

parents need more money

work part time at another nearby liquor store to get more funds

car breaks down 

quit second job and just mechanicing now

eventually costs pile up and parents need more money

stash a bit to the side and buy beater from coworker
put in a little tlc and car is fine but can't register or insure cause at this point I can barely save any money.

past month has been literal paycheck to paycheck with whole check gone from paying my bills and the rest to support my folks.

I have a debt from tools(three years), a hospital bill (will be paid off this june) from passing out at the first day of work at mechanic job (blood sugar just dropped for whatever reason, several tests later everything fine).

then I just have little stuff like a vpn, Hulu and Playstation network.

I do smoke and my pops does too. I smoke a pack every three days he smokes a pack+ a day and I pay for all our weekly expenses cause we work together
I just don't really know what to do because whenever I try to quit it's right there cause he isn't and I always lose the will to quit.

Redditors please hit me with an outside perspective. 
It just boggles my mind so and I'm at a loss. 
Here's what I've come to so far:
I can't count on a paycheck so I need an alternative way to make money.

my parents have just paid off my brother's tuition which is about 700 a month less we have to scramble together usually from my dad selling something or making a deal (selling something for someone) but our actual monthly expenses won't go down much. will know in a month or two.

my original car is sellable but I'll take a big loss cause it needs work and I'd rather keep it
second car is fine but nobody wants it

I very much want to move out and start trying to scrape my life together but I fear if I do my folks will flounder. 

I have no savings. saving for me at this point is getting a 20 out once a week or two weeks and tucking it away for when the money runs out and it's more or less an oh shit fund that never gets more than 40 bucks in it",07May2017,2
78,"My situation with my future roommates is a bit complex. Simply put, I am moving with two roommates in an three bedrooms apartment. One of them is my friend and current roommate, and they other one is her girlfriend. So a couple basically. And we don't want a fourth roommate.

So obviously we have one spare room that we have to decide what to do with it. The idea at first was to convert the master bedroom into a shared space for all of us. However they asked me to pay more rent for this. As I would have one bedroom + access to 1/2 of the shared room for my desk/computer.

Makes sense. But I couldn't agree with this. Instead of paying more rent, I would rather get my own room, leave the other two for them to use, and split the rent evenly. I don't need an extra shared space and I value my privacy. I'm also trying to save some money. So I told them that's what I prefer in the end.

But now his girlfriend proposed that they get the master bedroom since they are a couple, and that I should get a smaller one. If that was a two bedrooms apartment, I would have agreed without hesitation. However, remember they have an extra room for themselves to do what they want with it. She is asking for 2.5 times the space as mine and split the rent 1/3 each....fuck that.

I understand they are a couple but they don't need the largest bedroom if they are just gonna put half their stuff in the other one. And a bed is still a bed. It doesn't take more space whether one or two person sleep in it. They don't have double the furniture as I have. As for myself, I need to setup my desk and all my stuff in my bedroom. Comparatively to them, I would feel extremely constrained in a small one. Those two smaller rooms are pretty limited if you need a full bedroom setup. This is a matter of comfort and functionality at this point, so I refused her idea.

Of course they will pay a big portion of the rent in the end. But given the fact they have access the two rooms, I would like to have the choice of my room. I even proposed to pay a bigger portion of the rent for the master bedroom and let them have the parking lot if it comes to an argument. On top of that, I'm legitimately the one who did all the effort to find this apartment. I'm the one administrating all the bills at our current apartment and will still be in the new one. I'm also contributing more that half for the household appliances. 

So all in all, I feel what she is asking is unfair. My friend seems open minded to the fact that I get the master bedroom. I didn't talk to her yet but it seemed like what she wanted to do was the only option in her mind. And my friend doesn't want to take any decision until she is happy....come on! She have to make some compromises.

Please tell me if what I'm asking is fair....at least I think it is. How would you approach the situation with them?",07May2017,1

 -Closed campus, but since I am 19 I occasionally leave and don't give a fuck even though it isn't allowed


Ideas i've had: 
 -Getting a penis and vagina costume, telling everyone there will be a fight at a specific date and time, get everyone amped up and then have the penis and vagina ""fight"" while blasting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9FImc2LOr8] song. I would get someone with a megaphone that would say something along the lines of ""LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S GET READDDY TO RUUUMBBLEEE"". The penis and vagina would fake fight and eventually pretend to fuck. Pretty funny?

 -This one is slightly similar to the last one. We get everyone amped up and tell everyone there is going to be a ""fight"" at a certain date and time. Once large groups of people gather to watch us a friend and I either A- Pull out DS's and ""fight"" on Pokemon. B-Play rock paper scissors, or C- Hug it out instead of fight.

 -Spraying liquid ass around every corner of our school

 -Hiding dead fish in the ventilation and spreading the scent throughout the school

 -Planting beans, vines, or some insanely intrusive plant throughout the school

 -Ordering a bunch of pizzas to school


The problem with the first two is that:

 -Having a specific date and time to have a ""fight"" would quickly spread around. Around 3/6 of our security guards are complete fucking pricks and may catch on and try to stop it as soon as we have the ""fight"". I live in a suburban, low crime area.

 -Since the ""fight"" would be extremely high profile (would preferably like large crowds of people to watch) faculty may stop it if their head is up their ass. There is a possibility that they may just allow it since it is harmless and pretty funny. I was actually thinking of having a friend wait in a running car in the parking lot and immediately getting the fuck out as soon as the prank is over. Since we would be in costumes, we could not be identified and our chances of getting in trouble would be lowered. 

 A few options to get around these are 

 -Talk to one of the cool security guards and explain to him what my senior prank is. Since it is fairly harmless he may be cool with it, tell the other security guards and help me do the prank.

 -Purposely have the ""fight"" on a different date so the security and faculty are thrown off.

 -Ditch immediately after the ""fight"" is over, in costume, as stated above. Since our faces would be covered we would not be able to be identified and we would get away with it.

I am open to any and all suggestions as long as they aren't obviously illegal.

TL:DR: I am a 19-year old ""super senior"", I graduate on May 18th, ceremony is on May 22nd, I am known within my friends for being hilarious, I want a LEGAL yet hilarious prank to end the year with. Would rather have something funny than assholeish, although a few of my ideas contradict this lmao

93,"Hello reddit. 
So as the title says my friend was raped. We've been friends for 4-5 years now. We have a group of friends. 
We all graduated and pretty much grew out of the 'drinking every weekend' stage. She made some friends in her university (we don't go to the same) and they drink A LOT, because they are not from the city. She got waaay too drunk one day with them and the next she woke up next to a guy in a motel and yeah. She told me all of this while drunk. Her other 'friends' just laughed it off.

I have been sexually assaulted before (i have dealt with this ) so it hit me because i knew she was acting weird and i know what follows. she told me 4 weeks after it happened. I told her to please talk to me, that i would never judge her, i told her she wasn't at fault and that i would support her. 

The guy kept talking to her for a while but the worst part is that she refuses to acknowledge it was rape, she uses frases like 'we did it' 'we fucked' but never 'i was raped', how is it not rape? she doesn't remember a thing! 
She uses alcohol as a escape. I know this feeling all too well and i just want her to feel safe again to let her know she shouldn't be emabarassed and to cry or whatever. She was a virgin and she previously told me she wanted her first to be 'special'.

The last time we saw each other she drank alone in her house before coming to meet us, in her drunken state she said 'you guys are boring because you never drink' my other friend told me if i knew about the rape and i said i already knew and we are trying to find a way to help. She was kinda avoiding me while drunk and then kept apologizing about nothing. She doesn't talk to any of us about this.
Please, how do i approach this?

TLDR: My friend got raped while drunk, refuses to acknowledge this, and uses alcohol as a escape.",07May2017,1

97,"Hey

Me and my gf are both 24 and live in the Netherlands. We have been together for 6 years now and we still like each other a lot. My girlfriend recently finished her studies and is now job hopping because the field she works in doesn't have a lot of jobs available.

However she often complains about not having anyone to spend time with. This because she loves to be outside however doesn't want to do things alone all the time. As far as I know she only really has 3 friends me included. I work two jobs and I am still studying as well. As a result we spend our Saturdays together and a little bit on Wednesdays but other than that she is often really lonely.

Does anyone know any good ways to make friends around this age? I often meet people through mutual friends however that doesn't seem to be an option for her. Although she seems to be an extrovert, she is also rather shy and doesn't like going out drinking or parties and the like.

Any ideas are welcome, at most all I can do is suggest things to her. Thanks for reading :)

98,"I'm at 23 year old dude.

I don't know what to say. Al I can tell you is that I've known I needed help for years, but I've never been able to ask for it.

I'm having a very hard time adjusting to normal life, and in the past year or so, I've adopting some very destructive behaviors. I've more or less intentionally destroyed my chances at graduating on time and pursuing a career related to my field. 

I'm a smart guy. I know it. But at the same time, I'm intentionally hurting myself. I'm avoiding the future. I've skipped all of my classes the last month. After I missed the first two, I just couldn't bring myself to go to class afterwards. Too nervous.

I've been dodging calls. I ignore my parents, and I've become distant with my friends.

Something is deeply wrong with me, and I don't what, but I don't what my problem even is, and where to go to get it fixed.

There's so many things I need to say, and I can't find the words. I feel like no matter what I do, what I say, no one will ever understand me.

I'm losing touch with myself, and I'm really scared. I just don't know what to do, or how to explain my thoughts. I have a strong urge to just drop everything and run.

I grabbed it l, and climbed over the boy's bed who threw my pillow. He lashed out and I fell off, my foot landing on the face of someone sleeping on the floor
He woke up screaming and there was blood everywhere. We waited for a while and he said he was fine but today his nose was very crooked and his parents believe it to be broken.

102,"Hi guys,

So yesterday I was trying to resolve an issue on Rainbow Six Siege and my connection. I ended up turning uPnP off and on again, just to reset it, as well as portforwarding a bunch of different TCP and UDP addresses.

Additionally, I cleared out everything in my ""hosts"" file and updated all my drivers. I don't believe these two have any relevance but I thought it worth mentioning just in case.

This fixed the original R6 Siege issue but now I'm getting the problem mentioned in the title. WiFi completely dies, before turning back on again after a few minutes (affects all devices connected to WiFi network). I don't believe I'm being DDoSed or anything, and I haven't downloaded anything recently so I doubt it's a virus.

107,"so, this girl.... we started off as friends but i slowly developed a crush on her over the course of senior year. she had boyfriend troubles constantly and would get back together with this same guy all the time. during one of their breaks she had convinced me things with them were done for good. i was lonely so i gave things a shot. 

the relationship didn't last very long at all but it was extremely intense. she broke up with me twice, i believe, bc i was afraid of having sex w her due to past trauma and i was hesitant about being physical in other ways bc i didn't know how. the other time she was so afraid of hurting me that she decided it was best we just put an end to things.

ultimately what tore us apart for real was her old boyfriend coming back into the picture with her convinced things between the two of them had really changed. the whole summer i stood by her side through everything but ultimately i felt like i was being strung along as something to use if that relationship ended again. she was aware i still had strong feelings for her and she'd say she felt the same all while with her bf. this made me very confused and uncomfortable so i stopped expressing those thoughts with her after that. we were still incredibly close, i believe she has the highest string of texts on my phone to date even. but when summer started coming to a close i knew things were gonna change bc i had no choice but to stay here for college while she went an hour away right  next to the school i wish i could afford. she was my only piece of a support system then and i told her i was scared of losing her. and that'd id probably push away to make the pain duller, but i needed her to make an attempt to show she really cared. well, silly me. she up and left for college without saying a damn word to me. i found out on snap chat that she was already moved in with her new best friend. i remember angrily deleting her on there just to save myself from any more jealous fits i may have.

fast forward a few months later,  i see her for the first (and last) time since she left at my favorite band's concert she promised to go w me. it was amazing and everything felt right again, i felt good and i wanted her back. that didn't happen bc that asshole bf of hers was still in her life. we'd occasionally send texts after that like ""hey, sorry ive been so busy. miss u"". 

around december she says she learned her bf was abusive and had really left him for good, idk why she told me really. it felt like she wanted me to replace him i guess. but i remember her saying she only wanted to be around people who really cared about her over the break and i figured id see her. we made vague plans like ""yeah pls we gotta hang out"". i even bought her a really nice necklace for a christmas gift. but something clicked in me and i returned that, and i never went to see her. i always expected her to text me or something but it's been 5 months and i think she's completely forgotten me. i keep checking her instagram hoping she'll break up with this new guy of hers because im so utterly jealous. 

ik it sounds like im the toxic one here, and i don't deny that, but she had some extreme faults. i always felt pressured into doing things i wasn't comfortable with, and everything was always so dramatic and intense. i felt like i was suffocating. but i had also never felt loved in my life, and i really do think she was the one and only person to ever show me what that was like. i used to get those floating waves after being with her.. like id just come out of the water or a boat. it was really special. but it was so unhealthy. i was never really put as a priority. she always needed some one and i was happy to help but if id talk about my own stuff she'd relate it back to her or belittle me. 

sometimes i think im done thinking about her forever but then i get extremely depressed about it all and don't know what to do with myself. i could text her but it's been so long and i don't think i really want her back in my life again. maybe at times i do but that's usually just bc i have a thing for letting myself suffer. honestly i think if i ever saw her again id just get so angry id have to walk away.

110,"This is my first time asking for help on reddit and due to the seriousness of the situation I don't feel like I can tell my friends, so here's the problem.

I work in NHS and there are optional 'out of hours' available to staff wanting a bit of extra money. We fill in an overtime form to claim the extra hours we've worked but I've noticed one of my colleagues is claiming for hours they haven't worked. When I spoke to another work friend about it, they said that the person in question has been doing it all the time but nobody has mentioned anything. I noticed they have been claiming about 2 hours extra per shift (at enhanced 1.5x pay), she also takes on a lot of extra shifts and has been doing it for about 2 years. This amounts to a few thousand pounds in extra pay.
For a while, I too haven't mentioned anything because there was no 'hard evidence' that she had been claiming extra money, just my word against hers. But a few weeks ago a different member of staff had disciplinary action taken against them for leaving 10 minuets early (which I though was a little harsh in comparison) but Human Resources (HR) used CCTV footage showing them leaving early. 
I didn't realise that we had a camera outside the building and then last week a work friend was complaining to me that this person in question left at 12pm but wrote 2pm on her overtime sheet.
The dilemma is that if I report her to HR, she will most likely lose her job. She has already been in trouble with HR before about bullying other members of staff but she's young, spent 4 years at university  training for this job and now has financial responsibilities. If I report her and she loses her job, she won't be able to work in the NHS again. I'd genuinely feel awful about ruining someones life (which is why other people probably haven't reported it) and I'm not sure that I could deal with knowing I've ruined someones life. But what she's doing is a criminal act, stealing money from the NHS.
In my head, I know the right thing to do is to report this.
I feel like I'm too involved emotionally (after dealing with all the bulling) to make an objective decision about what to do. I don't want to report her because she made mine and a few others life unpleasant, it would just feel like some petty revenge.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, any advice would be helpful. I'm also happy to answer any questions as long as it doesn't reveal the identity of anyone.

I'm 25 who lives in Arizona. I live with a friend (kind of) where we both split the rent. I work as a medical assistant and have a certificate. I have a girlfriend who I've been with for maybe 7 months. I have no family here because they are all in California and I have a good relationship with my parents and siblings. My life doesn't suck and I'm doing ok. So why do I want to essentially run away and leave everything behind me? I'm not happy. I'm not happy because I'm not being honest to literally everyone around me. I'm gay. No one know's I'm gay. I want to leave because if I came out I would lose all my friends. I'm not exaggerating. All my friends are Christian and I attend the same church. I just can't do it anymore. Every inch of my being is screaming to get out. Not just from this place but from this mental prison of not being who I want to be. I want to just leave. Start from scratch. I have a car which I'm still making payments on. I have about $500 in my bank account and $1,200 in savings. I just want to leave a note or send an email letting everyone know I'm gone and to not bother looking for me. 
Now, here are my hang ups. My best friend who is pretty much family lives in the same city. We are really close. I don't want to leave him, it would break my heart to lose him and I know I would break his if left. Also, coming out to him is not option. It would be best to just leave and never see him again than to tell him I'm gay. Next would be my parents and siblings (brother and sister). Even though different state, they would be heartbroken as well because I visit them since AZ and CA are pretty close and I don't know where I would go. I don't really want to move back with parents and I'm not sure how they'll react if I told them I'm gay. I love my brother and we talk almost everyday, I don't want to lose him.

My husband is an attorney who works a lot, and both our children are gifted, sensitive, and artistic.

My husband's idea of being a good parent is taking the kids to fun places and spending money on them or bringing home candy. I have been in therapy and read several books about positive parenting and parenting emotionally intense children. Neither of us had nurturing parents, and I want to be the best support system for them.

I have been trying to get him on the same page for several years, and he has yet to finish one (out of many) books I have asked him to read. 

I could go on an on about the excuses he makes about not having time, etc. when he does have time to stay up late drinking bourbon and watching sci-fi.

So Friday night, after an especially long work-week, he comes home and does his bourbon/pass out thing while I take the kids to a neighborhood event. The next morning I take my daughter to her swim meet and he takes our son to a go cart place. When we get home, my husband says that both he and our son aren't feeling well.

An hour later, my daughter wants to go to the community pool with her friend. I tell husband that I'm not comfortable with him sleeping while our son hangs out alone. Husband says ""I can hear him if he needs me. I'm just going to rest for 45 more min.""

When I get home with my daughter 2 &amp; a half hours later, husband is dead-asleep in bed, and son is still on couch. I take son's temp, and it's now 101. He's also coughing like crazy. Husband sounds a little sick, but No fever. I'm pretty sure he's mostly catching up on sleep.

I'm just not sure if I'm over reacting. I would never leave my sick child for hours on end without checking on him, no matter how sick I was feeling. I feel guilty for having been away, knowing now he was left to take care of himself while husband slept.

123,"So my mum is in the hospital and just had surgery for tumors in her brain. I went in to visit her this evening before work so I could brush her teeth and get ready for bed, and one of our family friends was there visiting until I could show up. 

This particular friend does have a heart of gold and will do anything for our family. Unfortunately, she tends to not think before she speaks, or doesn't realize the implications of her words and the effects they have. 

Now because of her surgery my mom has a cut on the top of her head with staples in it. When I went in the friend said stated that she called my mom ""Staplehead"" or something along those lines. I know that this friend didn't mean it maliciously and I understand that she was trying to joke about it so my mom wouldn't feel bad about it, but I could tell it really upset my mom. She kept twirling her hair to see if she could pin it, or trying to use the hair on the other side to hide the staples.

Also we set up a small speaker in the room so we could play music for my mom and the friend had her iPod set up playing sad sounding indie songs. Again, her heart was in the right place but I could tell my mom was really uncomfortable with it since the friend kept playing songs that artists wrote for people who had passed away. The whole message she was trying to convey was ""unconditional love"" and I get it, but I didn't appreciate it. Nor did my mother. The friend kept asking if I was listening to the words and I said ""No, I don't really want to listen to this,"".

Again, I appreciate this woman and how she has helped our family over the years. And I have to stress that she didn't mean to harm with these actions. But the image of my mom trying to fix her hair over the staples is breaking my heart. 

I want to tell my Dad and see how to proceed, but he's in autopilot mode right now. And I'm afraid of making him upset with this friend. I also know that if I talk with her directly she's going to go be emotional with my mom, which wouldn't be good either. I know how I would word things, and even though I would say something along the lines of ""Do not tell mom I had this convo with you,"" she's going to tell my mom. I can't ignore this either. If this friend is going to visit my mom then she needs to watch what she says. 

I would just tell her not to bring attention to my mom's staples and to play light hearted music or podcasts that will make my mom feel good. And to not say I had this conversation with her since it would negatively impact my mom.

My options are 1) Tell my dad and then proceed how he wants or 2) Talk to family friend directly.

Risks: 1) My dad becomes very upset and bans friend from seeing my mom or blasts the friend for her comments/actions. I don't want to be the potential catalyst for 20+ years of friendship being undone, and while my mom is very sick. And I feel like it's a cop out on my part for not talking to the friend directly.

2) I tell friend about all this myself and run the risk of her going directly to my Mom and being emotional with her. This would be bad because my mom can't really talk and she gets tired really, really easily. And someone doing that would again be bad and would again bring attention to something that she's sensitive about. 

I just don't know what I should do. Any advice is appreciated as she's going to be visiting my mom again today. I'm going back to the hospital to help my mom with eating breakfast and read some blogs to her and I'm going to shower my mom with compliments and try and lift her spirits.

I currently work 6am til 2pm but wondered if anyone had any advice or examples of their routine if they work a night shift? The pay is really good hence the reason why I've gone for it.

127,"I fucked up big time at my schools prom last night. I left a pretty large (unopened) bottle of alcohol in my car in a place that was apparently not as hidden as I thought, considering a police officer saw it as he was going around checking cars. I was pulled out of the dance by my principal and the officer, and asked to take out the bottle and explain myself. In this instant, I chose to play innocent, and bank on my good reputation to convince them that it wasn't mine and somebody must have put it in my car to take out later at an after party they knew I was going to. However, I was also unable to give a name (which I don't think I will bc I don't want to blame anybody else) and agreed to take responsibility for the bottle and the PMB, saying it was my fault for not knowing and my responsibility for it being in my car. They officer and my principal actually buy it fully, and start inquiring about who it could have been, and wanting me to pass off blame. This continues when my parents arrive, and everybody seems to think that I know who it was but I'm just not saying. Now I'm in a bad situation because my parents are angry and want to figure out who did this, whereas I just want to take the blame, but if I tell them the whole truth they're going to flip and I may lose my car (which I need for my job) and will definitely lose my parents' trust. Furthermore, my parents have been going on a rampage calling other parents trying to figure out who could have done this and my friends are (understandably) getting mad at me for trying to pass off the blame. Should I just convince my parents that it was none of the kids they think it is  (they think it was done at the dinner party I went to beforehand) and try and keep them from continuing their rampage or should I let them come to that conclusion themselves and risk one my friends collectively just saying it was me. I want to just go through diversion and keep anybody else from being involved, but my parents are very concerned with my reputation and don't understand why I'm not willing to fight and find the person ""that did this to you."" I really need help, I can't come clean to everybody at this point but the lie is fucking things up.",07May2017,2
128,"Hi. Recently (last couple of weeks) I have started feeling more and more disconnected from reality. This has accompanied me with anxiety attacks about death and the bigger picture of what life truly is, as well as the terrifying thought that time is slipping away extremely quickly and my brain has been hurting with all the thinking I've done regarding what to do about it.

Even thought it was a couple of weeks ago, it started on Christmas day in 2013. I was 10 years old at the time and was having a normal Christmas day when suddenly I thought about what would await me after death (I didn't/don't believe in a God). And concluded that the most logical answer to that was that there is nothing after death, and since I can't really comprehend not being conscious, it gave me a massive panic attack. My mom wasn't really supportive of it, not because she's not a good mom but because she states that it is normal for a child to have these thoughts and I shouldn't be worried by it, which, while reassuring it didn't solve my situations.

Numerous months and a couple of visits to the psychologist later and I found myself to be completely fine and could live life even with the knowledge that that's what awaited after death.

About a month ago however (I can't recall what I was doing) it just returned to me, with no clear reason as to why. I reminded myself that I've been through this before three years prior and that I shouldn't be worried about anything, but it didn't work.

Ever since that day, some days better some worst, I feel like I'm looking at the world through very foggy glasses. Everywhere I look, things just don't seem to be the same, and It doesn't necessarily upset me, but it does make me feel very unnerved. 

Other things that accompanied me are the feelings that time is slipping away too quickly, as it seemed just yesterday that I was doing things that were a couple of weeks, months or even years ago. This made me feel like at this rate, in a couple of seconds I will be old and dying, and that is what upsets me the most. (I don't know if I explained myself well)

Another thing that has came up with this whole situation is the whole death thing. As I've stated before, to me the most logical answer to the question 

""What happens when you die?"" is just 

""Nothing, you aren't conscious, you won't remember being alive, you won't feel, smell, hear or do anything because you are simply incapable to, your body will turn into mush and the vitamins and minerals inside of your body will be sucked into the ground where it will be used to aid the growth of other forms of life.""

This is a constant negative automatic thought that has been going on through my head. I remember on my visits to the psychologist I was told that negative automatic thoughts should be countered with positive automatic thoughts, so I tried to come up with a few to counter this negative automatic thought. The ones I came up with are:

-We don't know exactly what happens after death, and even the things we thought we DID know (earth is flat etc.) were proved wrong at some point in history. Perhaps the brain is much more complicated than it already is, and consciousness, while being tied to a specific section, may be abstract and not of this dimension. Or not.

-If I grow up and do well in school and possibly do something in my life that I can be proud of, then I won't feel so bad about dying.

-If the things that were in my body return to the earth to aid the growth of other things, then that means that my death wouldn't be so bad, and that those vitamins and minerals will help the earth thrive.

However, a constant Negative Thought that counters all my positive ones is the notion that my parents and relatives will die one day too, and what if they die before we can upload our consciousness or something? Would it mean they were just unfortunate? Or is consciousness after death actually a thing, but since it's not of this dimension I'll never see them again?

I've googled my predicament earlier this morning and found [this blog](http://blog.tranquilene.com/disconnection-from-reality-is-common-in-anxiety-sufferers/) on a thing called derealization/depersonilization and as it states on the blog, it usually comes during or after anxiety. I'm not sure how accurate this is, because it also advertises their product, but I do know that every symptom on there I can relate to right now, even as I am typing this.

This recent predicament has not only affected my home life, but my school life too. I have Asperger's and already find it difficult to talk to people, but now I find it even more difficult because I cannot think straight. What helps me a bit is a distraction such as playing a strategy game or reading a book, but school has no distractions apart from a couple of classes. I don't have many friends to talk to (one, while fun to be around, isn't exactly someone I'd talk to about these things, and the other is a different story. She does call me her friend, but we seem to talk more like acquaintances  rather than friends. The type of people she talks to are people that while I don't mind being around, I wouldn't want to be them, and even if I did want to be like them I couldn't.) so I rely on teachers I trust (My maths and business teachers specifically) to talk me through things, but they've both been absent since last week, and I've had mid-term break before that.

Within the last 48 hours I've had occasional moments where I felt to be halfway within reality, and I felt fully conscious that I know what's happening to me, and that I can get out if I do the right thing. But other than that I still feel the same.

I know this is a long post, but I sometimes don't explain things correctly so I hope it made sense. If not, don't hesitate to ask. I don't know how to get out. If anyone does, please do say as I know myself that it's not healthy to live like this. Thanks in advance.",07May2017,9
129,"I have a ""best"" friend for almost 8 years but every day i feel more like a chore...

I think he uses me up. To trash his emotion or because he bored. He almost every day whining about something and only his things matters. I have to listen to his whining but when i have something, nothing happens. For 5 years i listen to his whining about past ex girlfriends, life and depressive stuffs. He talks about his hobby and i asking around even if i dont care. But when i show a music or talk about my hobby...nothing happens and sometimes criticize it. for his whining i try my best to give advice but he just undertsands the problem. 

When we meeting somewhere we have to do what he wants, listen to music what he likes. If i put a music in, he gots bored. Listen to his usual whining and every time the SAME stuff. Sometimes i have enough from life and i dont know few times a year i whine. And you know...he mentiones my whining and says he dont like it...lol

He have a social circle and with the he have a big compliance complex. If i say something or do something he fighting with me. Once i had a bad mood and i was silent. Didnt harmed anybody just wanted to cheer up. He punished and said if i have a bad mood again in front of his friends he never talk to me again. I had to appologize.

He never supported me even with words. Everything i like i do he dont like it sometimes criticize but he whining to me every day.

Long story short. I dont feel this is a friendship anymore and im only with him because im desperate and he is my only connection to people. Can i turn on this?",07May2017,4
132,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently a university student at a nearby campus to home. In my hometown, there's also an amazing, huge sports complex with a state of the art gym (it's not super fancy, but more like a family complex), the gym has everything you could possibly need ($140/month membership)...

I found out they are doing a college membership deal for students who are away for college and come home for breaks (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Spring Break, Summer) and the occasional weekend. The deal is $550 per calendar year. I think this is a great deal considering I am 5 minutes away from this gym. I could go there a few times a week to work out. Technically, I'd be lying and say I go to a different school upstate (Which is just a main campus of my of my school, same school though).

My question is: **Would the membership department ever find out that I am visiting the gym way too often? How often do places like this check their computer systems to see guest activity? If I ever get questioned, what do I say?** 

For now, I can easily get the membership, it's a question of how long I'll be able to go and the consequences.

**It's just that I really, really love this gym, it's so close, and technically not lying to the membership people, I'm just seeing a loophole**

Thank you",07May2017,1
134,"So my boyfriend told me that every year for his birthday all his guy friends spend the night in a tent in the backyard. I asked him who all was going probably six times and he told me what I thought would be everyone. However, I saw a snapchat story and his lesbian friend had come. She had never been brought up when I asked even though he told me all the GUYS who might POSSIBLY come or not come and for what reasons. SHE WAS NEVER EVEN A MAYBE ON THE LIST. My problem is, they have grown up together and he had a solid crush on her up until he met me. I've talked to him about this several times because it makes me uncomfortable seeing snapchat stories of them sitting on a bed together with her laughing at everything he says. So, drawing my own conclusions I would say he purposely did not mention her joining them because he knew I would be uncomfortable with it. Especially when the reason I wasn't going was because it was a supposed ""guy night"" I texted him and asked who came and he did say she was there but he could have known I saw the snapchat story and not wanted to be caught in a lie. I feel disrespected. He told me she was a guy to him and that I didn't want to hang out with his friends anyways.

136,"Hey guys, I'm just here because I need some advice.  So there was this girl I knew from school who I was very good friends with.  I've known her about a year and we tried dating, but she wasn't totally feeling it.  Anyway, we both work at my school paper together and things have been a little bit awkward since I told her I liked her.  I'm a senior and I'm graduating so I thought it would be nice to do something for her as an end of the semester gift and so we could both sort of move on.  On our last day of class she made a board for me with my name on it and newspaper clippings of all my work which I really loved and I gave her a matted photo print that I took of her a year ago.  The photo was of her smiling while sitting across from me when we had coffee this one time and I thought it brought some good memories so I wanted to gift it to her as a nice gesture after the issues we've had.  When I gave it to her, she said she really liked it.  We talked about life for about five minutes, then we wished each other luck on our finals and parted ways.  I felt very happy after this because I feel like I was finally able to move on.

My happiness wasn't long lived though.  Later that night I got a phone call.  It was campus security.  They called me down for questioning for an investigation.  Upon arrival, they informed me that as soon as I gave the girl that photo and we parted ways, she immediately went down to them telling them that she felt uncomfortable because I was often trying to get her attention.  She gave them the matted print I made as evidence.  They said she was looking for advice and didn't know they would call me down, but they had to because of protocol.  I was broken by hearing this.  She even removed me from FB that night.

A few days later I wanted to speak to her and I was walking around campus.  Everytime I saw her from a distance, she would turn around and walk the opposite way.  I eventually ran into her in the hall and we had a big fight.  I told her that what she did was inappropriate and that it really hurt me and what really got me was how she would consistently try to justify her actions.  She said I gave her anxiety.  I told her that she lied to me by saying she liked it and she asked sarcastically if I would have preferred she tell me it was weird and I said yes, I would have much preferred the truth to getting reported to campus security behind my back.

Anyway, I'm about over this, but her justifying her actions are making me feel like I might be in the wrong.  My group therapy session members all sided with me and said she was acting inappropriate, my friends I discussed this with and my parents said it was an insane thing to do, but I still don't know.

Long time lurker, but I really screwed up and I need some advice. heres the story.

In 2016, my uncle, who I was very close to, passed away. I'm not a person who shows my emotions but it did really affect me. But at the same time, I was in school and that semester I did terribly. 2 Ds, 1 F, and a B. It brought my GPA way down, down to a level where they put me on academic warning. Long story short, the following 2 semesters I did a lot better, but my GPA was so low that I wasn't able to bring it up to the level I needed to be and now I fear that they're going to suspend me for a year from school. I don't blame anyone except myself, and I should have taken the warning very seriously, but I didn't. 
If I do get kicked out, I have 2 choices. I can appeal it and hope they let me back in or I can go to a community college and catch up on my general education classes. 

What would anyone do in this situation? I'm just lost and I don't have anyone I can speak to about this.

As always, thank you in advance.

I love the film and television industry and would like to work there one day but having the same job or career for my entire working life would drive me fucking nuts. 

The only thing I'm certain about at this moment is that I know I want to travel around the world.

A little backstory - we're both from different nationalities - I'm [F34] from Europe and he's[M37]  from USA. 8 years ago when we got married we moved to Canada and I continued my studies and he worked there. But soon we realized that we weren't making progress in the most expensive city I've ever been in, so we wanted to move to another Canadian city - but we always agreed on staying in Canada except for times when I would get really homesick and just causally mention wanting to move back to Europe and starting anew. This would only happen when I would get upset or depressed. 
Our plan however was always to stay in Canada and I was working a skilled job to get the opportunity to apply for our permanent residency with, the deal was that i would work the terrible job and fill the hours needed and he was supposed to do the paperwork for residency because he was good at it.  Then the time comes to send in the paperwork and he postpones it to the point that we had to leave the country and apply from outside the country due to our work permit expiring. I had to come back to Europe and he had to go to the states. We left abruptly and left our jobs and everything. Didn't even have time to close my bank account.
We shipped all our belongings to the states and the plan was for him to send the paperwork as soon as he gets there. He had all of them. 
Once he got there his autoimmune disease got worse and he fell into deep depression to the point that I decided to not nag about the paperwork. He lost the paperwork in the move then after a few months he found them. 
He has a part-timer freelance job and All the time in the world. 

Now it's been 8 months and he has not mentioned the PR once. A few times that I mentioned it he got upset and started yelling at me about my past mistakes and seemed like he was avoiding the whole thing. He told me that I always wanted to go back to Europe and I got what I wished for. 

I recently got a well paying job here now and live with family. But all my belonging is with him and I don't know when I will be able to see him again. Eachtime I try to talk about it he either avoids the conversation or tells me to back off or tells me he's a piece of shit and wants to commit suicide. 
I can't do the paperwork myself as they are all with him currently and I'm afraid of asking him to send them to me. 
I've thought about going there myself but before getting a job I had no money to travel and now I can't because I have a job. 

I'm at a loss... I just want to die at this point. Because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I don't see an end to this.

169,"Background:

Im UK based, 18 yrs old. In NYE, I had an extremely messy night (lots of MDMA, drink, weed) ending up outside Mcdonalds at about 1 AM. I start talking to two of these guys who are mutual friends over a spliff and it turns out they knew my best mate. They end up feeding me some MDMA and soon enough we're in someone's parents house smoking weed and doing some more, soon enough we're all asleep and everything's chill. At some point in conversation, one of them was bragging about how they had robbed my best friend. Waking up still extremely intoxicated I pondered whether I could maybe take an unnoticeable amount (0.1 or under) of weed in order to get a small feeling of revenge and something to finish off the night with. So I'm standing up while the other four or so people are asleep, considering whether I should. I decide that I shouldn't, and as I'm about to sit down again one of the guys (one of the guys I'd met at the house, not outside McDonalds) starts asking me what I'm doing. I panick and say I was wondering if I could have something to drink. I change my mind and tell him I'm probably going to head off (I'd felt I'd overstayed my welcome as it was). Thinking that the guy I'd originally met had told me to leave through the kitchen door (he hadn't, I'd basically imagined that) I decided to leave through that way.

So I'm in the kitchen trying to get out, struggling to figure out (given how intoxicated I was) that I'd needed to leave through the other door. The same guy who ""caught"" me comes down, walks through the kitchen and into the toilet. I try saying hello a few times but he ignores me. He then leaves the toilet and sees me being befuddled. He explains how I need to go through the front door, I basically respond speaking gibberish as I'm so lost as to what's going on. I leave, stoned I go and buy some haribo from a corner shop and then go home. 

LATER my best friend tells me how they approached him and basically said they caught me trying to steal from them, but he (my best friend) was told to ""sort it out"" and that it's now fine. 

A FEW WEEKS LATER I see the first guy I met in the street. He has this broken look on his face and starts striding up to me with a key sticking inbetween his fingers and starts shouting WHERE'S MY MONEY (at about 4pm in daytime in the middle of town). Not wanting to cause any further anger and make my intentions clear to be amicable mixed with the fact I'm shocked and panicked, I start apologising profusely. He goes to punch me and I duck and he gets my ear. I then run off, thankfully the barrier of moving cars (as it was right by a road) gave me enough time to get away.

A FEW MONTHS LATER (4/20) I see him again, he is on a public bus going down the hill. I panick and think what I could do, I couldn't run up the hill in time, I couldn't take the bus as he'd follow me down to the bus station, I couldn't run down the hill as he'd catch me. So I run accross the street and he starts going on about his money again. I question him about what money and he explains what he thought happened (I tried to steal his weed, then hid in the kitchen (which makes absolutely no place to hide, and wouldn't have been a very good hiding spot given I thought that's where he told me to go)), I explained that it was a misunderstanding and a result of me not understanding how to leave (I wasn't going to explain the pontification about whether I should have, it'd've just made it worse). He told me I chat shit and I could have just used the front door. I told him that it was because I was fucked on mandy. He said I chat shit again, and started telling me to give him my money or I'd stab him. He said this over and over insisting he had a knife in his pocket. Honestly, he's the sort of person to carry one wherever he goes and my split second thinking made me think it'd probably be best not to try and find out if he had one or not. So I give him the ten quid I have in change, he seems dissapointed that's all I have, and walks down the hill insisting that I ""chat shit"".


A FEW WEEKS LATER I see him again, in a tiny town NOONE goes to (what's the chances of that?) where my best mate lives. We lock eye contact and I carry on walking, I'm stoned and midway through contact I realise who I'm looking at. He's in an alleyway with a bunch of mates. I carry on walking and briefly looking behind me, nobody is behind me. I turn up to Sainsbury's, and I see him and his gang at the entrance, with his hood pulled up over his face. I obviously walk the other way. 

SOLUTIONS:

Now thankfully he doesn't know my name or address, but he knows my face very well. I mock called the police about the mugging situation (mock called- calling the police pretending to be an innocent bystander who saw it) and a cop went and spoke to me about it. He explained that I could either 1) get them to send a warning to him (total crap, that'd just aggrevate him) 2) Take him to court (that way he'd know my name, and all his mates would know I'm a ""snitch"", furthermore I'd have to admit on trial the drug use, and I don't know how that'd fare for me) 3) Do Nothing but have him on record (this is what I did).

The problem isn't necessarily that he's a big tough guy, he's just a guy who has nothing to lose (he found his mum's dead body after suicide when he was 15) who literally will want to destroy me in public at any time. Furthermore, he has mates who actually are tough and if I somehow managed to beat him up or stun him (possibility) he'd come back for more, maybe even with his friends which would be a lot worse. And that time he'd definitely have a knife on him.

So what do I do? I want to be civil, I don't necessarily want my money back or want a  big hug, I just don't like having to constantly hide when I'm in the street, constantly be vigilant and prepare for the worst.

As a footnote, I haven't told any of my family. Which I think is best, as it'd only worry them. ",07May2017,2

177,"Before I say anything, I would like to explain that me and my girlfriend and are 17 and we have been together for two years. Based on the end of her past ""relationship"" (which I will explain in a bit), I have known that she has an overprotective mother who likely suffers from anxiety. Also, this is an old account because I don't want her to see this since she knows my current Reddit account. There will be a TL;DR at the bottom because this will be a long post. First, I will basically just explain some of the issues that have come up that I feel like I need to address.

So let's start with her previous ""relationship"". Basically, they had been together for nine months but kissed for the first time at month six. After that, they eventually got to the point that he touched her butt and breasts, not under clothes or anything, and texted about it. Sure enough, her mom had been using an online software to monitor her every message and found out. Consequently, she drove to his house, yelled at him and told him to stay the hell away from her, and psychologically screwed with her to the point that she felt obligated to end the relationship with him. While I think that at 15, that kind of stuff is weird but the ""punishment"" was way out of line.

That was a couple of years ago. There was more stuff between then and now which capture the idea but I just wanted to use that to explain what was going on. So on to what's going on now.

So a couple of months ago, i had been suffering from mild depression, likely from stress over cumulative tests and pressure from my classes, and my girlfriend asked for help from her mom on how to help me which made her aware of the issue. So one day, something very exciting happened to me and when I explained it to her, I just got ""ok""s and ""that's cool""s over the phone. Eventually, I got upset and asked her what was wrong and she told me it was something but refused to tell me what. This annoyed me a bit and when I was having this argument with her, I hear some motion through the phone and then her mom's voice saying ""Hi!"". She then basically ignores my concerns stating that my depression was making me mean and irrational and then proceeds to lecture me about how she was protecting her daughter and that my depression (which was improving and really didn't define every decision I made) had motivated me to hurt her daughter. This really pissed me off for obvious reasons and this is when a lot of tension between her mom and I escalated.

Next, a few days ago, I was at Starbucks studying for a test with my girlfriend and a couple of her friends. Eventually, we finished and while we waited for the other girls' rides(I could drive), and just kind of hung out during that time. Afterwards, everyone was picked up and I just drove home. The next day, my girlfriend was upset because apparently, her mom had been there, watching us for like 20 minutes while we waited and said that there wasn't much studying going on.  


So the next big one was last night/this morning. It was prom night. Basically, I went with my girlfriend and a group of our friends. We rented a limo, went out to eat, went to the dance, we hung out at my house, went to breakfast in the morning, and some of us stayed until the morning and left. The plan was to go swimming and just hang out and play CAH or something. So when we got to my house, apparently, she had been waiting at the dance, followed us back, and stayed all night at my house, regularly checking up on us to make sure we weren't doing anything ""non-PG"". My parents had made it very clear to her that she didn't have to be there and that they would make sure nothing catastrophic happened with her. This was annoying because we had to basically avoid the main room in my house the entire after-party because she was listening really closely to anything. Around *3:00 am*, she came to us and told us that she was tired and wanted to go home so she would let us drive to IHOP, eat, and go home. She basically guilt tripped us into doing what she wanted even though she wasn't fucking obligated to stay and watch us. All of us could drive, all of us are AP students who obviously don't do a lot of drugs, and my parents were happy to stay up, with their door closed to not listen in on us, and to help us if we needed it. It was all planned and her presence was rude, unwanted, and unnecessary. She basically ruined the party because of her stupid enforcement no ""non-pg"" rule. 

There is much more but I don't want to make this post too long because I'd really like advice. She regularly spies on us, looks at our texts, at her internet activity, and does not allow us any privacy ever. Every time I have tried to bring up concerns, my girlfriend will always get offended and defend her based on the reasons based on intentions her mom gives her. This girl is really amazing and she's the nicest person I've ever met but my concerns about her mom have been rising a lot and I don't know what to do because the happiness she brings to my life outnumbers the stress her mom causes. However, this is beginning to become a bigger concern of mine and I don't know how to deal with it. I really want to make it work with this girl but I don't think her mom will ever change. Thank you everyone who responds. I really really appreciate it.

TL;DR: I'm dating an awesome girl with a paranoid mom who regularly checks her texts, internet history, and spies on us constantly. She crashed a prom after-party because she felt that cards against humanity was too inappropriate for her 17 year old daughter. I have no idea how to address the issue without risking the end of the relationship.

I have been in some form of therapy since I was about 10.

My problems only seem to have multiplied as I've gotten older and the only real thing that I've been able to accomplish by all these hours of therapy is being very good at analyzing myself and rationalizing it but not actually solving anything.

I want to get better but I am starting to feel that going about it at more or less the same way that I have been for 20 years is not going to help. What alternatives to therapy (and I supposed medication as well) could I possibly try to fix myself?",07May2017,2

207,"My brother's a very shy person he's not very confident and only really talks to people he's used too. Now that doesn't mean he doesn't talk to people he just doesn't open up to them. 

Well he only really was very comfortable around his best friend, he'd always be over and they would always hang out. Me, I usually just stayed in my room because my brother is the type to sort of dail down when I walk around. 

His best friend always had comments or weird words to me but I'm like 15 and he's 22 so I assumed it was just him talking or joking. But there was always touching where he'd try to act ""friendly"" with me or just pretty perverted if I really thought about it.

But skipping to what happened, my brother's room is across the house, so really no one had any business being by my room. But I know his friend tried to open the door when I was in the shower but it was locked. So he knocked asking was anyone in there. I stupidly responded yes, I'm taking a shower. And when I got out I just went to my room to put on clothes. For no reason at all he barged in as I was digging through my drawers for what to wear and I looked back and he's just at the door staring. I crouch down covering myself behind a pulled out drawer shelf and scream for him to get out. So he did. 

That was creepy as hell... I didn't know why or what he was doing but... he definitely saw me naked... I didn't leave after that, my door has no lock so I just closed it and stayed there. Something woke me up that night though and I noticed my door was wide open... I remembered closing it... so I was kind of scared... but I got up and closed it. I couldn't sleep for about 20 minutes and it opened again, I just hid under my covers scared for a minute before I ran back to close it. I just sat on the door this time with my back too it. Thinking what the hell is going on. And all of a sudden something touches my stomach and I jumped in fear hitting my head extremely hard on something... Which was aching and I squated on the ground with tears in my eyes. Afterwards a hand grabs my wrists and pulls me over to my bed dropping me on it. And tucking me in, then they run out the door. 

Me being scared to deaf and my head literally hurting I walk over to get my dagger, basically a knife my brother bought for me from a video game, and hid it under my pillow, I turned my light on and closed my door but eventually fell asleep. Around like 3AM. I woke up one last time with the lights out and door open... I didn't want to move. I just stayed in bed. I couldn't sleep and I just stayed in one spot holding the knife tightly under thr pillow.

I don't know what it was but I turned around and looks across my room on the floor, my brother's best friend was literally sitting there. I literally jumped back trying to scream but he ran over and pressed his hand over my mouth saying shhhh... shhh... calm down.. calm down... I was trying to get his hand off but I just threw back the pillow and stabbed him through the hand. 

I guess that pissed him off because he yelled in pain then grabbed me by the neck choking me to the bed. I couldn't speak, talk, or stab him because I was literally trying to pry his hands off my neck... My hearing started to fade, my arms started falling, everything was getting dark and finally my brother ran in and knocked him off. I gasped for air a fews times but it feels like he crushed my throat. All I could do is watch as my brother tried to defend me but eventually he was on the ground getting punched to death, so I grabbed the knife and stabbed the guy a few times in the back and he basically grabbed me by my hair and jerked me over his head. I thought my neck stapped the way I twisted and basically I passed out.

I was woken up by my parents and the ambulance, my brother was bleeding and hand my knife stabbed into him a few times. They even looked at the knife but it only had my finger prints. And my brither was hospitalized... For some reason they won't believe me when I say his best friend did it because he denies this and won't tell them what happened.

No one seems to listen to me because they have only evidence that it was me but it doesn't make any sense. It's like because I'm 15 they won't listen to me. They put me on medication and suggests therapy as if I'm crazy but I know for a fact his best friend did this... I know his hands and I had a great view even if it was dark. 

Please help, his friend is no where to be found but there has to be a way that he gets caught... What should I say, what do I do? No one believes me... please anyone, give me advice... I know who did this.",07May2017,1
209,"I am moving from the greater Cleveland area to Monterey, California (for grad school, every dollar counts). 

My new place is a 1 Bedroom, floor-level apartment. I don't have a ton of stuff: Boxes of clothes, gaming PC, desk-chair, kitchen appliances and utensils, and then my Queen-sized mattress and boxspring.


I really, really don't want to make the 40 hour drive from Ohio to Monterey, for a lot of reasons. One of which is my desire to sell my car in Ohio before I leave (harder to transfer titles if I move plus I have an SUV that is in higher demand here).
The lowest quote I have found for cross-country moving is $1,750, and I believe my bed alone is close to that. Plus, It would be expensive to ship my PC and other items that I couldn't check on a plane. I already plan on buying a used couch and desk when I get there.

210,"So I could use a new car, but it feels like I live on the wrong continent. All I want is a cheap utilitarian vehicle but in the US that seems too hard an ask. Were I in Europe I would be spoiled for choice, estates for days (station wagons for us Americans) and boy do I love a station wagon. Were I in Australia a Ute would be amazing, but alas I am not in Australia. 

So here is the situation. I currently drive a 2000 Honda Insight, cute car but good god the maintenance. Dont get me wrong, im more than willing to do maintenance on my car, adjust the valves, change the oil, transmission fluid, clutch, pumps, lights, suspension components, engine mounts, whatever. But I dont like having to jump through 5 hoops to do so. Nothing on the Insight is straightforward and this bothers me. It fits many things, but not easily, which also bothers me. It gets very good mileage, which is nice, but is certainly not paying off due too all the cash I have to spend to fix all the broken stuff. Im willing to do the maintenance and put in the work, but it is annoying that I have to talk to a guy who knows a guy to get anything done on the car. 

So, you know my gripes with my current car, not big enough, maintenance is fine but annoying, and it is expensive to keep going. What am I looking for? A ute really, just a  sedan with a long (over 8') bed so I can throw lumber, bicycles, furniture (I move often), gun cases, extra people, bodies (haha), and power tools in the back without worry. 

I have found a few cars that could do this, a Volvo v70 is the obvious choice except from what I know volvo maintenance is not the easiest thing. 

The Honda Accord Wagon, maybe, but they are all as old as my Insight now and I'd like to avoid that.

Subaru Outback, safe cars, I appreciate the looks, I appreciate the car. But that fuel economy from the 4-wheel drive is not great. 

The 2003 Ford F-150 with a standard cab. This is a strong contender, it is simple and fits the bill except for being a truck. I can take 3 people places, throw all kinds of stuff in the bed, and the f-150 is more common than dirt here so maintenance shouldn't be an issue. It also possibly would allow me to do something I have always wanted to do, modify suspension components. Dont get me wrong, I dont want to slam the truck, but lowered a few inches would be cool. This is a strong contender. The fuel economy for the truck does not bother me because it fits the bill so nicely. 

Honda CR-v, 2001, nice looking when lowered. Seems to have a strong following and the biggest issue seems to be head gasket repair and regular valve adjustment. Maybe, but Im not sure. I dont know how easily I could fit my stuff in there because it is a bit short. 

I shudder to think about a full size SUV or crossover, but I am open to them as well. 

Oh yeah, the price range is about $7,000.

I got accepted into the honors college at UCF and not at UF and from UCF I am receiving a 32 thousand dollar scholarship which covers basically my entire undergrad because of my Florida residency and I don't get any money from UF.
I guess my question really comes down to how much will it matter in the work force after college or in graduate school depending on what I do and will it be any easier getting a job or getting into a graduate school and being successful because I went to what is thought of as a school that is a little more prestigious like UF instead of UCF honors college.

I stress out about things I shouldn't.  Things I can't control.  I let that affect my mood and take it out on the people I see as being responsible, or if not them, my poor partner has to deal with me crying / ranting / complaining.

I push my partner too far.  He is a very patient man but I will freak out over tiny things he has done.  Things that don't require freak outs.  Things that could go unmentioned or just be discussed in a calm civil way.  I don't want to lose him but even a patient man must have his limits.

I'm finding it hard to give examples because I find it hard to admit my mistakes and be honest about my attitude or behaviour.  Actually writing this post was hard.

Can I fix at least one of these? Or improve all of them? Does anyone have any advice on how?  I just hate myself so much but in the heat of the moment I repeat the same behaviour.

226," After several failed relationship attempts I've decided I'm going to stop searching and start trying to love myself as much as I love others. I always fall at least 90% for whoever I'm infatuated with and I want to learn to love myself as much as I love other people. It's not a confidence thing. I am fairly confident, in decent shape, and I know my talents and play to them, but part of me still doesn't love myself and I don't know why. I always become the ""best friend"" and I feel like that's what I'm really good at, but I'm not relationship material. Advice? Also I'm willing to answer any questions you guys ask.

229,"To sum things up, I met this girl 3 years ago, we started out as friends but eventually I fell in love with year. 1 year ago she found out that I had feelings for her but she didn't feel the same. We kept trying to be friends, but I couldn't forget about her in that way, and she couldn't forget that moment aswell, so, 3 months ago, she did what I never had the balls to do, and said we should stop talking until we overcame the situation. I was crushed, because I was scared of missing her friendship, I was scared that I wouldn't be able to find someone like her. Truth is, as time went by, I started noticing the girls around me and realized that she is not a special kind. 

Nevertheless, I miss talking to her and going out with her, but I still have some residual feelings for her. I'm not trying to make her change her mind anymore, I gaveup on that idea a while ago, but I've loved her for very long time, there is always some small attraction. 

So, I want to reconcile with her, be friends again, but I'm afraid of not being able to get a hold of my own feelings. This is just an hypothetical situation though, she told me she would speak to me if she ever felt comfortable about it again, so it's not even granted she will ever speak to me again, but I want to believe that the moments we shared meant something to her and we can be friends again. My mindset right now is to meet new girls, and possibly find one special girl, but I have to say, she is the best girl I've met in my life and she was also my best friend. Believe me or not, I'm not saying this because I have loved her in the past, she truly treated me like no other girl did (and I have loved other girls in the past and even had one sort of ""girlfriend""). 

It's a truly messed up situation, and an hypothetical one, but I don't know how to react if she tries to reconcile with me. I definitely want to be friends with her again, but I don't want to be selfish anymore and keep hurting her and myself, on the other hand, I know that these residual feelings will not vanish until I meet new girls.",07May2017,3

231,"So i'm at a bit of a crossroads. I thought I liked Engineering, but lately unless its a hobby project I'm barely interested. I was thinking of doing an apprenticeship after Sixth Form, or taking an access course for a university I like so that I can decide what kind of engineering would best fit me, even if its not a perfect fit.  but I don't know if that makes sense. I'm not an incredibly academic person, by any means, and I find it extremely hard to focus on stuff I'm not interested in, most of the time, which has made my grades out of SF less than ideal - although there it time to recover, and I'm honestly trying.

But I'm stuck for motivation. I'm finding it hard to work when I don't know what I'm even working towards. I want some life experience, somehow, but I don't know where to start, and my family seem against it.

(It's worth nothing that Uni in the UK is different from college in the US, for any americans reading. It's not free, it's a loan, but not one you need to repay in a sense. It's a small percentage of your income over 23k a year until you're 40 I think (when its written off), so most people don't feel it too much. But even so, it's hard to get this loan again to reapply for uni after you leave Uni once, so it's a toughie)

232,"My father, who is in his late 50s and has been divorced for the past 10 years, has been trying to slowly get back into the dating game. He went a painful amount of time without finding anyone, until he got into a relationship with a female coworker. He works as a respiratory therapist, so there is nothing crude about this relationship, at first anway. It became very apparent she was using him to bail her out of numerous situations involving both drugs and alcohol, it turns out she had accumulated numberous DUIs on her driving record. She started to distance from him after he decided he didn't want to help her, but that did not provoke the reaction she intended. My father began to post pictures of her on facebook and text friends about her offenses to try and belittle her. It got to a point where it was just straight up stalking. After a while he gave up after she threatened with the police, and since then he's been trying to find love online. This online dating has escalated to a website called Anastasiadate. To my understanding, he pays by the hour to talk to Ukrainian women looking for a husband. This is not only disturbing because he's willing to pay for love, but the website blocks any numerical characters (1,2,3,4,5,etc.) that are sent. This means he cannot even truly contact these women. It's incredibly painful to have to watch him devolve as he misses work continuously because of how late he stays up. Often he'll call me down to the computer, requesting I do reverse image searches to validate the women are real. The reason why he has me do this is I proved to him once he was getting catfished through reverse image search. This is an incredibly delicate situation because he is the most hard-headed man I've ever met, and he will never listen to me for advice. If I anger him enough with questions that make him uncomfortable, he threatens to kick me out of the house (I am a college student, so this gravity of that threat becoming reality would end my college career, as I could not afford alternative housing.) If there's any other way I can get through to him or any general advice for dealing with the situation, I'd very much appreciate it.",07May2017,1
233,"I'm going mad here. A few weeks ago, I started to notice a funky cat pee smell in my kitchen. I figured it was some spice or something that was being cooked and it dissipated quickly. Over the next few days, it gradually came back and eventually began to overpower the entire house. Ugh! The search began to find the source of the stink. 

SO and I pinpointed it quickly to the basement. We've got three rooms down there. Only one smelled so strongly of cat urine that our eyes watered. Of course we instantly pointed fingers at our neutered male cat and began the cleanup. We got a UV light and found several spots of pee on boxes, concrete flooring (our basement isn't totally finished) and other things that needed to be thrown out. We cleaned it up and firmly shut both the door to the room and the door to the basement. The smell went away. 

Now I haven't been down there in a while, but I needed to get something out of that room today and when I opened the door to that cat pee room the smell hit me like a ton of bricks. It smells like a whole slew of cats have been locked in there. It's disgusting. But...when you shut the door again, the smell is gone. It's ONLY in that room and it isn't traveling if the door stays shut. WTF. It can't be my cat, because he can't get down there through not one but _two_ closed doors. 

Is there some animal living in my walls? I only find urine. No poop. No hair. Nothing. It's crazy. And it's driving me insane. The room has since been dubbed 'the smelly room' and no one wants to go into it. I need advice! ",07May2017,2

236,"This is a throwaway account and this incident happened rather recently. I'm eating dinner with my mum and dad, when my mom starts to make fun of fat people. She tends to do this alot where she sees someone who is fat and starts laughing and mocking that person (discretely) with my Dad. So anyways we are eating dinner and she makes a derogatory comment about fat people. I say that it is not OK to make fun of fat people. Mom immediately denies she was making fun of fat people while my Dad says that since only we are here in our house it is alright.(completely going against my mom's denial) I disagree with his opinion. Then my Dad comments something about me being a liberal (which I do not identify as) and my Mom says something about me being privelaged. 
The major fuckup is when I mention about the divorce they are planning and then my Dad talks about he was this close to kicking my ass (has happened in the past) and my mom gets even more mad about my ""privelaged"" behavior. My dad leaves commenting that its terrible I treat family worse than strangers, and I say that it's just not Ok to do what they did, I'm not even asking them to change, just that I feel uncomfortable when they do make fun of fat people.

239,"Okay this is a bit of a serious question sorry, I have a friend who has both depression and anxiety, and occasionally becomes suicidal, usually rather openly so, and I'm not sure how seriously to take her. I honestly can't tell if it is more of a cry for help or a cry for attention. I do have a bit of a reason to think it might be just to get attention, she tends to say random things a lot in order to be paid attention to, for instance, one day in my history class we were just doing a bit of individual work in silence, when she taps me on the shoulder (She sits directly behind me) and confirms with me that I like both dogs and cats, then proceeds to inform me that I should look into getting a savannah cat when I'm older because they're a good mix between dogs and cats. This really didn't have any connection to what we were doing, and she had said this same thing before when we were discussing pets the day before (something else she does a lot, repeat herself, I think just to have something to say). Being the attention-likeing and story-exaggerating  person she is , I just don't know how seriously to take her when she says something along the lines of, ""You should never try to kill yourself(or something), something that I've tried before."" Or says in a openly in a group of not so close friends that she's been feeling suicidal lately.

240,"   I'm going into my 4th year and my high school friend and I go to the same college but for different majors. He in a tech major, I'm in a design major. We've lived together in an apartment with two other people all separate rooms except him and my other friend. My other suit mates and I have talked about how he always is in his room. He like never wants to come out even when I'm really trying to connect with him. Apparently he sleeps in till 4pm and plays a lot of video games (grade A introvert). I want to say like dude ""friendships are a two way street"" but he'd get all uptight about it. Honestly besides me and the people we live with he doesn't have any real friends and im concerned. 

   This is what set me off. So I had a NYC walking assignment to take pictures of the buildings that would take an afternoon. He would hangout with us before when we were all starting college but it just got worse. He said sure he'd love to come with and hang out, but then the night before he said he doesn't think that he could make it. His cop out is always ""studying"". Ill give him that, yes studying is important especially at the end of the semester. 

  Okay, I go on the trip and make it back around 5pm from leaving at 1 in the afternoon. I walk in the apartment and hes making a sandwich and I was like ""Whats up!? hows the studying going man?"" In a shrug voice he said ""oh yea I didn't even start that yet."" I said ""So you could have came with me man what the hell"" with a laugh. he told me he ""slept in so late again"". So I am always the one to text him or spark any interest in whats going on in is daily life, but there not much because he stay in all the time. I have my friends in my part of the school but with him i just  have a feel things aren't right. It just feels like hes hibernating all the time. What can I do to break the ice because we have so many common interest in culture taste and stuff. Thanks

241,"I lived abroad before - and there’s nothing like learning a foreign language, meeting people from all over the world to give you a new perspective and make you forget everything you hate about yourself and your home country.

Why do I not want to live where I was born? All I can say is that I was never happy here - too many bad memories, too many familial expectations. All of my old friends are gone, and I am just not content with a life of Netflix, mowing my lawn, and sitting in traffic so that I can amass money prancing around corporate America.

For some reason, my relationship with my family seems to completely sap my will to live. They profess to love me, but it seems to me like mostly they don’t want me to be happy or enjoy my life. Instead, they want me unconditional, constant, and persistent affirmation that this, the life they’ve dragged me into, where the only thing I’m allowed to enjoy is the amount of money I’ve earned - not spending it on anything of course, but just earning the money and looking at the sum in the bank account - that this is the best possible place and best possible way of living.

I try to be nice to them, because I know that human suffering is constant - but I can’t help but feel that they’ve dragged me out of a life that was my own, that I had made for myself and enjoyed - in order to force me back into a city I always hated and an over-rated career field full of elitist Masters of the Universe and a lot of fools being parted from their money. And they did this primarily because they derive some emotional utility from my kindness and support - they personally don’t care one jot whether I’m happy or not, or whether I’m doing what I want with my life - instead, they jealously cut me off from any outside influences or value systems so that they can maintain their primacy in my life. 

By most accounts, I’m great at my job - but it seems to me like success is more a product of having an engaging personality and correctly understanding power relationships than it is about keeping your head down and getting the job done. It’s hard for me to want to fit in at the office, because I hate myself and I have literally no friends or girlfriend. Most office banter seems to be ego-maximizing bragging about various life achievements - and when I don’t have an iota of enthusiasm for my own life, how can I expect other people to give a shit?

So, should I become an English Teacher in Hokkaido or Okinawa?",07May2017,1

I'm 30 now and I had watched this thing over and over since as young as I could remember. I was never allowed to express it because it would be against cultural norms and my mother would not let me.

Anyways, I just exploded and if he doesn't leave us alone I'll beat him! I felt very ashamed but I just couldn't take it. Anytime I hear my mom in anguish it just sends me into panic attack.

But I felt really bad and I told him I forgive him. We are all old now so no use in doing this shit. This was my mother's wish so I'm really doing it for her. I feel very conflicted about accepting my father now but optimistic maybe we'll have another shot at being a family again.

246,"I'm kind of freaking out right now and I just need someone to tell me what to do with this mess.

Some background, I dated this girl for a little over 8 months. We were both in high school at the time (I was a senior and she was a sophomore).

Fell head over heels for each other. Never been in a relationship like that one. We were extremely close and intimate. Unfortunately that was kind of our downfall. We realized we were just way too young to deal with a relationship that intense. And then I went to college and it all just went to shit.

It was a very cordial breakup, we ended on great terms. Didn't talk for a month or two. Then we started very occasionally hanging out in groups when I was home and texting occasionally. But this is where things go bad.

She started drinking, then started drinking a lot, like every weekend. And for a junior in high school that's never a good sign. She got a new boyfriend, and given the fact that I still had feelings I backed off big time. Then I started seeing all this shit over snapchat (her friend's stories mainly): she was doing acid, regularly drinking to the point of vomiting six times in one night, that kind of thing. She always did shit with her hair but she started dyeing it these crazy different colors all the time. And we talked less and less. Recently she had her car taken away for sneaking to some campsite an hour north of our home town.

Well, another girl in my life (someone I used to have a thing with, now we're friends) started talking to her. And the two hung out, and basically I just had some stuff confirmed for me: She lost feelings cause we got too intense, but she wants to be friends with me. I also found out she smokes cigarettes and her new boyfriend is a drug addict who does cocaine (and offered it to her).

Given I'm studying for finals right now this is just a lot of shit coming at me and I had that I'm letting it get to me but it is.

Here's the kicker: Today, she called me. She told me I was the only person she wanted to talk to right now because everyone else is a mess. She started venting to me about how she's been doing a lot of drugs, but then kind of trailed off and just started complaining about work, normal shit. I could tell that she was all over the place. She brought up how she loves getting drunk to the point where she can't remember anything. Basically nothing like the fun loving girl I had fallen in love with who hated alcohol and loved going on hikes and adventuring and loving life. I gave her the only advice I could, that she should be safe and know her limits, and if she drinks she should drink to enjoy life not to forget about it. She ended the conversation by asking me when I was coming home (this week) and that we should hang out this weekend.

I'm at a loss here. I feel like I have some responsibility to get her out of this hole she dug for herself, but at the same time, I don't know if I should. I still love her, my feelings really haven't changed, and I can't figure out if she's just using me or not.

So my question is, what the hell is she feeling right now? And what am I supposed to do about it?

251,"I really need advice for how to start running my household and putting things back in order. 

I'm (19/F) a college student who just came back home for the summer, and I can't believe the state that my home and family are in right now. Both of my parents are alcoholics, and my father has been in and out of the hospital constantly for the past year and half due to numerous physical/mental health issues. And they've let the house become disgusting to the point where I'm certain that the authorities would condemn it if they were to see it.

In part, my biggest concerns are my two 13 year old German Shepherds, who have gotten to the point where they can barely walk and can no longer hold their bladder. They simply piss and shit all over the ground, and usually my mother is the only one around. Instead of cleaning it up, she lets it sit their until it gets completely disgusting, or she'll stick some paper towels on top of it to let it ""soak up...."" And then never picks up the towels. As a result, the entire 1st floor of our house constantly smells like dog piss and I can't stand walking around on the hardwood floor without shoes. I honestly think it's time that they be put down- as hard as it is, they're at the point where they have a shit quality of life, but my parents got angry whenever my little sister (14) would bring it up this past year. My parents also also havent changed our cats' (plural; we have FOUR of them) litter in months, which I was completely horrified to discover. I'm probably going to have to burn the damn thing to get rid of it, it's so bad. And as a result of the cats not having a clean litterbox, they've also resorted to doing their business around the house. 

There's a lot of other things, too. For one thing, neither of my parents sleep in their room anymore, or even go in it at all, really. They've both taken to squatting downstairs, my mother on the family room couch and my father on the living room couch. They hardly ever leave their respective couches except to go to work (my father works full time and my mother, after over 15 years of unemployment, started work part-time about a year ago). And furthermore, they've completely trashed up these rooms now as well. They both have a combination of empty bottles, red solo cups, food, wrappers, old food, etc scattered all over the floor around them. Nothing has been dusted for months, and both my little sister and I have severe allergies. We also still have our Christmas decoration up (classy, I know) and nobodies vacuumed or cleaned the floors. As a result, the entire downstairs is also unlivable. 

They've also done a horrible job at keeping up with other things as well. The dryer has been broken for two months, and we don't have anywhere to air-dry clothes, so my little sister hasn't been able to wash her clothes during that time. My parents also don't clean the downstairs bathroom, and my sister insists that she hasn't seen my mom actually shower in weeks, and that she just washes her hair occasionally in the sink. The lawn looks like it hasn't been mowed since spring began, and the fridge was almost empty. My sister hasn't learned how to cook for herself, and my mother doesn't ever cook for her/show her how to cook so she tells me that when she's at home she's just been eating cereal/frozen pancakes. She usually lives at her friend's house, but usually has to be home most school nights. 

My mom also forgets to pay the bills as well. We've had our water, electricity, and Internet shut off before because she doesn't pay the bill, and we've had to recently switch trash companies because she never paid the bill for the last one. We have the money to pay these bills, she just doesn't feel like getting off the couch to go through and complete them. And now that the trash company has switched, my father is always away on business whenever trash night comes, and my mom hasn't taken it out. When I checked the garage the other night, there had to be 20 giant bags of trash just sitting there. 

Out of every room in the house, only my bedroom, my brother's (17), and the upstairs bathroom is kept clean. But that's because I clean my own room and My brother usually keeps up with the bathroom while I'm away. My sisters room is unlivable. Apparently she's been spending time in my room because hers is so bad. I can't even be mad at her; no one ever taught her how to be clean, and her room has gotten to so bad that she probably feels incredibly ashamed/overwhelmed about it. 

I have so much work to do if I want to make sure my sister is in a livable environment when I go back to school in the fall. I've given up on my parents at this point; if they want to change, they need to somehow find the motivation to do so, and it isn't something I have any control over. But I want to make sure my sister has a food, a clean bathroom, and a clean place to sleep and study once I'm not there anymore. 

I guess my first request is advice on how to make this household somewhat livable. The house needs so much work done to it that I haven't been able to figure out the best course of action or routine to get to fixing it. I also want to figure out how I can teach my sister to be as self-sufficient as possible. It hurts to know that she has to do so at her age, but so long as she's living under their roof I want to make sure she's safe and can take care of herself. 

I haven't even gone into the actual atmosphere of our family, but I feel like this is enough for now. All that's really necessary to know is that both of my parents are very mentally ill alcoholics who have gotten to the point where they're barely functioning, and don't put any effort into running the household. And that they can hardly stand each other and the entire family (including extended) has basically turned on one another. It's a very hostile, depressing, negative environment to live in, and I'm so worried about my sister. Things weren't nearly as bad as this when I was her age, and I'm still incredibly fucked up. The only thing keeping me from completely giving up is her. I can't even imagine what growing up in this is doing to her. I want to be a positive role model for her. I want to model what it's like to be a functional, responsible adult. How can I do this?

Thank you for putting in the time to read this. I know it's a lot, but I've only been home for two days and I'm already at my limit. I just don't know where to go from here. 

I won't even go into my mother's drunk driving/public drunkeness-even at school events-or my father's mental health issues, but they're there, and they definitely contribute to my concerns. ",07May2017,1

Dysphoria: a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life

I'm a 6 foot, 225 lbs. 20 year old male who is unsure about a lot in his life. And I would say more than normally. My belief in God, my gender (as in gender dysphoria), and my emotions and interests. I guess I'll outline these issues a bit more clearly.

**1. My Belief in God: Religious Uncertainty**

I've believed in God my whole life. My belief has been reinforced by my Protestant parents teaching me at a young age and enrolling in a Christian school for 2/3 of my K-12 education. I am aware enough to recognize that. I never felt a relationship with Jesus while enrolled at the Christian school. I was numb to belief in Christ until 2013 when my anxieties built up into a repentance and a need for help. It changed me for a few months, but I felt like I was living wrong at that time as well. Sure I was less shy, but I had a need to try to drive everyone I knew or had known to believe in Christ. It made me feel manic, and I recognize that looking back. Now it's an uncertainty if Christ was the real Savior or not. Or if there is a real Savior. I can't see a world without hope, but then again why should there be? 

**2. My Gender Dysphoria**

I've never been able to talk to girls my age my whole life. This is probably due to social anxiety disorder I've had. From that, it has evolved to some guys too. This doesn't apply to guys who have been my friends for a long while, but random guys my age. Now I've liked girls my whole life, and I think the inability of being able to talk to one has made me jealous of them. Jealous to the point of wanting to be a girl. On top of this, I've worn girl's clothing and it has made me quite aroused. So my attraction to women has transformed into an admiration and a jealousy of them, their aspects, and their idiosyncrasies. This has created an attraction to transgender people and a very mild attraction to men, and that scares me. People say you can't control your gender, but I think there are many factors that can sway your gender such as shyness, social anxiety, and lack of self-confidence (at least for me from a self-analytical standpoint). I desire to be a man who can like women, not a woman made from a man (meaning transgender). But then again, I do have this desire to be a woman, but this is not what I want deep in my soul if I have an absolute choice. And the societal pressure to ""trust your feelings"" combined with an evil-world philosophy from Christianity makes me feel like transgenderism is falling to temptation. But what does it matter if I don't believe? I'm uncertain in belief so I am uncertain in being transgender or ultimately gay.

**3. My Moody Emotions and Swaying Interests**

I like many things. I like Hip-Hop, Music Production, Wordplay, Futurology, Chemistry, Endocrinology, Astronomy, Entrepreneurism, Video Games, Nutrition, and Art. That's what I can think of off the top of my head. The point is my broad range of interests really make me unsure on what to pursue as a career choice. I know I do not have to be certain, but my indecisiveness makes me fear my future. My interests are not definitive in holding my attention; that is to say that if I were to commit to something, I fear I would be stuck or not enjoy it or even get burnt out on it. And other days, it all seems meaningless to me.

This ties to my emotions. Many days I feel really inspired with ideas and concepts, and many days I feel the opposite. But I always have a lack of motivation and self-discipline. I go from happy to sad every day to the next respectively. It screws up my way of thinking and keeps me in a state of limbo. This process has probably fueled my dysphoria and uncertainty. I'm coiled up in enigmas that refused to be answered and I hate living with them.

**What I've Tried**

I tried exercise. It's hard for me to commit to it. I did two months consistently, but I often had a lot of lactic acid in my muscles and acid reflux. I'm an acid cesspool basically.

I've eaten relatively good with not much progress to my health.

Both of these things made me feel like I had not changed. Although others noticed my change, I did not and that frustrated me from continuing with it. This has given me physical dysphoria as well, and I'm considering a diet where I burn my muscle because I dislike being a large person (as in muscular).

**Conclusion**

I thank you for reading this and any advice you can give would be tremendously appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Unsure about a lot of things. If you only read this, you probably should not reply.
