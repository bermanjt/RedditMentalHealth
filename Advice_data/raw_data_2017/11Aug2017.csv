3,"Hello everyone. A little about me, I'm a male age 20. I'm a college student and I been a loner for years now but I'm trying to be more social. I've had this problem for a while now and it's the main reason I'm usually quiet. Most of the times I just can't think of anything to say.

I keep telling myself maybe it's because I'm not smart enough. Meeting people is easy but around people I know like even my mom I'm stuck in my head. Many people talk about the news and share intellectual thoughts while I can't for some reason. I thought maybe watching the news more is a great place to start. I could be around my family and try so hard to think of something to say but end up silent. ",11Aug2017,2
4,"I met a girl last semester in one of my classes. Things were going pretty good and we started hanging out. She told me early on that she just got out of a 5 year relationship where she was shortly married and now divorced, just for arguments sake she is now 21. anyway we have sex and made out a few times. She went on a trip to Korea recently to see her mom and ended up blowing me the night before she left. Now shes back and she seems kinda distant, so I sent her a text asking if things were ok between us. she said it was fine, but she is emotionally unavailable. I then asked her if she still wanted to see each other every so often and she said she does, but not in a sexual way. I feel kinda weird about it because we started off sexual and now she just doesn't want to be. Should I keep seeing this girl as a friend or just move on to the next one?",11Aug2017,1

8,"Last week I went to therapy (I don't really have a exact reason why, my parents force me to) I used to dread going until I got this beautiful therapist. I've been seeing her for a few months now and I always masturbated to her after every session (at home of course) It was funny cause she has these like 'b' cup boobs that are pretty sexy (I'm really into flat breast) I always stare at then and she never minds. One time she did the cliche ""my eyes are up here"" line, I just thought of it as a joke. She would always ""drop things"" to show her ass (which is also at my size of likings) Sometimes I would even see her underwear. Well anyways last week we were just talking as usual, talking about my ""problems"" and then again, as usual I was looking at her little boobs. She said while looking irritated ""if you are just going to look at my boobs the whole time let me do this"" she then continued to take off her shirt revealing her cute little white bra. Me at a lost of words wasn't saying anything but digging the situation. As if I was in a trance then starting to stare at her pants. She then took those off too. She had the cutest pair of white panties. Her being probs around 25 or like 27 she looked perfect. Next thing you know my pants are off and I had my dick out. I took off her underwear and right before I put it in she put her land in front of her pussy and said ""don't tell anyone, ok?"" I nod and she removed her hand and we fucked till the end of the session. It's been a week now. I had therapy again today but she said she was having her period so not this week. I'm just wondering what should I do for next week? I'm 18 already so this isn't illegal. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.",11Aug2017,1
10,"I'm 23 and recently just quit my job with American Income Life. The reason I finally quit is because I hadn't been paid in 3 weeks, the job being 100% commission based.

For me being a recent college graduate, I had bills that were due and mixed with the fact that my car broke on the way to work, and no sales in weeks I couldn't afford to keep running. 

My bosses didn't see it that way. It was my fault, I didn't book enough appointments, It made no sense to quit a full time job to work part time making calls for other co workers, but I explained I needed steady pay and the bills I had coming up that no pay in three weeks and working 60+ hrs a week wasn't covering it.

My whole family was against the job, but in the end I didn't regret working there, they showed me I had a lot of growing up to do and my facial expression and energy needed work. I was sad to leave, which is why I accepted a job making calls for people because nobody on my team really enjoyed making preset calls, but it was one of the things I was really good at.

I don't know if it was me or if the market is really bad for selling it. A lot of people I met were really suspicious of us, next to none could afford the insurance. My grandfather told me the market was bad for insurance right now, people are trying to cover their bills.

Is it possible the market will pick back up anytime soon or is this a cause I should just mark as lost?",11Aug2017,2
14,"I am a 20 year old who may possibly be dropping out of college based on poor academic performance.

I don't know what to do. My academic failings started around the end of my second year, where I felt so alone and empty I could barely drag myself out of my dorm to walk, much less attend class. I was able to continue to attend, but was on academic probation. My parents hoped I would do better, and I hoped so too. 

Basically I did bad during the middle of the school year, not attending classes, staying cooped up in my room, not eating until my head hurt and spending lots of time sleeping. I tried to get myself to do work, but honestly I felt too empty to care. By the end of the year I stopped completely, and just wasted away in my room.

I honestly don't know what to do right now. Summer is ending soon and I know I have to tell my parents, even though the thought of doing so hurts. I was the golden child, but honestly I don't think I''m worth anything, especially after what I've done. 

I've been dreaming about running away, idiotic I know, but I feel like a burden to my family after everything thats happened, and honestly I have little to lean on if I do. I guess I just want to know if others have gone through the same thing, and if they, or anyone, have any advice they're willing to share.

17,"So I play three sports. Basketball, tennis, and volleyball. I'm the best at tennis and am almost guaranteed a spot at varsity is what the coach told me and I'll be a freshman next year. I'm keeping basketball too I have a good shot at JV. I love volleyball too I could probably make JV or freshman. I want to do all three but there are problems. Money, time, coaches, and parents. It's expensive to play all three but we can afford it with a surplus of money. My mom just got a huge promotion as well. Tennis and volleyball are in the same season which is time. Some coaches favor kids (including me) in some sports so the selection process and playing times can be questionable. My dad wants me to only do tennis and basketball. Tennis is my least favorite but I'm the best at it. I just don't enjoy tennis that much period. And when I loose I become even more upset because I could've been playing another sport instead. I will try to see if I can possibly do all three for high school but even if I can my dad will be pissed. My mom won't care. So what should I do. Should I try to do all three and see what happens (what I mostly want to do). Or should I drop a sport. That means quitting tennis(which I'm good at) or quitting volleyball(which I love). And will it make a difference in my collage application if it said JV volleyball instead of Varisty Tennis. The tennis team sucks (btw) so we won't have a championship win. I saw them play.

19,"Throwaway, because I am a paranoid son.

First about my dad. He is the only one in the family who has a stable job and our primary source of income. But he is not only that, I love him. He has given me and my family so much. A loving man. A kind man. But things have been going downhill lately. He came across this woman who I've known for quite a while and has helped our family. But he eventually caught feelings for her, and caused some problems especially with my mom. After a few months, though, eventually he said that he gave up feelings for her. Or so we thought. 

For the past couple of months, my dad has been suffering due to this neck problem that is constantly giving him pain. He begs to get it fixed by surgery but his doctors say that he can't and tell him to give it a few months and just use these pain killers. Now I don't know the full details about this because I never really was curious about it. Now, the problem with these pills are that it makes him constantly drowsy and hinders his work. What he decides to do is use some illegal drug (that I will not mention because I'm paranoid) that keeps him awake. I was afraid at first, but as the naive boy I am, I let it slide because ""taking a small amount won't get me addicted"". Anyways, this kept on until today, when that woman that I recently talked about said that she would be getting married soon. 

This is when all hell went loose. He started self-harming, sending the pics of the cuts to her to try to get her to come over. He keeps on doing it for the next hour. This is where I start losing my mind, I tried at first to threaten to call the emergency line, but he said he would go to jail if I do. And thus, the situation I am in right now. Tired, afraid, scared. I want him to get help because I love him. I don't want him to get in trouble, lose his job, but I want this all to stop. 

Anyways, currently, in the situation I am in right now, I don't know what to do, I'm probably going to have a panic attack soon.

25,"---- Long Post; Be Prepared ----
Hello fellow Redditors! How are y'all doing? I am currently a junior in high school and I need some advice with dropping out or some alternatives. Let me explain my story. I recommend reading the whole post so you guys would understand.

Just like the title says, I feel like High School is a waste of time. I don't want to attend anymore. I feel like all the information presented to us is useless (Except Math). Every day I wake up with a mentality of ""Dang it. I have to go school again."" I never wake up looking forward to attending another stressing day of high school. I just don't. Not only is it because I don't have ANY interest in the material (Except Music. More explaining coming), but I also can't soak up information like all my classmates do. I have always thought that if you like a certain subject, that class will be a breeze. I wasn't wrong. For me at least, I have a passion for music. I have taken two music classes in high school (AP Music Theory and Advanced Band) and I got a clean A+ for both of them. The rest of my classes? Bs and Cs. 

What I want to do when I grow up is be a musician. I want to surround myself with music. I want to go to a good music school (Juilliard, Curtis, Colburn etc) and all I want to do is music. Now, for those of you who think ""High School is never a waste of time"" let me ask you this:
- How does learning about The French Revolution improve my playing? **It doesn't.**
- How does learning about Mitosis and Meiosis improve my playing? **It doesn't.**
- How does reading Shakespear's novels improve my playing? **It doesn't.**
**Not trying to get into an offensive or aggressive tone here; Just stating my points.**
If you think high school is never a waste of time then why are we not offered a class that we will actually use in life?
- Why are we not taught how to pay taxes? Or bills? 
- Why are we not taught how to buy a house? Or Car? 
- Why are we not taught how to open a bank account? Or manage financial plans/budgeting?
- Why are we not taught how to manage a passport? Or Visa? Or Greencard?
Of course, this is at least in MY high school in Georgia. I have asked friends from other schools if their school offered ""life"" classes and they said a simple ""No.""
My point is, why am I forced to take classes that I won't need? Why do I need to sit at my desk studying my butt off for that next French Revolution test when I want to be a musician?
I have talked to my parents about this (briefly) and they said school is designed to not be ignorant. They said it was to not make you look like a dumb, useless person. I get it. I understand this very well, but let's use logic. 
Do you really think that if I go to audition for a professional orchestra they will ask what I learned in my high school social studies class? Nope. 

That's not all. High School has changed so much in terms of pressuring kids. High School also defines you with numbers. The saddest part is that the education system has been the same for centuries (I'm NOT trying to start a political debate on the education system). 
I hate it when I'm defined by numbers. I tell people I have a 2.8 GPA (unweighted) and they think I'm stupid. Not only does this happen between friends, but it also happens between adults. When I go to my friend's house I always hear his parents talking about how my friend talks with this guy who has a 2.6 GPA and that he is too dumb for him to talk with etc. Like, what if he is a national champion in soccer? I think you get my point here. 

Finally, what other alternatives are there in the outside world?
Or what can I do to help with my music career with school not being in the way? 
*Any advice is extremely appreciated*
**Did I explain my point clearly? Do I even have a point? What if I'm in denial? Please tell me!**
If anyone has questions, I'll do my best to answer as quickly as I can. 
Thank you for reading this far and have a beautiful day :)

27,"I no longer live with my mum (I live with my nan) because she is always in hospital... I am now 17 and I understand that I should be fending for myself now and can't be reliant on my mum anymore but she doesn't buy food and when I ask her for money so I can buy some she puts up a fight. You're probably thinking I could just get a job but it's more complex then that. I use to have a part time job for a famous food chain but because I am still in full time education I couldn't juggle all my school work and work (basically I was overworked and sleep deprived because I would go to school then go to work until 22:30 then go home and do homework and repeat it all the next day). My mum seems to think that I have a lot of money in my bank account but I literally have £2 because I spent it on food and things I need - like toiletries, ect... So she refuses to give me money. It got to the point that I literally would eat two bowls of cereal - one in the morning and one in the evening. So I asked my mum if I could please have some money and she proceeded to yell and told me that I'm taking all her money and that my bank account  must be so full which really made me angry because I honestly have nothing - I didn't even have enough money to get the train home after work. Recently my hair has been falling out a lot, my vision is always blurry and I'm always tired. My friends always complain that I walk too slowly, they don't understand that I'm so tired. They complain when I don't eat lunch or if I eat very little but I can't afford to buy sandwiches and stuff. My mum thinks I only want her for money which isn't the case I care about my mum but these days I'm becoming more and more resentful, she stresses me out because I'm always worrying about her.... Yet if I ask her for money she tells me I'm selfish. She honestly has  no consideration for anyone - I spent 3 days straight cleaning her house and she didn't even say thank you.  Currently, I'm tutoring kids to try and get money however it isn't enough, trying to find work but everywhere seems to reject me. I'm honestly beginning to give up on my mum because she makes life so much more stressful.  Am I asking too much of her?",11Aug2017,11
28,"Little background. My mother was a teen mom, didn't grow up rich, but she loved me. Now that I am older I came out as Transgender *(MtF)* to her last year, I told her that I am starting HRT *(Hormonal Replacement Therapy)* two weeks ago. When I told her I thought she was going to be happy. I was wrong. She told me that I couldn't afford it *(I am doing it through a free program in my state, so not really sure whats going on there)*. Now she is currently on her second block though this time just a messenger block not facebook completely *(She does not have my phone number or even know where I live, just the state)*

I am also going to mention that she has already disowned me before and due to how the block worked *(Me blocking her)* I let her back into my life two years later, she has always been narcissistic to a point however I am feeling that this time is going full forward into a possessive tone with me. With the way she wants me to do things for her for 10 dollars a hour when I need to focus on my job which is honestly paying 2~ more.

I have many thoughts to disown her , I still love her but she will cause me too much stress. Her sisters, and brother has disowned her but due to my connection to her I am unable to talk to them due to the issues my mother brought up and the memories that I ""trigger"" for them.

My family sounds pretty f'd up when I write it down.

31,"I work as a lifeguard at a water park. I'm 17 and yesterday I dropped my sunglasses at the bottom of a waterslide. My colleagues found them while i wasnt there and gave them to my supervisor because he told my friend to go back to his job before he could give them to me. After, I found out what happened and asked where my sunglasses were and he wouldnt give me an exact answer. He told me to check here and there and then ask another supervisor who wasnt with us that day. I kept going up to him and my colleagues who found my sunglasses confronted him and said exactly what happened but he denied knowing that the sunglasses were mine so he said he left them in the employee area of the waterslide catchpool. I know this is bullshit because 1. he couldnt look at me while he was telling me his vague answer, 2. he keeps changing the location where he left it (even though he never gave just one in the first place) and 3. the way he talked to me today when i confronted him for the last time seemed like he was telling the truth but I looked online and it was quite unnatural -- he stared for a long time holding eye contact, not moving much, and i felt him getting angry and raising his tone the more i talked to him about it. 


Security is currently on it and i talked to one of the higher positioned supervisors about it. My mom is getting management involved and she's pretty determined to get my supervisor fired, since he's unethical. 

This has happened to me before, it is kind of a mirror scenario. when i was little, i went to a summer camp that took place at a church. i lended my iPod touch, which my father had recently won at some contest, to my friends, who gave it to our counsellor, because i forgot about it. i asked about it the next day and they told me they gave it to the counsellor, who said she left it at the front desk. she kept delaying and finally she said it wasnt there anymore. when my mom got involved, she was pissed- at me and my counsellor. She got the ipod back, but it was wiped + a $10 itunes gift card. 

Please let me know what i can do in this scenario besides what i have done so far. I have written a letter explaining what happened and will get my colleagues' signatures to make it legitimate.

37,"Titles says it all, I'm 27 soon to be 28 and never been in a relationship or even had a conversation with a non-family women, other than necessary, appointments, etc. I've always been considered quiet, and I remember having my teachers in my early years like kindergarten calling my parents saying I'm too quiet, and sadly I remember the closest I ever been to a girl was holding her hand in kindergarten at recess :( I don't even know how that happened. I never really went out during my school years and was mostly a shut in, in high school I remember being alone at lunch and at one time someone invited me to sit with them as they seen me always alone. After graduating high school, I was found  a job by a neighbor in 2007, when I graduated at a local owned grocery store. I could of been one of the worst experiences of my life, the bosses harassed me on a frequent basis and I kept it to myself, as I thought this was normal,  so I suffered for years until I quit in 2012.

Fast forward now, pretty much the same, somewhat. Last year I finally got the courage to tell my parents I needed help, I live with them, so I started seeing a therapist, I was diagnosed with social anxiety, I'm taking meds now but not really being put in places to try if it's helping. What I was doing till then for money was living off my savings from my only work and still am, and also Have entered sweepstakes online everyday since like 09, and have won a lot of prizes, cash and trips, I even zip lined with a model last year from a contest, I was hoping I would be given a chance to talk to a lady, that was famous to help me with confidence, but there was no time unfortunately. I fear I have phobias also like, I had a car my parents made me buy with my work money back in 09 but I only went to work as I felt forced to buy it, buy I could never go anywhere else, since I think I have a fear of going outside of my city and streets that I know, I only been on a highway with a driving instructor. Right now I don't have a car but I can get one with another prize I'm awaiting to receive, a BMW motorcycle, which is a pricey one, which I am hoping to sell for a car again. 

Last year I also had help in enrolling back to school so it's been one year in and another year till I get a degree, but still no luck in meeting someone. I have tried to apply to many jobs since then but I never got hired since now I have a large work gap, I don't know what to do. I'm just upset that I've been always been alone and used, I've always wondered what it felt to have a girlfriend, it's the small things like cuddling and hugs, I wish to have. I'm from the US and 5'8' if that helps and 130 lbs, on top of that, I'm balding, which  lowers what ever self esteem I have if any, I used to have long hair, which I miss. I have an Okcupid which my therapist recommended, but I've had no luck in getting a reply if any.

41,"There is a lot to this story, but I don't want to type it all up. If you *really* want to read all of it, it's all in my post history.

tl:dr ex-FWB was diagnosed with cancer. She found someone who could be in a committed relationship with her and started dating him before we broke it off even though she said she would discuss it with me first. We remained friends, but she got distant. Contacted her last week to see if she wanted to meet for lunch in a couple days when I would be in town and she said yes. That morning she said she wasn't feeling good from chemo but to check closer to lunch to see if she was feeling better and we could go out. Texted her at lunch and asked if she was up to going out or if she wanted, I could come over and make some lunch at her place. She never replied. I went by her place to check on her because it was on my way home, thinking maybe she was asleep or maybe her sickness had worsened. Her car wasn't there. Turns out she was at her mothers house hanging out in the pool. Her mom lives far enough away that lunch would have been impossible so I get the feeling she never intended to meet and was probably lying about being sick. She never did text me back about the lunch. 

A few days later she texted me about something I had posted on Facebook about being back in her town. I didn't bother to reply. I'm pissed that a) she lied to me about meeting a dude. Not that I would have cared, I would have wished her well, just that she lied to me. We've been friends for damn near 15 years. And b) that she stood me up and then ignored my message completely. Made me feel like I don't matter to her.

Tonight she posted a picture. The chemo made her hair start falling out so she shaved her head. We talked a lot about her cancer before she distanced herself. I know one of the things she would be really upset about was losing her hair. I want to let her know I'm sorry it happened to her and that I'm still here to support her, but at the same time I kind of feel like she doesn't want my support or she wouldn't have been treating a 15yr friend like she has been.

I know that when people don't text you or ignore your texts, something is amiss. You just don't do that to people who you care about. Part of me wants to support her. Like the post or heart it. Message her and tell her I'm proud of her. Another part of me just wants to forget her and let her deal with it herself because i feel like if she wanted me to be in her life she would make an effort to include me and she isn't so fuck her.

46,"Hey everyone!

I graduated college about 8 months ago (I am 24) and am in a mess right now and I feel emotionally stuck and depressed. I was wondering if you guys can give me some advice or insight? So I just got an offer from my current company (Company A) that I am interning with, however, they want me to move 4000 miles to a place in the middle nowhere for training for a year. I am not too sure if i have what it takes to do it. I have never been away from home and I don't know if I can just leave all my friends and family like that. However, this job will open opportunities for me in the future.

I got another offer recently from a different company (Company B). It is about 15 miles from where I live. However, if I take that job I will be pigeonholed and will have hard time finding a new job in the future because of how specific this job role is.

In terms of pay the company B will offer more for the first 6 months, however, company A promised to increase my salary after 6 months, which I am pretty sure will be more than company B. In terms of environment, its very hard to choose. Company A is much bigger while Company B is a small business. I would say its a wash.

As you can see its very hard for me to choose. What I am really worried about is moving to the middle of nowhere with company A. If I didn't have to move, I would choose company A easily. What would you guys do? Any insight? Advice? Help?",11Aug2017,1
49,"I am looking for advice on which to housing option to choose between. I know that the decision is ultimately mine and I should choose what I think I prefer, but I am hoping to get peoples opinions as well. This is because people may have been in similar situations and have had good or bad experiences. Generally I would like to know what you guys think since this is the first time I’m living with people who are not family, and for the next 1 year and if I like it then 3 years. 

To give a little more information about myself; I am going into my second year and made these friends in my first year. Sadly in my last semester last year, I did not perform well at all academically (below average). I blame this on myself mostly, bad habits, but living alone in my own apartment sort of reinforced them (Got lonely and went out a lot, yet didn’t make time to leave home to study). This considered, I want to choose between these two compared to living with random people and landlords or living alone again. I can not afford to let my grades sink again in anyway and thus I have to cut out distractions from my life. 

So that considered, I myself started leaning towards living with the Girl. She is very busy (Job, Boyfriend, House chores) and yet manages to complete her work and does it well. I am comfortable asking her for help and she is happy providing it. She never bothers me to do something or go out with her, but my other friends do. Though spending time with her is nice because it feels legitimate and personal. But I am unsure in general and have limited experience and thus I am conflicted.

According to both, choosing one over the other won’t strain my relationship with the other. My concern is only myself. I don’t want to introducered things in my life that may affect my performance. Currently I am not confident in myself and my ability, or at least not enough, to be able to take chances/risks and still manage all my require work.

Any suggestions would be very appreciated. A quick pros and cons list (very basic) on each:


Pros Friends:

3 of my Guy friends I knew all throughout last year. 
2 of them are in the same program/some same classes with me. 
I get along with them nicely. 
We have similar interests. 
The house is recently renovated. 
Not too far from bus route and straight bus. 

Cons Friends:

One of them IS the landlord and owns the house, comes up with arbitrary rules. 
Two of them fight over the smallest things ever. 
Last year I didn’t get work done when we “studied”. 
I mainly chilled with these guys and studied on my own (hangout at school/bars, work at home/library). 
Have to share between two washrooms, and one of them is kind of makeshift washroom (not fully tiled). 
Rooms are kind of small and no closet. 
My parents are against this housing (kind of irrelevant). 

Pros Girl:

I also knew here all throughout last year. 
I trust her with things I don't with others cause she’s easy to talk to. 
She’s also in the same program and some same classes. 
She’s very hardworking and we study well together . 
I get to live in her basement all to myself and mostly furnished
My own room, washroom, fridge, microwave. 
She has a car and promises to drive me everyday to school/gym (we used to go to the gym and she wants to continue that) . 
She has a doggo!. 

Cons Girl:

I have to share the kitchen upstairs . 
I will be sharing with her family, who live upstairs (mom and sister) I don’t know them very well. 
Her boyfriend will visit and stay Friday and Saturdays (I dunno if that will be a problem, don't have experience) . 
I don’t know if it will get lonely in a basement (I go out a fair amount and she promises to spend as much time as she can we with me). 
Funnily enough, parents are also against this housing (again irrelevant) . ",11Aug2017,1

58,"Hello, Reddit.
I'm stressed as heck for university. I'm sure you heard this a million times, but I feel narcissistic and want my very own question overloaded thread (just scared, sorry). 

I don't know what works better to convey my point across, so I'm doing a mixture of a list and, of course, good ol' paragraph form.

Shall we begin the list?

- United States citizen
- Only veteran affiliation is grandfather (WWII), doesn't count for GI bill (I believe)
- Michigander from one of the top five Best Public High Schools in Michigan
- 4.0 GPA and a 1210 SAT score
- No AP or IB courses (a ton in my school do)
- Probably low class rank due to no AP/IB
- No job (because I don't yet want to grow up!)
- Fairly intelligent (relative to myself?)
- Learning disabled since the age of... 4?
- Recently switched from IEP to 504 for my disability
- Parents went to university
- Parents don't really care 

So, nobody is holding my hand. And because of that, I am scared and stressed. I want to get into a good university because that's what we're all supposed to do-- right? Anyhow, uh, I don't know what to do. I'm learning disabled but my transcript does not share that and I do not know if I should share that with the admissions office. Special education students are very expensive to teach, even if you're paying 13,560USD for tuition and for that reason it is logical for me not to share that. However, I could play the empathy card if I do share that. So, don't know if I should share that[1]. Plus, it is illegal to discriminate people with special needs. But, I'd have to prove discrimination and with a public ivy (i.e. Michigan State University or University of Michigan--Ann Arbor) they deny a lot of people so one more denial means nothing. 

APs/IBs. I dun' f'd up. I am assuming I am pretty low in the eyes of admissions because I didn't challenge myself. And, apparently, they want you to do that. For a student constantly getting A's and A+'s and a couple A-'s they'd expect me to challenge myself with college level classes. Plus, I (poorly and anecdotally) estimate about 70 percent of the students in my grade took at least one AP course. I took none. If I say the reason why I didn't take AP tests was because of the reading requirement was extremely intensive with my disability [1] that would at least be an excuse. But, then they'll be saying I don't try hard. So, uh, that. I didn't take an AP courses because I knew the reading was extensive (similar to college :c) and with a disability of being unable to read, I didn't want to waste 90 percent of my day attempting. So, this isn't really a question but something I want to calm myself with and I feel pretty poorly about. So, how do I ""own up"" to the fact I didn't take an AP/IB courses?

3) What do I do about getting into university, I think? I listened to a speaker for University of Michigan--Ann Arbor and holy cow, I do not meet what they are seeking. Though, for Michigan State University I do meet what they are asking for. According to PrepScholar, I have a 83.98% chance of acceptance for MSU and a 6.57% chance for UMich. I am thinking about also applying to Central Michigan University as I had a family member who attended and UM-Dearborn because I think I like it. Though, to be honest, I am thinking about only attending MSU. If I don't get accepted and attend MSU I feel like I should just do community college as it'd be cheaper. So, what do you suggest? [3]

University is expensive as heck. How do I afford it??? I am not in a high incoming class, but I don't think qualify for much because my parents saved a ton of money for retirement (it's liquid, not 401k). But, I know my parents WILL NOT pay for my university. They've been really upfront about this since I was little. It seems insane that my parent's income is what decides my ability for grants, but my parents will not pay. They say, ""it's your choice, do whatever,"" and so I am kinda on my own... They say they will cosign on my first year because that's the way the law is, but after my first year it is all dependent on me. And to be honest, I don't expect my parents to be alive (knock on wood) for much longer in the future. 

I'm scared, and stressed, and more scared. What do I do? My parents say I am an adult now (I turn 18 in three months) and because of that they don't want to do anything because it's my life and they have no control. I think they will continue to let me live at home, but heck... I am scared, and this university stuff is eating me alive. How do I handle the stress? I've kinda resorted to creating an alternative Reddit account and asking for help from complete and utter strangers. I don't really have the money for counseling, and I do not want to go to counseling. 

lt;dr version:

[1] - Do I share that I am disabled?

[2] - How do I ""own up"" to the fact I didn't take any AP/IBs?

[3] - If I'm not accepted to Public Ivy, just go to community?

[4] - Affording it, how? 

[5] - How should I handle the stress?

This is overloaded, and I am sure I have more stuff to ask about... but it's 2 in morning and I have to ""wake up"" in 4 hours. So, if I cannot sleep (normal) I will respond. Otherwise, I'll view it in a couple of days when I have time. Also, THANK YOU FOR READING! Respond to a single part, or multiple, or don't even respond. I would, though, like help. Thanks, again...

The guy was like I don't know what to tell you. I don't have any solution for that. After pushing the guy trying to help me to ask other people we came up with a solution that I would connect my dishwasher water-in pipe with a y-tee and close the other end of the y-tee pipe. Now the dishwasher pipe fits perfectly on the y-tee pipe but the y-tee itself cant be connected to my faucet. So I am at the same place where I began. Please help me :(

I'm a 25 year old female that recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education from a prestigious university in the southern USA. I have decided that teaching in a public K-12 school isn't right for me for various reasons, and I would really like to return to school in a few years to get a Master's degree and pursue a career in higher education (admissions counseling, academic advising, or teaching at the college level). I love the university I went to and I want to work there--it would be great for me if I could get my foot in the door there and receive incentives toward my tuition when I do decide to start grad school, plus I need a job with steady, full time pay and regular hours. I've polished up my resume, written a bunch of cover letters, and sent in applications for several positions that I'm qualified for... and... nothing. No calls. No e-mails. Nothing. I've been a university grad since December and I'm still working the same damn dead end bartending job at a local restaurant that I've been at for over four years. Don't get me wrong--the owners, management, and my coworkers are wonderful, but I've had some really rough experiences with verbally abusive customers lately and it's mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting. I want and need a job where I'm treated like an intelligent, functional human being. On top of all this, my fiance and I are living together and struggling terribly with money. He works a full-time job as an electrician's apprentice and is currently working toward getting his journeyman's license. I get asked all the time when we're getting married and I respond with the same answer--""I don't know."" I really don't. We can't afford it and I'm so beyond embarrassed to explain that to everyone around me.

I feel like I'm frozen in place and watching everyone around me, all of my friends and colleagues, moving on and starting careers, getting married, buying homes, and living their dreams... and I'm just falling further behind. I'm such a loser. :( I've struggled with pretty severe depression for years and it feels like I'm in the deepest, darkest hole I've ever been in. I don't know what to do anymore... I need some help, some encouragement, some advice. Anything.

Hi guys, I'm about to graduate my undergraduate course at University at the end of this year and am expected to go pursue a full time job. 

Specifically, I study economics and my grades are decent (above average). On top of that, I've had a lot of work experience over the years at a lot of places and my resume is quite competitive. I have a lot of money saved up and I recently traveled internationally as well. My parents will soon be able to retire, thanks to the housing situation and absurd capital gains that they were lucky to catch from our house. 



AKA, my life is good. I spend a lot of time being thankful for the opportunity and situation I am in as I do recognize that a lot of people would kill for this life.

That being said, the work culture in recent graduates / business students in Australia is something that I can't resonate with at any level. 

As soon as I graduate, I'm expected to get a job in a financial services or any other big industry firm and build my career there for the next 40 years, culminating in a hopeful retirement by the ripe age of 65. I'm not hating on this life path as I can recognize the security and financial stability it offers, as well as other merits associated with paid leave, social status and etc. 

I worked at a bank for 10 months in order to land some industry experience and as a result, I have decided that it's an industry where I do not want to spend my career in. I loved the people and my team and I was very good at this job, but I still hated it (when considering the long term).

Can someone whose been in a similar situation give me some advice? I have immense pressure from everyone around me, friends, family, even people I barely know but I work or interact with, to follow this trajectory.

Thanks for reading :)

85,"I found out today that my sister was recently bullied to the point of tears. I was literally shaking with anger. The group of girls that bullied her are renowned for being particularly bitchy and bratty girls. My sister is 11, the bullies in question are 13-14. Some of her friends are also reluctant to talk to her now.

I'm a recent graduate of the school. I always promised my parents that I would nip any hint of bullying in the bud (and then some) when it came to my sister. Unfortunately, we were only in school together for a short amount of time. I've never wished to be in high school again more than now. 

My parents aren't doing anything. They're proponents of ""being the bigger person,"" ""forgive and forget,"" etc. While I certainly agree, that doesn't do anything about the actual bullying. It WILL continue. And... I mean, just because my sister should be the bigger person doesn't mean I need to be. I'm in full big sibling mode and I'm fucking pissed. This school is notorious for sweeping bullying under the rug (especially for the wealthier students). I'm highly considering taking it up with the principal, a former teacher (we're still close and talk often), the dean of students, the girls' parents - whoever it takes for this to stop. I'm not confident it'll work, though, from past experience. If my parents won't do anything, I will. It's taking every fiber of my being not to go and make those girls' lives a living hell. I still don't know if I've talked myself out of it. What should I do?",11Aug2017,28

I was an emotional trash to a whine ego. I thought the dude notices that how he acted with me but through the years nothing happened. Than i started to notice my problems and still nothing changed.

I had many BIG reasons to just stand up and end our friendship years ago. But i didnt...i was a friend. Than i wanted to end this for a year when ive been mistreated and he started a fight with no reason. After when i had to beg for mercy (before i had to beg several times) i said this was the last time when i beg for my best friend without a reason. No, there was 4 more times when i did it. In the last year he intentionally generated drama every now and than but only with me. Acted out on petty things but a had enough a week ago. Wrote to him and thats it. Enough. He wrote 74 messages i think he beg (he thinks begging is good because he likes me to beg) but i dont want to read it and dont want any explonation after 10 years. Dont want anything from him.

But i feeling very bad. I contacted a local psychologist who just wrote ""I should have done this for years, you are very tolerant."" Thats it. I still dont feel very good because i have no friends now, no connection. I had only that toxic friendship. But he has a ton of friends and this is why i feel anger and nervousness. I will miss them, miss the new years eve partyes, the people...im very scared.

(Im not english, my grammar may be horrible)",11Aug2017,1
96,"TL DR: I could use photoshop to fake an unimportant course on my high school transcript






It is 4 in the morning for me so I apologize for any grammar errors. 




Long story short, I'm 18 right now and my whole life is depending on me going to college in September. Unfortunately in the second-last semester of high school my foster parents disown my older sister, threatened to kick me out, I discovered some memories of maybe sexual abuse from my birth mother and ghosted her, some other stuff happened, and then I got depressed. I then discovered that I only needed to take english to finish high school so I started an online course and pledged I was going to move out of my foster parent's house and (maybe) never speak to them again. 




Whelp it turns out that being depressed makes it really difficult to get stuff done. I am only 3/4 of the way done the course (I've gotten a job and wasted a lot of time at home but never moved out). The college I wanted to go to just sent me an email asking for me to scan an official high school transcript showing that I completed english 12 with at least a ""C"" by the 14. I am could write the final English exam on the 14th if I completed the rest of the course before then (which doesn't look too good based on my track record). Even if I write on the 14th I doubt that the college will extend the deadline for me.




Thankfully, the three years of Information technology I took in high school might finally pay off. One of my favourite parts of those courses was the units on photoshop (we used a program called gimp 2). The college wants me to scan a transcript and email it to them. I loved messing around with photoshop and am good enough to edit my transcript to show that I completed english. See where I'm getting at here?





The course itself is engineering. Had I not gotten depressed I would have chosen to go to a university instead but I am going to take a bridge program and finish my degree at an University. I have about $10,000 CAD saved up and can get my tuition paid for since I'm a foster kid. I'm in Canada if that matters. The argument that I won't be really for this course unless I finish English 12 doesn't work cause I can still finish the course, just not before the 14th.





I want to cheat, and I think I'm going to. You guy might be thinking ""*it's ok to wait a few year before going to college, I went when I was 23*"" but that just isn't possible for me. I don't want to work minimum wage full time for another 4 months. I don't want to admit to my foster parent that i've been lying to them and never really finished high school. I don't want to get depressed again because I've failed at the one thing I've spent the past 12 years working towards. And I don't want to finish college 4 months after I otherwise would, delaying my opportunity to leave this city and move to Europe. I want to move on with my life.

98,"I've been working at my current job for nearly a year now. I'm the office manager at a small upholstery shop. It was previously owned by a family friend and so I was fortunate to pick up the job after she sold it to new owners in August 2016 following 3 months of unemployment. The new owners are a husband and wife duo and new to owning a business. They are still working out the kinks and between her driftyness and his being away in Afghanastan (he left a few months ago in order to bring in more money to run the shop), I've had to do more than the pay is worth. They have struggled to pay bills and pay employees so their solution was for him yo continue to work at a higher paying job half way across the world. I've been asked to wait several days to get paid. Did that once, never again. She is very vocal about me ""never leaving her"" and how much I help them run the business.
I was recently told by my mother, childhood friend of the former owner, that they owe her $10,000 (the former owner still owns the building and rents it to the new owners). I know they've stuggled to pay rent in the past and I don't know much about their financial situation. Not sure if the allegations are true, but even if it's not that's not a good sign. 
I live with pretty severe anxiety and this job has given me a calm and comfrtoable environment to work within. I enjoy meeting the clients and working creatively, but I'm living paycheck to paycheck.

100,"I just moved into a lovely new place with my boyfriend. It's an area with a lot of older folk but whatever, you know? This all happened just hours ago. An old friend of my bfs is over and they're up late talking on the patio when this woman walking her dog comes and greets. They let her in and I'm woken up by my dog. So I get outside too and kinda talk with them.

So this lady is 60 and that's dandy. She obviously had a bit of the ""I'm older so I know more than you"" thing going on, specifically at me (Im 20, bf & friend are 28/29). She tried to explain morning wood to me for some reason? She kept bringing up her age and how she knows a lot of stuff. But I was indifferent, I understand there's always small aspects I won't like about others.

She also hates the rest of our neighbors, calling them judgmental. She claims to be judgement free but hates that them ""blacks"" pull the ""black card"". Uuugghhh.

But I swear, I didn't turn the conversation around to mention a personal experience any more than the other 3 people. I swear this woman talked about herself quite a bit, and my boyfriend talks about him a lot but that's great because it's always interesting things to say. But you know what? While the bf and his friend were discussing something, I went to tell her something related to the subject, she interrupts and tells me I'm full of myself.

I responded, dumbfounded, ""Huh?""

""You're constantly turning our conversations around to be about you. You are self-absorbed and it's his time to talk.""

I really didn't know what to say. They're all three a little drunk, I was the only sober one. Neither of the others heard it. I just said okay and just kinda left and went to bed.

I should probably include we all shared that we had many troubles in our lives and this woman tells us she has no friends. She seemed flirty with bfs friend and seemed to be more interested in what the guys had to say. Maybe it's because she's lonely? She also mentioned that she didn't like girl hate but maybe there was a little ""I'm the better bitch"" sorta situation?

We already had mentioned to her that she's welcome over before that but I probably shouldn't slam the door in her face. I already wasn't fond of the idea of an old lady coming over and flaunting her age to all my friends while probably willing to prowl on some of them.

I was in the cafeteria today, drinking some tea when my friend when my friend accidentally knocked it out of my hands while taking out his wallet (place was pretty crowded) and the tea got all over my shirt, face and pants. I swear to God, I've never been so mad in my entire life. 

I took his backpack and tossed it down the stairs. I have no idea why but it was the only way I felt I could blow off some steam without actually punching him in the face. 

As soon as I did this I felt an intense guilt. I immediately went and apologized profusely and patched things up with him, so our friendship is safe. 

The thing is, I still feel really bad about doing this because it genuinely was an accident even though he said he'd forgiven me. I was also very scared of the pure rage I felt at that moment. I started cussing out loud and wasn't thinking straight.

I've known that I've had issues with anger management in the past but I've never had a reaction this intense to anything. I'm scared I might do something I'll regret (like throwing his backpack but worse) if I don't learn how to control this.

107,"So recently I've had a nasty falling out with a friend and I made it worse in various ways. However with time, I was able to write an apology and really see where I went wrong, and she forgave me. I don't think we are friends but at least we are on neutral terms, based on the positive response to my letter. I'm hoping that eventually we can start talking again. However, I'm scared of screwing up again. So I came up with an idea:

Pen pals! I find it would be a good way to slowly restart communication, preventing things from going too fast and breaking again, because me talking too much  about my problems caused this mess. The fact that it would be slow, spaced out communication would make it more likely that we would talk about random stuff rather than our problems. She wouldn't be a surrogate therapist anymore, but just a person to shoot the shit with here and there. I find that the fact that I'm moving away makes it even better, we can talk about what is going on in our respective areas.

I dunno, it sounds like a good idea to me but maybe it isn't. What do you think? Also, how do I bring this up without sounding too pushy/needy? I'm thinking of waiting a couple weeks and then asking her.",11Aug2017,2

I use a calm voice when I notice she's in those ""moods"" but she often shouts at me.

Whenever she's angry at our parents, she always seems to release her anger towards them ON ME.
I'm so tired of this. I often let her be and just stay quiet. But really, I cannot stand being her emotional punching bag.

Cause often, when our parents don't do or give her what she wants, she ALWAYS SOMEHOW BLAMES IT ON ME. that somehow I was the one who made our parents not give her what she wants. Which is fucking insane. Cause i didn't do any fucking thing.

I had all sisters and he is an only child so we bonded over boy/guy stuff (we are both 33). Our dad's were brothers, his dad (my uncle) passed 10 years ago.

He isn't adopted, his mother (my aunt) and my mother were pregnant together and gave birth in the same hospital. The options are insemination, rape or a NPE (Non-Paternal Event, basically mom lied).

I'm sorry for any errors, i do not post on reddit very often.

I currently live in an apartment complex in the middle Tennessee area. My central air conditioning unit went out about a month ago. For the first two days it was 90 degrees in my apartment even with the windows open. Eventually the apartment gave us a window unit that it is the spare bedroom of my apartment and that has been the end of the repairs even though during he day it is still 80 degrees in my apartment. I have gone down to the office several times, I've called them, maintenance will come in every now and then maybe once a week to ""fix it"" and then leave and I never hear from them about it for at least another week. They don't really seem to care.

I've talked to other residents and they are having the same problem getting things fixed. A girl even told me that there is mold growing in her apartment because they won't fix her dishwasher properly.

Does anyone know if there is anything I can do to get my a/c fixed? The window unit is very expensive comparatively to central air and I'm pretty tight on expenses.

125,"So basically this guy on YouTube won't stop being a child.  He keeps using foul language and tries his best to roast me.  It's actually starting to get hurtful.  I'll give you guys the last thing he said (warning, there's bad language):



""German_shepherd_dog wow was that supposed to hurt nigga ?!? I'm sure a lot of men and adults play Kirby and they are NOT being called a fucking ""child"" by some butthurt nigga like you. So what if I still like Kirby and dedede what about you? I bet you watch Dora and nobody talks about you do they? So you're basically we're back in this judging people shit. dude if you're gonna be a fucking retard at least do it right because...seriously name nitpicking and judging people when you fucking play shit dog simulators and subscribe to fucking retarded meme channels and boy I thought I was the sadistic lunatic here! You also listen to fucking old ass rock bands from the damn 1960s BRUH your fucking weak and fucking useless so take your shriveled prick between your damn legs and fuck right on off with that poor kitty cat shit you autistic crippling nutless sack of inbred shit.﻿""

That's what the guy said.  His account is MEATY GUY.  I dunno why he has to be like that.  My account is German_shepherd_dog.  What he said was uncalled for.  This is another thing he said:

""German_shepherd_dog tell me kid do you know where I live do you know my real name and do you know how old I am? No you don't but I'm sure your a sad kid triggered because he did not get his bottle or his nap﻿""

I have no idea what to say to him.  I really want to shut him up.  It's starting to get hurtful.

What I'm asking for here is what to say to this guy.  I don't really want to curse back.  I just want to make him be quiet.  I need a really good comeback.  That's all I want.  Please help me, any help is greatly appreciated!

127,"     I am a 19 year old male going into my sophomore year of college. I have a friend, who is 18, who is going into her freshman year of college, at the same college as me. She is currently one of my best friends, we hang out quite a bit and get along really well. Over the past several months, I've been developing feelings for her, and recently the feelings have grown pretty strong. However, she is currently in a relationship with a guy who is also a friend of mine, but he is still in high school. Whenever her and I hang out, she constantly complains to me about all the shitty things her current boyfriend does, and how is immature and doesn't treat her right. I've talked with other close friends, and they seem to think she may be developing feelings for me too. I think once this school year starts, and she moves away to college, her and the current boyfriend will break up, which I've been hoping will leave room for me to come in and hopefully start up a relationship. My feelings are pretty strong, and she's been all I can think about over the past few months. 
     The weird thing is, last night, I had a dream about one of my other friends from college. She's gorgeous but I never thought of her as a possibility for me. The dream wasn't sexual. It was a dream that we were dating. We kissed a few times and exchanged some smiles but that's it.
     I'm really confused. Why am I so interested in this one girl, but had a dream about one I've never given thought to before?",11Aug2017,0
128,"I'm not sure if this is of any interest, but I just got home from work and there was another note on my door. This time, she requested that I come clean her patio and patio furniture. She believes that the dirt and sticks on her property are being dropped from my balcony. Here's the thing, ever since she first complained about my plants, I haven't used my balcony. There's a chair on it. That's all that's been there for almost 9 months. Behind us is a little bit of wooded area, and it's been raining here and very windy, blowing crap all over the common area where the balconies and patios overlook. I don't know why that wouldn't come to her mind when she discovered the sticks and debris....

 I'm going to the police station today to see what they can do for me. If there's any interest, I'll post an update afterwards.

EDIT: I apologise for not linking the original thread, I honestly didn't think this was interesting enough to get responses! I spoke to management yesterday and filed a complaint. They told me she is absolutely out of line and that contacting neighbors via notes taped to doors is not allowed. Neither is telling me what I can and can't do inside my apartment. Also, I should have clarified, I'm a paramedic and I see police officers quite a bit at work. I was planning on asking one of them while at work for advice, not bugging the police station. My bad for any confusion. I'm happy to report, however, that I've placed my red ""ghetto"" curtains back up, put my plants back outside, and am peeing as loud as I want.

I've been looking for full-time work, applying for jobs every single day. I received a really positive call back this morning and was told that so far I'm a top applicant. I was so incredibly happy but then she told me that the position doesn't start until October. I felt like laughing in pain haha.. I just can't wait that long, I don't want to get kicked out of my place.. I don't want the sheriff to turn up to my place because of how late I am on bills. I'm terrified. 

Please just any advice or reassurance and if anyone has any ideas on how I can make a bit of money ASAP that would be wonderful. 

And even ideas on some jobs that might be available (like something online etc), my work experience includes 5 years in retail customer service, I have a diploma in science and photography.

131,"Basically, there were many things wrong with her boyfriend and after hearing about it all I relunctantly suggested breaking up. I didn’t want to because she is my friend and I didn’t want to hurt her but I knew in my heart I had to. She did it today. The boyfriend was surprisingly cooperative which helped. Once she was done she was talking about wanting to cry and just feeling like shit. She then said she didn’t want to talk to talk anymore. I just said that’s fine just don’t do anything bad (like self harming or anything like that). She said she’ll try but I don’t feel confident in her answer and I’m concerned that she may do something. What should I do?

132,"ok so I just got a job (my first job ever) and it's at a pizza place down the street. I start off training by learning how to use the computer, answering phones, and just cleaning. My boss immediately told me two girls quit and his main girl is going on vacation so I have to learn everything in less than a week. Keep in mind the person who is training me got constant training for one month straight, and so did every worker. I have anxiety and I'm so nervous to always go and my friend who trains me is kinda getting annoyed I don't know everything yet (I've had two shifts, both for 2hrs) and I feel like everyone's constantly watching me. Idk if I'm posting this for advice or just to rant, but everyone's telling me I'll get used to it but that's because they had over a month of constant training, not 3 shifts and I'm on my own. Oh yeah he put me on the schedule by myself on Tuesday without the person who trains me, like seriously?? ",11Aug2017,2
133,"Ok so my best friend is a guy who I am head over heels in love with.  We met about 5 years ago at work and became friends almost instantly.  He ended up going back to his old job, but would walk over and take breaks/lunch with me.  After about a year, he got me a job with him.  We worked side by side as BFFs for 4 years, but he recently left our work to take a promotion elsewhere.

 

When we met we were both in shitty long term relationships, which ended shortly after we met and became BFFs.  I was in a DV relationship that I have a 7 yr old from, and his ex was just a loser who couldn't handle any responsibilities and wanted to party all the time.

 

Since we became BFFs neither of us have dated anyone seriously.  I don't think he's actually dated anyone (he's never mentioned dating anyone at all even casually), and I dated two guys briefly.  I broke up with both because they were jealous of my friendship with BFF. 

 

So our friendship has always come very easy, he hangs out with me and my kid and he's smart and funny.  Even when we worked together 8hrs a day we would still go home and talk on the phone for 2+ hours.  We have hung out a few times outside of work but we have never been intimate in any way.  I think we hugged like once and now that I'm thinking about it, we don't really have any physical contact ever. We talk about maybe one day getting a house together and what we would want it to be like.  Everyone at my job has always thought and continues to think we have a secret romance/relationship.  We have also never had a real fight. I don't think we could, I've been pissed with him but that's it.  He makes me a better person and I feel like I'll never have something real with anyone if he's my BFF,  I would put him before anyone.  

 

I've tried to test the waters to see if he might feel something for me, but I can't gauge it so to me that means he's not interested.  I have never loved anyone the way I love this kid.  I think about how great of a life we could have together, sometimes I even dream we're a couple and I'm so happy.  When I have those dreams and wake up, I'm sad that it hasn't happened. 

 

My question is, should I tell him how I feel?  I used to use the excuse of we worked together and it would be inappropriate but that's not the case anymore. I'm afraid if I tell him and he doesn't feel the same way it might make it awkward and I could ruin our friendship.  He's been my rock through everything (and it has not been an easy 6 years) and I am terrified to lose him if he doesn't feel that way.  Even if he didn't feel super awkward and bail, I don't think I could continue to have him in my life knowing he doesn't feel the same way. So here I am, treading water for 4 years wondering what the hell I should do.  Tell him and face the music or keep things the way they are and feel blessed at what we do have?

 

If you think I should tell him, how do I do it?

135,"I have always had issues with insecurity that have been getting in the way of life. I have always been a little overweight and in high school my ""friends"" would always point this out on a daily basis and because of this I never had the courage to talk to girls and develop the necessary social skills I need today. I am 24 and have never gotten a phone number. I actively started to work on the weight problem two years ago when I met someone and fell in love with her. I went from 327lbs with no muscle to 198 with a decent build but I still have work to do. I do morning cardio a half hour a day before breakfast and lift for 45 minutes to an hour 7 days a week (some days being less intense to get rest and promote growth). Recently I approached the woman I fell in love with and was not only shot down but she ended up ending the friendship as a whole when I confessed my feelings. I know I didnt do anything wrong by approaching her and it is better that I got that out of my system now instead of focusing on her for any longer than I have, but when it happened all I could think about was how I went wrong. I have been rejected like this every single time I ever approached someone. I've never even gotten as far as asking someone on a date because they all tell me bluntly they arent interested in me before I get the chance. I want to grow from this experience and not just sit back and take it. I want to be able to take a rejection and know that there is something wrong with them and not me. I want to be able to look at the other guy who asked her out and not compare myself to him. I'm strong enough to overcome these thoughts but its hard with no family and my only friends only being available one day a week because they all work nights and I'm in school. I live alone and most of the time I just sleep when I have nothing to do because I'm broke, have no one to interact with, and my hobbies are leading me no where in life. I used to sit around and game all day but that only left me where I am now. I want to move forward and be the confident and responsible man I know I can be so I can start a family someday.

I've recently decided to go back to college and planned to spend the next year saving most of my take home pay to pay for it.

However, an HR hourly position has opened up that I feel I would be good at and these positions don't open up very often. It's also in a location closer to my home. My cut in take home pay would be about $300-400. I'm very back and forth on what I should do.

Every morning, he will have a croissant at his desk, or a sandwich and then go back to working on his computer without washing his hands for hours afterwards. 

In a discussion with another colleague and me, he admitted to not showering more than once a week. He goes to the gym three times a week and has long-ish hair, so I was more than just a little grossed out at this point. Used tissues regularly fall out of his pockets when he has the flu, and he will sometimes come to the office smelling horribly like sweat. 

A few days ago, he got gum and started chewing it with his mouth wide open, so I plugged my earphones in to ignore it. But then when we went to the kitchen after a meeting, he saw some chips on the table. He spat the gum in his hand, and started to munch on the chips. And then to my horror, I noticed he was playing with the gum in his hand the entire time, rolling it and squishing it between his fingers. When he was done with the chips, he threw the gum back in his mouth and went back to his desk.

I can't stand this anymore, it's gotten to the point where I refuse to touch whatever he's touched before, or even get close to him. I don't know if others noticed, I've never heard anyone say anything about it (and people in my office gossip a LOT).

142,"I live in Philadelphia, PA next door to an elderly couple. The husband (T) is 75 years old and the wife (A) is 80+. Neither of them know a thing about cable or the internet which is where this problem started. Yesterday as I'm walking into my apartment (T) stopped me to ask if I could help him with his cable. He tells me that a few weeks ago two Verizon salesmen came to his door and convinced him to switch from Comcast to Verizon. They led him to believe that Comcast was charging him more than Verizon would so of course he made the switch. Now that the first bill is due, (T) is realizing that Verizon is charging him around $300 a month for their ""Double Play Package."" I looked up their pricing online and it says the Double Play should only be around $70 a month. This is where it gets crazy though. I go into his apartment to see if maybe I can help some way and they don't even own a router, modem, or computer. They have a [big screen tube TV](http://www.list4all.com/www3/freddiedl/rev-1310331160/23-1.jpg) that still works but I'm not sure if you'd even be able to get the premium channels on that TV like (T) wants. Somehow these Verizon salesmen saw this situation and still decided to sign them up for a package deal. From my understanding you can only get bundled deals through Verizon now so no matter what option they choose, they would be receiving some type of internet service.

158,"I have been a brother for one year. 

It was a long term serious relationship. She took my virginity and we were in love. At least I thought so. We broke up because my ""best friend"" from high school came between us. Long story but she turned into a whore. When we broke up I told her to please stay away from my Fraternity. Not to be fucking anyone in my fraternity or my friends. She done the exact opposite. 

One of my brothers fucked around with my ex after 5 days of the breakup. Let's call this guy Bob. I was always conscious of Bob in the relationship and I thought he liked my ex. One night we was all smoking and he told me ""If you wasn't here man I'd have to take your place, we all love you dude"". He was talking about taking my place with my ex girlfriend. When I told my girlfriend she acted like it didn't matter and he didn't mean it like that. After that was all over I found out they made out and he came over to my place to apologize and gave me ""the secret gesture"". Basically swearing on the fraternity that it wouldn't happen again and that it was a mistake.


 One of my pledge brothers slept with my ex girlfriend a month later. I saw them at a party making out and tried to fight him but I was forced to leave. Another close brother of mine tried fucking her behind my back. He had tried to take a picture with her a week before and he told me that it wasn't nothing. He swore on my fraternity too. A week later they are fucking. 

That's 3 brothers and probably more. It's no brotherhood. A lot of my brothers have tried to mess around with her, and they know how it would affect me. My big brother has had nothing to do with me since my entire time in my chapter. He actually called me a bitch behind my back when I was upset over my breakup.

I'm fucking pissed off and disgusted. I loved my fraternity and my girlfriend but my fraternity is fucking shit and my ex girlfriend is a pathetic whore. She tried messaging me on GroupMe like 5 times and apologizing. I told her to go fuck herself. 

Everyone is in clicks and I only feel brotherhood with one other brother. It's just a group of assholes that are selfish. I want to drop but I am scared what will come after. Will I regret it? Will I not? I am tired of the party lifestyle. I don't care about money anymore. I want my grades up, I want to find myself.

159,"Something I've been asking myself for a long time.
TL;DR: I want to get my music out there, but people are either not very receptive or just fake about listening to it. (If you did read all of it though, I appreciate it a lot haha.)


I like what I write, but I can't bring myself to go to open mic nights and show it to people (even though I have a few times.) I just don't think it's worth it. Why would I want to put myself on a stage and vulnerably play my art for people to just sit and quietly judge? I might get a fake ""It's good, I like it"" from one or two people, but that's been about it.


Then I find myself asking, ""why did my favorite bands get themselves out there?"" Did they just want attention? Are they just better than me? Or did they just have a big enough ego to think that their music is reeeally good enough for people to go out of their way to show up at a crappy venue (pay for parking, wait in line, etc.) and pay money to listen to? Or do they just pressure their friends and family to come ""support"" them and think it's the same thing?


I'm very against the idea of going out and trying to ""sell"" myself and my music to people. Don't get me wrong, I do have that cliche pipe dream of one day playing in front of a big stage with a bunch of people, emotional fulfillment, yada yada yada. But I want people to decide for themselves that they like it, and WANT to go out of their way to show up at a shitty venue and pay money to listen to it. But it seems that if you want to get anywhere in the music business, you just have to sell, sell, sell yourself on social media and whatnot. I've seen countless bands that (honestly) aren't that good, and many people go to see them anyway. They just say ""they wanted me to come support them, and they're my good friends.""


That's my worst fear. To be stuck in this ""supportive"" bubble and have no idea that my music just isn't that good. Almost to the point where it's not even worth showing it to anyone. But I do want that fulfillment. I want that connection with people who like the kind of music that I like. I want people to honestly tell me the pros and cons of my music, like tasting wine. Because I'm such a big music fan(snob), that's what I LOVE to discuss with people.


 I guess I just want people to be real with me more. But they don't seem to want to. I guess it's just easier for them. But I AM confident enough to say that my music doesn't suck. Much like The Cure doesn't suck, just a sound that some people like and some don't. That's all I want. Any advice? REAL criticism? Even just a ""get over yourself and get out there!"" would be nice. Lol. ",11Aug2017,2
160,"I've always had a little bit of vaginal itching due to wearing panty liners. About a month ago I stopped wearing panty liners everyday after I told a physician assistant about it. My itching has intensified now as of the past week. I visited planned parenthood and they said it was due to an irritant like soap. (They tested me for infections so we had already ruled that out.) I was using a gentle unscented soap that was organic with no chemicals. The manufacturer says it's hypoallergenic. Since I have been washing down there more often than I was before, I think I might be having a reaction to the soap. I switched to honey pot feminine wash recently which is also organic and had no chemicals. (I just switched as of yesterday. I'm using the sensitive version. Also, the main reason why I use soaps and feminine washes is because I have issues with odor. If I use nothing I'll have a really bad odor.) Since I used to wear panty liners everyday, now I'm getting more exposure to the laundry detergent on my underwear. Planned parenthood gave me a sheet about irritants and laundry detergent is on the list. I bought a new detergent without chemicals and enzymes yesterday, I haven't used it yet. The urge to itch has become more intense. I've woken up in my sleep at night with the urge to itch at least 3 times this week. (I also get the urge to itch at least 3 times a day.) I used to resort to using a cold washcloth to make the itch go away but then that stopped working. I have a detachable massager shower head so, I've been using most powerful massage function to spray over the itch. That's the only thing that brings me relief and makes it go away. Most of the itching is concentrated on one side, the left side. The itching is on the left side of the vulva (labia minora) and the surrounding area.

162,"My lady and I had a good relationship. It could have been a lot better. I am American, she is Eastern European. I was traveling a lot for work when I met her and we hit it off. I feel though we enjoyed each others company our relationship never really took off. I would visit for a month at a time and then leave for 2 months due to work. We'd talk using varies methods but it's not the same as being together. Eventually my job changed and we broke up. I haven't quit thinking about her. I knew the dream was going to come to an end. I had the time to travel because of my job, it wasn't because I was free. I have dated many girls since then but again she's stayed in my mind and heart. Okay so back to the present. She messaged me, we talked a little bit, it was nice but, then she quit responding... OK so I quit writing. Then out the blue comes a message of missing me and apologies for wrongs etc... We talk a little, ok and then again she quits responding... Then again out the blue I get another slew of messages. We talk a little bit and then, poof, she popped smoke and gone again. Her birthday passed I wished her Happy Birthday. I don't know. Deal is in 16 months I am going to be free to do whatever I want... Financial Independence. I am a god fearing person and I been praying. I don't talk about this with anyone. So here I am))))) How would you react to this situation??????? Is it all negative?",11Aug2017,1
163,"First things first I don't feel any stress, depressed or any other emotion other than shock. I'm an overly positive and aggressive guy, I feel one and an other quite well. I do have confidence in myself and not overly. But something I do feel a lot, especially lately is shock and maybe false hope. So recently I pulled an all nighter to fix my schedule right, I don't feel any less to my energy than me wanting to sleep when I can possible, which was yesterday. Yesterday was big, I hadn't sleep, I was a bit paranoid about my phobia-water issues in the bathroom, my grandma comes in my room to tell me she's going to the hospital and said bye which was odd as hell, then my dad says he's going to go to the hospital with my granny, I just gave up on my family for a sec I thought  ""Dad you always make serious things so casual holy shit no wonder I don't feel stressed"". So then for the four hours I was just chilling in my room tryna not to sleep. My mom comes back and tells me to get dressed, we're gonna see grandma. I thought alright maybe it's a quick visit to like a doctors lounge there. So I put on my J's, look fresh because my grandma always loved it when I look and smell good, thought it was gonna be a fun day, how slightly wrong I was. We walk to the hospital and while we're inside I kept on having a serious deep thought like ""This was where I first ever started life"" and ""I'm walking with the same woman who gave me birth in the place where I was born"". It was just perplexing. Then after the while bs of waiting I walk to see my grandma laying on a bed with needles connected to her hand. I couldn't think at all. Seeing my grandma full of life and energy at a hospital, she's that tough that she can beat me in arm wrestling and actual wrestling. She's only 58 too, what the fuck is happening? When the doctors came they kept on asking her if she felt any pain in her chest, she said non at all. I asked her why she's here, she had a stroke apparently, she didn't really know that she had a real stroke either. Her doctors always said if she's feeling pain or any discomfort she should be taken to the emergency room. So that's happened, talked to her how she doesn't care at all about what's happening, if it happened, let it be happened. I just couldn't see my grandma at 58 laying at a hospital. She's borderline at the point of getting sugar problems so that's a thing. So I ate food, slept early and woke up at 3 am. Six hours of sleep, apparently I had a wet dream, yes I'm not afraid to confess, everyone has it atleast once, atleast I have good sexual strength. So it was also a great thing because I can see my grandma early in the morning, I just had to wait **SIX MORE HOURS**. I got dressed, woke my sister up and went. Decided to grab extra clothing for her for today. When we got to her room I wanted to instantly drop, she had a shit ton of wires to her chest and other limbs. So I grabbed a chair, she had no pain or problems so that's a definite yay. But she had to go to another hospital in the fucking foothills so that's a no. Me being the smart teen I know what was going on. She's getting her heart checked out and if there's a small blockage she's getting meds and coming home, if she has a full block she's getting stents, and *oh god* if she has multiple blockages she's getting cardiac surgery. I'm just feeling nervous if she's gonna make it out fine. I'm typically an emotional person, if I see someone cry I might cry, but I can control my tears. I make serious things sound less serious but this is something I couldn't do. She then grabs her stuff and gets on a chair to the truck or whatever it's called. Since she doesn't know English she needed my sister to come with her. I wish I could've helped but felt like a useless sack of shit. My sisters 25 and I'm just a teen. I couldn't come I think but I wanted to help out. Feels like I don't carry my weight of the family at all. My grandmother is sensitive so seeing her cry fore she's left also fucked with me. I'm just hoping it goes well with her, I just wanna sleep and see no one die yet. My grandpa is at work and it felt rather off telling him. Does stenting have a big risk factor? Or anything that's she's going through. My bet is she doesn't have to take surgery because she doesn't have that big of a problem. If she comes back doctor wants her to excersie and cut down on sugar. I could help her with that. My mom is having it the worst I think. Having her daughter and mother somewhere she doesn't know and only living life with minimal sleep everyday. I was never this positive in my life, after yesterday I commented how it was a fun adventure. It's just that all my childhood was with my grandmother and grandfather more than any other person I was ever with. I'm more than ever proud of my body and mind though. I can withstand a lot and still be positive and uplifting. Me and my grandma always puts others lives before ours. But I get jealous easily because of my pride.

170,"Hello, this is actually my first post here on Reddit so it's all a little new. Anyways, this is what I'm currently going through in life: 

I'm 18 years old, going on to become 19 in October. Ever since I could remember, my parents always have been smart with money. They have always been financially stable and had a comfortable life. They spent a lot of money when it came to education so that's kind of a big deal. I know a lot of families who struggle even sending kids to school so it never really hit me how spoiled I was until about a year ago? or it's been really really hitting me in the past 6 months or so. Technically, as of right now, my parents still are paying for a lot of my things. Tuition, car insurance, and mortgage. Only in the last 4 months or so I started paying for my own phone bill, medical/dental/vision insurance, gas, food, and just things I want. When I tell this to my friends, they tell me how lucky I am and that relying on them until I finish my 4 years of college is OK. They also say that if they were me, they would just not work at all and enjoy their school life. But I don't like that. I hate the fact that all these years, I have been relying on my parents for pretty much everything! So I started to work rigorously the last 6 months or so. First 2-3 months, I would only pay for gas and phone and spent the rest going out with my friends or buying what I wanted.  Now I've seriously started saving and being a lot more frugal with my money. My parents are actually telling me to not work so much but it makes me want to work even more when they mention that. They have even offered to pay for my gas, spending money (to go out with friends), food, clothes, and everything else as long as I finish college. I understand that they just want to see me succeed in life and become independent AFTER I get my degree but it actually makes me internally upset with myself when I know how dependent I still am on them. As of right now, I'm working three jobs and going to school full time. My personal goal currently is to save up 5k or more, get a used car, give back the car I was given to my parents so they can sell it off, and then start saving to move out. They also got upset when I mentioned I wanted to eventually move out before getting my degree and threatened that they would stop paying my own tuition, I just said ""so be it.""

P.s. My family also doesn't get financial aid, so they pay the full tuition out of their pocket. I have told them many, many times to let me go to community college and then to transfer to a 4 year but they refuse. I even offered to pay for the classes with my own money. I don't see the point of getting the same credits and education except you can save A LOT of money in the long run... ",11Aug2017,1

That's the side of her I see if I piss her off or do something she doesn't like, if I'm calm when she's pissed she'll get angrier. But now she's acting all perfect again and it makes me feel like I made all of it up. Like I convinced myself that she's horrible. Her and my sister bully everyone in the family, they change the subject when my nan says anything or they both try to control what I do with my life. My sister who is in her 20's still has tantrums and shoulder barges me if she's annoyed. My mum enables this because she's the 'golden child'. But when I try to fight back they say I'm acting like a victim and that my mum has gone through so much.

I have an amazing girlfriend who's taught me about budgeting and saving, I'm not hurting financially im getting by.  I live at home and my parents pay for groceries and no rent cause I do stuff around the acreage and the house( and they are amazing) So I guess that's the back story so my guidance I guess I'm looking for is to answer these questions 1. Right now the job I'm at I am a summer student (maintenance for apartments) but the year round people seem miserable and hate their jobs and all they talk about is money and I have a genuine fear that I end up working a job that I just hate and can't get out of it cause I don't have the money too 2. Next May my friends want to go travelling I went to Europe a few years ago with a couple buddies and it was amazing, however I could be a summer student for Bayer and get paid quite well and get my foot in the door with them for a job after my degree. So do I grind it with them all summer and not travel? Cause I've read lots of grinding stories which always pays off typically but often comes with regrets like not taking enough time to enjoy their youth. So I know this is such a first world problem but it's been on my mind for a while and I just want to look back one day and be like I did everything I wanted to with my life and look back with pride not regret. 

TL;DR 1. How do I not end up with a job I absolutely hate and get trapped in a cycle of working it and hating life 2. Do I grind my summers away for the next few years and build a career or travel with friends and enjoy my summers ",11Aug2017,1

But someone said to me that they only protect from minor things, AKA low grade hackers if the NSA turned up or FBI they will divulge everything they have on you where you live who you are your banking details ect.

188,"Boy, I'm sure nobody has ever posted this ol' chestnut to this subreddit before. Nonetheless, every situation is different and I'm grateful for any feedback. 

After college, I went a LONG time without finding stable employment. I started my own marketing strategies business with decent success, but it wasn't sustainable and the health insurance situation was becoming a nightmare, so I took a job a few months ago. I'm not crazy about the company but I needed stability, benefits, and enough of a salary to get out of my parent's house, so I did that. 

Three months in and it's incredibly clear that it's not a good fit. Most of the team is super friendly but my immediate supervisor and the president are a nightmare to work with (it's a small enough company that these are daily interactions). I was never trained as it 'wasn't my supervisor's style', so things have fallen through the cracks and it's blamed on my ignorance rather than my supervisor's failings to communicate his expectations. There's someone in the same job as me who began only a month early, and he receives heavily preferential treatment from the supervisor. In the three months I've been there, I've had the thought ""I hate this and I want to quit"" about half a dozen times, which can't be healthy. I thought it was just growing pains, but I'm almost feeling things get worse, so I think it's time. Three months is the end of my 'evaluation period' where either party can end the employment relationship relatively easily, so there's an obvious window here that's closing. 

I'm nervous about three things: 1) The gap in my resume, 2) My financial situation while I'm looking for a new gig, and 3) What those two weeks in between my notice and my departure look like. #3 sounds silly, but I have anxiety issues and really do like most of my coworkers, so the thought of having to sit in those staff meetings and work with them for two weeks after I announce I'm jumping ship is driving up my blood pressure.

My managers have all been notified for weeks, and at one point a sign had been put up saying that that was a blackout date for requests off. Problem: I had requested off since before that sign was posted. Bigger problem, they're saying that I more than likely will not be able to have that day off. Or any of that weekend off. They're requesting all hands. And final problem, which brings me to posting this, if I miss this, it's (by policy) automatic termination. This reunion will be the first in three years I would have made it to, if I go. What do I do?

194,"I'm worried that I am a horrible person and I'm ignorant to my effect on others.

I have depression/anxiety/blahblahblahnoonecares and I don't often get panic attacks, but when I do they tend to be pretty severe and last for a few hours and require me to have some form of supervision. I had one a couple of weeks ago, after I had snapped at some of my friends (we were all on a camping expedition with DofE-dreadful- and I was unable to continue due to health stuff) who were being what I took as insensitive by making remarks about how difficult the hike was and how I had it easy compared to them etc... Looking back on it I was probably taking it wrong...

After I immediately burst into tears and couldn't stop apologising for my demeanour. I felt/feel horrible. I tried to do everything for them after that (cleaning up dinner stuff) but the panicking made me dizzy to the point I couldn't see what I was doing and I ended up doing fuck all to help them after their hike. If my teacher hadn't seen it all happen and the state I was in I honestly would have tried to take my life again. She took my compass/scissors/other stuff I could've used and tried to calm me down, but my panic attacks tend to be psychotic in nature and I couldn't help what I was doing or saying...

Another girl, a kind of friend, came up to me and told me to stop apologising because I was stressing one of my other close friend out (who I snapped at) and that she was crying because of the stress. I felt worse and stupidly tried to apologise for annoying her but thankfully couldn't find her. 
Through the next few hours (while teachers weren't present) and the next couple of days I was consistently reminded by this girl to stop being apologetic/keep my emotions under control in order to stop stressing everyone else out. I felt hurt honestly, like I wasn't allowed to talk about how I felt because I wasn't as important.

What really upsets me is that I felt hurt. I feel horribly entitled about thinking that I matter/deserve to have a voice. I feel like a piece of shit because I panicked and stressed out my friend and somehow expected to be understood.

I'm sorry this doesn't make sense, I don't know how to explain things differently. I just feel so guilty for thinking I matter, and I feel like I need help in understanding why I was selfish/bad/horrible, because deep down I know I am, I just don't know what came over me by feeling entitled..

I'm friends online with a girl who has special needs. For some context, she's unable to live independently but can hold a written conversation with few issues. I am/was her only close friend and we used to message for several hours each day. She gets upset easily so I did everything I could to cheer her up. I put a ton of effort into the friendship.

I'm disabled with mental health issues (non-psychotic) and told her that I was feeling low around 3 weeks ago. Around that time, she dropped me like a stone. From messaging me near constantly to ignoring me for days at a time, and it's been like that ever since. She says she still wants to be friends and got upset at the thought of losing me for good... but she doesn't want to hear from me until she feels like talking, whenever that may be. It's been a week since we last spoke. This being at a time where I could really use a friend, just for the company.

I am aware that, with a lot of friendships, you don't talk constantly and you do just check in with each other as and when. I don't want to be some weird stalker-y friend and I've only tried sending her one message in the last week. But it's the sudden change in contact, the timing of it, the being ignored when she's clearly using Facebook, and the fact that I put so much effort into being a supportive friend when she needed it. I feel a bit used.

Her special needs makes it more of a conflict because I want to be understanding and I don't want her to lose her only friend - even though she's not talking to me! She has a history of pushing people away, apparently. 

This is upsetting me and causing me stress. So, what do I do? Do I try to get used to a friendship where I just don't hear from her that often, if at all, even though we were so close? Or do I gently end the friendship, risking upsetting her but allowing me to move on?",11Aug2017,1

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm having a serious problem with a senior tenant that I've rented one of my rooms to. I rented the room to him a few months ago and for the most part he was doing fine. 

Unfortunately, a few weeks ago he suffered a bad fall and I had to get him into the hospital. The doctors checked him out and said he was fine, and he ended up being sent back to my property. The issue now is that in the recent weeks his health has degenerated rapidly. He's having some major sight issues; becoming almost blind.He is in no condition to be living independently and on his own the way that he currently is. 

I've been discussing with the person who has been paying his rent for him about his condition, who is the only person he really has in terms of relation. This person refuses to help us in anyway, and I'm incredibly worried about his health. This man is currently living on his own, and if anything happens to him no one will know until we check up on him. Another problem is that he refuses to go, and specifically, stay at the hospital. 

In this circumstance, I feel like it would be the best to get him into a place where he can be adequately cared for as soon as possible. I'm afraid that he will experience another accident, and I don't want him to end up dead or seriously injured. 

Is there anyway that I could get him into another place to have him cared for? I want to make sure that he is in a safe place as soon as possible. 

Tl;dr: Senior is renting one of my rooms and he can't take care of himself, but he doesn't want to stay at a hospital. The only other person who can help that actually knows him doesn't want to help. I need to get him to a place that can take care of him before something serious happens.

TL:DR Can't feel anything and being at home sucks

Hey guys, I am 15(m) if that matters to you, I think I have depression. For years I haven't been able to feel anything , like at all. I felt no sadness or joy. I emotionally can't feel, I gain nothin from meeting a goal, or standard. I have hated living in my house for a while , but the only thing keeping me here is my online friends, cat , and my brother, and I don't even know if my online friends are my real friends. Today out of the blue, I just started crying and kept on crying for like 30 minutes, I'm still crying as we speak, and it doesn't help when my mother and father who are very religious try and help me with their religion which I believe is bs. And my father is emotionally abusive, he yells all the time, and is racist a bit, whenever I have my friends come over, he will say something, whenever my friend who is of Asian descent comes, he asked what type of dog he had for dinner, and all of that other racist shit. My mother tries to be nice and tries to help but it's all religiously charged, nothing except you're a child of god, etc. And on most days I can't even get out of bed without being yelled at I just want to sleep or stay in bed. I'm hardly able to get up at all. Guys please help me I don't know what to do.",11Aug2017,3
203,"I'm in a dilemma. I recently got hired at one of the bmw's in a very affluent area in sales. There's real good money to be made here. However this is my first "" 9-5"" and a job in an office environment, I feel totally out of place and immature.i only applied to any full time opening because I was scared of how I will provide for my daughter that's on the way. Just a few months ago I was working 20 hours max a week and going to school full time. I busted my *** for 2 1/2 years, should I go back to get my degree work part time and not let 2 1/2 years go down the drain?
I'm in an extremely good place right now as I look around and see most sales associates in late 20's minimum. This will be a gold mine for experience and building a resume and it's a place where leads are given to us, we do not have to wait outside in the hot sun for customers, however i want to finish what I started and at least ""enjoy"" my last months having no one to look after. Sounds selfish but it will only help me zone in on fatherhood once the baby is here. 

TL;DR: recently got a good job as client advisor at BMW as full time, versus being a full time student pursuing a degree in business. Found out I have a kid on the way so I dropped out. What is your advice? Young dad drop out and make money or go back and make your kid proud. Thanks ahead

209,"So I've asked this question everywhere else I can think of and still haven't gotten a decent answer. 

I sometimes house/dog sit for this elderly couple. It's usually 3 days to a week. I like to pack as light as possible (especially if it's just a 3 day weekend) but I really need help thinking of things to do while I'm there because I always get bored out of my mind. 

I bring my laptop, my phone and my DS. I'll always have a book to read plus a crossword puzzle or coloring book. This isn't ever enough though. I'm not much of a tv person but I'll sometimes watch a movie before bed if I'm in the mood. My days usually consist of watching YouTube, sometimes Netflix, playing video games and then reading before bed if I'm in the mood for it. 

I think my main problem is, since I'm not doing much of anything, I don't get tired until about 3am which just means more hours of boredom. Their house is always super clean so there's not much of that I'm able to do. 

I can't leave the house either. The reason I have to stay is because if the dogs are left alone they tear up the house. I take them outside and sometimes run around with them out there but I'm not allowed to walk them since they're so huge and I wouldn't be able to control one of them let alone two. 

People always say read a bunch, masturbate, take on a new hobby!! But I've been doing this for so long, I've already done all those things or they just don't occupy enough of my time.

I'm going to be there this weekend. I feel like I have a decent amount of things to do but would like just one or two more ideas. Especially to use for next time or when I end up having to stay for a week!",11Aug2017,1
210,I am 15. Several years ago I was in a bad spot and was not thinking clearly. I touched my 10 year old sisters breasts. I am worried she will figure out what I did and will ruin my life. What do I do?,11Aug2017,1
211,"I just turned 18 a couple of weeks ago and since I'm now legally old enough to gamble I decided to apply in some bookmaker stores. Long story short I got 2 jobs. One is the assistant manager position at Betfred. The pay is £6.80 an hour. They hired me knowing I had no experience as a manager and they are training me now. They also hired 6 other people to be assistant managers on the same day I got hired and the interview was very easy. I think they are not really bothered who they hire. I also got the job at Ladbrokes as the customer service manager for £9.50 an hour. This job is much better paying but it doesn't start until the 21st of august so in the mean time I'm working at betfred trying to get as much management experience as possible before I start the job I really want. I also think it will require more responsibility and skill which I do not have currently.

The thing is I'm very worried that I will be very unqualified for the ladbrokes job. I'm finding it quite difficult in betfred and I definitely don't feel like I'm the assistant manager there. The thing is they don't mind because they are still training me so nobody minds that I don't  know what I'm doing right now. I'm worried that at ladbrokes they will expect me to run the store and know what I'm doing when realistically I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm trying my best to get as much experience from betfred before I join ladbrokes but I think I will still be too inexperienced even by the 21st. For this reason I am planning to take a couple of days off to try out ladbrokes before I quit betfred just incase the job is too difficult for me.

What should I do? ",11Aug2017,1
213,"I basically ordered £23.50 worth of stuff from ASOS on 4 August and I selected Standard Delivery as the shipment method as I always do to avoid high charges that could be determined in possible customs. 

For standard delivery, asos parcels normally arrive in 4 weeks, being shipped by my local post. 

But this time, it (kind of) did in 6 days through DHL. 
I did receive the confirmation email from asos that they had shipped my order, but did not instantly click the tracking link. Basically, I got an email from DHL, the delivery schedule being on 10 August. I was surprised, but little did I know, I was expected to pay the customs plus DHL's processing fee for approx. £25*. LIKE WHAT??? My order is only £23.50. After being notified, I called them and refused the delivery and opened a dispute. *DHL's processing fee is about £8. 

In my country, CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) is used for calculating duties and any parcels worth more than ~£33 will face charges. So in other words, just using DHL or Fedex which usually seems 'expensive' to Customs Bureau could get you charged. 

In my case, I chose Standard Delivery which came free with my £23.50 order. I have contacted basically all of the three; asos, dhl, and customs bureau. 

Asos kept saying it is not their responsibility when it comes to customs. I mean I completely understand that, but come on, you sent me stuff that arrived in 6 days through dhl which seems very odd since I chose standard delivery. 

Dhl was actually the only one being cooperative and trying to help. They suggested me to open a dispute and gave me two options: after them contacting asos, have asos pay the customs or send back the order and I get a full refund from asos. Literally, dhl is my saviour. 

At this point, I am so frustrated with customs bureau for charging me £13 on a £23.50 parcel. I called them and they responded that it was because of the carrier that caused such high customs but I didn't even pay for it? It's not supposed to be considered as freight in? I'm not good at this kind of stuff but it seems so unfair especially the law clearly states I can have an order under £33 and not get customs charges.... 

I really don't know who is to blamed.... maybe it's my fault I don't wanna make a big deal out of my £23.50 order but gosh having to pay another £25 is just ridiculous. 

With this lengthy information/rant, what do you think?

217,"Hey there, never posted to this sub before.

I currently work as a hemodialysis technician. It's a relatively low-skilled medical job. I do not have a college degree, but I do have some college credits. I've been doing this for about 3 yearsish, and I recently moved to the city because of the security of this job. The pay isn't great at all, but it's better than probably most entry-level positions.. I assume. 

The problem here is that I really hate it, a lot. And you see a lot of people that work in these clinics that also hate it. There's a pretty high turnover rate, because you getting taken advantage of so much, and the pay just ends up not being worth it for a lot of people. Not to mention dialysis patients can be *rough.* 

The main issue here is that clinics are always understaffed because it's a corporation gig, and corporations really only care about turning a profit, so they spread everything as thinly as possible as well as penalize clinic managers for having ""too many workman hours."" 

I work long days. *long* days. 16-17 hours regularly, that start at 3:45AM and don't end until between 8-9PM. Then I have to be right back at the clinic by 3:45-4:00 AM all over again the very next morning. Causing me to only get 3-5 hours of sleep a night. 

Since we're understaffed, I'm still doing this type of schedule every week. I'll 5 days a week anyway, despite incredibly long days and no sleep.

I have anxiety and depression issues, I'm certain it's from my job (amongst other personal reasons). 

Here's the thing though. I live in Chicago, and it's relatively costly living expenses. So I sorta need this job, as well as this money I'm making. 

I've tried talking with the schedule person and having hours reduced or at least cause me to not have to work back-back days where I literally cannot get enough sleep, but I'm met with ""were understaffed, it won't always be like this!"" 

But it will. As soon as they hire someone, some will leave, because it's a guiltless exit at that point. Happens every time. 

I hate the medical field. This job made me hate it. So I don't exactly know what career I'd like to do, and this is where I start feeling utterly stuck. If I quit my job, I don't know what I'd replace it with, and if that replacement would be enough money. I'd be willing to sacrifice a few pleasures though, in exchange for a healthier sleeping schedule.

Also, I'll really miss having insurance because I have very regular visits to the doctor because I'm transgender. 

Sooo I don't exactly know what to do at this point. I want a career shift, but even for anything that I *might* want to do, I immediately convince myself I'll never have the time nor energy to work my way towards it. Not with this schedule, not with this job. I want to get back into school for something, preferably technology related, but I just know I won't be able to maintain that during these crazy work hours. 

I don't think I can survive without this job, or this pay, and I know I can't afford to go to school or boot camps on a lower salary. 

I just feel trapped, with no real way out. That's why I'm writing you all, in the hopes for ANY type of advice.

Thank you so much for reading, I'll cherish every response. ",11Aug2017,1
219,"I tracked down my biological dad who gave me up for adoption and his family 6 years ago.  Over the years I've tried to keep a good relationship and make an effort to spend quality time.

My bio dad is a severe alcoholic and very sick.  I first met up with him at his family gatherings so he didn't drink too much but was on medicine so was acting sickly.  Then I started visiting him where he lived (in a sailboat in a marina in fl).  He would take us to restaurants and order drinks (nbd) but would disappear on our visits for a couple hours at a time.  He was also showing a lot of symptoms which aroused a lot of sympathy from me.  Over the next few years his day drinking became less of a secret and his illnesses became more complex and mysterious.  He also had no reservations about bringing us around unsavory people.  Eventually we found out he was telling everyone he was moving in with us (without telling us).

He was causing problems for his ""friends"" (falling off his boat and needing to be rescued, going missing and being found passed out on the streets by the police, etc) so his friends started pressuring my wife and me to take responsibility for him.  We eventually met up with him again to have a talk about his situation.  We took him to a nice hotel and restaurant.  I got sick during dinner and had to leave, but my wife talked to him about how he needs to be in a place where he's not in danger and he lost his shit at her.  Apparently things got loud and he even made her cry.  After that happened, we kept our distance.

We moved back to the USA and I heard he moved out of his boat so I decided to give the relationship another go.  It turns out he lived only 2.5 hours away so I asked him to come up and visit.  That's when I really started to feel manipulated.  He couldn't make the trip because he got hospitalized.  One of his friends from his new town got my phone number and shared the bad news.  The lady seemed to be beating around the bush, and never directly asked me, but I feel like she was trying to soft-sell the idea of him moving in with me and my wife.

When he got out of the hospital, we decided to visit him in his town.  It was more of the same (hiding to drink even though he was day drinking in front of us, bringing us around unsavory characters, lots of complicated and mysterious ailments, inconveniencing strangers for passing out on the sidewalk).  The longer we spent with him, the more his symptoms became inconsistent.  We started to realize he was hamming some of his health problems up.  He called his friend and handed the phone to me.  She started again with indirectly suggesting that he moves in with us and because my wife is a doctor, said she was perfect to help him (she's a pathologist though).  We later took him to dinner at a place he liked to drink.  In front of this audience, he turned even more sick and couldn't walk up 2 steps to go to the bathroom (requiring the staff to jump to his aid) even though we were telling him to use the bathroom that was closer and not up 2 steps.  While he was in the bathroom the staff spoke to me and told me it was good that we were moving him into our house so he could finally get help(I guess that's what he was telling them) .  I responded with ""yeah we need to get him somewhere safe"".  I started to get mad that he was telling everyone he knew that he was moving into my house without asking me.  I later found that he was telling people how great of a relationship he and I always have had and never told anyone that he gave me up for adoption or that I only met him a few years ago after I tracked him down.

We went home and his friend continued to contact me.  It felt like she was ramping up her suggestive language that we take him in without ever saying it directly to me.  He and this lady had a very strange relationship.  She was married and I really doubt she had any attraction to him, but they were constantly on the phone with each other.  My hunch is he managed to play to her sympathies and she was trying to do the right thing, but just going about it the wrong way and not communicating like an adult.

I got in touch with his sister (my long lost aunt) and because of how big of a mess he was in, she got power of attorney and started looking for places to put him.  She was also sick so I was her eyes and legs to check out the places for her.  Bio-dad's friend started contacting my aunt, nit-picked every option we had (and our options were limited), tried to control the entire process, and spoke condescendingly to my aunt.  I still didn't understand this lady's goals.  We ignored the lady's input and picked the best possible place we could.

During this time, I was speaking to the medical staff who met me at each of the places I was scoping out.  I learned that he didn't actually have the diseases he was telling me about.  He had something else that was a definite problem, just not the things he'd been ""selling"" over the years.  He had such elaborate stories too.  This upset me.

I drove down there and packed his stuff up and moved him to the new place (he was getting out of the hospital again and the transport guy refused to leave him without me being there).  He was pissed at his sister.  His friend was upset with both of us.  She contacted me about him owing her money so I told her to no longer contact me (I might have been overreacting but her communication style really stressed me out and her asking me for money was a little too fishy).

I let several months pass before getting back in contact.  I was mad about all the lies.  I felt bad for him but I wasn't going to be emotionally scammed.  During my avoidance, his lady friend emailed me this:

>The last thing you said to me was .... do not contact me anymore.
The problem is.... your ole dad, or Jim, is trying to call you and does not have your new number. He's getting weaker every day and to hear your voice would make him smile. If you have 5 minutes maybe you could find it in your heart to speak with him.

I had made a point of calling him by his name whenever she called him my ""dad"" so I guess she thought it was necessary to put both names in the email instead of just deleting her innocent mistake of calling him my dad.  The other problem with this email is that he had all of my phone numbers in his phone, and his caretaker also had all my phone numbers (I run a few business).  I still didn't call him because at this point I feel like he was trying to get her to feel sorry for him.  I replied to her email with:

>This is the last warning before I contact the police.  You are not allowed to contact me anymore.

I basically called his bluff and sure enough he called a month after that.  I answered the phone and assumed enough time had passed.  I told him I would make time to visit him soon where he was staying.  Shortly after, I get phone calls from his caretaker and his case worker to talk about him moving in with me.  Apparently, he told everyone he knew after our phone call that I was coming down to pick him up and all his things to move him into our house.  I told his caretaker that I wasn't doing that, and told her about how he gave me up for adoption and I only got in contact with him a few years ago.  She was unaware and was under the impression that he had a much bigger role in my upbringing.  She also said she wasn't surprised about the stories or his lies about his condition because she watches him do it with other people.  I was angry again.

He started calling all my phones continuously throughout the day for about a week (sometimes 5 in a row).  I eventually answered and said I wasn't answering the phone because I was upset with him.  I told him I didn't appreciate all the lies.  He said he didn't know what I was talking about and to ""enlighten"" him.  I got upset and told him that if he wasn't going to speak to me like a man and shoot straight with me then I would hang up the phone.  He still played innocent so I called him out.  I said I didn't like being manipulated, I didn't like being lied to, I didn't like he and his friends making plans for me and my house without consulting me, I didn't like how he treated my wife at the hotel, I didn't like being taken around questionable people.  I left out the lying about the ailments but I told him how I've spent my life trying to be a good person and do the right thing but I don't appreciate my kindness being taken advantage of.  I told him I would call him in a month because if I spoke to him any sooner, I might do something I would regret.  I've got about 18 days before I call him.  

Did I do the right thing?

1. wake up for work
2. work for 5 hours
3. come home and sit around the house, sometimes play video games, read a manga, watch something on Netflix, and work out a bit

That's all i've done for 2 years

I don't spend too much money, I pay for my car and phone but otherwise my parents pay everything. I like deposit most of my money into savings and have a good chunk of change saved up. Sound fine right? Well....

I haven't had any friends since highschool, most of my social interactions are on Discord. I've also never had a girlfriend.

I really want to get out of this rut in my life. I feel like I'm not even really making myself better. The thing is, I don't know WHAT I want to do at all and HOW I should go about finding out. It's a bit hard to share with people also, being how I only have 1 real life friend that hardly wants anything to do with me.

I do have goals though, I kind of enjoy my quiet life but I want to feel like I'm growing up at the same time

1. I want to move out, this will be after I find out the career I want and how to pursue it
2. I want to make friends,I think this will be easy if I go to a college, other than that I have no clue.
3.I want a girlfriend I feel like I can share anything with.

So how do I go about doing this? I don't think I am depressed, I try to keep a positive attitude most of the time.

230,"I really need some advice. So please, anything could be helpful. I'm just going to tell the whole story, because really I think that is the best thing to do, so I apologize in advance for the length.

I just graduated university with a BFA. I just recently moved home, surprise, surprise. I actually had a job working for a gallery lined up in Dallas, but my family convinced me I shouldn't take it or move there because the pay was so low ($9 and hour) and I didn't know anyone in Dallas. So I opted out.

Now I work for my parents at their newspaper. I've been working there for about three weeks now. My dad is teaching me graphic design which is cool. But other than that there is no relation to my career.

(Full disclosure, living with my parents is not the best thing ever. They pretty much expect you to pay your rent in labor, which means chores, yard work and looking after their 8 pitt-bull lab mix dogs (yes they have that many). It's not as bad as it used to be, but it's still not a picnic. Also since I don't have a vehicle, I'm pretty much stuck here. And by here, I mean out in the country. So yeah.)

Anyway, so, my aunt found out about me moving back in with my parents. See, I had told her I was moving to Dallas, and hadn't gotten around to telling her about moving home. When she found out about this, she offered me a place in Austin, where she lives. I would still have to pay rent, but still pretty cheap (around $520 a month). Plus I cold work for her as an accountant at her business until I find a job of my own.

I think being in Austin would be much better for me, since it would be a lot easier looking for work in a gallery or a museum (which is genuinely where I want to work), and it would be easier to submit my work to galleries. 

However, when I threw this idea to my parents, they were not happy about this plan at all. I guess they wanted me to work at the newspaper for a little longer. Plus my dad said something along the lines of me using him, and learning what he knows about graphic design.

What's more I'm not even sure if I should move to Austin right this minute. I don't even have a car yet. I think maybe I should get more financially secure before doing this. 

I guess the question I'm ambling up to is, should I just go ahead and move to Austin, or should I wait a little while longer until I'm more secure financially.

Thanks for all you help. :)

The other thing is too, I kind of get the feeling that they might need me at the paper. I don't know that for a fact, but considering how my parents reacted and the state of things at said paper, that's the vibe I certainly get.",11Aug2017,1
232,"So I am 15 years old and I am getting to that stage when I need to earn money. A few of my friends either have a job working for a business or working in the family. About 2 months ago I made a football (soccer) Instagram page around my favourite team, it got to 100 followers but then would not grow further. I still posted the same stuff and it just wasn't growing so I make the page inactive. Recently I have been drawing pictures of football (soccer) players and sold a few to my friends. However, I don't think many people in my school are interested in buying them. I really enjoy doing this and have fun making them. Also, I tried editing pictures which is something I enjoy when it goes right but I do get frustrated when things go wrong. I don't know what I should do, can someone help and give me advice. Suggestions appreciated, thank you.",11Aug2017,2
233,"It all started when I went on a business trip alone. I got bored and a little kinky in the hotel room and decided to record something for /r/gonewildaudio 

I had also included some photos of myself with the post. Today my son's teacher told me that he has been skipping his assignments and texting during class. After we got home, I took away his phone, xbox and computer privileges until he gets his shit back together. It's a little harsh but I feel I've been too lenient and it hasn't been working out. 

After he handed me his phone, I swiped the screen and it unlocked to my surprise. It was set to require password after 15 min and he must have just used it. I was curious and checked his browser history. I saw his reddit username which was already logged in. He commented on a few GWA posts, including mine. I even remember responding to them. He didn't know it was me and I didn't know it was him. 

He has also saved the pictures I had posted on his phone. I don't know how to handle this. Either I be honest and mentally fuck him up for life or I tell him to delete the pictures, in which case he may have a backup anyway. 

I'm free to post on reddit until his curfew is on. After that I'll be deleting this as well

234,"I have battled myself for too long on what I want to do for a career. I went to college right out of high school for real estate. Hated it. 

I decided to go back to college after 10 years of bartending and admin work and being a mom. I went part time and took a couple classes and aced them. It was hard but I enjoyed making my brain work again. 

Since then I have been racking my brain relentlessly to figure out that one degree that would be fulfilling and make me money! 

I've been through quite a few ideas because I'm into so many different things... 

I think I finally narrowed it down. I am very into being environmentally conscious. I love architecture and interior design. I walk around neighborhoods to check out houses and business all the time. I love going on home tours. I like creativity and hard work. I don't mind heavy lifting and getting my hands dirty. I also love love love animals, plants and the outdoors . 

I was thinking about sustainability and then I had an A-ha moment! Sustainable architecture, design and landscaping. 

I'm almost 34 and have no idea if it would worth me starting this collegiate path now. So I am asking for your advice, Reddit. What do you think I should do? If you have any experience in this field, what should my first steps be? Any advice, knowledge and opinions welcome!

Thank you all in advance! ",11Aug2017,1
235,"So I play three sports. Basketball, tennis, and volleyball. I'm the best at tennis and am almost guaranteed a spot at varsity is what the coach told me and I'll be a freshman next year. I'm keeping basketball too I have a good shot at JV. I love volleyball too I could probably make JV or freshman. I want to do all three but there are problems. Money, time, coaches, and parents. It's expensive to play all three but we can afford it with a surplus of money. My mom just got a huge promotion as well. Tennis and volleyball are in the same season which is time. Some coaches favor kids (including me) in some sports so the selection process and playing times can be questionable. My dad wants me to only do tennis and basketball. Tennis is my least favorite but I'm the best at it. I just don't enjoy tennis that much period. And when I loose I become even more upset because I could've been playing another sport instead. I will try to see if I can possibly do all three for high school but even if I can my dad will be pissed. My mom won't care. So what should I do. Should I try to do all three and see what happens (what I mostly want to do). Or should I drop a sport. That means quitting tennis(which I'm good at) or quitting volleyball(which I love). And will it make a difference in my collage application if it said JV volleyball instead of Varisty Tennis. The tennis team sucks (btw) so we won't have a championship win. I saw them play. If you need something clarified ask me.",11Aug2017,2
236,I'm interested in shaving off my pubic hair but I'm scared that a regular trimmer/shaver will cause harm. Do you recommend any models for under $30?,11Aug2017,2
238,"I would like to first start with saying that normally, I was never really a depressed person-I was comfortable and relaxed. Lately I do not even feel like myself. I am paranoid and scared to think about living another 50 or more years when my life is so hard already.

Problems: This past year I had 2 root canals done. Both teeth went rather close together. The one tooth never felt right after and it hurts and throbs when cold water hits it. The work done on those teeth sparked some crazy all around the mouth pain-hitting different teeth spontaneously. I've been dealing with this since May or so. I am taking trileptal to help calm the nerves (yes, I am aware it can cause depression-but I do not feel it is responsible for that).

So I am having mouth pain daily with no real solutions and opening up one of the root canal teeth could potentially set the hell raising pain off again, but worse. I am going away for a week with this issue and it has made me loathe going on vacation. I am nervous and not excited to go.

I moved this summer (very close to home but I still moved) and I am having a very difficult time adjusting. I do not feel like I am at home. I wake up feeling gross every day and I constantly have that feeling you get when you come home from vacation and nothing feels the same. It is unsettling and I am all up in my head about it. I like the independence but I do not like the feeling that I don't belong.

I am irritable lately and I go back to work after labor day. I am scared to go back with this pain and I am not ready to work -I have lost my drive. I get overwhelmingly upset when I think about my mom or my cat (even if they are right there).... sometimes I feel like my bf is a stranger to me and we have been together for several years. Eh, I cannot explain it. I don't feel right and everything feels so distant, yet its so close. 

How do I fix this? Even like meeting new people and enjoying conversation and recreational activities makes my skin crawl in an unsettling way (even though I am having a good time). Something feels off and it's making me feel weird. What is happening to me?",11Aug2017,1
239,"    Hello ---,

    Attached is my final presentation from last Friday in case you wanted to look it over. 

    Best,
    ---



I spend way too long trying to write good emails. Last week I gave my final presentation for my internship. My boss told me to send him some thing I worked on over the summer and shared in the final presentation.

I forgot what specific thing he asked for, and it’s been a week. I doubt he cares too much since I was just an intern. I thought by sending a general email containing my final presentation which has an overview of all possible things I worked on, that would suffice. Then, if he looks at the final presentation and sees the specific thing he requested and still wants, he can let me know.

Thoughts?
