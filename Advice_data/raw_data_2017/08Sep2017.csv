2," I just turned 21 in August. So I know I'm still young, but nonetheless I've done some rediculously stupid shit. I have had so many doors open for me in my life. I have only turned one down. But of all the open doors I have walked through, I have ruined all of them. I've had great jobs, opportunities, etc. I've burned all bridges, and I'm not entirely sure why. When I get a job I get so ecstatic. Like I'm finally going to make a change and succeed in life. Then some dumb shit will drive me insane and I'll start showing up late, calling out, or just quit. It's not about laziness. I know because I loving being busy, I'm addicted to success and hard work. 

I really want to succeed in life. I have my goals, I know how to achieve them, but for some reason I just ruin any chance to reach my goals. A lot of times when I look back, I can't remember why I did what I did. 

On top of my failure complex, the last two weeks has made me want to clock out on life. My fiance of three years told me she wants to just be ""dating"" and not get married. I broke my car key, got a flat (twice), and I installed the wrong headlights in my car, which melted the connectors. I also wasn't able to pay car insurance and I ended up selling my computer, keyboard, and mouse (my almost $1500 birthday gift to myself) to cover some (not all) of the issues above. It doesn't help that I get treated like a child because I make bad choices. I'm always getting yelled at, and if people aren't yelling, I'm getting advice for things I already know how to do. I'm not dumb,  I don't think at least.

I need advice on how to be an adult. I can't handle all of this shit. I feel like my failure complex is due to me being scared of putting everything I've got into something, and failing. It's a lot easier to deal with failure if you see it coming I guess. But that's a very vague guess, I literally have no idea why I do it. All I know is I'm tired of failing, and I'm tired of people treating me like trash. I need help.

3,"Hi all, as you can tell by the title, I'm in a bit of a problem regarding a friend. About a month ago, I was tweeting about Charlottesville as it was unfolding and news was coming out. My timeline was 90% of it, and I felt very angered and had a need to tweet it out, as you do. Well this friend, let's call him John, decided to DM me on twitter and share a bunch of tweets that are personally hot garbage alt right apologistic horse shit. I didn't want any of it, and told him I didn't agree with this and didn't want to hear it. If he didn't agree or want to listen, he could just mute me or unfollow me for a few hours. From here it was a huge fight. What should have been ""look, I don't exactly want to hear how we should respect Nazis opinions when they just murdered someone, please just mute me and stay in your lane"" turned into a full fledge argument, where he proceeded to dig himself in a bigger hole with each message, until he used the fact he was practiced and participated in Judaism when he was real young to justify him not being racist. Soft blocked him, because he pissed me off. 

About a week ago, he decides to message me again, saying that he didn't know that this would hurt our friendship, and that ""minor political differences"" shouldn't get in the way. I ignored it, because I was still upset. School starts up, and I learn something very interesting. John decides to tell the other people in our friend group about the situation. Except he's a huge massive liar and manipulator and has been telling them a ""woe is me"" version where I apparently attacked him online with my political belief, that I was essentially emotional gay communist, and that I did it partially because I hate his younger brother and friend, let's call this second friend Ben. I wasn't aware of this, but someone decided to tip me off and send screenshots of the chat. I was pissed, and he decides to text me (yesterday) with a half assed apology attempt, and then today he texts me alt right shit since I blocked him. 

Now at this point, I am doing everything in my self control not to just expose him with the messages and call his ass out. I'm pissed for a lot of reasons. The big one being he decided to not only turn my friends against me, but also try and manipulate me into apologizing and just ending this when he knows damn well he started it. I don't want to apologize. I want him to face the music and have what he said and did actually be held accountable against him, but I don't want to inflict actual physical harm.  

I don't know what to do in this situation. I want my friends back and I want John to be the one to deal with what he said, but I'm feeling like if I do confront him, it's just going to be people going after me for picking on the poor, helpless john. I would like some feedback, anything is really okay. 



tl;dr: friend is manipulating my friends after an argument to position himself as innocent, I want to know what I should do in this situation that isn't apologizing.

5,"So I moved in with my boyfriend with my cat Yuffie 6f after a couple weeks Yuffie still hadn't gotten okay with the move. Basically Yuffie is legally my cat I adopted her. But we moved in with my grandparents and she ran up stairs, hid in their closet, and I never saw her again unless I was letting her in from outside (if she would let me, most of the time it had to be my grandma) or upstairs in their room. She basically said screw you I like this room more and because of that adopted my grandparents. Now though, my grandparents are moving (and with their own pets reached pet limit in their retirement community) so I had to take Yuffie and that was about 2 months ago. My boyfriend and i thought Yuffie was lonely so we adopted this sweet little tortie kitten 4months and named her eclipse that was 2.5 almost 3 weeks ago now. We introduced slowly switching out beddings and such and then big rooms just kinda left the doors open keeping watch. Thought things would be okay they were sniffing and then cue cat fight number one, and just the other night about a week or so after the first fight, they were in the same room. ""Great!"" I think cause they were just staring at each other they weren't hissing like they do when they see each other. Things were chill for like 10 minutes. Yuffie I thought was just being curious, she wasn't doing your typical prowl, just jumps and attacks the kitten. again. Aside from these times when she attacks or might be out at night shes also hiding in all the cupboards, currently as I write this shes hiding under the kitchen sink :(. She cries at night and it breaks me because I know shes just not happy here. What can I do to make her happy? How can I get her to get along with the kitten? 

extras: I got feliway when we moved cause I read it helps with anxiety I also gave her these little anti anxiety treats. It sorta helped but not a whole lot. I just bought Spray cat nip in a effort to see if she would ever enjoy the big ass cat tree I got her when we moved or maybe like the couch if she would be willing to grace with her presence we have all these loves we can give her.

12,"When my grandparents passed away my wife and I assumed guardianship of my 46 year old, slightly mentally handicap, Uncle.

He can cook simple dishes, mow the lawn, read at a young adult level. He has a part time factory job and even had his drivers license about 20 years ago.

Unfortunately he appears completely incapable of properly cleaning himself after going to the bathroom. He gets specs of feces all over his bathroom wall (as if he flings it somehow) and we often find clumps of feces in his after-work shower.

I'm not sure if it's all attributable to his handicap, given his ability to function in other areas, if it's his obesity (6'5"" 390 lbs), or just laziness.

This piece of information may be trivial to some but I settled for this guy. I was slim while he was fat real fat he had man tits and a waist I couldn't wrap my arms around. I overlooked this and fell in love with him around october.


In december we decided to be a couple and after that the texting the flatter exponetially increased and this went on till mid july. After mid july I realized that he wasnt texting me as often and often doing other things on social media while he still hadnt texted me. I thought he was just busy due to his internship when it ended the ignoring still went on.


A few days ago he wrote me a text that he really enjoyed his time with me the past year and he loved our interactions but told me that he couldnt handle a realtionship atm because apparently he had a bazallion other things to focus on. He told me that a relationship was something he could not concentrate on atm and he didnt have the focus or concentration for it. I honestly was so surprised. I know he wouldnt leave me for sex etc becuase he's not too comfortable with basic affection like kissing and he has given me strong attention until mid july He also said that if he was ready to be in a realtionship again he would really want for us to continue our realtionship again.


I also metnioned that maybe we should have a breakup because im doing my med school apps this year just to chime in and not seem hurt. And then he said yeah i understand. I'm confused rn this is a guy who is butt ugly didnt initiate anything more than kissing even after knowing me for one year and suddenly decides that he isnt ready for a realtionship.

30,"I faced an upsetting and what I consider degrading encounter today, during my 2nd day of my junior year of high school. An English learning program coordinator came to my school to issue a test to certain students to measure the level of English that they are able to comprehend in order to give them the help they might need. Among them were foreign exchange students, and myself. (Total of 7 students including myself) There was a lot of irony in this situation, as they pulled me out of my AP English and AP physics class in order to take the test, which quite frankly, was ridiculous. Adding to that, I received one of the highest scores on the standardized English test that everyone in my grade took.

An example of a question on the test the coordinator gave us might be one that asked me to identify what an apple was, among a list of fruits. I was extremely confused as to why I was pulled out of two important classes to take this exam, and when I questioned the coordinator as to the reason why I was taking the test, she gave excuse after excuse, which each time, I gave a valid counterarguments.
I am paraphrasing the conversation here, but here's the general gist of what happened.

Me: I don't understand why I have to take
this test.

Coordinator: All students who marked any 
language other than English as their first 
language must take this test. (Students
 mark what their first language was during 
registration, and there was no mention of this program)

Me: I lived in the United States since I was two 
years old and completed all necessary English 
requirements before entering kindergarten. 
(This was in a different state than I am currently in,
which I lived in for 11 years)

Coordinator: Oh this must be the reason why, 
because you just moved to this school district.

Me: I've lived here (in current state)
 for four years, and I have residency. 

Coordinator: You must have gone to a outside 
school district. What middle school did you go to?

I mentioned that I went to the middle school 
that was directly within the aforementioned school 
district and why wasn't this issued to me then, like
 it should have been.

Coordinator: Well you still have to take the test. 

I was given no further explanation and was not permitted to return to my classes until I finished the test. Despite the elementary level of questions, the sheer amount of the questions they issued took an hour and half of class time. I asked my many peers who did not have English as their first language if they were required or have taken one, but none of them went through the process that I did. 
Keep in mind that this was a state issued test, which requires parental notification, which none was provided.

What are my options? How I do I address this to the school and how to I request a formal explanation?

Sitting close to me is the hottest girl in the entire school (hands down this girl is very very popular). Somehow, she started talking about prom, and she began talking with her friends about what she should wear. Then, all of a sudden, she turned towards me and started talking to me.

This scared the shit out of me and I'll be damned if I'm on that position again.

I'm trying to prepare for this hurricane, my mother not so much. I got the plywood and boarded up with the help of friends but there's only so much I can do. I drive a scooter. I told her tonight I needed to eat sawdust from work to put in front of gaps in the garage door. The area we are in tends to flood on the roads, that scares me. I don't want water inside. She avoided it until now it has rained and the sawdust is ruined. I suggested we have a backup plan and look into shelters. She instantly refused to go to a shelter because she ""heard on the news people get raped and robbed in shelters"". I told her there's going to be cops at the school, well be ok. She refused again and stormed out. I decided to keep looking into shelters and only one will accept pets, but only with up-to-date shot records. I told my mom we should let my girlfriend vaccinate my cat tomorrow. She works at the vet and can do it for 5 dollars. That way if worst comes to worst and we have to go to a shelter we can bring her. She reacted as if I attacked her. Upset with me that I wanted to prepare just in case we had to go, because ""she will not go"".

I think too much while I'm jumping around and trying to be wild, so I can't do it for more than a couple of (tortuous) minutes. Is there something wrong with me? Do I need alcohol or something?

54,"I like this girl at college and I'm fairly certain that she likes me as well. She gives off the usual signs such as constantly staring at me, acting both nervous and outgoing towards me, laughing at everything I say, etc.

However, I have a tendency to overreact to certain situations and always assume the worst case scenario. One of these situations is how this girl addresses me. In the past couple of months, she would refer to me by my real name, (Tyler) but today she called me by my nickname (Ty) that my fellow classmates and professors call me by.

I've always assumed that I have some type of anxiety disorder and this is one of the reasons why. Feel free to laugh, but I'm worried that she doesn't like me anymore, even though she still gives off the previously mentioned signs towards me. I'm thinking that she's calling me by my nickname to show me that she now only sees me as a friend and therefore calls me by what my friends call me, as opposed to people close to me who call me by my full name.

I'm interested in the idea of asking her out, but I'm at a point in life where I just got out of a toxic relationship and I need some time to get over my last girlfriend. I'm just not quite ready to get back into the dating game.

Anyway, am I overreacting to what this girl calls me, or is this one of those subtle signs that a girl would give off to show disinterest in a guy?",08Sep2017,1
55,"I don't know if I'm being overdramatic but I feel as if I have no one.

Recently everyone I know has been refining their friend groups and I now realize that I don't even have a single friend. 

There were 5 of us in a group. It split off into 2 people, who were better friends with each other more or less splitting off from the group and only doing stuff with each other. The other pair did the exact same thing and now I feel lost.

I'm fine with them leaving me because I too would not want to be friends with anyone I dislike, however, the lead me on. I'm still in group chats with them on Snapchat -I think they have all blocked me though- and I'm pretty sure they've all blocked me- and I occasionally ask if they all want to do anything and every single time everyone replies that they're busy. I feel as if they go to great lengths to ignore me and feel as if I'm no longer wanted.

I have no other friends am having to find anyone close to me. Everyone I know already has a pretty defined group of people they exclusively do anything with and usually, they tend to be a casual group of 2. 

The worst thing about it is that I have no one else to talk to this about and am honestly just at a loss.

56,"I am a sophomore in high school and I just don't see the point. I don't see the point in wasting the limited time I have in this universe with endless work and school. I have trouble turning assignments in or even doing them because I just don't care. My parents are constantly on my back because of my grades. I try to voice what I think to my closest friends, but none of them have ever thought of anything else but work and school. I believe I am resourceful enough to survive on my own, but I just can't get the nerve to do it. Most will just write this off as high school problems, but I have always dreaded adult life, and I don't want to waste my time on stress. What do you think about my situation?",08Sep2017,1
57,"Hello all, so part of why I'm confused is specifically because I believe, as far as I know, that I'm doing everything I can to make myself socially available, friendly, attractive, etc.  I'm also writing this from a good place mentally; I've struggled with depression, but as of right now I'm content and I want to address this issue *before* it becomes fodder for a dip in my mood.  I'll try my best to make this concise.

For context, I am 20 years old and am a newly transferred student at my College - so I am starting with a blank slate.  As a person, I wouldn't consider myself socially awkward per se, but I do suffer from fears and am very hyper aware of myself and my appearance.  I'm not outgoing, but I do make efforts to meet people, involve myself, crack jokes, and be friendly.  Those who know me best say that I'm a wonderful person, and I pride myself in my emotional intuition as a plane on which I can connect with people.  In my past, that aspect has unfortunately led me to be the ""fixer"" for people and their problems, including my ""bad ex"", so I've made strides to not let myself get carried away and suffer.  I've dated three people, generally am competent with girls, etc.

Anyways, since coming to this college, meeting plenty of people, and exchanging information, I find myself watching my roommate (who is also a transfer) routinely hang out with others, tell me that he's getting invited around, etc.  It's hard to not wonder why I'm having an issue with that.  I've joined the Frisbee team and met those whom I sit next to in class.  I've made conversation multiple times with a girl on the team whom I'm developing a bit of a crush on, and even recieved compliments from her and others on my vinyl collection when a group of us stopped by my dorm room.  People seem to like me *when they are with me*, but nobody is inviting me to go hang out, smoke, drink, etc. with them - and yet I'm seeing all these freshman and transfers whom I've met be invited around all the time.  I sit alone at every meal, and while I'm fine with that, I can listen to podcasts and whatever, it definitely bums me out.

All the advice that I've ever read that I would think to be applicable generally is geared towards just meeting people, presentation of self, and how to approach women.  I've taken care of all that, in my opinion, but I feel a little empty handed at the end of the day.  Do I just accept it and keep trying to meet more people?  I'm a little tired of always having to initiate any sort of social meetup, and I fear being annoying.  Any comments would be appreciated!",08Sep2017,1

61,"Led Zeppelin is absolutely amazing and definitely the best musical group that I have ever heard of. The combination of instruments is genius and the variety is brilliant. The chemistry between Jimmy Page and Robert Plant only adds to the wonderfulness of it all. Frankly, though, Led Zeppelin is also very arousing. The fact that Robert moans obscenely throughout the lyrics is one of the many factors. And the way Jimmy fingers his guitar and engrosses into his work makes you believe that his instrument is more than just a guitar. And the intimacy of John Paul and his bass cause a deep, satisfying melody. Also, how John Bonham slams into his drums like they're the only thing keeping him alive. The music is like sex. You can't even call it music. ""Music"" isn't an eighth of what Led Zeppelin is. And this is the issue: I'll be in the car with my dad and a Zep song will come on. I have to keep my mind from wandering to dirty places and I have to shift around in my seat to satisfy the urge to squirm around everywhere and slide down to the floor and die. I usually cope with these problematic impulses by singing along, but since Robert makes sex noises, it's hard to control myself. I don't know how to contain my desires and I want to enjoy Led Zeppelin around the people I enjoy without my arousals interfering. If anyone has any advice at all, please help me!!",08Sep2017,1
63,"Sorry in advance for the rant-ish format, I kind of brain vomited all over this place with my feelings.    
My BF and I are both 22, and have been together for 6 years. He's basically the only guy I've been with. The last 2 years have been getting increasingly busy and straining, and the spark is gone. Growing into adults simultaneously has been rough.     
People always say you should do new and different things together, but what if you don't have the time and money to even do that? What if the only way to feel excited anymore sexually is the quick, cheap, and easy method of finding someone new?     
I desperately crave that excitement I've felt only two or three times in my life: the rush of feelings when you kiss someone new that you've been feigning over. I feel like I've been overcome by stupid teenage hormones. Its just getting harder to maintain a LTR while work/school/family is also stressing me out.

69,"A kid at my high school keeps stealing money and expensive clothes from people by going into the locker rooms during sports games and practices. The total over the three years he's done it is probably well over $2.5k. Last year when it was really bad we caught him on camera in the varsity locker room(a place he's not allowed to be) during one of our games, and it happened that the Athletic Director caught him as well at the same time, so he wasn't caught on tape stealing anything. Anyways the school got involved at the end of last year and several friends of his, his mom(who works at the school), and himself, all admitted to knowing of his stealing. But because we go to a very liberal school and the kid is gay, the school did absolutely nothing. Not even a suspension. That brings me to now... I'm very pissed off at the situation having had money stolen from me, and just this week he stole another $250 from one of my good friends. Is there anything I can do if the school won't do anything? Would police investigate if I reported the larceny for all those who were stolen from. This kid needs to be punished for stealing such a large amount(felony worthy).

You try to look at me in the eyes as I avert my awkward gaze away. We cross the street and as I say goodbye you say ""not yet"".

I picked out a pair of frames that cost $179
My insurance covers $150 so I only had a little out of pocket there.... my insurance is also supposed to cover certain lenses which I am now assuming I didn't get.... I was not asked which type of lenses I wanted at all.

I felt like the girl that was helping me was intentionally rushing me so I wouldn't ask questions. She didn't  go over the price of anything except the cost of the frames and the actual exam (which was free!). 

The only receipt I got was from when my card was ran. I didn't get any paperwork, not even my prescription. I went to the same place I went to for my last glasses and back then I got a little packet with all my paperwork in it,I still have it! 

She told me that I'd get a receipt emailed to me but I haven't yet. I'm really annoyed with myself because I shelled out $170 and I haven't a clue what I'm getting except for the frames. According to her, 'I have good insurance, the total was about $700 but I only have to pay $170' 

I will definitely be asking questions when I pick up the glasses but does it seem like I got taken for a ride? I feel like I should have received a breakdown of the total cost and at least asked which lenses I preferred. I didn't even sign anything except my credit card receipt!

So far, that bank has refused to help us find out what happened even though I can verify with the original deposit slip I have of the amount I put in. And finally, I had put money in my girlfriends account (US based bank) to avoid having all my eggs in one basket in case something happened to one or both of the other sources of money I had for the trip.

So there are many reasons why I'm posting this. One; I can't seem to stay on track and slack every once in a while. Two; It's making me lose motivation. Three; I want my goals so badly, it's causing me to think ahead instead of actually getting stuff done now.


So on my general to-do lists I have college assignments for 5 classes. I have a watch list, which includes movies that I want to watch and make a review to post on youtube. It includes stuff that I need to do in real life, like setup this computer, test stream, find a backup provider, etc. And lastly, it includes stuff for youtube like recording this and that, and then livestreaming this and that.


I've tried to do a strict schedule (not time constraint). Example; I'll list assignments to-do that day and things for youtube, movies, and real life. I just seem to either get lazy, think it's too much, rethink the schedule and make a new one, and other stuff.


I've tried to do a loose schedule, like just make 5-6 things to do each day (this is probably my best one), but then I feel like I get that stuff done, but then I slack on the other stuff, because I just get lazy for some reason. it's weird, because usually I'm very motivated to get what I want and work hard.


I've also tried just a general to-do list. Like on an excel spreadsheet, type everything I need done and then just try and work off of that until they're all done. This is alright, but I get lazy, because I feel that I'm not getting enough done and then I make a new to-do list or schedule.


Are there any other alternatives? Like what do you do to stay on track with things that need to be done? Do I just need to buck up and get working or what? Thanks in advance!",08Sep2017,1

This was fine as it gives us time to gets jobs and get an apartment of our own, but just today a friend informed us that my ex is now instead planning to up and leave the apartment with us still living here. This is where I need help. I've never really lived in an apartment and I don't understand anything. I'm also afraid to go to the landlords about this situation without advice first because I again have no idea what to do or say and my current boyfriend is also living here while not on the lease. 

So my main questions are:

How much power do I have as an unpaying tenant? (I am listed as such)

Can my ex remove me from the lease?

Can I remove the original tenant (my ex) from the lease?

If I am an unpaying tenant in an apartment that was added after the lease was initiated, am I able to add another tenant?

If the original tenant decides he wants to end the lease, am I able to renew it?

Will we be evicted if we are both unemployed but are able to pay all rent and bills?

Can ""secondary"" tenants be held accountable for bills once the primary tenant has abandoned?

Are any of my ex's actions illegal?

I may have missed some details so if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything please don't hesitate. I really just want to deal with this situation and move on with my life.",08Sep2017,1

Depression took everything good out of my life and right before a suicide attempt a few months ago I burned all my bridges.

I've moved to a new city, started at a new university, got on some new psychiatric meds and I think I'm ready to reboot my life.I have already gone cold turkey on alcohol, porn and video games. Ive been feeling a little better the past month but when I look around and see all of the driven, motivated, charismatic and beautiful people who surround me I can't help but feel useless.

One day after work she would not leave me alone, so I decided to see what she wanted and she wanted to ""hang out"". So I decided what ever maybe she will leave me alone after. Dumb decision right? Well anyways we hung out and when I tried to drop her off she wouldn't give me her address. She didn't want to leave my car. She made me park somewhere where she then kissed me. I pulled away and she immediately leaned more towards me. I didn't really know what to do so I kissed her back. I then drove around again asking for her address but she still wouldn't tell me. Eventually I parked somewhere near where I thought she lived, and said goodnight. This wasn't her intent so she began doing things I'm sure you know. Well we got caught I got arrested and now I'm facing sexual assault of a child under 16, a Class C felony, could put me on the registry, give me years upon years in prison. And ruin my life.

I have been having a really difficult time deciding of whether or not I should add a person on Facebook for months.

So I volunteered at a library and worked with this one lady. She was super nice and we had a lot in common. The problem is that she is nearly 30 years older than me. I don't know if she would accept the request because it may be too awkward. I also have this feeling that I *love* her, because she is the best lady I have ever met in my life yet. The thing is that I am currently 19 and she has a boyfriend. I met her three years ago and worked with her until I moved out to college. As much as I don't like most people, she is one of the few I still think about. I just sent her an e-mail once I moved into my new place and that was the last time I talked with her (18 yrs. old). So this is why I am making a big deal out of this...

So, I have a sweet dog. Love the boy to death. He makes coming home bearable and, as any dog owner/lover would say, is a huge stress reliever. Looking at my furbaby gives me joy and I just absolutely love having him around. It's hard to put in words the feeling of having a dog around, but to simply put it, he feels like family. He helps me cope with some personal issues. 

The problem is that the dog actually isn't mine, but rather, he is my brother's. My brother is moving out, and so is the dog. I feel devastated and I don't know how life would be without my dog, or a dog in general. I have been around dogs all my life and I can honestly say that they make my life a lot better. I don't think I necessarily NEED a dog, but for some reason with my brother's dog, I really fell in love and grew an attachment like no other. My brother will only be a 15 to 20 minute drive away, but he's a busy man and I don't want to bug him just to see his dog. Yes, I can dog sit, but I feel anxious thinking about my new everyday life without the doggo. 

I want to bring home another dog, but I know my parents would get extremely mad and there would be too many complications involved. So, how exactly do I cope with this?

With that in mind, when I (using TaxAct) did my 2015 taxes in 2016, I had forgotten about the disbursement, and when I rec'd the paperwork, I quickly went to H&amp;R block to have them amend my return.

After the amendment, the associate told me I had another return coming, which sounded odd to me, so I asked if he was sure, and he said yes.  So i went on my way.

A few months ago I rec'd a letter from the IRS stating that I owe 5,000 in back taxes due to an unclaimed amount of income to the tune of my 401k disbursement.  I IMMEDIATELY called H&amp;R block and the associate hurriedly told me ""they probably havent gotten to your amendment yet, just rspond to the letter with all of your documentation and the amended return.""

So I did.  And the IRS returned a reply the other day saying that I still owe because of some such thing on this line on that page.

I'm 20yo and live in Berlin (approximately three hours away from our parents).
I don't want to bore you with details, but our parents are super abusive, yet the child services or police won't help us. 

I need to get her out of our parents house, but she is underage. Next year she'll finish school and will be almost 17. 
My therapist suggested to do this as nicely as possible to not turn our parents against us (and possibly losing the money they have to pay us). She wants to get away from them and move in with me. 

I study computer science and could earn enough money to support us both + we have the money our parents have to pay (they're rich af)

My parents however are convinced that I am a drug addict (which I'm not, I smoke pot sometimes, but that's normal for a college student where I live). They also spread lies about me and told my sister that I did something very terrible to her, but she would be too young to talk about it yet. This isn't true.

I'm just numb. I'm not sure what to do. She had only been diagnosed last month. She had a seizure the other day. I know that's very serious, it's just other than that she seems normal, fine even.

122,"I won't lie to you and tell you I'm someone who's given up on pretense. I'm in a place right now where I can see the basic fallibility, falsehood and impermanence of societal standards, and divisions between people, while still forcefully applying these ideals to myself and others. I am smart and good-looking. Sometimes, when I feel like just breaking down into an incoherent pool of tears  and reverting to infancy in the middle of a shitty work day, I look at myself in the mirror and imagine the things I might have done, the man I could have been, had I been born in the Iron Age. I would have been a fucking warrior with a heart of gold. And wise at that. Plato's idealized ""philosopher king.""
But then reality hits home, and not just the obvious reality that this is 2017 Anno Domini. Mobile phones, twitter, facebook are our dining halls. Ideological, massive, bureaucratic, emasculated militaries are our warrior class. Bald old lawyers and bone-dry politicians pass laws telling us what we can and can't do, and they do it without any reference to things like God, the Universe, morality, fate, eternity. There are 7.6 billion people out there and a hell of a lot of them want to rule the world, just like me. A lot of them are even smarter and better-looking than I am. 
No, the reality that truly hits home is this: I am where I am and when I am because I'm supposed to be. Courage? Apply it now, where you are. ""If only there were some great enemy to fight, like Mongol hordes or a plague,"" I think to myself, almost daily. ""I would be a rock upon which others could rely. A man of steel, of strength and permanence in a world of chaos, a world where God and love seem far too absent."" No, my enemy right now is my own mind, and my perpetual tendency to regard myself as inherently different from others--sometimes better, sometimes worse; the constant is alienation.  
I'm nearly 23 and I'm in a rut. I still live at home with my mother and sister. I have about 3 real friends, and while I'm thankful for them, I don't consider 3 a crowd. The last intimate relationship I had ended nearly a year ago...it was just animalistic, probably unhealthy sex with a girl who was questioning her sexuality at the time. I liked her as a friend. But the lack of romantic feelings was almost certainly mutual. I've completed less than one semester of post-secondary education, and I'm paying the price. Making just above minimum wage picking orders in a warehouse, alienating most of my co-workers with my constant grimace, overly punctilious demeanor and refusal to talk about anything besides art, music, politics, or the fundamental nature of reality and our place within it. I get angry when I see others living fearlessly and joyfully. That might be the definition of evil. 

I just went back and read everything I've written here, and I feel almost sick posting it. I recognize the basic arrogance permeating every word. I need to figure out what one is supposed to do for oneself in this world, and what should be done for others' sake.

I'd like of someone whose not emotionally attached to the situation, i.e me, could check what I'm going to send my manager for reasonableness.

The email (personal details changed):

Please accept this email as notice of my resignation.

 

I felt incredibly disrespected in our meeting yesterday, especially when you laughed/scoffed at the fact it had taken me a month to do a task. I understand that I’m clearly not the best member in the team, I’m not Jim or John or Bob, I’m me. I’ve tried my hardest and this reaction from yourself is something that I feel as an employee I should not have to accept. This is not a work environment I want to stay in any longer. I don’t like the fact that I’m not the best, I’ve tried to rectify this in the way I know I work best but the reaction from yourself, and your clear disrespect for the way I value to work, has gotten too much for me to just keep sweeping under the carpet and forget about.

 

You said earlier in the week that I should take the extra mile to ensure that everyone is happy. You’ve known for 4 months now that I have not been happy in this position, but I’ve dug in and dealt with it for the benefit of the team. However, after yesterday I cannot keep doing this anymore. It feels like the only one who is happy in this situation is you; you are getting your projects completed, you are keeping your overhead in line with what is needed, whereas Aaron is unhappy as you can’t commit to a deadline on my transfer, and I am unhappy, just as I have been the last 4 months, and the 6 months prior to that, in this position. This is not a fair situation for all parties involved, as the only one getting the benefits here is you. You claim you want me to be happy, but at the same time refuse to commit to give Aaron a transfer date for me thus allowing me to move on from a situation I’m not happy in. This tells me that you clearly have no respect for your employees wellbeing and only care that you have yourself covered. I don’t want to be in that sort of atmosphere any more.

 

As I said in our meeting yesterday, I consider my email of 31st August to be a clear intention of my plans to leave the team, and thus the start of my 2 months notice. I must take a page out of my managers’ book and ensure that I am happy, despite the detriment it will cause to other parties, and I will therefore no longer be a member of the team as of 31st October, and will be starting within my new role as of 1st November.

 

I wish you all the best for the future, and thank you for the opportunities this last year, however I can no longer continue working in this environment and thus please treat this email of my official resignation.


Many thanks,

138,"Hello. I am a freshman in college at the moment and, even though I'm in my second week, I'm worried that I won't be able to make any friends before all the little social groups are formed. The problem is that I've never really made friends before, people (either because of a high school environment or maybe out of curiosity) have made friends with me so I don't really have any experience trying to initiate conversation with people. I don't think I'm really introverted, I just have this weird mentality where I'll feel rude or intrusive if I just start talking to some random person.

I live on campus and I do have a roommate but I don't really get along with them. I've tried going to different events on campus and I've even kept my door open but neither of those actions have really led to anything.

I have two friends who went to the same high school as me but they couldn't afford to live on campus so I don't really see them that much, especially since we're completely different majors. They seem to be making more friends than me and I'm worried that I'll be left behind.

142,"I hang out with four friends and we have a private chat where all five of us can talk with eachother. One of these friends, let's call him Lenny, got into a type of light military training a while ago (I'm not sure about the specifics).

Anyway, Lenny posted a picture in the chat that showed him in a military outfit. I decided to make a joke. I didn't have any bad intentions, I just wanted to be funny.

So what I did was I copypasted in a turban, a rifle and a shirt which said ""Al-Qaeda"" on MS paint. The three other guys found it funny, and I assumed Lenny would laugh aswell when he had seen it.

After a few hours, Lenny called me, and this is basically what he said: ""if you don't delete that goddamn picture immediately, I'm going to report you to the police"". I was chocked that he reacted this way, and I basically just said ""okay"". I then deleted the picture from our private chat. I messaged him that I had deleted it. He wrote back ""okay thanks"".

I thought about the incident a few days, and I started to get more and more angry about his reaction. I didn't understand what the big deal was. I also didn't understand why he felt he had to threaten a friend in order for a picture to dissappear.

Maybe he thought that the picture would be damaging to his career in the military. But how could it? The pic was obviously fake, so nobody in the right mind would think he was a member of Al-Qaeda. Also, the original picture didn't have any military secrets in them, he just stood near a wall and a door. Also, I wasn't even planning on spreading it. Also, I had not posted the picture anywhere else.

Since I was angry and hurt, I decided to delete him off social media, to show him that I didn't want to be friends with him anymore. I kind of thought to myself ""a real friend doesn't threaten someone over a harmless joke"".

Can I get some opinions on my and Lenny's behavior? Was Lenny being reasonable? Should I apologize to him for cutting him off (I haven't blocked him or anything but he hasn't sent me any message since I deleted him)?",08Sep2017,1
143,"(As a preface I have tried apologizing multiple times  I have been calm and civil The Who time.)

Ok so to start the situation out I went back to school this year. (My sophomore year of high school.) my ex friends currant girlfriend and I were pretty decent friends. And at one point we were even in a relationship. We started hanging and being friends again it was nice. And one day we were walking in my cities downtown with her and another friend of mine. I remember some troubling stuff I heard about her current boyfriend (my ex friend) I presented in awkwardly in a attempt for it it be a joke. I made sure to say that it was not 100% factual but I felt like if this was true it would be important for her to know if she was in a relationship with him. What I said was that apparently he hacked his girlfriends Skype in order to see if she was cheating. About 4 days later she breaks up with him one reasons being she heard something troubling apparently. She she still specified that it was her decisions and no one other than herself influenced it. He contacts me and asks why I have been talking shit, I said I made a shitty joke and I was sorry. I didn't mean to cause anything. Fast forward 2 days and he has been Ignoring me and when ever we have to work together he would just yell passive insults at me. This peeved me off and here is where I made my mistake. I mentioned it again to a 3rd party saying something along the lines of ""idk if it was true but it would seem like something he would do"" apparently Ex friend got word of this and now he won't stop harassing me. I left school that day and he started screaming at me outside the school. I did not engage I said I was sorry and he needs to not scream at me. I contact him tell him if he has problems to sort them out with me now and not cause a new scene. Fast forward another day and after school we meet with the new recruits for the after school from between 3-5 he is just non stop insulting me and yelling at me. He even has his friends join in. It was brutal. I tried not to engage I asked him to stop he just mocked me. To make things worse he is a department head of the program, and a grade above me. So people trust him more then I. I left. They still talked shit after I left. I don't know what to do. Did what I say warrant a reaction like this? How do I resolve this? How to I get him out of my life?",08Sep2017,4
144,"So I'm in my early to mid twenties and it's getting sad because I only attract girls who are 16-19. Pretty much the average age I'd say I'd talk to is 17. I only attract 17 year old girls and at first I thought it was weird but I kinda started to realize it's better and I'm not sure if I should be like this or not. Also every girl and person I talk to says that I look 18-19. I've heard 16 before but no one thinks I'm my own age. I don't know if it's bad or not but it's getting weird the older I get. 

I've liked and talked to girls my own age and it's gone good and we hit it off but it's rare  and I liked them but I'm starting to not like girls my own age for a few reasons. 1. They're all covered in tattoos or something. 2. They've had tons of hook ups and I've never really done shit like that. 3. They're mature like too mature literally all they care about is money it's like feelings don't matter in a relationship my age it's all finacial (it's important I know). 4. I'm a permnanent child and I think the way girls my age dress is plain and boring (dresses/skirts and a dress shirt) I prefer a girl in jeans and a hoody not sure why I think I had dating issues in high school or matured slow or something that makes me like girls 17-19 instead of girls that 20-24. Another thing is I didn't really embrace my eras culture I like younger people culture like the music and tv and memes and stuff i feel like I'm just a permanent 19 year old or something. 

I know I'm mentally messed up but every time I talk to a girl my own age I kinda feel anxiety and the relationship just feels superficial and stuff it's weird. When I talk to a girl that's 17-18 I have more in common and our conversations seem more innocent and it seems more like we can have fun doing simpler things (like just staring at a sunset) instead of the typical pick up in a car, meet, go on a date, go upstairs and have sex or keep repeating until that happens and you're actually official while you guys both talk to members of the opposite sex weighing your options and comparing. It's like the innocence is gone out of relationships my age. 

Not sure what to do the older I get the weirder it seems I mean 17 and 24 seems like the absolute max to me anything younger/older would be weird with a few exceptions.

146,"Bit of background, I have two cats: a 10 week old kitten we have had for a week and a 9 y/o adult male.

We got our kitten about a week after we got back off vacation. A close friend of ours was working nearby - I know money is tight for him, so I said he could crash at my place a couple of nights during the week, and do washing and stuff if he wanted to; our older cat was at a cattery and was deflead the day he went; I also cleaned the house, so I didn't really think about fleas being an issue.

Cut to nearly two weeks later and I've noticed both cats scratching a lot the past couple of days, then today I woke up with bites. I realised that my friend also owns a cat, but has also been out of work until about a month ago, so I have no idea if he's been keeping up with her flea treatment - I don't have the money to loan him to actually deflea his house, but I don't really want to have to go through the whole debacle of trying to get rid of them again if he comes over - I already had to spend money on insect killer etc and, which wasn't really something my boyfriend and I had factored in when budgeting this month for getting a 2nd cat. At the same time we also now have to figure out the logistics of introducing 2 cats without scaring them, but also trying to deflea the whole house and keep them out of the rooms getting sprayed... 

Any advice? :(",08Sep2017,3
147,"Hi, I currently live in Florida, and with the threat of the oncoming hurricane, I'm a little worried about my cat. 

She was a feral cat that I somewhat adopted, and I'm not allowed to bring her with me to my moms work where my mom and I are going to ride out the hurricane.

I can't leave her in my apartment because I live by a large river, and my apartment could easily be flooded, and I'm afraid to leave her outside because of obvious reasons.

148,"Some background: I'm a first year Master's student and my roommate is a 4th year undergrad (both girls). We met three years ago and have been best friends since. We had both lived in single rooms on campus until this year, when we decided to get an apartment together. We didn't get the chance to create a formal roommate agreement (or even sit down and talk about it) in the first few days because her boyfriend was staying here to help her put together her furniture. Since then I've been mentally cataloging things that we really need to establish rules on (garbage, dishes, borrowing things) but I'm not sure how to approach the ""contract"" idea without unloading all of my pent-up frustrations. She grew up in a small house with three siblings, whereas I only have one, so our idea of how things should run is already different. I'm sure there are things I'm doing that she doesn't like but since we haven't talked I'm not completely sure what they are. She does have a much busier and more demanding schedule than me, so I don't realistically expect her to do chores *immediately*, but here are some of the things that will need to be addressed in a...non-aggressive way (I.e not the way I've written below):
* Dishes- Do your own, and do them as you dirty them (with the exception of pans that need to soak overnight). Load the dishwasher--that's what it's there for. Don't leave dishes for more than 24 hr. The mug of bacon grease that your boyfriend left on Sunday should not still be there when I get up Friday morning. I'm not kidding when I say we are going to get cockroaches. 
* Garbage- Kitchen garbage should be taken out when full (or stinky even if not full) and bag replaced as needed. If after dark, okay to leave bag by front door to be taken by the first person who leaves the next morning. We're both in a hurry in the morning, so please don't step around the bag and say you didn't have time to take it. There's a dumpster on the way to the bus stop. 
* Borrowing things- If you borrow something (with permission if needed) return it to the other person promptly and in working order. Else, put it back where you found it. 

Sorry for the unnecessary venting. Basically I am looking for advice in 1) drafting a roommate agreement, 2) approaching my roommate to discuss it, and 3) being less controlling but also less passive aggressive when I'm upset by something. Thank you!",08Sep2017,2

151,"Hey, guys. 

First of all I did like to mention that english isn't my primary language, same goes for my country. Thing is guys I have been on a dilemma cause I'm still bad at communication with the others and most of the things I talk is pretty much useless for the  most people or they're just things that people don't understand, so it makes me look like a bad company or just an antisocial guy. It sucks because I'm neither, I'm a person who likes videogames, sports, animations, series, music, culture (*meant history and art*) and coding. Yeah, I work with coding.  

I mean, I could just blame the fact I like to play a lot of games instead to go outside and meet with people, but this would be silly, cause people do all the time and still having a nice social life. Other part is that I always ended up getting played by the others cause I just act innocent at my conversations and they abuse it just for fun or because they want to get advantage over me, since I don't understand or don't pay attention at the situation. 

Some people have told that I should look more in here, not just outside where I'm not able to connect with people. Cause It's like I'm too cold for them and too meaningless to be with them. 

I did like to change my conducts and having a better view of things, cause for sure I don't deserve to get treat like that.

154,"LONG UNNECESSARY BACKSTORY REMOVED TO REDUCE THE WALL OF TEXT. IF YOU'RE A MASOCHIST AND WANT TO READ IT, MESSAGE ME.


First off, I have a car. It's the main reason I'm at home right now. My parents, mostly my mom, was heartbroken that I was planning on leaving, even though they encouraged it, so they decided to buy me a car, a relatively nice one, despite our ever-present financial troubles, to keep me at home. The deal was for me to stay home for 2 years, but they've said if a good school accepts me next year that they'll let me out of that. Anyways, I say I have a car, and what the deal was, to say that I'm not a Christian anymore. I don't believe that there's anything after death, and that contributes to an extreme fear of death, but more urgently, the fact that I pretend to be. My parents don't know I don't believe anymore, and I'm probably not going to tell them anytime soon. The fundamental Christian belief is that anyone who has been saved, who believes, who accepts Jesus Christ as the only way of salvation, will go to heaven. Other people? Hell. Eternal, infinite, torture. And even though I don't think that's in any way the truth, they do, and it'd break their hearts. I'm also worried they'd cut off a lot of my freedom, and be insistent of a lot more things from me. In fact, no one knows, including my best friend (also a Christian. He says. Honestly it seems like he might not be, might be like me, but there's no real way to probe without seeming suspicious), except my ex. We're on relatively good speaking terms now, though, and I trust her not to tell anyone I know. But it's wearing on me heavily that almost every waking moment I have to pretend to be someone I'm not, pretend to believe something I don't.

Second, my intellect. I'm smart. It's just a fact, I don't mean to brag. There are definitely people less intelligent than I am, but for the most part, I'm smarter than anyone I meet. And that makes me extremely cocky. I don't intend to be that way I just do. For a lot of people, it works. That's just part of who I am, and they like me for it. But I don't like it. I don't like that I, for no reason whatsoever, think of myself as better than most people, even though I, one, don't know them well enough to know if they're more intelligent than I am, or two, know that intelligence doesn't even make someone a better person in the first place.  Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was a genius by every definition. He had an IQ of 167, accepted by Harvard at 16, and an assistant professor there by 25. Yet he was a serial killer. I'm not at his level of intellect, but still. I am cocky, yet I shouldn't be, and I know I shouldn't be, but I still am. I also am smart enough to recognize it. If I applied myself, if I did what I should do, if I worked as hard as I could, I could be brilliant. I could make the world a better place. I could be famous. I could be rich. Maybe they're delusions of grandeur, but I honestly believe them to be true. Yet I flake. I skip classes. I didn't transfer any of my college credit from my high school because I wanted to start over, and work on getting a perfect GPA, and a fantastic level of involvement that I know is completely attainable. Become a student that a top school couldn't turn down as a transfer. It's something I'm completely capable of, but I don't. I decide it's more important to do my own thing. Even now, it's the second week of school, and I'm writing this post, at home, while I should be taking notes in one of my classes. I don't know why.

Third, I can't stick with anything. During the summer, I was working out. I went to the gym five days a week, ate right, and was building muscle. I went on a brief vacation about a month ago, and haven't been to the gym since. I was intent on self-improvement and was listening to a few podcasts. Haven't touched those in a couple weeks. Two of my closest friends other than George are just a text away from seeing them today. But I haven't seen or talked to either of them in months. If I had to attribute a cause I'd say I have a fear of commitment, stemming from being abandoned by friends as a child, but I could be off base.

My future career. My family's financial trouble has left me wanting to have a job where my future family will never have to want for anything. Will have every single opportunity, will have any indulgence they might want. I know they won't have *everything* they want but still. I know that whatever path I choose, if I fix my flakiness, fix myself, I can excel in it. I can become the top. But I don't even know myself well enough to know what I want to do. I don't want to hate my job I want to love it. But I also want to be home. I want to be with my family because my dad never was. He was constantly working. I don't fault him for it, he did what he had to do to keep our family afloat and give us what we needed. He was an amazing father, but I want to do that and be present at the same time. But on the track I'm on, that will never happen.

And finally, my social life. I've come eons from where I was as a child. I'm not shy anymore, and I embrace my personality. As mentioned, I am cocky but other than that, I'm.. better. Sort of. I still don't have many friends. I have George, and we're as close as brothers but other than him, I only have a couple people that I regularly hang out with, and similar to the small group I was part of with Frank, they're mostly George's friends. I talk to them, but most of them I'm not really friends with. The thing is I don't know how to fix that. I have no trouble approaching people. I'm not afraid of talking to a new person. But I don't know how to keep that talk going. Within a few minutes, any conversation I'm having with a person I haven't talked to before devolves into a practical interview. I'm asking them yes or no questions, they respond, and the impression I'm assumed they're left with is I'm a boring person who's an awful conversationalist. I've been trying to practice, but it's not that easy. Even though I'm not afraid of approaching someone, I still don't want to be rude and interrupt whatever they might be doing. I talked to a guy the other day that was sitting on a bench while we were waiting for a class, and it was going ok, but it was only like 15 minutes, and the last couple, I started asking yes or no questions like I had been. I texted the girl I mentioned earlier, Sarah, the really attractive friend of Emily, and asked her on... what I made to seem like a date. Got turned down (which I don't care about, I'm not afraid of rejection), she said because we don't know each other that well. So we've been texting for about a week. But I'm still not great at not having conversations turn interview with me giving unsolicited information about myself, and she's mostly giving two or three-word responses. I'd like to keep that going because she is a nice person, and as I said quite attractive, but at this point, she seems bored of me. And I understand. I got approached by a girl the other day, and we talked for ten minutes or so, but I told her I had to go after I realized that the last few minutes had just been as interviewy as always. The only thing I can think of could be causing this is that because I barely talked to people growing up, even though I don't classify myself as shy anymore, I didn't develop the social or conversation skills that most people do, and am learning them late. So any tips there would be nice.

That's about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, mostly for the last five paragraphs, or any other way you can see I could improve myself. If any of this seemed confusing or disjointed, I'm sorry. I'm kind of under the weather, and I wrote all of this in one sitting without an outline. I'm happy to clarify anything that you're curious about. ",08Sep2017,1

157,"I guess I should give some context. The choice for what I wanted to be in life came out of nowhere in grade 7 when my parents asked me what I wanted to be and got me to pick in a list of schools. Not having thought out this question beforehand I picked the first thing thing hat came to my mind. Becoming an architect like my sister. You see at the time my thought process was: ""Well hey my sister is an architect and my dad's a welder, why not try to be in the same job circle as them? Builders!""
Looking back on that, that was one of the dumbest and most not thought out decisions I have ever done. Because you see I was never really passionate about being an architect or a builder. I love computers. Ever since I was 7 or 8 we had a (admittedly low end) computer and I fell in love with it. Heck I even opened it up just for fun (Although I forgot the thermal paste when putting back on the heatsink, thus it didn't work for more than 30 seconds.) to check out what was inside. I geek out over the latest technology, and I am fascinated by how they operate. And programming shows me how they work and I love programming for fun and seeing programs come to life. Admittedly I suck at programming, but I have basic skills in Javascript and Pascal. Back to the topic, can I even change my career path at this point? And even if it is, what would my parents think of me, if I ditch architecture and follow an entirely different path in life? Wouldn't an University like to accept students with a technological high school backgroud? By the way I have mostly As and a few Bs in my IT class and I'm pretty damn good at it.

159,"Hi, Reddit!

This is my first post, so please be kind.

My Fiance and I just became first time homeowners a week ago, which should be an amazing milestone in our life. Except, it's a total nightmare.

Ever since my Fiance told me that he wanted us to take the bold plunge in the housing market, I reacted in loving protest. I continuously spoke rather openly about my desire to wait another year to see if the market would cool off, but it fell on deaf ears.

He would reason with me by using two main points: We would save money by switching from renting to paying off a mortgage, and it'd be better well-spent. I agreed with those points; I see the value in his vision. It's not the logic that I have a difficult time complying with, it's the timing.

The market is HOT which is amazing for those who wish to sell their homes, but a pain in the butt for those who wish to settle down and buy. If you're in real estate or you are a home owner yourself, you know what I am talking about.

Just to give you an idea of the market we are dealing with, we purchased a our new ""home"" at $145,000. Can you guess what it got us? A 700 Sq Ft, old, dark (there are no windows except for a sliding glass door that doesn't get any sunlight), musty scented, 1 bedroom condo on the garden level in a really sketchy part of town. When I say ""sketchy"", I mean SKETCHY!

The crime rate isn't pretty between sex assaults, break-ins, car theft, etc. Hell, a few of my neighbors are registered sex offenders! This is not an exaggeration; this is my reality.

The other day I was walking my dog a few feet from my home, and a man pulled up in a pickup truck alongside me to give me a warning. He said, ""young lady, be careful walking around by yourself out here. I just had to help another lady up the street because a large man was following her."" I ran inside and had a complete meltdown.

We traded in our safe, airy, open, and beautiful apartment in a prime location to be homeowners in a really (pardon my adjective) shitty area. As a small young female who works from home and has two dogs that I need to walk constantly throughout the day (no, they are not the type of dogs that provide any ounce of security), this entire thing is extremely unsettling.

I feel claustrophobic, uninspired, and scared in this new place that I am supposed to accept as my home. I have talked to my significant other about this a few times since we moved in last week, and each time I have approached him I have been in tears. He cares about my feelings and adores me beyond belief, so naturally he is doing his best to make me feel secure.

He put up a lattice board on our patio, placed a little triggered alarm system under our doors, and will soon install security cameras to make it less likely for someone to break in. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for his effort. All of that is amazing, but I literally feel caged in. If I stay in my bubble, I am offered more safety. But the minute I leave, I feel anxiety ridden.

I don't know what to do.
I feel trapped.
I can't and won't leave my partner; he's my everything and we're in this together. But I don't want to stay here.

Like it was hella obvious and just to make just I wasn't jumping to conclusions I waited for a couple of weeks and tested stuff out like: when I would drop my pencil he would go out of his way to pick it up, he would only take my paper and his to give to the teacher even though he had a dude right next to him that we both talked to, in the corner of my eye I would see him doodling my name on his paper but everytime I got up he would hide it, and when we would have to go to groups he would rush to be in my group. I was really creeped out but I was too scared to tell him off (I didn't have low confidence or any of that I was just really shy and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) then near the end of the year he asked me for my number I wanted to say no but I panicked and I was about to give him a fake number but then he turned it around on me. He told me to put his number in my phone and to text him. I said I would text him later but with a little force in his voice he told me to do it right now. I freaked out I was yo shit imma die if I say no. So then the day after he asked me if I wanted to go to the movies to go Alien: Covenant. I didn't want to go so I made excuses like I had to go to my dad's for the weekend (lmao I watched it with my dad in the weekend I liked the movie) but then he texted me 
(I have a picture I'm too lazy to post the convo) but technically he assumed I wanted to hang out with him and I really got pissed off at this point. I started ignoring when he would talk to me I pretended I didn't hear him. I even sent a message saying I didn't want to hang out with him but no. When I had all my courage to send that text the next day he went really close to me and asked if I had seen his message. Me being the idiot and my saying DID you get my message I said no and that I was cleaning. This was a day before school ended and the next day when I was waiting for the bus I was kinda looking around for him so I could avoid him. But as soon as my bus came I turned around and he was right behind me I told my friends bye and ran to the bus. (I was shook). That was last year and I'm a junior now and I was lucky to not have a class with him but I do occasionally see him but instead of going to class he goes straight to me and stands where I can feel him breathe. I'm tired of being nice and I need something to say to him. He doesn't get the point I don't want to talk to him and I need to be assertive. 
I was scared because I'm a 5'3 girl and he's 6'1 he look like will shank me if I reject him but now I'm tired of it",08Sep2017,0

Well, still being depressed, still having anxiety - but I'm working on improving those - going out in public, hanging out with friends, trying to make new ones, and so on and so forth.

Problem is, while I do have friends both online and offline (Significantly more online), I don't have any sort of community that I feel a part of - some place I can share what's new in my life, get advice on what to do, and just all around talk to / have fun with a bunch of other, new, people.

So what I'm looking for is a community, outside of reddit (Lack of bumping threads, an up/downvote system, etc. really isn't what I'm looking for), that can satisfy my itch. Ideally I want it to be fairly large, or at least very active. I was looking around for Discord servers, but I'm new enough to it that I'm not sure where to start looking.

It'd be great to have be able to be a part of a forum with a chat room (Or discord) with a wide range of people, but I have even less of an idea of how to find something like that.

Can anyone help me? Even just sharing a few communities you're apart of that you think would fit my needs would be super helpful.

This old account is about 6 years old and has been inactive since then, so I don't even remember the email used to create the account, let alone my username or any passwords. There's nothing super bad on there, but it's typical cringy 15yo stuff and I have a semi-public presence now. 

I think all of my requests for removal are just ignored automatically since they don't come from the email address that was used to create the account, and there's no way for me to prove that it's my old account aside from being able to prove my name. On the one occasion I actually managed to get through to someone, they said there was nothing that could be done since I have none of the login info. I really can't accept that answer. 

The account has definitely been inactive for close to 5 years at least, but I can't say exactly the last time I logged on. I would have thought an account would be automatically removed after so long inactive.

188,"So a little about my family

My dad and my mom used to work at the same place. I'm not going to specify their line of work due to privacy. Their work involves clients and the pay is directly related to how many clients they have.

My dad gets fired because the clients find him annoying, with the managers, and acting like he is in charge of everything.

He goes unemployed for 2 years, ocassionally getting some side money which was barely enough to pay for the electric bill.

After two years, he finally finds some more work in the same field. However, if I had to estimate, he makes about 1/2 of the money as he did before.

He is also extremely gullible. There was a period in time where he believed in 4 different religions and spent $3000 on Ponzi schemes. He also has the idea of people that don't do anything are the ones that make it big. Recently, he stopped eating fish because of an incident that Costco had. I guess he thinks that all fish have worms in them because of one incident.

Anyways, he loses clients over time. The problem is that instead of trying to find more ways of getting money, he sits at home. He doesn't even do chores. He just stares at his computer screen or sleeps.

My mom and I have been trying for years to get him to change his behavior/lifestyle. However, he continues to make baseless statements to justify his laziness. 

He also likes arguing a lot. If he has nothing to say, then he just changes the discussion and shifts the argument so he has something to say.

I really don't know what I should do or what my mom should do. I suggested that we find him a doctor but I don't think that he would agree to that (because of how he thinks he is always right and doing nothing is the priority over everything else). ",08Sep2017,1

I feel like a robot that can't say anything and moves to classes according to the program once the bell rings. I have no friends and most of the time I spend around the corner of my school that has internet. I struggle to make new friends really, there's nothing that I can relate to with anyone and it almost feels as if i don't belong there even though I like this one girl from my class. To be honest, I wish I had a couple close friends so that we could do things together like going out or exploring places, thrill seeking. I so often wish I had a friendship similar to Sam and Colby's or TFIL (Youtube Channel, look them up) So that is one. 

Second, I feel confused and lost all the time during class which I think are symptoms of brain fatigue/fog. Now, I know when to ask questions if I didn't understand something but thing is, most of the time I don't even know what we are talking about even though I was listening since the beginning unlike other classmates who seem to understand and answer correctly to the teacher's questions. I worry so much that my grades will be horrible like last year or even worse because we were told it would be a lot harder and I am a C-B student. Last year, I had a panic attack incident because of these worries and anxiety which make me feel stupid! I want to be a straight A student so I can go to University where I want to become an Accountant. 

Third, has something to do with what I mentioned above, me feeling like an emotionless robot. I have a hard time to relate to anybody's sense of humor so I never laugh or spend a good time at school. It feels like the dullest place for me.  I also feel very awkward around people because everyone seems to know each other as if they are brothers and I am the guest, the left out one. I hate it.

It's a rental, studio style. Fire came through from the balcony, but all the stuffs in the closet and restroom are totally fine, just smoke damage. 

What happened afterwards is that the leasing company kept telling me my room is not safe to go back in while all the adjusters are allowed to go check my room. My insurance adjuster even told me lots of my stuffs are still salvageable. There's no reason to not let me go back in and let my stuff sit there. 

I managed to contact their insurance adjuster to go into my room and get my important document out and she did. But she still told me the floor is unstable yadayada and they will build a support one day so i can go back. Never got update from her. 

Yesterday I found out that the leasing office already started renovating the unit and ALL my stuffs were thrown away!!!!!!!! NO ONE told me that they gonna do this. And then i found out the manager who I kept contacted with is no longer with the company. The new manager knows nothing about my situation. She asked me to send a list of my salvageable stuff to her and she will ""try"" to get it to their insurance ppl.

It's weird to admit but i work in the same place as my mom and it was a temporary job but i postponed looking for a new job until it was too late. TBH i have trouble getting and excelling in job interviews, i have experience but in a different kind of work (mostly food, which i want out of), with school i didn't have time to apply.


So i'm quitting in 2 weeks because i move for Uni, i handed in my notice in August saying i'm quitting the 20th of Sept. i don't move until the weekend (23rd) and the 21st-22nd i was gonna spend relaxing with friends and family, so i can get one last whole day exploring my hometown because i realized i'm gonna miss it. In my notice i asked for Tuesdays and Fridays off, and i'd be fine getting called in on Tuesday but Fridays are a definite no.

My mom wants me to work more, saying i have until the 22nd to work so why am i quitting the 20th? The last two days are to relax before i move, because Uni is going to be difficult. I'm tired of this job, i need my 2 days off a week to recover as i have back problems my family doesn't respect, my back takes a lot of stress because i have so much shit to do in so little time. We're understaffed, and it'll be worse when i leave but i don't have a choice, i'm moving and i want to enjoy my time left.

 we got in an small argument yesterday she said to get my clothes clean because i'm working tomorrow. I got pissed off because i asked for fridays off and she's telling me to pick up another day (i've already worked Tuesday to Thursday, if i work today i'd keep working Friday until Monday).",08Sep2017,0

222,"Long story short, I work as a software developer in an area that does not have much talent in my field. The role that I fill is critical to the success of our business and there's just not many developers around here. I have discussed with my boss and the CEO the fact that I could be making roughly $20,000 more per year down in the city, and they are fully aware of the fact that I am taking a paycut to work here. I really enjoy my job and am lined up for a managerial role in the near future. The benefits are great as well. I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and I do not want to sacrifice my happiness just to make a ton of money in a job I don't like. I live 45 minutes from here in a more populated and expensive location, so the salary issue is something that I think about a lot.

We will be having a discussion about my future at some point next year. I am trying to figure out what I want to say. Again, I love the work I do and the benefits are great, but I am not a fan of the remote location and I am underpaid. I have looked into other jobs and been through a number of interviews. A career change is **not** what I want. My employers have been amazing over the past few years and have given me a ton of flexibility.

What do I say? I don't want to sound arrogant by requesting a ridiculous salary. I don't even need a ridiculous salary. I just want a competitive salary that is fair and and reasonable considering the location. Do I ask if we can meet somewhere in the middle? I appreciate any input that you may have.",08Sep2017,1
225,"Hello all, I hope every one is doing ok today. I have To apologize in advance as this is probably going to be a long post. 

To start off a little history, wife and I have been married about 3 months but we've been together for almost 6 years and known each other for over 10, we've been best friends since day 1. she's 25 and I'm 24 for those curious. Our life together started off a little rough. She was having severe trouble at home and was fighting a losing battle to try to get her son. Fast forward about  6 months in to our relationship we get pregnant with our daughter. I'm working here and there and she's staying home for the most part and everything seems to be going ok. Well fast forward to about 4 months ago she starts working as a correctional officer at our local jail. I have to stay home as we only have one vehicle and she makes more money than I would at any job I'm qualified for. Anyway, shes currently there and decides she's not really happy in our relationship anymore and I understand. She tries to keep it together but we just cant anymore. We are back to just being best friends again we're looking at getting an apartment together and doing all of the things we planned, which i didnt mention but basically move out get a second car and just basically, be room mates. We're currently living with some of my family until we save enought to rent somewhere been here for awhile now. Now comes the part where I need advice,  she's an absolute sweetheart and we both have agreed on everything so far including the moving in together and everything. I saw instant relief wash over her once we both got our feelings out in the open. She was terrified of saying anything because we are best friends and she didn't want to hurt me. Well, that's the trouble. I know we love each other we just arent in love anymore and aren't sure if we ever were even though we agree there were a lot of times it felt like It. Anywho, my problem is i dont know what to do with myself anymore. I know we arent together and it's going to be quite awhile before either of us start seeing other people. How do i get rid of this feeling of being lonely? To clear things up her and my relationship is doing well as best friends and I know she'll always be here for me but the trouble is, she's all I have.. I mean i have family but they arent much help and havent been and frankly if they found out we made this decision they would kick her out and I dont want that. Am I upset about us not being together? or is it just the fact that she is all I've known since I was 18(ish). I truly don't have any friends i can fall back on for advice. I mean sure i have some people i went to high school with but almost all of them are drug addicts, in jail or simply, living their own lives and almost all of them i lost contact with. Not upon my wife's request just because i invested every spare minute I had into her and our relationship. 

Edit: upon writing this ive come to the conclusion that im not upset about our break up, I just have this overwhelming feeling of being alone. 

TL;dr my wife and i have been together for almost six years married for 3 months we mutually agreed to break up but remain best friends and be roommates for awhile. I have no friends and my family isnt great. How do i get rid of the feeling of being alone?",08Sep2017,2
226,"So, I'm having a really hard time right now dealing with everything. I am a father of three boys the oldest is deceased, a 4 year old and a four month old. My wife is a teacher. She leaves for work at 8. She drops the four year old at school on her way. I wake up around 8:30 feed the baby and go back to sleep until about 10:00. I get up, get dressed and get the baby dressed. Feed him again get thrown up on. Change my clothes. Get him strapped in the car seat and go pick up the 4 yo. Bring him home. Make him lunch, feed the baby. Get thrown up on change my clothes. Hold the baby until he falls asleep for an afternoon nap. Play with the four year old who has been upset since he got home because I can't play with him and take care of the baby. I finally eat something. Wife comes home from work. We usually end up arguing about something. I go to work feeling like an asshole. Get to work. I run a janitorial business. It's very small me and one employee. I deal with all the BS that that entails. Get home around 11:00-11:30. Fight sleep for a couple of hours so I can get some time to myself. Feed the baby again and then start the whole process over. All of this while trying to deal with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. I guess what I'm really asking is, is it wrong for me to ask to take a weekend away by myself or ask my wife to take the kids away for a weekend?

227,"Hi, I'm sure you have all heard this before so lets get down to it. It is my senior year in high school. I have only dated one girl in freshman year and things never got serious. She was suicidal and things started falling apart when I tried to get her help. So I haven't had a girlfriend in two years. Now in my anatomy class there is a girl. She is popular and I am not, but I am also not an outcast or nerdy. I keep a close group of friends and I am content with that.I am a quiet and don't really say much. I would rather listen to other people talk or listen to music. Usually people do the same, not really talking to anyone else in the class, but she would say hi to me. I know it means nothing but it would made me genuinely smile and I would say hi back. The first couple days, that was all we would say to each other, a casual greeting and goodbye. That grew into small talk as she needed help in the class and I kinda knew what I was talking about. By this point whenever I saw her in the halls, in class, or with her friends she would smile, get excited, and say hi to me. I know this doesn't mean that she likes me but it made me feel special. She then got sick and missed school for a couple of days and I missed seeing her. Now I am debating whether or not I should try to make something of our relationship, like dating. On one hand, I want a girlfriend and/or someone to take to prom later in the year. But, on the other hand, I don't want our relationship to last a year and that is it.

240,"So my girlfriend and I have been looking for an apartment to rent in the Jersey City, NJ area. We found an AMAZING apartment (900 sq ft, which is unheard of, gorgeous bathroom, huge open floor plan, full kitchen, washer/dryer, cable/internet included in rent, just overall perfect) for an unbelievable price. We contacted the owner through apartments.com and started discussing the details of the place. He claims that he bought the apartment for his daughter when she was in school, but now she lives back in North Dakota (where is currently lives) so he is looking to rent the place out. It all seemed OK, but then he mentioned that he can only deal through Air BnB - which I thought was a little sketchy, especially since we discussed being here long term (1-3 years). 

Should I be wary of this? OR is long term Air BnB a normal thing. 

This is our first time renting, so we are being a little cautious. ",08Sep2017,1
241,"Strap in this will be a long one.

Background:
I am 36 years old. Married to an amazing woman.  I have a Master's Degree in Public Administration w/ an emphasis in Student Services Administration.  I have 7 years experience in my field.  Mostly in counseling and advising.  I currently make $41k a year working for a university in a position that I really enjoy.  My wife owns a retail business that has not made any money for about 18 months, but it keeps her busy and makes enough to keep the lights on and provide a little to our livelihood.

My wife is about to complete her BS and wants to go to graduate school.  We have 2 kids, both girls, both from her previous marriage.  They split time with their dad and us.  They live primarily with him, but only a couple miles away.

I have never made a major move in my life and have never been one to take chances.  Pursuing the safe bet is why I live 35 miles from where I graduated high school.

However,  I am on the cusp of some major opportunity.

Working in higher ed means I have the capacity to make my wife's dreams of graduate school come true.  She identified a few programs that she is very interested in for her Master's.  One is University of Kentucky and one is at Auburn.  I applied for open positions with both of them.  I was offered interviews at both.  I am about to fly to Kentucky for a second interview.  Auburn interviewed me yesterday and that went really well.  I am expecting a chance for a second interview with them.  However, they are putting hiring on hold for a couple weeks while search team members go out of town.  This means an offer will most likely come from Kentucky before I finish interviewing with Auburn.  I am not sure how to handle this situation, as Auburn is probably the preferred job.  The pay is much higher, and the grad program is almost perfect for my wife.

Question 1:  how do I balance these staggered offers in an ethical way?

Next, our kids, although i strongly believe they are more interested in living with us full time have flat out said they are not willing to relocate. (One is 14 one is 12)  This puts a major stress on our plans.  We do not want to leave the kids behind, but we are 100% on board with them coming with us, in fact for us it is preferable.  We are not trying to leave them behind.  but in order to progress in our lives we have to go somewhere.  If I were not there stepdad it would be a ""too bad so sad"" situation, families relocate all the time.  But, as of now, its a big hurdle for the entire thing.  My wife (Their mother) is actually a little more on board with the ""summer and Christmas break"" thing than I am.  I don't want to leave them behind.

Question 2:  How do we reconcile with our kids not wanting to make the move with us?  What are some good tips and techniques to help them make an informed decision and support their decision?

I am afraid as all get out of moving 2,000 miles away and starting my life over again.  I have made peace with moving away from my family.  I will miss being near them but I have to do what is best for me.  

Question 3:  Has anyone here picked up and left your old life behind to start again somewhere you have never been?  I am not sure why I am so scared, but any tips on how to cope would be awesome.

Thank you.",08Sep2017,1

243,"I'm getting really frustrated and annoyed, and I'm almost done trying to be nice. There is a guy stationed in Hawaii (I just moved across the continental US from my old home state we used to go to high school together). I didn't know him very well then but he was always nice when we did talk though. We started getting back in touch several months ago (maybe four) and I was going through a very bad break up so talking to him was super nice and a great distraction from everything else. But he lived in Hawaii and I didn't and for me text messages only go so far, someone can say anything on a text message. And I told him this. Then I moved. And I wanted to start fresh in my new state. I wanted to meet new people and make new friends, and go on a date if I found a guy I really liked. I pretty much wanted to start fresh with no strings attached. And I told him this, and he got upset but said he understood. Except now I'm 99% sure he is trying to guilt trip me and ignoring what I said. He keeps talking about how much he loves me (which I have never once said to him, I've made very sure never to say it or make any implications that I did) and how much he hopes he gets the chance to be with me and show me how passionate he is for me. After Hawaii he said he was going to try to move to a duty station as close to me as he can get. He screenshots my pictures on Snapchat and said that when he is down he scrolls through them to make himself smile and happy. That would be sweet and all if I hadn't already told him several times that I am not interested. I'm beginning to get really pissed off about it.

Didn't have my first job until I was 20 and didn't start driving until I was 22. I've never been in a situation where I NEEDED to do more and I've always had someone to back me up when we had financial problems. This life has lead me to feel it isn't worth it to grind my ass off to live on my own. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have my own place and travel. But I  can't fathom working so hard for it. Basically I want but don't want to work my ass off for it. I am a hard worker when I want to be but I can't put my all into a job that I don't like or find tedious. I notice I tend to sabotage myself as well. Oh, they gave me extra hours this week? I'll just give them to co-workers so I can have more free time to do nothing. I have hobbies but still. 

I remember when I was at my old job and they looked at me like I was crazy when I said I wanted less hours. ""Don't you like money?"" They said. I told them I like my free time. However I am great at saving and managing my money. I had a nice lump sum of money saved up but I got terminated from my job due to being written up for stupid shit. But I had to use all of it while looking for another job. I always kept to myself and did my job but apparently it wasn't enough. Meanwhile other co-workers slack off and talk with their buds for 20 mins at a time but never get talked to. Deep down I am a greedy and stingy person, even to my family. Right now I don't make enough to cover my share of the rent and my family picks up the slack. But I'll spend money (not all on her) left and right to go out with my GF. But yet two years ago I was all butthurt over having to cover some bills for my family. Even if it was only $50.

I try not to complain while working but I just can't find a job that I am willing to work long hours for and not feel like I want to quit the same day. I realize I am just a bitch a very stubborn bitch. This foreign girl I was dating who worked in the states for 3 months at Mcdonalds never once complained about her job. There were times she worked 17 hour days because they asked her to stay. She even complained when they didn't give her enough hours.

(Some names and stuff will be changed)

So its my sophomore year of high school and I just moved to a new school. I don't know anyone and the whole school seems a little intimidating, but I get used to it and meet people. I made some friends and did all the normal high school stuff a typical person would do, then my problem happened. Since I didn't know anyone, I sat with my chemistry partner during lunch. She was a freshman and was nice and we got along fairly well, then more people started sitting with us. These people where from her middle school and we also got along, but I got along too well with one of her friends. We will call her Athena, because, I have my reasons. She transferred to my 7th period Chemistry class and we got along very well and we talked a lot during class and after school. We sat together during lunch too, until we eventually sat with other people but we still talked. We got along great and everything was fine, almost too fine. Eventually I developed feelings for her and I thought she did too. She would get close to me, she and I touched each other a lot (nothing sexual, just like hair and hands and stuff) and you know, other stuff. Spring break came around and she told me she had just started a relationship, and that got me a little upset. I then read an article along the lines of ""Don't live with regrets"" so I told her how I felt and then the inevitable came. She said that she was with someone and how she wanted us to still be friends and that she hopes this doesn't affect anything. It did. When we came back from spring break, we stopped talking to each other. I wanted to say something, but it seemed she didn't want to talk. I eventually tried to talk about what was happening and she agreed that we weren't talking as much as we did before. So we talked more but what we had faded. Soon we stopped talking all together and it was awkward being around her. At the end of the school year, I tried to be friends again but she didn't want to. I was, not heartbroken, but sad that I lost one of my best friends. I spent the summer a little bummed out and didn't get over her. So now we are back to today. She is in my physics class and I really want to talk to Athena and I don't know what to do or even if I should. I really need your help Reddit. Please

263,"So I'm very sure I'm doing this wrong ...a year on Reddit and I still don't know how to format ...
 
My apologies.

     
So to start off ,I went in-patient for suicidal intentions about a month ago now  ... Upon being discharged from  in-patient I was given scripts for Lexapro 20 mg I filled them at Walgreens and everything was great .

So very recently I ran low on meds and Walgreens called me with a refill reminder ,saying they could refill my Lexapro for me no problem .So they tell me that the med will be ready at 8:00 am the following day ...Which is great because I'm running low.

   Fast forward to the following day and at about 10 am the pharmacist calls me saying they contacted my psychiatrist from in-patient and that the psychiatrist wants to schedule an appointment with me before refilling my meds ...not so great... Mostly because the psychiatrist works a good 2 hours away from where I live in the in-patient facility and I won't be able to get there to see him anytime soon ....and no one mentioned an appointment to me when I was discharged from in-patient ...

 
 So I've been calling and calling ,and calling some more up to the in-patient facility to reach the psychiatrist desperately trying to get my meds filled for at least three days now ...I'm afraid to be without these meds, since I'm still very unstable the longer I go without hearing back from my psychiatrist the more anxious and ""dark"" for lack of a better word, my mind seems to get ... 
 
 I've been given the run around thousands of times. Every time I reach  the nurses I stress how important it is I reach this psychiatrist ...
 Then they tell me he has my contact info he     will reach me when he's not busy or with other patients 
While I understand he must be very busy as a psychiatrist , I just can't help feeling like I'm not worth enough to him for him to return my calls 
     I'm sure those poor nurses at the front desk are getting so tired of me by now . I don't know what else to do though.

 By now I'm completely out of meds and I'm afraid I'm going to have to go back in-patient because I feel like everything is falling apart ...I've tried him again like three times today .
                        
   Anyway what I want to ask is ,am I being irrational ? Is it me ? Am I the one being inpatient? ...I feel like this is my fault and perhaps I should have notified the doctor sooner ? ...but then I thought Walgreens handled it and I was so relieved I didn't have to  worry about anything ..Also I was hoping I could get some advice on what I should do now ? Do I still call repeatedly hoping to get ahold of him ? 
        
 Thank you any advice is appreciated right now ...also sorry for grammar mistakes when I'm an emotional mess I tend to throw grammar out the window .. hopefully this is legible .",08Sep2017,1

I'm looking for a song and I can't remember the name??? it was on my dads old mp3 and I've since been unable to find it?
I keep searching it as Schoolhouse Slaughter Song because thats the first thing that comes to mind
I can't really remember any words beyond ""click click"" at one point? but I'm not sure
Please help me find this song! I've been trying to find it for years
I'm assuming it's old?
 [ADDED INFO] Think it was, rock genre? I wasn't very knowledgable about genres back then since I was just getting into music and listened to whatever songs my dad had. As for Old, I recall it being like... 2005-2007? Ish? When I listened to it last so it could be that old or older.[ADDED] I think one line was ""Shoot her in her motherfucking head""?

He was desperate to save his cats so he went to Home Depot and bought some cardboard boxes, poked holes in them, and added sheets into the inside. He placed his cats into the boxes (1 cat per box) and they immediately freaked the fuck out. They cried and cried and scratched and tore giant holes in all of his boxes. Hurricane Irma is rapidly approaching and he didn't know what to do. He took his cats and put them in his car just free to roam and they freaked the hell out there too, they tore up his seats so he got them out as fast as he could.

267,"Hello.

Questions are at the end. English isn't my first language but I'm fairly sure you'll understand what I wrote here.

#Context of the situation:

Male, 23, Medicine Student, Final Year starting, Hospital assigned for this year is &gt;1,5h away from home in bus drive and &gt;60min in car drive, decided most efficient way to be on time *every day* was to move. 

#The good:

Found family friends near Hospital (5min on foot), they will lend room, I won't have to pay rent only my food.

#The Bad:

First time ever living alone, I can cook basic stuff, know how to do laundry and clean. I suck at organizing myself because I've always lived with very caring parents and I never tried to be truly independant.

#The Help:

Parents will come once a week to visit and bring supplies. If they can't come, will send me some money @Bank account (small budget).

#Now the questions for advice:

1. Already packed clothing enough to use for 7 days (assuming I use things once only, which I don't. Jeans can be reused a couple times). It this enough? is it too much and I should be more conservative? reusing T shirts?

2. Food. I'll have a kitchen available. Planning to keep a healthy diet of beans/fish+rice/pasta+vegetables. I think all these things can be frozen and even when prepared, they can last quite a bit (3-5 days?)- Suggestions? Any advice?

3. What are the basic things I should put in my backpack before I leave home? Already packed personal items like toothbrush, deodorant, soap. Can you name me some things?

4. PC(Desktop) will come with me. Most books are there, plus most of my entertainment and stress relief. Advice on safely packing for travel?

5. Any other advice is *very* welcome and damn, god knows I'm messy with my things and need all the help I can get.

268,"My supervisor is no good. She does a whole list full of unacceptable, unprofessional things. I'm meeting with the head of my department to discuss all this, but I'm not sure how far to go. You see on top of the normal horrible boss stuff, some serious legal shit has occurred. For example coworkers have been forced to share log in information and sign in other people under their log in, both being massive security violations. The other stuff is all fixable, but if I bring this up it could mean serious serious trouble for some people. Now I don't mind getting my supervisor fired, but I'm worried about the fall out from it, like will my coworkers who did what they were told and shared the codes be held just as guilty, even though our boss forced us.

269,"I'm currently 22, and am doing all I can to try to be more independent in general. Of course, it's important to rely on others when needed, as I'm not gonna make myself out to be this almighty strong god. But at the same time, I'm done relying on people all the time. I've learned that people won't be there for you all time; I want to be able to fend for myself. 

I plan to find another job so I can save enough to buy both a car and live on my own (well, for the car, I'm studying for my drivers permit and then my license, so I obviously need that first). I'm also teaching myself to cook in order to feed myself along with the rest of my family. I already clean as much as possible and do my own laundry. 

I want to know how to be independent, not only in living on my own, but also financially and emotionally. How not to depend on a guy to make me feel loved or a group of friends to make me feel wanted. How not to measure my beauty comparing me to other girls and just own who I am. How to be my own person and achieve the goals I have for myself. 
Any suggestions are welcome!

271,"I've met this girl in the past few weeks, and I feel that I like her.
Lately, I began thinking about asking her out and maybe later confessing my feelings.
She always posts about never having a boyfriend or things like that, or that she thinks she has a cold heart. I also never had a gf, but in the past 5 years I've had 3 crushes, and those the have rejected me, some of that has been the cause or a multiplier of a feeling of sadness that once evolved into clinical depression (I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist like 2 years ago) and left me with the fear of being rejected, which can lead to weeks of depression/sadness because I'm too hard on myself.
 
So what I'm afraid of doing is what I always do, when I get rejected because my feelings towards the girl are still somewhat strong, I cut all forms of communication, just to help me move on. But it is sure I'll be seeing her every week for the next 2-3 months, so I don't know how will it be if things go wrong. 

What should I do? ",08Sep2017,3
272,"My mum is 56 so not elderly, I have read many posts sort of relating to what I'm trying to explain but all parents involved were 80+ so I'm not sure it is relevant to me. I am a single child and she has been the only parent for 15 years. We have no other family. I am her world and she is an incredibly caring, will always want to help everybody type of person but lately I have found myself snapping at her more and more basically telling her to stop being a bitch. 
When asking a member of our friendship group about her mothers upcoming birthday and whether we were going to organise going out for a meal like we usually do with birthdays, friend said she would find out when her mum is working and we will work around that. Two people couldn't make the suggested day so we said why not do X day instead. My mum ranted to me about why not do the original day, if they can't come then so be it. I told her it wasn't her birthday and therefore her place to say who attends the meal etc. 
We were leaving the house a few days ago and got caught behind someone clearly trying to reset their satnav or something and were hardly moving. No biggie we're not in a rush. My mum reaches across me, blocks my view and slams on the horn without even giving this person a chance. They hadn't realised we were behind them and stalled (we were on a residential road so not a big deal but it really shook me what she did).
We went to see some friends at their stables and the conversation got to how far their field was and how long they had to walk to get to it (extremely hilly area), and my mum said something along the lines of ""if we had a horse here I'd want the field furthest away so she (meaning me) would have to walk more and loose weight"" - the look on our friends faces as they turned to me highlighted that they had just realized the extent of her fat shaming me, and they looked horrified. 
These are just a few examples of her behavior, she is increasingly louder (almost shouting), arrogant and complaining, snapping at  people, being very ""bitchy"" rude behind other's backs and I don't know what triggered it. I'm embarrassed and forever telling her to stop it or be quiet but don't know what I can say to make her stop.

273,"I can't get rid of this state of self loathing, self hatred or whatever it's called. 

I'm a 30-year-old male, over weight, and never dated. I've always been selfconscious my entire life and was always the quiet one in class afraid to speak up for fear of having my opinion judged. I graduated late at the age of 25 with a bachelors degree in Business Administration after switching majors a few times. I was hired half a year later on a trial basis with a company that kept me on for about three months before deciding that I wasn't the type of fit they were looking for and let me go despite working my ass off there. 

Still living with my parents for financial support I began to job search like anyone else let go from their previous job. There were interviews here and there but I know that my closed off personality doesn't really afford me the best first impressions. The search turned into six more months with no end in sight. Nothing was going my way. I started to feel discouraged. 

Another year went by and I started having thoughts about what my purpose was, what I was meant to do in life. I thought maybe I could go back to school but ruled that out as a waste of time and money. 

5 years later I hate myself. I'm thinking about all the things that I probably did wrong, things that could have been, places I could have moved to for better opportunites, places I could have visited had I had the money saved from working, how I should have gone back to school. 

I had to sell my car for parts because it wouldn't pass inspection anymore and I didn't have the money to fix it. I have to borrow one of my parent's cars now to do anything.

I have to excuse myself everytime someone asks me how I'm doing because I start to cry now as it makes it real everytime how much I suck at life. I cry as a watch my classmates and friends get married and start familes, something that I've wanted myself but can't see happening in my current state. I can't look anyone in the eye anymore, I lie saying everything is fine, afraid of how they'll judge me if I told them the truth.

I've still never dated. I live in the middle of nowhere, the pool of potential people to meet from your parent's house is damn small and when you're overweight and selfconscious about everything you're not exactly ready for the dating scene or any scene for that matter.

My job search is pretty nonexistant now. I physically can't get myself to even look at a job search page because it reminds me about how underqualified I'd probably be applying to anything. How weight will be the first thing an employer sees as my first impression regardless of my introverted personality. And after so many years of being unemployed I can't get myself to accept even a low wage job because I subconsciously don't want all these past years to be a reminder of how much time I wasted. How I could have just started at a low wage job five years ago and risen up the ranks had I known I'd be in the position I'm in now. 

I hate myself for doing nothing to find work now. I hate myself for being afraid to do anything. I hate myself for wasting all this time. I hate myself for not choosing a better degree. I hate myself for not dating to potentially get married and start a family sooner. 

I hate myself. And I have no idea what to do with myself. ",08Sep2017,0

275,"Within my group of friends, one friend offended me pretty deeply on a personal level not too long ago and I cannot seem to get over it. We will call the friend ""Tom."" 

It involved one of my children at the time and a comment Tom made in a conversation that he was not even part of. Without going into it too much, someone other than Tom kept using the word ""retard"" or ""tard"" to offend me on purpose (not joking around) and I asked that individual to refrain from using that word as I had a son who is special needs if he wanted to be taken seriously and continue the conversation. My son had also recently been bullied with the word. I got angry and called the individual the name right back at first. I'll be clear on that. My son is not retarded but has autism and a few other disorders. I stated all this to the individual (not Tom) of why it's offensive to me (not to mention I think it takes away from the meaning of the word for people that are in fact retarded. To use it so loosely. And the fact it is used as a slur in other cases like the one that was happening.) and he didn't have anything more to say. 

It was then that Tom, who had not been present in the conversation at all, jumped in and was basically arguing that it would be okay to call my son those words since he has autism and is not retarded. I argued that those words, other than when used actually to describe someone with actual retardation, were being used as a insult. Especially in that situation. Not to mention that I just explained myself in full as to why it was offensive to me personally. He chose to ignore all that and pressed on while fully knowing my son has autism and some other disorders as well.

A little context to my friendship with Tom. We are coworkers and would hang out all the time at work. Outside of work we were involved as well. I know his wife from high school. I would very often talk about my son in some context on a daily basis. So its not like ""he didn't know"" prior that my son was special needs. I think that is also why I am so offended as well. Because he knew before and still continued. Not to mention HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND. That's not what true friends do. Not to mention many many times I've defended him against people who want to slander him behind his back. I really felt some huge betrayal aside from being offended and mad.

Our mutual friends were all on my side immediately. Asking him ""wtf and what are you doing? You are supposed to be his (my) friend."" Tom immediately tried to make it all about him or political or ""poor him."" Everything but apologize or make amends of any kind. In fact he doubled down and avoided me. At one point I cornered him, after a month went by, and he told me we are not friends. So no closure.

Some time has passed. My mutual friends will try to include me in activities that include him but I want no part of anything that includes him. I have yet to catch him ""one on one"" but I think I might say some nasty things if that were to happen. He tries to act like nothing happened. Its hard. It makes me not want to hang out with our mutual friends but that isn't right. To just ""write them off"" for something he did right? Everyone seems to be over it but me.

My wisdom teeth are finally coming out and it's painful as all hell, as you'd expect. I haven't run into many 'afflictions' before, so I haven't needed to take any kind of medicine before, really.

Now I'm tryna numb the pain a little bit with some paracetamol, but I honestly just can't swallow the tablets.

I've tried the water soluble ones but they're pretty expensive and taste horrible, but at least I was able to keep them down.

I developed a game that requires a third-party, where we get four cups, fill each of them with water and then one with two of the soluble ones, and then I have someone swap them around while my eyes are closed. I pick one of them up and down it like a shot, and if I don't happen to get the right cup on my first two tries, I fill them up and start again.

279,"I work in a specific department that only has three employees: my manager, myself and another person who is considered my equal. In our business, our job is to basically make sure the feedback our 'agents' are given is consistent and we are constantly working with their direct supervisors on making sure they (the agents and technically the supervisors) are treating our customers and business correctly. Quality Assurance, if you will. 

I have been at this job for a little less than two years, but I have managed to move up fairly fast. This specific position I have only been in for a little over 3 months. The person who was hired on with me got fired about two months ago, so I've been doing it alone since then and the new work partner just started two weeks ago. 

The new partner was in a lateral position by company standards before this, but she has never done this job. It is very different from her last post, save for the pay. That being said, she has been with our company for 9 years, although it took her about 5 years to get to her first real promotion, which was the position she was in before coming to my side.

I realize it is new but I am very frustrated with her. I have been told since my last partners sudden firing that I would be the one tasked with onboarding her. Teaching her the ropes, letting her know what to expect, literally train her in the position. I am a people person through and through and I love teaching. I also am very easy to get along with and open to new ideas. But she.... She knows everything. Even things she doesn't know. I constantly have to correct her (nicely), the answers I give her are not correct in her mind, and she tells me how to do EVERYTHING!!! Most of the things she asks me, I will answer her, she will argue and invariably end up asking our manager, who then solidifies exactly what I said. He typically follows that with 'Just ask her, she should have already told you that.' (Her being me) and I HAVE!!!! It is so frustrating because then I look like I am not doing a good enough job of teaching her how to do the job. And I can understand why she wouldn't necessarily take what I say so easily, she has been there longer but also she has been told I was doing her training. I just don't think it was stressed enough that right now, I am her superior. She is my trainee. Couple that with the fact that she literally corrects the way I WALK! The way I do anything and everything, really! What the shit is that? Basically I am super annoyed and stressed and feel that my manager set me up for failure and that I am working with the world's biggest know it all.

I'm starting to realize this field is not for me. I always doubted it but I figured I would get use to it later on which never happened. I'm kinda lost at what to do, I don't think the two years was wasted I just don't know where to go from here and out. I feel like I'm too deep in but why do something you hate for no reason? Could use some guidance and where to look next.",08Sep2017,1
301,"My sister introduced to me her friend about a month ago. I took her out on a date and afterwards she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship. Then a week or so later, she says she wants to go out again. We do for about a week and now she says she isn't ready for a relationship again. Is there anyway to keep her? I really like her and don't want to just give up but I don't know if there's a way where I win.",08Sep2017,1
302,"Hey all, 
Backstory, the girl I've had a crush on for a while moved in (because we were friends and I needed another roommate/housemate) and it gets worse every day. We walk to classes together, watch movies together, eat together, etc. I don't think she thinks of me that way.

I don't want to ruin our friendship/make it awkward since we'll live together until May. Help?",08Sep2017,1
