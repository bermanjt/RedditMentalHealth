2,"Ok so a long story and I do well in English class so my grammar is shitty. 

This story starts 4 years ago when I was a senior in high school. I started dating a freshman girl and she quickly became my first love. And as it is with first loves they are the ones that hurt the worse. So we date the whole year and everything is wonderful. Well I was going to the army so we knew we couldn't really continue our relationship in reality so we broke up (more her choice than mine). Well I go off to the army and I didn't make it through basic training so I came back home. Me and her continued  our friendship because after all we had no ill will towards each other but we never dated again. When I came home I found out she started dating a friend of mine. I didn't really care because they were their own people and I just wanted her to be happy (no matter how much it hurt me). Me and her continue talking for years always being friendly with each other. Well last summer she calls me saying her boyfriend cheated on her and they broke up and she wanted to come talk to me. Me being naive I thought she just wanted to talk. However we ended up having sex and that was the first time we had sex, for a time I felt like I was back in high school and had her back. The next day she leaves my house and then proceeds to block me on everything. After a day she texts me and says she went back to her boyfriend and said if she talks to me he would hurt me. ( I didn't care because I knew I could kick his ass easy) well dispite her boyfriends warning we continue to talk and she came over to my house several times after and sometimes we had sex. Each time after we have sex she blocks me and doesn't talk to me for a few days. And then after this going on for a while we have sex and she blocks me for what seemed like forever and I started to move on. Sometimes I would think of her and it would hurt and I'm not gonna say I never cried over her. Well a few weeks ago she comes back in my life and I'm estatic we have been talking almost everyday since. And we hangout a lot. She made it clear to me that we werent in a sexual or romantic relationship anymore we were just friends. I was fine with this. Come to find out since I have been blocked she has been sleeping around which she can do sex feels good I'm not faulting her. Now the cause of my current pain. She has been sleeping with my roommate lately and I tried to act like I don't care because I isn't my place anymore. However it hurts a fuck ton and I don't know if I should say something to her or just let them have their fun because like I said sex feels good and I will never fault anyone fire having sex. I try to act like I don't care but now matter how much I lie to myself her or my roommate I still care about her. I'm sorry if this makes no since I am hurting alot and would just like advice from some people who are truly third parties in this whole scheme. Thank you in advance and again sorry for my bad grammar.",28Mar2017,1

4,"Hi everyone! I'm writing an episode of a show where three guy friends argue about what love or true love is. (Loosely inspired by Plato's Symposium.) The episode starts off at one of their places drinking beer and playing the game ""fuck, marry, kill."" Then from there, they start arguing about what love is. They all have different ideas, talking over each other at times and challenging each other. One guy talks about science, the other is more philosophical. There's a lot of comedy among the three friends. I just need a way to establish for the audience upfront that this particular episode doesn't move away from this scene. I need them to know that in the next 30 minutes, they're just going to be experiencing this real time conversation. I want to set up the right expectation. How should I establish this? Any ideas would be so helpful! Thank you!",28Mar2017,1
5,"I'm always so jealous of my one friend named Katie. She is so much more outgoing than I am, she is so charismatic, and she has friends EVERYWHERE. I, on the other hand, am a quiet,introverted,and shy person with only a handful of good friends that I don't even think like me. And my friends like her so much more. It makes me depressed to even face her because while I like her, I'm so jealous of her that I don't like her also. All of my friends like her, and I feel like I'm an outsider in my friend group. I'm the quiet one because I'm afraid of what they think of me. I hate that I'm so insecure, but can't help it because I know this feeling and felt it way too much. She's so funny, and while I think I'm funny too, I'm still not as funny or as well-liked as her. I tried talking to these people at my work, and they don't seem too into me. However, whenever Katie comes along, those same people are laughing until tears comes out of their eyes. She's better at everything. When I introduce her to people I know, those people gravitate towards her and away from me. I'm afraid to say anything because they'll just say the same thing. ""We all like you!"" It sure doesn't feel that way. This probably stems from the fact that I have such low self esteem and confidence that I feel like no one likes me. It sucks and I wish I could stop feeling jealous and sorry for myself. I wish I could stop caring about others since they don't seem to care about me.",28Mar2017,1
6,"I (24m) met this girl (23f) online a little over a month ago. We went on multiple dates and each one went great. She always said she had a great time and wanted to go out again. Well, fast forward to 10ish days ago. She messaged me saying that she is too busy and stressed to be in a relationship (I understand cause she does have a lot going on) at the moment and did not want to lead me on. I took the hint and told her I enjoyed getting to know her. I respected her honesty and was going to move on, however, she responded (last message from her) saying she wanted to stay in touch and was open to the possibility of continuing things in the future but as of right now she could not handle a relationship. I was completely fine with this because its been awhile since I liked someone like I do her so I was willing to wait. Last week I sent her a couple ""Hope you have a great day"" messages and after not getting a response, I regretfully signed into the dating site we met on to see if she was online. She was. This doesn't make sense to me because of her saying she was not able to handle a relationship right now. After over a week of not hearing from her, I have assumed she is no longer interested.

I guess I am just looking for insight as to why she said all that stuff just to disappear when she easily could have not sent her last message.

8,"I am 17(M), and I am currently a junior in high school. I am having issues to continue my life at the moment. I am currently failing most of my classes and have more than double the maximum absences for all my classes because I much rather sit in my car for 6 hours than go to school. My school has an amazing attendance remediation program and I still can't get myself to go to those. On top of all of this over the past couple of years, I have slowly let myself go hygienic wise. I used to keep up with daily routines but now, I can barely do it. I don't know what to do. I understand I need at least a high school diploma to even get through life, but I have been given dozens of second chances to fix my mistakes and I can't even bring myself to do those things. Everyday my closest friends push me to go school and to stay in school and not leave in the middle of the day. But, I leave anyways and just tell them it's okay, I can just make it all up in the future. But, the future comes and I still don't do it. I am almost 100% certain that if I stay back a year, I will not go back there. I keep telling myself, that if I start eating better, and start working out, and get back into daily hygienic lifestyle that I will feel better about myself and that will motivate me to do well in school.

10," I was studying mechanical engineering at university, but I wasn't feeling well and wondered if that was what I really wanted, which led me to a strong depression, disappointment and I've finally gave up the course. I'm already 24 and have never had a job, now I find myself kinda of lost and not knowing what to do with life. I have some money saved from the allowance I receive from my parents, but I do not want to depend on their help anymore. So I've been thinking about several ideas on how to start a small business to get back to school without continuing to feel like a burden for my parents.  

I already thought about:  
* UV printing  
* Laser Cutting Machines  
* 3D printing  

What kind of business should I enter?

15,"So for a while now I've been having sleep trouble. I'm wondering if it's anxiety or paranoia induced, because when I'm trying to sleep at night, I hear sounds like the house settling, and every tiny little noise I've heard for years makes my ears prick, keeping me alert and anxious about an intruder or something stupid. I can't shut it off.


The night before last, I went to bed at 11pm, and I did not have a single minute of sleep all night. At 6am I just gave up and got out of bed and went about my day, exhausted. Last night I slept 10 hours like a log, presumably because I was so so tired.


It's 1.30am now, and again I'm having the same problem. Every tiny little noise is making me anxious and keeping me awake. Like sometimes I'll hear a sound of the house settling and no joke, my heart will start racing.

17,"So I traveled to my hometown last week to help my parents get the house ready to sell and a old memories came rushing back all week long.

A few days ago I remembered that multiple times in my middle and highschool years a very pretty/popular girl would approach me in a crowded area and ""Confess her love/like for me"". That is to say, mess with me so her and her group of friends could laugh. Because I was the nerdy kid with few friends that people would rush to be in my work groups but ignore otherwise.

This must've happened 4 or 5 times all in different ways by completely different girls.

I realize now at the age of 27 that this probably been affecting my relationships with women ever since. See, I don't do very well with asking women out or being attractive to them(though I lift heavy 5-6 days a week and now have a very broad build). Unless a setting has forced repeated contact: work or friends and even then I only seem to attract those I don't care for or who are just looking for a boyfriend because they hate being single for long.


How do I fix this?",28Mar2017,1
18,"I never thought I'd have this problem after high school. In college, living with three other people, 2 rooms of 2. For the first half of the semester the guy I room with was fine, we hit it off, even played stuff together, got along. Then he met guys on Xbox, high schoolers or younger (I hear them through his mic and they have bed times). We're in a confined space and my PC is set up right next to his TV, no other way to do it.

I have headphones on constantly, blaring music and games and still hear him. He does it every night. I'd say something but he's extremely irritable and easily angered, slammed and broke a heavy cabinet door one day and he's 100 lbs bigger than me. I can't escape it or I wouldn't care as much. I am on my PC a lot, and have nowhere else to move it or believe me I would have by now. I'm not sure what to do. There's about 5 weeks left and I'm trying to get through it but it's been about 4 so far and I can't handle it. It doesn't help that he yells instead of talks, but then rages, throws shit, he's just an asshole when he's playing. And the sighing, like a teenage princess not getting her way, always yelling at the game.

What can I do? We had an incident earlier in the semester where he *yelled* at me after asking him why he was slamming shit and I was legitimately scared, I've never seen or been yelled at like that before, and I just asked what was wrong. I'm sure I'm not handling this the best way either but I don't know if even politely asking him to be quiet is the best move.

Part of me is okay with it, I get it, it's cool he made friends. The other half wishes for just a day he'd shut the fuck up. It's gone on too long so I'm sure he feels like I have no problem with it, entirely my fault. Any advice here?",28Mar2017,1
19,"This year is my last year of high school, in a few months I will be going off into the real world. My problem is, I don't know what to do for money or a career. 

Ever since I was 8 I have constantly been on or surrounded by, computers. I started programming when I was 13, I coded as a hobby, it was something to do to make fun programs that did some stuff, or mods for the games I play. Obviously, a lot of you are probably thinking, ""go into computer science"". 

The problem is my GPA is just under the minimum for most colleges, my math skills are trash, problem solving or debugging is a massive pain the ass for me. Coding has become less of a hobby and more of a, ""look, you have no other skills, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL MAKE ANY REAL MONEY"" which makes me not want to program at all. It makes programming stressful, it makes any problem solving with a computer stressful. Because I am constantly trying to compete with anyone else in terms of knowledge, because I know they will have a better education than me, so I will have to prove myself way more. I want to have a different career and go back to the time when my fucking life didn't ride on computer science. Does anyone here have any advice for finding a career? ",28Mar2017,2
20,"So i get that this is a pretty common sense question, but i am the worst at confrontation. 

So i brought two of everything to my apartment, two spoons, forks, plates, bowls. However, my roommate has a habit of using my things. I typically wouldn't mind as long as she washed them after using them, but she leaves her dishes to ""soak"" for days at a time, the worst was a week and a half. They get moldy and smelly and it really is kind of disgusting. I just want to enjoy a bowl of cereal without having to wash her crusted food off of my dishes to get there. 

So i guess my question is is how can i write this note without sounding super passive aggressive? (She already stole my toothpaste last week and i got upset so i feel as though she'll be more defensive, not to mention that i've asked her several times to stop leaving the heat on 85 because i get nosebleeds).

25,"I spend an hour and a half a day at or transiting to a religion class each day. I have to wake up at 5:45 in the morning to go to this class, which means to get 8 hours of sleep I would have to go to sleep at 9:45 each night. I have no belief in this religion and consider this a complete waste of time that puts a lot of stress on me. In the short-term it has no chance of getting better unless I tell my parents I no longer believe, but I’m concerned about using that as a solution because I think there is the chance that they will go all-in on trying to re-convert me forcing me to read many chapters of scripture a day, and maybe even attend more religion classes in addition. Long-term there is opportunity for improvement because next school year I plan on taking 4+ AP classes and my parents are often understanding about academics. (i.e. I can tell them I’ll be too busy for the class). I doubt this will be enough to convince them to let me quit the class outright though. I just want to wake up in the morning without thinking that I’d rather be dead than live through the next two hours of my life. I know it's not the biggest problem in the world, but it is pretty infuriating. Any thoughts on what to do in this situation welcome. (Religion is Mormonism for any curious.

The one thing that I truly enjoy is robotics with my friends, however my parents have taken that away from me due to a C in one of my AP classes, this has happened since freshman year and a B- is enough to get me in trouble. They don't take my phone or laptop, but rather an after school activity that brings a little light to my day.  Even when I had a B early in the semester they wouldn't let me stay after school and in my perspective I see them as major dicks. Aside from robotics they've forbidden me from doing soccer in high school the second most enjoyable thing for me.

31,"I know I shouldn't have read his messages, but he has been so sullen lately I wanted to see if I could find the reason why, so I read a few. 

A few details: He only just turned 18 and I am his older sibling. I am in my 20s. But we both live in the same house. We sometimes get on really well, and other times we argue a lot. He has a bit of a temper and goes off on one easily. I normally fight back also.

When I was reading his messages, I saw he was messaging two friends particularly. He has told them that he is depressed, suicidal, starves himself so he will pass out and cuts. They wrote back in a very supportive way, they weren't dismissive or anything, so that is good. I just don't know what to do next..

Do I tell our parents? We are a bit of an awkward family and do not really talk about or share stuff like this, but I will do it if it will help him. 

This may sound bad, I know this is serious, but I think it is also driven a bit by attention. He never had a huge amount of friends at school, but now he has more since finishing recently and I think he likes having friends who care about him, and I think he enjoys the care they show when he says this stuff. 

But that is not to say this stuff is false, he has been withdrawn and in his room more lately (he tells his friends this too)...and I am worried about the suicidal references the most...so what should I do? If I mention it to him I feel like he would get very angry and awkward and not respond well..but I feel the same thing would happen if I mention it to my parents too. But I don't want anything to happen to him and I want him to be happier. I am just at a loss of how to deal with this.

32,"I just graduated in December with a degree in teaching. I recently passed all the tests to get my teaching licensure, and I'm craving a change of scenery. My boyfriend and I are thinking of moving to the largest city in the state so I can get a teaching job at one of the inner-city schools. He's a computer programmer, and does music production as a side-business. He's wanting to move to the city to get more clients, both musical and programming gigs.

She has in the past suggested that I get a job teaching in the current district I work in (I'm an instructional assistant K-5 currently) but the district is in financial ruin and I'm like, 90% sure my school will be closed by next year. 
My mom has also twisted this back around somehow to being upset that my boyfriend ""would drag me so far away from home just so he can get work.""

34,"About a year and a half ago, I entered my first year of post-secondary enrolled in my local universities theater program. I worked super hard, got solid grades in the first term, straight A's in the spring semester, and was laden with praise by my classmates and teachers. The thing about the program is that in the first year they select roughly 40 students and only take about half the students into the remaining two years of the program. Although in my year, we only had 29, so it was pretty clear who was getting in and who wasn't. I and my friends were incredibly excited for the second and third year and went into the audition for those years with blazing confidence.

Two weeks after my audition, I received a letter informing me that I hadn't made it into the second year.

I'm not going to sugarcoat things, I was absolutely devastated. The plan I had for the next two years of my life was completely obliterated. In a weird way, the whole rejection made me completely lose my drive and passion for performing. I've always had issues with my self-esteem/self-confidence, and both were completely shattered by my rejection. Many of my friends who made it into the second year of the program were shocked to learn that I'd been rejected. They told me I was a great actor and how I deserved to get into second year. I can't say exactly how, but their sympathy only made it a thousand times worse. To make matters even more horrible, my job had confiscated all my shifts for all the work I missed while working on my final performance in the program. It took me almost two months to get them all back.

I tried to make the best of my situation. I focused on other interests I have like scriptwriting and photography, and for a little bit, I thought everything would be ok. But then I went back to school.

I really had no choice but to go back to the school where my theater program had been. I would've gone elsewhere, but I was so convinced I would get into the second year that I didn't bother applying anywhere else. I wanted to take the term off to work, but I was under immense pressure from my parents to continue my schooling, so I enrolled in general studies and hoped for the best.

I felt awkward socializing with the people in my program. I felt like a complete outsider as they discussed things like their courses and the practicum show they'd be performing in. I felt as though I was constantly catching up with them rather than sharing experiences together. It took me a month before I realized how much I despised the courses I was taking. I'd be sitting in my history class listening to my egotistical prof drone on and on about the Egyptians or whatever and text a friend in the program to find out what they were up to only to hear that they were learning Shakespeare scenes or studying stand-up comedy or whatever it was that was a thousand times more fun than what I was doing. I tried to start an Improv club to fill the hole left by my theater school rejection, but I only hosted one successful meeting before people stopped showing up. I had to put it out of its misery to take away from my misery. I gave general studies another go in the second term with different courses before dropping everything except for one course and working full time instead.

As of now, I'm twenty years old, unemployed (recently fired from my job over a scheduling disagreement) living with my parents and quite frankly feeling like shit. I have tentative plans of attending film school for screenwriting in January. But the application process is fraught with errors and is honestly driving me semi-insane. My parents and peers often ask me why I don't just start acting again, but its not that simple. The drive is non-existant and I don't know how to get it back. I've been thinking that I never enjoyed acting that much in the first place and I just liked the program because it was different than a more standard program for something like business or psychology. I know everyone experiences rejection and what matters is how you rebound against it and blah blah blah but I just feel depressed constantly and I feel like there's a ""hole"" in my life and I don't know what to fill it with. I try to stay in touch with my friends as best as I can, but work/looking for work takes up so much of my time. I really do want to rebound from all of this and make something of myself before I die. I'm trying really hard to do it but nothings working :(.

I've tried managing my symptoms, but every time I check the the Maslach Burnout Inventory (recently upticked to a solid 75/75), I wonder if I've rock bottom yet. Reading past Burnout posts in Reddit, it seems most people fixed it by getting out. Would any of you kind souls be able to help me out here with how to handle burnout?

I went into medicine initially with the intent to help patients manage their disease. I really enjoyed developing relationships with them in medical school and working with them to understand their disease... to empower them. To take care of the sickest of the sick was my mission. 

Now, I find myself in the awkward position of wishing I had never gone into medicine in the first place. I'm... tired. I'm exhausted, I don't care about other people's feelings and I don't even know what the point is anymore. I feel like all I do is take care of people who refuse to learn about their disease or drug addicts, both of whom just want an easy answer to be fixed so that they can continue doing the same thing. 

I'm tired of the administrative bullshit. I'm tired of having be yanked around in the system. I'm tired of having to justify every step and jump through every hoop. I'm tired of the testing. I'm tired of coming home exhausted, to be on the verge of tears about having to go in the next day. I'm tired of being angry and lashing out at my loved ones. I'm tired of feeling nothing when I'm not angry. I feel so numb. 

I just don't feel like I can get out right now. Between the debt and the decade of commitment, I don't know if I can start fresh.

38,"Hello, I posted this on /r/rants but I wanted to ask here too.

I have a sister who is 9 years my senior and honestly I have never liked her. It makes me feel like a bad brother sometimes but holy shit I just cannot stand her, I see almost nothing in her worth liking and the thing is most people I meet I see plenty worth liking and very little, if anything, to dislike so it is not like I am a misanthrope.

She will act kind to you when you are doing things her way or whatever she wants, but the second you stray from that her 2nd face comes out. She starts to be EXTREMELY condescending with the way she talks, she will raise her voice, talk to you as if you are a complete and total idiot. She expects you to drop everything you are doing to immediately help her if she asks for it. She is incredibly insecure and will find anyway to take a joke that isn't even directed at her personally. Even when she is pretending to be nice, you can tell based off her tone of voice that she thinks the person she is talking to is stupid and beneath her, do you know what I mean by that?

It is not just her mistreatment of me that bothers me, but the people we work with or my mother or father. She has made my mother cry I don't know how many times and when that happens or when I see her mistreat someone at work it disgusts me. Not taking out my emotion on other people and trying to treat people the best I am capable of has always been paramount in my life and the person she is the antithesis of what I try to be.  I can't go to her and talk to her because she will just find ways to point the finger at me and blame me.

For God knows what reason my parents have always tolerated her behavior and expected me to put up with and acted like I am at fault if I complain so I often feel forced to tolerate her shit. I work with her (family business, father owns it) so at the moment I have to put up with her as well until I can finally get the fuck away from things.

Am I in the right? Is she actually an asshole? I have lived with this my entire life so I don't fucking know sometimes. Especially because my parents tolerate it, it fucks with my mind like I am the wrong one.

42,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this. But any help anyone can give would be very appreciated. 

T is my friend, she has a daughter who is 12. Daughter was sexually, emotionally, and physically abused by her father when he had sole custody, and sexually abused while in foster care. She got custody back two years ago. Daughter has always been strangely affectionate, and strangely sexual to the point I could have her at my house without her mother because of her behavior towards myself and my husband. It made us both uncomfortable and neither of us felt it was appropriate to have her unsupervised. 

Lately her behavior has escalated. She was caught have a sexual relationship with 15 year old cousin. (obviously that is the cousins fault. ) and has been sending nude pictures to strangers on the internet. T has also had complaints of Daughter acting provactively towards other adult males in your life.  And acting out with violence to T and the grandmother when they try to stop her. They took her Phone and computer and found out she has been stealing other people's phones to get online. 


She asked me for advice, and to help her find some resources or websites she could find other mothers who have been through similar things. I know the behavior is not unheard of in abuse victims, and I've tried to at least get her to understand it's likely a cry for help. But I have a clue how she cold even begin to help her. And my kids are only 3, so it's not something I have been through personally. I told her she should probably get her into therapy asap, but the mental health care around isn't great. 

Can anyone point me to some support sites or websites with information that might be able to help? ",28Mar2017,0

I would think of pursuing a physics bachelor's degree as a safe undergrad to go either way. If I go medical I will go towards a doctor or PA (leaning towards PA). And of I go towards space, I would probably go for some kind of engineering or a higher physics degree. 

These two fields really intrigue me. They both require a lot of hard work and time to get into the field. I have a small background in medicine and no background in physics.

I've always cared for her, she's become the most important thing in my life, and we're not even a thing, just really close friends. But we never acted like we could be a thing. Ever. I've always kind of looked the other way when it came to that subject with her, of what she and i would be like together. I know her better than anyone ever will, i'm not joking. We know pretty much everything about eachother, except this obviously. Problem is, she recently got dumped, so i'm trying more to be the supportive friend, helping her through it, and not hit on her and make her jump to the next relationship asap, i and i've had a huge crush on her before, which didn't end well with her, so now i'm terrified of thinking about this again, because my feelings are resurfacing, or at most, i'm taking notice of them always having had been there. I never liked her exboyfriend, honestly. He's very douchey and cunty, even more now that i had accepted it and moved on and started to like him being with her. Nothing has ever mattered to me more than seeing her happy, no matter how, i always want her to be happy, and i think that's what made my feelings for her come back, multiple times, even when she was in that relationship. She is the greatest person you'll ever meet, funny, smart, beautiful. She's a fucking goddess basically, and just talking with her about anything made my days better than any other girl i've tried hookin up with. It always comes back to her somehow. She's also the only real friend i have, so that's also there. I always imagined what we would be like together, is that sad? Weird? I'm sorry. But if you got to know her as deep as i got to know her, you'd want to risk everything too. I care about her wayyy too much, and i think that the day i lose her will pretty much be the end of me. My whole world could fall to pieces, but if she's still there it wouldn't matter. I really don't know what to do about it, because i don't ever want to let her go again.

59,"Hello Reddit,

So I have a little bit of a dilemma, and I'm still panicking a little. I went to the store for not more than 15 minutes. I came out, and I noticed a big dent in the door of my 2017 Toyota Corolla that I got in February. I'm either assuming someone hit my car with their door or let a cart roll into my car in the parking lot. Currently, I'm alternating between wanting to cry and wanting the person who hit my car to die. Somewhere in between.

Anyway, I'm not sure what the next steps are in this whole ordeal. Since I got no license, no insurance or anything (person drove off or was in store for all I know), my insurance has to be the ones covering the damage. I filed a claim with them, but they will get back to me tomorrow about what the next steps are.

So I guess my questions would be -

-How long would I wind up waiting for this whole process to be complete (insurance working out whatever they need, painting, fixing the dent, having my car back again)? 
-Will this have to be reported on the vehicle's CarFax?
-What's the likelihood my insurance (in California) would at least partially cover a rental (that I can't afford at the moment out of pocket) for me to drive to work and back during the time I'll be waiting for mine to be repaired?
-Can I expect my car look exactly like it did before I got hit? This is a one month old car. Metallic olive green colour. I've always heard that metallic colours are the hardest to blend.",28Mar2017,1
61,"I was job hunting online today and came across a job that I think I would be perfect for, it pays about what I get paid now, which isn't amazing, but it pays the bills. 

However the two major PROS for this job are that A) it's very close to home, I could bike there. Meaning savings on travel big time. I currently drive to a train station, and pay $7.50 one way and another $7.50 back each day to work.

The second Big PRO is that it is a day job, where I currently work nights. I've been itching to get a day job for a long time. So this would be a god send in that department. So far so good right?

Now the CON, and it's a big one... the job is only for 12 mths, with a possibility of extending it for another 12 mths afterwards.

*IF* I got the job, and *IF* it got extended to two years.. i could be facing unemployment in 2 years. :(

The only part of me that tries to rationalize this, is that my current work has laid people off this past year, my shift has about half of what it once did. There is a growing fear that we all could be out of a job within 5 years. But that is merely fear and rumour and I honestly don't think the company has any solid decision on that one way or the other. 

I would hope that after 2 years, I could convince them to keep me on, or use that experience to move to another location, but that is hopes and dreams, and nothing in concrete.

If I was single, I'd do this in a heartbeat... but I have a wife, kids that I have to think about...

Right now, I'm thinking ""apply, do the interview if I get called, and see from there..."" but I know if I get that far that I am offered the job, saying no will be hard, but so will saying yes.

I haven't had much experience aside from what I learned in school. With my job, I got thrown into a position that is demanding more from me than I can keep up with.

I'm pretty dense and a relatively slow learner, but my role is requiring a lot from me. Although I'm excited to be learning as much as I am (it's been less than 6 months), I feel overwhelmed and incompetent. I'm feeling like an idiot and a failure as I keep making mistakes over and over. The issue is I keep repeating some of these mistakes, while being careful not to repeat others.

63,"It's a really long story and I have a very unique situation, so I have to cut some things down a lot. If there's any confusion I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

I'm 17 and live with a Legal Guardian, in a house that I will inherit from an estate, **not from LG** , when I am 18 in November. LG has a son who I'll just refer to as N. N is my age, 17, and gets his pot from his dad.

When I was 13 I noticed LG smoking behind my back (loud disgusting coughs when he thinks no one is listening and cigarrette butts and discarded joints everywhere). LG knows he's not supposed to smoke because it could gradually do damage to the house. But he doesn't care. Me and family friends have confronted him about it and he acts really defensive and makes it sound like we're attacking him. LG has yelled, thrown tantrums, and then been really passive aggressive to me whenever the subject of him smoking is brought up. It feels like I'm living with another teenager in the house, not a man in his 50's.

N stands by his dad, and we're not really on speaking terms anymore. All he does is sit in his room, play video games, and smoke. Occasionally his friends come over to smoke with him (and LG). I think both LG and N usually do it outside, but I know for a fact they do it inside at night.

What used to by my late mother's clean, organized bathroom now reeks of weed and cigarrettes with ashes and porn mags all over the floor. I can't even go in there anymore.

The smell is terrible. I can't stand it. They do a decent job at hiding it most of the time, but when they don't, I feel a lot of anxiety and discomfort.

Regardless of any strong opinions about marijuana you may have, please understand that I've grown up feeling distrust and anxiety around the subject because LG's done it behind everyone's back for years. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. My discomfort isn't just going to ""go away"" just because it's proven that weed's ""on the same level as alchohol"". If LG and N had drinking problems instead, I know I'd be super uncomfortable with that, too.

Because of my unique situation with a legal guardian taking care of me in what is technically my own house, the advice I get a lot on Reddit is ""get emancipated."" I've talked about this option with the appropriate people and we're decided it's not an option right now. I'm not going to go into detail about it. So please don't suggest it.

You might be saying, easy, just don't shave, drink beer and ride a motorcycle. Well, that's not what I meant. I'll give you some back story so you can see where I am going with this.

My name is Nate. I am a boy (obviously). I am in high school, 11th grade, 18 years old. I am about 6' and 180. Not very muscular, but not fat. I usually wear nice leather boots or converse, jeans or khakis, and a T-shirt. I have blonde long hair, about eye length. I push it to the side, and it is a little bit curly. But anyways, my whole life I have been brought up in a good home, so no family issues. I love music and have male friends at school. 

Thing is, no girl-friends. Most of my life I have a hard time talking to girls etc. I am not anti-social. In fact, I want to talk to girls, and I enjoy talking to other guys. Thing is that I don't know how to talk to them, react around them, or even be myself around them. Now, my issue isn't the fact that I can't talk to girls, even though that is one.

My issue is I found a very attractive woman. That's right, I'm screwed no matter what ha. This girl, who we'll call Maya, is amazingly gorgeous. She too is 18 y.o. I know she likes music that I like (indie), and I know that she knows that I exist. The only way that I know that is through a connection. She is friends with a boy that I'm really good friends with. Let's call him Ryan. Ryan has some classes with her, and he knows that I like her, so he'll ask some questions. That's how I found this stuff out. 

The issue again is that I have no idea how to approach her or talk to her. She is in none of my classes, and I rarely see her. Only when I pass her in the hall. But since I am afraid of talking to girls, I always look a different way. One day I was going to say hi, but she was looking a different way. So, my only frame of oppertunity to talk to her is when I pass her in the hall, which I feel would be weird because we have never talked before. I'd just be popping out of nowhere saying hey what's up. Plus, I feel that I'd start stuttering when I talk to her. 

That's where I am coming to you guys. I am not trying to smash and dash, but find a serious relationship with this girl. Please help me out on what to do. I'll keep you posted.",28Mar2017,1
66,"I think it all started early last year when I moved to a new city. I started a course here because I got kicked out of high school for some dumb shit I pulled. Ever since then I've felt incredibly lonely, I have no friends, no girlfriend. Nothing. Every single day/weekend I sit in my room on my computer just wasting my life away. It's incredibly hard for me to make friends and stuff because I have serious social anxiety. I don't know how to talk to people and overall I just feel like an awkward person. Loneliness leads to depression so of course every day I wake up depressed, not knowing what the fuck I want to do with my life.

I'm fat, white and ugly so getting a girlfriend is completely crossed off the list lmao. I'm probably asking for hate right now, I know asking the internet for advice is the wrong thing to do but it's easier for me to do than talking to someone. If anyone has any advice for me please let me know, I'm sick of this life and sometimes at night I just have breakdowns and cry. Fucking sucks man.

68,"Before I start i want to preface this with the fact that I have social phobia and generalized anxiety, and have also struggled with clinical depression and post traumatic stress. I've been on Prozac for 7 years and only just found out through genetic testing that it doesn't work for me and may actuly be harmful. So that's a bit of background that I think is pretty relevant.

This is going to sound crazy, but I want/need to transfer to homeschooling soon (during the last 2 months of my senior year of high school...). The problem is that I've already applied to and been accepted to certain colleges. The school that's looking most likely is a public state school though; still waiting to find out if I'm admitted (they have a set notification date which is coming up).

I'm miserable. Going to school right now might be the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. The biggest reason isn't much of a reason at all: generalized anxiety. I can't really put my finger on why it's so awful, but I feel VERY worn out. My grades have suffered, too (I used to be a straight A student but that's changed ever since a traumatic incident forward).

Some other reasons are severe fatigue, social anxiety, and high stress levels (it's not an easy school that i'm in). I experience suicidal thoughts too, but they're mainly intrusive. Though in the past month i have considered it, but when i am in the right state of mind i know I would never because, other than school, my life is pretty great and I'm really grateful.

I'm in the ""home stretch,"" I know. If I can just ""power through"" and ""not let my anxiety win""... well, these are all things I'm hearing from people I love. But they fail to motivate me. I don't know if I can bear the rest of this semester without having a mental breakdown.

I know what homeschooling is like; I did it junior year because of a semi-traumatic event that compromised my ability to go to school/function. So please don't tell me how difficult it is.

My biggest fear is that doing this now would affect my admissions decisions. I can't really provide them a reason for it because mental health issues make you look bad to colleges unfortunately. I think my best course of action rigt now is to somehow anonymously contact my schools and see if this would affect things. 

It wouldn't be the perfect solution. Because of my anxiety and closeness with my boyfriend, I'll worry about him because he's told me this would make him really sad. He said he will support me whatever I do though. Another thing is there's a formal dance at my school and I'm his date; if I don't go then it's likely he will have to go with someone else who neiher of us knows and idk that just makes me sad because I wanted to go with him.

But I think overall, my health is more important, and IF a transfer like this would prevent a serious breakdown and have a net effect of lowering my stress levels, then I feel like it's the right choice. 

I'm just really scared of both options. Scared of staying because I'm miserable and it's really really difficult and I'm tired all the time and keep having panic attacks. But I'm scared of leaving because of how it would affect my boyfriend and my college admissions decisions.

The most important thing is that it doesnt hurt my college admissions, because that's the one thing I have been counting on. I cannot lose that for a big personal reason. I guess I'm even willing to sacrifice my current health for that. But I'd really REALLY rather not.

One more concern involves the (online) homeschool, would I be able to find one that lets me transfer at this time? Would my courses be able to match up? Would I have to restart the semester (I'm willing to do extra work if it will help me out of this hell)? I don't know. I have so many questions and fears. 

The only reason I go to school anymore is for my boyfriend and for college. I think things would ultimately be ok with him though if I did this, but the college thing is a question.

79,"Hey reddit friends. 

I don't really know where to start, so maybe i'll write everything in a way as clear and organised as possible. My mind is in a mess right now. (There's a TL;DR below)

I'm 21 years old. I feel like this is the time where most people are unsure where do they want to go with their life. Mine as well. The fact that i'm inherently insecure person with low self-esteem does not help at all.

I'll start from 4 years ago. I went abroad and did my undergraduate degree in the UK. On first day of lecture, I met the most beautiful human being I've ever seen in my life. It was love at first sight for me, and we started dating very soon after. We lived together for 3 years, spending day and night, doing all kind of stuff a married couple would do. Also, we traveled to a lot of places. Those were the best time of my life. Fast forward to 3 years later, I'm lucky enough to graduate with a first class honours. Things looked bright, and I envisioned myself going back home, getting a decent job, marry my SO a few years later, and stuff. I made that my life goal. Well, it ended up the complete opposite. In short, I couldn't find a decent job. My ex left me, said she wasn't into me anymore. And couldn't see a future with me. She came from a pretty rich family, so. The breakup happened less than a month ago, and I still have trouble getting over it. However, this is not the main purpose of this post.

Apparently, the breakup hit me super hard. I lost my purpose of living, don't know what to do anymore. I feel abandoned, unwanted. Literally can't find something that I enjoy or interested in doing. I don't have a lot of friends but a few close friends. A couple of them keep making fun of my breakup, they didn't think it's a big deal or anything. Some of them are really successful. One going to work at Advisory in the 'Big Four', and one going to work abroad at an MNE. The culture here is all about achievements and money. The fact that my ex left me because of my background hurts me more. They made me feel so useless and worthless. 

I have since been trying to focus more on myself. Try to find a purpose, something that I really want to do. Try to prove that I can actually achieve something like everyone else. I decided to apply for a Master's degree at some top Uni, and got an offer at KCL. Here's the thing. I really enjoy studying (and consider myself good at it), and it would be a huge achievement to me if I could finish my Master's with a distinction. But deep down I know this Master's probably will not set me up with a much better career. And the cost of doing this could probably get me a house. Being able to own a house is a big deal here, but honestly I don't care. My family isn't rich, and this Master's would cost most of our savings. I don't know if doing this is worth it, or is it just some bold decision caused by my frustration and emptiness.

Thanks in advance, reddit.

TL;DR: Got dumped by my ex of 3 years. And with the pressure from my friends, I feel myself worthless and underachieved. Wanted to do a Master's degree (that I really enjoy) but that would cost most of my family's savings. Not sure if this is worth it.

80,"A little bit of background on this to start off, I'm not new to the dating scene, but I'm rather shy, or even ""beta"" per say. Recently  I've gotten into a new relationship and I'm struggling to really break out of the shell I'm always in. We recently went out, and it felt akward, I couldn't muster up courage to make a move, and it was like that the whole time. 

What I'd like advice on is how I should go about trying to make a move perhaps, or at least not be so shy about doing something.

Every Friday we see eachother, spend the whole day together, sometimes we spend all of Saturday together too and a little on Sunday. We hug, kiss, hold hands and cuddle. Then on Sunday night or on Monday, I get sick. EVERY TIME. None of us were sick during the weekend. But sometimes we both get sick at the same time after the weekend. So far I've gotten dry coughs, mucus coughs, sore throat, dry throat, fever, nausea, dizziness, tiredness, runny nose and sneezing.

We have a couple of classes together and we often talk during or between classes. The conversations are usually very casual, but they're enough to improve my day vastly. I'm not a very social person, so small things that she does like engaging in a conversation with me and asking how I'm doing really mean a lot. I have started to develop stronger feelings for her but I have no idea how to go about this. I have been friends with her for almost two years and I haven't ever really texted her too much, so I feel awkward just texting her out of the blue and we don't see each other much outside of school except at the occasional party.

102,"Hello everyone, I'm going to start by warning that this post might go on for a while, so sorry. Lately I've been having some trouble thinking about what to do, so here goes:
First of all, I'm 13 years old. I'm in a family of 5 and am the oldest of 3 siblings, I'm the oldest brother, I have a younger brother who's 11 and a baby sister. My father is very hard working and is almost never home for more than a week at a time, he flies a lot. My mom, who stays at home, has a good relationship with my dad AFAIK. Both my parents take good care of me, there's no struggle for food or any financial problems in the house from my understanding, but sometimes I have problems with my family members. First of all, my dad isn't around enough to fight with, and I feel that he respects me but I don't really feel great about the thought of having a intimate conversation with him. My little brother can be a bit of a mixed bag, sometimes he's happy to see me and sometimes he's not. He's always telling mom and myself that I should spend more time with him, but when I do he's ungrateful and is often rude about me being there. My mom is always busy, and since my dad is away most of the time, a lot of household duties get delegated to me. My little brother often gets the ""easier"" jobs, which i understand, but my mom always seems to listen to him more and get his input while she expects me to do what I'm told and nothing else. Often I have trouble understanding exactly what needs to be done because I am extremely forgetful and I think I might have a mental disability (I am a year ahead in my school and get great grades, but I am slightly socially isolated and I struggle with understanding what people mean when they say things. ) When I misunderstand or forget instructions, my mom gets mad, and when I try to defend myself, she says I'm being a smartass and that I should listen. This is much harsher than the treatment my little brother receives. Whenever I try to confront my parents about not feeling good about how they treat me, they just say that they treat me well by sending me to a good school and giving me spending money, which I am very thankful for, but this doesn't let me talk about how I really feel. My mom generally makes a big deal about saying that she loves me, but when we're alone and she's in a bad mood she treats me like a robot without any emotion that is built only to serve her. Most recently I've been feeling quite depressed about all this, no suicidal thoughts where the situation stands. However I feel like every day I'm backing up closer to a cliff. What do I do?

TL;DR: Please for the love of God try to skim it.

Also, thank you very much for reading all this, All and any serious advice would be much appreciated. ",28Mar2017,1
103,"My mother was my world. I went to her for absolutely everything, we had one of the best mother/daughter bonds you could have. I wasn't afraid to tell her anything, and never hesitated about it. 

I have really horrible anxiety and depression issues, which she would support me through. She also had anxiety/depression her entire life, so she knew how to help me with it. 

We would do everything together. Go shopping, help her cook, listen to music, take care of the house, etc. We were never really apart from each other. As i said before, we had an amazing bond. 

She had a past history of alcoholism, drugs, etc. This was all before i was born, but it was really intense. It almost killed her multiple times, she was in her late 30's/40's. Last year in may, it began catching up with her. She was diagnosed with liver disease. She was in an out of the hospital, continually getting worse for a month and a half, until she passed away due to pneumonia and liver failure. 

I can't get the memories from her being in the hospital out of my head. She was in the hospital 4 times, for atleast 4 days each time. It was horrible. I skipped all of my school work from the beginning of may until the end of school to be at the hospital with her. Out of the four siblings i have, I was the only one too visit. It made sense for 3/4, they were in another state 600 miles away. My other sister on the otherhand, lived with us. She just didnt feel like going. Im not going to get into that though. 

Ever since she passed my anxiety and depression has gotten worse than ever before. I've been in counseling since the day after my mother passed. The pain doesn't stop. On some days its easier sure, but it still hurts. it still destroys me every single day. My step father already moved on and fell inlove with a new girl, my sister took her money and ran, havent spoken to her in 5 months. I rarely speak to the rest of my siblings, and thats the only family i have. I don't have anymore other than them. I feel so fucking alone in all of this, i have no one to turn too who really understands this mental fucking torture im going through. This internal pain that hurts me so badly I want to vomit. It keeps me up until 6-7 in the morning because I can't get the thought of how life would be different if my mom was still here. 

My anxiety is constant. I have no break from it, Im constantly feeling on edge and worried and scared, for absolutely no reason. Its exhausting. 

My depression is always with me. I always have this heavy ache in my body that makes me want to get into my bed and never leave it. It makes me want to give up on everything I do, and drop all friend/relationships I have. 

I feel like im dying inside. I feel so empty and sad and hurt. Im not suicidal, but I dont want to keep going. I dont want to live my life without her here. She didn't even get to see me graduate yet. 

Im still so young and I havent even started my life yet and im so afraid to start it. Who am i going to go too when i need help with something? What about advice? Legal help, buying a house/apartment, getting married or having kids?? I don't have anyone. 
 It doesn't feel fair. Both of my biological parents are dead and i feel like i have no one too go too. I don't have a support system. I don't have anyone to talk too (except my therapist, and my LDR s/o) 

I know she wouldnt want me to hurt so badly for this long, but I cant help it. She would want me to smile and be happy and look back on our memories and be so thankful to have such an amazing mother as she was. Don't get me wrong, I am so beyond thankful she was my mom. I am so proud and happy to say she was my mom, and to share the memories with her, but know I cried so hard typing that. that i had to stop and remind myself to breathe. 

I've been told to just take it day by day, and let myself hurt and cry and be in agony, and i have been; It's just getting worse as the days go on, and I don't know what to do. 

I know eventually I will be okay. I know eventually I will learn to accept my moms death, and as much as it hurts me to type this, learn to live without her.  It just feels so far away. It feels like a goal that is absolutely impossible to reach, and I dont know if I ever will reach it. 

Im sorry if my spelling is bad or something, I've been crying and shaking and just a mess throughout typing this. 

Also, im just going to answer some questions I feel like im going to get:

Why not talk to someone at school/make friends?: Im homeschooled. All of my teacher are online, across the state. 

You should tell your therapist all of this: She knows this and much more. ",28Mar2017,2
105,"Dear reddit

I came to you with something I considered a huge problem, this time however, i'm making a post wich I hope will inspire others &amp; help others in simular situations.

First of all, thank you all for the suport, I litterly considered killing myself to the point where I was so close to doing it, I read the comment and I somehow didn't. 

So turns out the girl is already togheter with my ""good friend"" and they make out all the time at school, sitting on eachother laps, wich still bothers me a little. But it also made it easier for me to let go in some way I think, I went out this weekend. Both friday &amp; Saturday, alot of chiks tried to flirt with me &amp; I thought it would hurt, wich it did a little but I also enjoyed it, I've not been as happy as I was this weekend than in the last 3 years.

**To anyone out there in the same situation **
SHE is not worth it, I worked my ass of for her 3 years long, litterly did everything to the point where their father &amp; mother claimed I was too good for her and that she had to change.
It still bothers me that she tries so hard to make it work. But I also realise, she tried it with multiple dudes, she just doesn't want to be lonely &amp; somehow that comforts me, somehow it frustrates me. Cause , she addmited that at the start she used me to forget her ex aswell, it was only around the 4 month mark that she truly loved me. 

However, I still feel lonely sometimes,I just try to block these thoughts, I go partying alot &amp; all of this because of your  support &amp; advice.
Thank you so much, It still hurts like hell, but eventually I geuss i'll be fine..
&amp; Remember guys, always keep going. Never give up, she's not worth it (': especially not after a move like this, thank you for opening my eyes&lt;3

106,"To preface everything, there are some things to note about me (m/ 21) and my girlfriend (f/ 21). We've been together for nearly four years and known each other for about ten. We had a rocky on and off type relationship for the last couple years in high school and for the last four years have taken no breaks. 

She is very direct and outspoken (which I normally wouldn't say is a negative thing), but I am one to think more before I speak. However, this, in effect, leads me to overthink things like going ahead and breaking up. Why would I want to break up?

Well, when we began dating, we were both 17 years old. At that age she had experience with other guys (which I have no problem with) but I had little experience with other girls. It may sound sophomoric, but I always imagined I'd have a stage in my life where I had the chance to play the field. So in a way, I feel like I missed out on a part of my life. I feel that I am getting to the tail end of the playing-the-field-age, and if I am ever going to do it that has to be now. 

At this point it probably sounds like I am just trying to be a dog. The justification I have for wanting to get out of my relationship, though, is that my girlfriend is a big time planner, and casually mentions things like ""when we are married"" or ""our kids,"" but I don't see the things she has planned out in my future. It is so flattering that she sees herself achieving those things with me, but I don't know if the feelings are mutual. I feel that things should happen as they feel natural and someone shouldn't be forced into marriage just because they've been together for four years and have a long history. I also have anxiety issues when those things come up so it really bothers me.

Another issue I have had is that of attraction. Over the last few years, she has put on a few extra pounds. It may sound shallow, but sex to me and I think most people is an important part of a healthy relationship. I just don't find her to be as attractive as I once thought she was. Sometimes when having sex, I will either not finish at all or have to think of someone else to get the job done. I also cannot keep myself from looking around at other girls. This might just be a guy thing, but I feel like it has been to an extreme for the past year. I've never acted on my attraction to other girls but I constantly think about it.

With all that said, I still struggle with whether or not to pull the trigger and end my relationship or to just try to power through and hope I feel the same way eventually. On one hand, I feel like right now is a point in my life in which I could be so much happier than I currently am. On the other, I really do love her and it would destroy her to break up because I know how all in she is.

What do I do, Reddit? Do I break up with her, and if so, how do I not crush her heart? Or is that inevitable? ",28Mar2017,1
107,"Hi all, so as above, I bought a spa from a bloke on FB. 

He says he hasn't used it in about 18 months, but was working fine.

I got it home, had a once over, took the filter out and cleaned it, drained all of the residual water then filled it through the filter housing as recommended in the manual. It was at this point that I discovered a couple of water hoses that my dogs had chewed, so lost 80% of the water. I repaired the hoses and filled again. 

I immediately had issues with the spa. When I plugged it in, the pump came on straight away, however the lights and LED display on the control panel was flickering heavily, and the pump was continuously shutting off and restarting. The longest I had the pump running was about 25 seconds. 

After a couple of minutes of pressing buttons and opening and closing the air jets, it started to run a lot better. I set the temperature to 35 and walked away for a couple of hours. I could hear it running without much issue. 

After approx. 3 hours, the water was warmer, but then as I turned on the TV and some lights inside the house, the issues with the pump started again. 
Now, it will run intermittently as before, however if I turn the blower on the display will flicker and shut down. I have to unplug it to achieve anything. 

Where the previous owner lived was in the mountains, so reasonably wet. I haven't taken the electronics apart yet, however I've tried different outlets within the house, and attempting to run with and without the heater. 

Please advise on where to go next :(

109,"After a huge argument with my partner I have packed my belongings into my car and left our shared apartment.  i have been living with friends and family for the past two weeks, but during this time I spent a few night back `home` and the relationship was exactly as toxic as when I left.

I havnt yet told my partner that I am officially done with our relationship. We have a very abusive on and off again relationship. Im incredibly unsure as to what to do as I moved a long distance from my family to live together. I have an amazing job in this small town that I love but am currently sleeping an hours drive away every shift. 

I have a few friends in this town that I could stay with, but I would feel guilty staying for free and can not afford to pay two rents. I can not imagine leaving my partner with all the bills of the household as she is just a student working part time and I am working full time / studying a double bachelors full time. Although our relationship needs to end, I still have strong feelings for her. I would never forgive myself for leaving our shared responsibilities.

So for the next 2-3 months I will be paying two rents or needing to find a way to sleep for free. I currently own my own car (however it is unreliable) and have all my personal belongings packed. I could essentially bounce between family and friends in the main city, but I would have trouble getting to work at 5am or finishing at 10 / 11pm. I don`t think work would currently allow a transfer. 

I currently have no savings and earn approximately 1,100 - 1,200 a fortnight. $320 goes to our shared apartment, $200 goes to loan payments and other assorted bills. I don`t think I would be able to manage driving back and forth everyday. As my fulltime hours span over up to 6 days of the week.

Would it be ideal for me to share a house with as a flatmate and pay two rents? Sleep in my car? I`m unsure as to where to go from here. Do I leave my job and start over elsewhere?

I'm from a relatively large city in Ukraine, and I've been working in the same IT company for over 3.5 years. omg how long it's been. My job is called QA Engineer and basically I have to check that the Web sites our programmers make work according to what the customer wanted without any errors. Quality Assurance. 

The problem is... I've been thiking for a long time that I don't really enjoy what I'm doing, and would like to change to something that has also something to do with the IT industry, because it's one of the very few jobs that pays good money. 

What I really like about my job is communication with people and the customers by the means of writing (skype, email) and solving different types of issues that might arise during the work hours. 

For some time I was considering a Project manager job, but yet again, it stated that this position requires an outstanding verbal communication, and for me it's a stopping sign. For some reason, my speaking skills are terrible, even in my own language. 

Another maybe good option may be a Sales person, but yet again, it would be even worse for trying to speak and embarras not even myself but the company I would be presenting. 

Also, I kind of like writing something, but there's no use in this.

114,"As the above title states. I'm 25 going on 26 in a couple of months. I used to be 17st8, but I'm now about 11st. I go running three times a week and I tend to eat well. Throughout my late teens to early-mid 20s I've had issues with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, low self-esteem and periods of depression but now I'm just about past that through giving up drinking, reading a lot of good self-help books and meditating daily (Don't knock it - it's changed my life).

My problem now is that I'm getting lonely and concerned about the future. While I'm much less concerned about how I am perceived by others than I used to, I have a complex where I feel that there's something wrong with me now that I haven't dated in 9 years and I'm still living with my parents. I have plans to move out once I've got the money together to for a mortgage (I doubt I'll be able to afford to rent seeing as I want to live alone).

My social circumstances aren't great, either. I get on really well with most of the people I work with, but I hate going to clubs and doing the whole 'drinks after work' thing (Mostly because I don't drink). Over the period where I decided to get my shit together, I became something of a recluse. I've had a group of friends since I was about 18 which I only see every couple of weeks at this point. I'm willing to accept that I'm an introvert, but I still want to get into a relationship.

The fundraiser was to pay for accommodation and bills while the parents were in the city and unable to work but now after only 2 weeks the little girl has passed away and my wife is unsure what to do about the fundraiser. A lot of people close to the family still want the fundraiser to go ahead but my wife is struggling with the morality of the issue as the parents haven't accrued any cost or debt that the fundraiser would specifically be going towards.,28Mar2017,31

132,"Basically my work has called me twice asking me to cover a shift. I've ignored both the calls but I feel guilty. I have no proper justification for not wanting to cover the shift other than me not wanting to clean that particular site (I work as a cleaner). It's hard to explain but some sites are nice to clean and I feel comfortable doing it but others I just don't like. I need to go to my usual place in an hour anyway. 

Should I ignore the call or pick up? I'm not very good at saying no and was planning on just saying I have other commitments. Or wait until I'm at a bit I cant leave and say my phone was in the car. 

I once had someone point out to me if it was still landlines people used and I was out for the day I'd have no idea work was calling me.

133,"Theres a girl in my class and we go to an all girls grammar school. She is very messed up, she is a liar , has horrible anxiety and is the most self destructive person ive ever met. She basically has a very bad reputation at our school, she drinks she smokes parties and does drugs.  Now not that anything is wrong with that, but the problem is i think she dosent want to live like this anymore but has just continued being passive to it as she had already gotten this far. But I want  I just want to steer her towards another direction. This is because i can see that she genuinely appears to be trapped in the fake persona shes created for herself. I see it time and time again the way she brings herself down, considering herself lower than those who get better grades than her. I see her dating guys that treat her like absolute shit and her thinking she deserves what she gets. The teachers and students at our school are no help at all, and i think she thinks that theyve given up on her. Thats the part that makes me sad, not the fact that she lives this life style, but because she feels obliged to. She doesn't want to be like this and i know it but she just keeps going because she feels its irreversible. She has very toxic friends, they live the same lifestyle as her (but the difference is, is that they are happy with it) they bring her down and pressure her so much. And i see it all, the slow deterioration of this persons potential just to give in to all the rumours and image she has created for her self. I know its really stupid and i should probably mind my own business but i cant help it, i dont want to be a bystander. And i dont know how to help her, i tutor her in maths and chemistry and she gets it! But when it comes to the test she doesn't bother because her friends dont. Im sorry i know im rambling  but this is the only place i thought to come to for advice. We have no proper counciling system in our school. I just need some advice on how to tell this girl that she is not defined by her past and there is still hope, i just genuinely dont want to see a human give up on life. Any advice? ",28Mar2017,6

I won't pretend I'm not spoiled, but at this point in my life I finally decided it was time for my freedom. As a kid, I was never allowed to go out like the other kids. At 16, I was still being chaperoned on certain outings (not just including dates) and almost always had to stay in while my friends went out. I have been in a relationship for 4.5 years with an amazing man. He is kind, smart, and stubborn, and we decided that we wanted to move in together in May along with another friend. My parents flipped, expectedly. I was prepared to pay for everything regarding apartment/living expenses with my job, but I never expected them to want to take away my college. I understand I am not entitled to this, as it is their money, but they know the effect that this would have on me financially. Today, my mother gave me a choice: either not move in with my boyfriend, and have ALL of my expenses paid for, or move in with him and lose all financial support. I am not just doing this because I want to shack up with my boyfriend, but also because I want to be independent and not have to ask for their permission for everything I do.

Heres a quick summary I work for a school and sports photography company and my boss hired this 22 year old girl in September thinking he could train her into a photographer. Thinking just because its so called fast food photography and he can show anyone off the street how its done. Well you cant train stupid. The amount of effort this girl puts in daily blows my mind on how a human being can even function. As a photographer there a certain expectation you would think it would take in order to work at a photography company but this girl has no idea how or what the settings are on a camera. No idea what a f/stop is or even how to even capture a true smile in a child. You cant just stand there blankly behind your tripod and say ""smile"" to a child. It just does not work. It takes effort and being a silly goofy what ever it takes kind of personality. Not even just these things make her a horrible employee to work with but you ask her to alphabetize something she doesn't know that m comes before p or is it just pure laziness? Okay she sucks at doing anything here's another you think she would get the hint you put your headphones in while driving to a job that you wouldn't want to talk to her she still trying to talk and yet you ignore her. Any other kind of human being would get a hint right.

141,"Hello, I'm a 15 year old girl. I have a problem with a ""friend"" of mine who is at the same class as me. I'll explain the issue. 

I met this girl at middle school, and we've been friends since then. I am now in high school. At first she was a good friend, we helped each other with homework, things like that. 

The problem is her personality. I dread it. She basically is one of those people that say everything that comes up in his mind and she doesn't think if that will offend anyone or not. Then, if you confront her, she gets mad and proceeds to ignore you until YOU apologize. Also, if you do anything and she doesn't like it, she also gets angry. It's insufferable. 

At first I didn't notice it and I didn't care, but since the last year this problems have become more frequent. I can easily count more than two annoyances per week, and all of them caused by very little things that deserve no attention. 

I have started noticing it and I don't want this to continue. The problem is that I'm a very introvert person and I can't find any new friends at school right now, as the other ones are friends of her, too. I have to go with her at all the school trips because I don't have anyone else, and I've reached a point where I am happy when she doesn't come to school. 

I asked her which high school specialty (It works like that in my country) she is going to choose, and she said that maybe the same as mine. Please, I don't want to be with her two years more, I couldn't stand it. 
I would be doomed without someone to stay with at class, and it is already uncomfortable to be with her in the same class when I confront her. 

What can I do to stop being with her? Thanks in advance. ",28Mar2017,2

I'm a 15 year old guy who just started HS


This one girl and I were and kinda are enemies since elementary. It all started when we wanted to move real bad to a bigger apt right next to ours since it's the biggest one with 3 rooms. We asked the owner if we could move soon and he said ok. A month until we move in we're told that the owners  his sister need a place to stay because of their old apt is starting to be rebuilt. They said ""sorry, were not gonna stay that long only 3 months. ( keep in mind we were in desperate need of a bigger house) Whoops!!! They wanna stay now.

 Over the years, we didn't mind. Until they installed wood flooring everywhere. You can hear every step, the family had 2 kids and the smallest is a runner, he makes our wall shake and him screaming makes it worst while he runs. Now they have a baby learning to walk, they put tap dance shoes on her and it makes it even louder to the point we can't hear our TV. She also screams and is running now. Every time they have a party, they stay up until 5 am doing very very very loud karaoke. One time we woke up Christmas morning at 3 pm because we had to sleep in.They have a speaker, they take their showers at night with it maxed volume. Our only bedroom is connected to their bathroom. ( My 3 brothers sleep in the bedroom, and my parents sleep in the living room on blankets, no nothing) they have this real bright light next their door, leave it on all night for no reason ,which goes threw the curtains and to the living room where my parents sleep and bothering them, too many things to say.  

Until last night, I was already in a pissed off mood from my pc not wanting to start up. I saw the bright light, i snapped to the point my face turned red. took a picture because it was just blinding me. Put it on Snapchat with a caption, ""screw this family, they are the worst.....-blah blah blah -"" 17 people saw it in 5 mins, I was starting to think if this was a bad idea. She adds me as a friend to start chatting with me, I blocked her. Deleted the snap. And now I'm asking everyone who told her because I didn't get a screenshot notice. I'm kinda scared if she'll tell people or friends what I did, or tell her patents. I'm in bed, that morning starting to get worked up. What if I get in trouble in my school. The thing that is kinda getting me a bit happy is that we're moving in a month. What if my friends don't want to hang out any more. I would be pretty mad if she said the same thing to my family because what I said was kinda really rude. This is the most edgy social thing I've done. Sorry if this sounds stupid. I'm also on spring break until Monday. Hopefully she didn't say THAT much about me.

150,"Hi everyone, 
I am a straight women and I am here to get some advices from you. Me and my boyfriend are dating for 9 months right now. We spent 6 first months together and 3 months separated because I need to leave him to finish my school. He lives in Canada and I live in Thailand. First of all when we knew that we need to live far away from each other we decided to do long distance relationship. 

In the first 6 months, we spent time together, we were really happy with each other. There was no sign or anything that he's gay/bi or struggling with his sexuality because the way he treated me, showed me that I was his entire world. However the happiness could be end. Me and my boyfriend came back to Thailand together in December 2016 and he left me on January 2017 and we plan to live together on June 2017 once I finished my school. 

My boyfriend had the problem about his anxiety and depression. And It came back and get worse again since we live separated. He told me on Mar,26 2017 that he wanted to break up with me because he's now struggling with his sexuality and doesn't want to hurt me. He doesn't know if he is gay/bi or straight. I was so upset and ask him to think about it again. Because for me it seems like he starts thinking like that because his anxiety and depression. and it's unfair for me to never give my opinion about it. He told me that the first time when he had sex was with a guy. And he's enjoy chatting with guys in online chatting as well. He said he never hook up with a guy. And most of his relationships were with a girl. However he also cannot live without me. He said he doesn't want to regret in what he will decide. He ask me for more time to think about it and will see the professional help soon. 

I can accept and support who my boyfriend really is. we decided to step back to see what is going on. It is really hurt and a lot of painful. I think he is gay right now but i still want to wait and have a little bit of hoping that it will be just his sexual fantasy thing.
I don't know what to do right now and I really need your advice about this. And let me know if you have any experience about this kind of situation.

Thank you",28Mar2017,2
154,"Hi, I'm currently in highschool trying to think about what to become after I graduate college. To give some background, my dad's a dentist, but he isn't really insisting that I become a dentist but my mom does think it's a pretty good way to go.



TBH, I'm a guy with not much passion in anything, I'm just slightly interested in things for a while then I get bored. The only thing I found that i was consistently interested in was computers. So then I decided about a year ago to get serious about coding. I took/ am taking coding classes and I think they are interesting. But then I realize something. 


Salary. Money fucking matters to me. That comes off as super materialistic but money really does make the world go round. As some computer engineer in a small software dev or game dev isn't gna make me a substantial amount of money within a couple years. 


But a dentist might. Scenario of me going to a clinic and become an assistant dentist. Worse pay than software dev at first, but after lets say 5 years, I become a dentist on my own. Then thats when the salary difference appears.



Quick thing to point out is that I'm pretty good and studying and memorizing stuff. This means I could probably get into a dental school with some prep, but not too difficult. 


So the point of this long post is just this. Should I stay with computer stuff(remember, I'm not passionate about it, im just kinda more interested in it)? Or should I just go to be a dentist?


This decision is pretty much everyday I live. If i don't switch gears now or soon, things might approach the point of no return. I understand college is just a diploma. But dental school is like completely different. So help me God. Thanks

TL;DR - Highschooler thats not passionate about anything. Computer/Software dev slightly interests me. Good at studying and memorizing things. Dad's a dentist. Should I continue down the path i recently started on computers or should I quickly switch to dentist study?",28Mar2017,2

159,"I am currently the average finance worker. I'm making decent money with no debt and getting my MBA at night (paid for). My career does have room for advancement and after a few more years and the MBA, I will be looking to make in six figures (33% increase), with room to grow in the industry.    
I currently rent but I am looking to buy a condo with my gf. We look to have a future together.  She makes a salary comparable to mine and together we make $140,000.  She comes from a stable family and she looks to inherit a nice sum of money for to make a next egg (~$500,000).    
All in all things will look pretty predictable. There will probably be two or three kids, raised in a respectable town. Saving for their college while trying to afford nice SUVs and traveling.  Comfortable, but I know 32 years will pass by with a blink and I'll be 60.  Countless hours spent working for a company for a pay check that is needed to fund that whole lifestyle. Constant work to maintain a household and family.  Never longer than a week off to go on a vacation.    
Or I can become a contractor for the government and work overseas. From my military experience I am a prime candidate for certain positions.  There is some danger but it is not a big factor. Two month on and two month off rotational deployments to various places over the world for $165k a year.  For the six months overseas housing, meals etc is provided. Travel is all provided to and from where I choose to live in between the rotations.  There are no workplace requirements between rotations.  I could live anywhere in the world for those two months; I just need to arrange with the company to get to a place at a specific date.  I could live in Italy for two months or tend bar in Key West.  Being a ski bum in Colorado or traveling Southeast Asia is entirely possible.     
Of course that $165k isn't net and doesn't include any benefits, but being a military reservist gives me many of those benefits and the six months of no expenses more than makes up for it. After five years I could leave that profession with a nice nest egg of my own. After that it could be some kind of related program management type work.  I have a degree in finance and I would position myself to be identified as a possible candidate for such positions. Or maybe I choose a different line of work.  With money in the bank there would be a lot less pressure to make a high salary.      
So how do I go about choosing whether to stay the course or to pull chocks. My gf would not be on board and it would be ended. When I was overseas I told myself I would love the contractor lifestyle.  Now that I'm back I'm wondering if I really would; I'm doubting what I felt. I live in a big city and see the constant rat race of everyone.  It seems like I would have a ticket to choice and freedom to experience the world while I'm young.

162,"Firstly my dad suffers from gout, arthritis, smoker's cough. And I suspect diabetes and lung cancer. I say suspect because he shows the possible systems but refuses to go to the hospital. This is first problem he has all these illnesses but doesn't want to follow the advice I give that will improve it.  

One other problem is that he suffers stomach pains every single day because he doesn't eat enough food.The reason because of this is that he doesn't like the food. Am not masterchef but the food is decent. It's not horribly disgusting. How does this effect me? Well he repeatedly moans about how much pain he is in and about being hungry and even though we offer food he declines. Also because of the stomach pains I have to frequently massage him several times a day and make a malt drink to help ease the pain. This is extremely time consuming and bothersome especially when he wakes me up during 2am or 4am to aid him. 

Another annoying thing is that when he finally decides to eat, it will be food that promotes his gout attacks which puts him in agonizing pain and leads to me massaging him. Even though we warn him that it will promote the pain, he will still eat it and then complain later about the pain. This is especially frustrating as when his moaning in pain he says things like ""Why God me?"", ""kill me now"" etc. 

And my last vent is that no matter how much pain he is in, he doesn't want to go to the hospital. Or even accept the fact that all this pain is caused by his actions like for example whenever he enters into a massive coughing fit because of smoking. He proceeds to blame his pain with a cold and that this coughing fit was the result of it. 

Also any advice on how to get him to go to the hospital because I highly suspect he has cancer or possible diabetes?

The roof on the kitchen had a bad spot, my landlord told me this was from a leakage from the person over me, and i didnt think much more about it. Now 1 month later, its starting to look disguisting, and it looks like some kind of mold has started growing

I also had to throw away a backpack which had been resting unused against the corner of my bedroom for about a month. It wad moldy all over, and several other smaller objects also had to be thrown away. I also had to wash both cornes of my bedroom, as blackish mold was showing up. Also clothes are nearly impossible to get dry. I have a couple of hours in the morning i can dry them and fold them. If i leave them overnight, they get wet again..

Now the obvious thing to do is obviously moving out. But money is short and moving out RIGHT now would most likely put me in a miserable living position for about a month.

Stick it out (safe option) and get the management position which will net about 55-60k in 2-4 years.

I already know which will make me happier, but I'm more worried about my long term financial situation. I know there is inherent risk in going back to school, but hey, nothing ventured nothing gained.

Any advice? ",28Mar2017,2
173,"Everyone has their own preferences for things in life.  Mostly, we advise to follow one's own preferences instead of doing what others will approve of.  

When you shop for clothes, do makeup, or change your outer appearance, do you do so with what other people's opinions will be, or your own?  Even if it keeps getting back to you that such and such a thing doesn't suit you?

Surely, there isn't a general rule for all cases, so perhaps you can advise on the criteria you use in different instances.

174,"Is there anyway for me to work on an APP for iphone, and then publish it to the appstore, and earn soemthing with it??

Like couple years ago on pc there were some programs I worked with I created a cool flappy bird like game, It looked AMAZING, but guess what, I just realized that publishing it through that software costed like 110?

So now i'm older, I'm about to start work soon, And I sometimes have a lot of free time, so I thought why don't I make use of my 'talents' I guess? 

I've worked on my own games for pc like amnesia custom story, world at war custom zombies, unity 4, etc so I really am good with mapping, texture stuff and coding. (iphone game I would make isn't going to be 3d tho, just a simple plain game I think)

So is there ANY way, ANY program that lets me make my own app, which after i'm done lets me publish it to the apple store??

176,"I posted something regarding this a while ago, but I never got any answers for it, so let me reword this.  
My whole life, the philosophy that's been drilled into my head is, ""You're only as good or worthwhile as people say you."" I grew up socially awkward, and I depended on others to tell me what I was doing wrong virtually *all* of the time, since every time I acted for myself, I'd get punished for doing the wrong thing.  
My life philosophy has been, ""If I just copy everyone else, I'll be liked! Or at least less hated!"" That didn't work, because all I became was a brown-noser and suck-up. Then I thought, ""If I just become successful enough, then I'll be liked! Or less hated!"" But then I learned the hard way people trust you *less* if you're successful.  
Nowadays, I wouldn't say I'm as socially awkward anymore, but now I'm crippled by this fear of being judged as ""too charismatic"" or ""too ambitious"" and that I'd be seen as ""selfish"" or a ""narcissist,"" even though all I want is to be treated like a normal person. So, now I'm wondering if my problem is I worry way, way, waaaay too much about what the people who dislike me think. **My whole life's been all about, ""Earn the approval of those who hate you, then you'll be happy!""** But my actual friends, who don't judge me one way or the other, keep telling me that's an unhealthy way to live. The problem is I tend to not put as much weight in their words as I do the people who hate me because I know the people who *do* like me do so unconditionally, so I don't have to do much to keep them liking me.  
So, **how do I undo this mindset of always trying to please the people who dislike me, and start really valuing the people who *do* like me, as well as my own opinion of myself?** ",28Mar2017,27
179,"To clarify, I lost specific documents necessary for me to replace my ID a few months back, even though the local DMV already has the copies of those documents. They aren't letting me get a new DL, not even a State ID. I don't have any other form of picture ID, I only have my Social. I am out of money due to bonding out of jail for the petty cost it was, I was already broke in the first place anyways. Now i'm about to lose my apt because i don't have an income. I also have to pay for drug tests as well as monthly fees to do so I am likely going to be unable to complete my probation.  I don't know where to move forward. I'm not thinking logically.

I will try to summarize this as best as I can. 

I'm 24, two years out of my undergrad (Information Technology Management), and have currently been working for a large ""Big 4"" firm for the past year and a half. I absolutely hate it. The culture, the work, and hours required have been very demanding of me. I work roughly 60+ hours a week doing something I do not enjoy (IT Audit). I am afraid I will become more pigeonholed and stuck if I do not leave and find a new opportunity soon. However, I am unsure how to talk about this experience or apply for jobs after feeling like I wasted the past year and a half in this position.

186,"My parents and I have rough patches in our relationship. Mostly about things like schoolwork, jobs, and computer games. They constantly push me to get a job in order to be able to move out after highschool when they want to Move to Nicaragua, and rightly so. I need work experience and a bit of money saved up. But more recently my mom and I have gotten into another spat. I'm not the most truthful person to them, I acknowledge that, and should be honest with them. 

More recently I was falling behind on school pe  credits. We have a program at our school where you can do or at home and log it and turn it in. This makes pe more flexible for me, an 18 year old with one leg. However, over the past week I made up all the required minutes, essays, and said I would turn it in last Monday. Well, that didn't happen. I had it all done, but when time came to turn it in I was distracted by a meeting with job seeking helpers after school and I completely forgot about it. But I still told my mom I turned it in. With t he intention of turning it in today (which I did) I left for school. My mom found out about that lie I told yesterday, and has turned off my phone contract, will have a talk with me after school today, and to to it all off I forgot my backpack today and had to drive home to get it making me miss 30 minutes of first period and getting me a Saturday school. 

They've done so much for me and are just looking out for my future, but they are so anal about every little thing. ""Oh, you have your prosthetic leg off and are laying in bed but won't bother to take the dog out? Lazy"". ""Why isn't the trash taken out, you forgot? Suuure. Lazy"".

192,"Wall of text incoming, sorry. So about a year ago I broke up with my ex for reasons I won't go into here. It was only a 6 month relationship, but we both fell extremely hard for each other. So when I cut things off, it ended painfully for both of us. We never spoke after the break up, blocked each other on social media, and tried to move on. About 3 or 4 months later (still no contact btw) I tried to send her a letter. I was having an extremely difficult time moving on, and thought I made a mistake. I wanted to try and salvage anything I could. I just wanted to hear her voice. I never got a response. Classes for the fall semester started back up later on (we go to the same university). I knew I would run into her occasionally, so I tried to send a message to her on Facebook. She eventually replied and basically said she would call the cops if I ever tried to talk to her again. So that was the end of that. I never spoke to her and rarely ever saw her in public for months. About a month ago, she got a job at the food court and was working the register. At this point I am freaking out inside my own head, I paid for my stuff, asked her how life was, and basically ran back to my room shaking. I have gone out of my way to avoid going there when she is working (out of fear of having another little panic attack), and I only ever occasionally see her in the dining hall when we both happen to be eating at the same time. Here is where the fun starts. A few days ago, a friend of mine, who she doesn't have blocked, relayed a fb post to me about her saying how I am stalking her and being creepy. I'm sorry, we go to the same university, we are bound to cross each other's line of sight occasionally. Her friend where saying she should get a pfa, which made me chuckle because I can count the times I've talked to her since we broke up on one hand. My main concern now is making sure all my shut is together in case she tries to do that or one of her friend goes after me. I have no intention of trying to recontact her, I want no part of her life anymore, I just want to move on from her. I feel silly saying I still haven't moved on yet, but we where each other's first and our relationship was short but very passionate and I still miss the good times. But every time I get those feelings, I try to remember all the reasons I broke it off and why I had to and try to calm down. I just want her to stay in my past. Is there anything I can do to in case she tries to do something? Or any tips for keeping her out of my life?",28Mar2017,1
196,"Hello all! I need your help in picking a job.

&amp;nbsp;
**Story**:
I graduated college in 2014 with a bachelor's in finance, I'm 24 currently. Once I graduated I applied for many jobs and after getting rejected from basically all of them them I accepted my only offer a banking job in July of 2015 Denton, Texas 40 miles away from my family/friends in Dallas, Texas for a sucky salary of $40,000 after annual benefits (I still make that). My current job is decent, but now I decided I need to leave to be closer to my friends and family  and again after getting rejected from basically every job I now basically have two offers (one for sure) I'll describe:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
**Job choice 1**

&amp;nbsp;
Located in Arlington, Texas (20 minutes from Dallas, Texas) so I would be closer to my friends and family; Arlington is not only closer but is just a better city to live in. I feel like the team I would work with is super kind and a great fit for me. The only con is that I still would be getting paid the crappy pay of $41,000 for this job with my for sure wages and I'm not sure if I could negotiate a better pay with the bank. I might possibly be getting bounses but not sure. The reason for this pay is that the consider this position a *junior* analyst position despite the fact that I would be the only analyst in the department. I got the job offer yesterday and I'm assuming it's pretty urgent that they want me to start.

&amp;nbsp;
**Job choice 2**

Located in San Diego, CA. I've actually never been there but back when I desperate for a new job I applied for a job at this bank and I've been talking to the hiring manager for the last few months. I don't know what I'll get paid but I'm *assuming* it'll be the current pay I have now adjusted for CA cost of living. Like I said I never have been there but my best friend does live there I also like the idea of living in a cultured area. I have an interview next Friday April 7, 2017 (10 days from now) and they're flying me out and paying for the hotel.

**Questions**

&amp;nbsp;
1. Should I go to the interview in San Diego?*

&amp;nbsp;
* If so what should I tell the bank in Arlington? That I'm interviewing for another job? Also should I ask the manager what the pay would be if I got the job prior to flying out?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
2. I guess the picture is what job should I choose (option 1 or 2) and if you can could you give me your reason?",28Mar2017,1

I moved to a city to be the production manager of a 700 person venue. It was a great gig but sadly the place closed 1.5 years in. After that I was doing PR until I found out my boss was using a fake name and I left. 

I always have to fall back on coffee shop jobs. I have been since 2008. It's. Its not that I feel I'm ""too good for them"" it's just that I have a passion and have gained so much experience in the industry I want to, and now I'm the 30 something working with a bunch of 20 year old girls at a coffee shop. 

I'm moving back to where I came from,hoping my college network can help, but really I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice about breaking the cycle of falling back on service industry jobs.

Because I was going through some serious depression he told me I needed to fix myself and change if I wanted our relationship to work. And I did, I've been going to therapy, and taking SSRI's, but he still tells me I need to change. For reasons I don't understand his family hates me because of the way I was when I was struggling so badly with my depression. He had depression, he and his family should understand but he turned his back on me and they just hated me for it. He's tried throwing me out of the house twice. He gets mad at me when I try to give my honest opinion.  I feel like I can't talk to him about anything. Now he is talking shit about parts of my family that he doesn't even know saying they are backwoods hicks because they live in a more rural part of Pennsylvania and two of my cousins have had children at a young age (18-19). Which hurts me because if I ever said anything bad about his family he would be furious. But I never even would. He's allowed to treat me bad, and talk crap about my family but I'm not even allowed to give my opinion without being a controlling bitch. He ""doesn't allow me into his house to speak to him that way."" I used to feel so secure with him, now I just feel lost, and confused, and hurt. I don't understand why this is happening, he never used to treat me like this. I told him that I felt like he doesn't care about me or our relationship anymore, but he's holding on to me because he doesn't think he could get another girl and knows I'd stay with him no matter how bad he treated me. He accused me of thinking low of him and I said I wasn't, but that recent occurrences have made me feel that way, and his response was ""well your feelings are wrong""... aren't I supposed so be able to tell him anything, and not be afraid? I've never been able to talk to anyone, with him I thought it would be different but I'm falling back into the same position where the safe and smart thing to do is keep my mouth shut. I just wish someone would listen, I wish he would listen. I try to tell him how I feel when something is wrong and he just gets mad at me for feeling that way. 

But despite all of this I can't seem to let go. I love him so much, I know that I'm starting to feel like just loving him isn't enough but I still can't bear the thought of my life without him. He makes me so unbelievably happy sometimes/most of the time(?) but I don't want to keep living like this... where it is okay for him to hurt me but I can't even give my opinion. I can live with not talking about my feelings I just have to build walls again but I wish he cared. I took down all of my defenses for him... and what he's done is mount an attack on my heart... I know I should feel like I can talk to him about anything but I don't, I know I should feel like I count on him no matter what but I don't... and because of that I feel so guilty. I know I should but I don't, so what's wrong with me. I love him so much, but at the same time he is hurting me so much.

208,"*THIS WILL BE LONG BUT WORTH THE READ. PLEASE HELP A GIRL OUT*

*BTW I AM A GIRL TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER GIRL WHO WAS ROOMING WITH FOR FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE*

So I met this girl thru a mutual friend and she's going to the same college as me. The girl lives in a college town, very liberal, where being gay is much more accepted than where I'm from. She's very pretty &amp; I really thought it would workout when I saw her. I hit her up and for some reason she initially told our mutual friend she didn't wanna room with me because I was on xanax one night (I don't do xanax btw my mom gave me one to go to sleep). After our friend talked to her about it, she realized how much she wanted to room with me &amp; texted me a million times in a row making sure i was still down. In general i really don't give a fuck so i was like okay whatever so i went to meet her in her city with our friend. 

We had a fun ass night but multiple times throughout the evening she told me how she wished she was me &amp; also went up to our friend saying the same thing. Maybe because her ex boyfriend &amp; his friends were hitting on me heavy, but I blocked her ex from all forms of social media in front of her face so she could see I don't play like that. She also told our friend that she wanted to hookup, so when we got to her house our friend went downstairs while we hooked up for a minute. When i kissed her neck she freaked out and ran to the mirror to make sure she didn't have hickeys and told our friend to come sleep in her room so our hookup would be over. When our friend fell asleep we hooked up again multiple times, then went to bed. We woke up and talked about how nothing was serious because of rooming so it was all chill. That same night she initiated hooking up with me while we were out at a party. She texted me telling me to go to the bathroom w her multiple times and even came up to me &amp; asked me to go w her to my face. It was so passionate and amazing that we both couldn't want to go back to the house we were sleeping at to really get into it. But i was too drunk and I threw up, so she slept in the other room with her friends. I wasn't bothered at all &amp; went to bed. 

The next day after I went home she said she wanted to keep it in the past so it wouldn't be weird next year &amp; I just said that i looked at life differently and didn't think it was so serious, she agreed right after. We talked all week &amp; had actually meaningful long conversations. I was genuinely intrigued by her life/vice-versa. She was super flirty to me as well. 

Then for saint patrick's weekend I went up with our same friend to visit her again. That friday she left at 9:30 to hangout w this boy &amp; I didn't care until it was 11:30 &amp; i was trying to go to bed but needed her to come back to drive my car since I was drunk. She took soo long to come get me &amp; was acting super shady about what she had been doing. I didn't let it bother me and waited until we got into her bed. We got super deep with each other &amp; hooked up again: this time was crazy intimate. The next day we woke up and she was acting super weird with me, so i told her we weren't going to hookup that night (since i thought that's why she was acting that way) which she followed with ""Oh so you already have your mind made up?"" She seemed kind of upset so i tried to say well we can see where it goes then. I was down to hookup i just didn't want to make her uncomfortable at all. That same day we went to the Frats to day party. The same guy she was with from the night before was there and he started making moves on me so i went to go tell her because I thought she should know. I told her not to go and tell him &amp; that's exactly what she did. I just said whatever fuck it i don't know him &amp; continued to party. I met a guy i thought was really cool and made out with him for a while. I had no idea she saw until she went up to our mutual friend &amp; her boyfriend and started asking a million questions about my popularity &amp; status, and then told them she was annoyed with me. I didn't know this &amp; we left for a hot minute and then went back to the same frat. She went off with her guy &amp; another guy who i liked was there so i hung out with him. I've been dying to kiss him so we kissed and talked for a while at the frat. When i wanted to go i went to go get her and she asked me about that guy saying ""Are you done like have you seen enough of him"" I said back ""Yeah it's not that serious im just ready to go eat"" so i bought her some noodles &amp; at the restaurant she told me her mom grounded her &amp; needed us all to leave her house. She wasn't looking me in the eye and was acting super distant and weird. Once we left her house i asked her what that was all about &amp; asked if we could meet up please and she acted like nothing was wrong at all. That same night she went out despite her ""being grounded"" &amp; didn't invite us even though i had tried to text her earlier figuring everything out. 

The next week was weird and we didn't talk for the whole week, until i texted her again trying to figure out what i had done wrong &amp; apologizing for whatever it was, she said it was fine &amp; then didn't respond to me when i tried to fix it even more. Then i was snap chatting her bc my guy friend thought she was hot so i was trying to set it up and she said ""YAY when a genuinely nice person wants to room with me :,)"" but then when i asked if it was for sure she said she had to talk to her mom &amp; was super short then ended up not responding to me after i told her to figure it out the following day. 

The next day she texted me the longest message that she didn't want to room because of the argument ""which was my (her) fault"" but wanted to stay friends really badly. I said that i felt bad if it was over hooking up &amp; that I genuinely fucked with her a lot and was super excited to room. She sent another super long message explaining how she fucked w me too &amp; really really really wanted to stay friends &amp; how hooking up wasn't a 1 way street at all but that her mom wanted her to room with someone boring so she could do her schoolwork. I was short bc i didn't know what to say but was still nice and said we could be friends. The next day she blocked me on instagram. I texted her about it and she said she didn't mean to &amp; that nothing was wrong. 

I'm not sure what to do considering I genuinely liked this girl as a person and I'm just confused on what I did to make her hate me so much or what I did to make her so upset with me.

210,"I live in western Oklahoma. Spring is usually dubbed ""tornado season"" out here because of how quickly rain can turn into a severe storm. I am a newspaper distributor, which means I usually spend about 2 1/2 to 3 hours driving approx. ~80 miles to deliver papers to smaller towns around me. 
These past few days (even though spring has JUST begun) we have gotten some very strong wind that has been making it difficult to drive because 
a) my car will swerve slightly during gusts 
b) the dust and dirt wind kicks up leaves me very little visibility when it comes to any deer on the road, etc

Tonight, we are planning on getting a little rain which could turn into a slight storm. I need to start preparing now in case this tornado season is going to be awful. My job doesn't allow us to just ""do it later"" because it's a daily newspaper and I have the biggest route (making the most profit, mine HAS to happen every day). I can always wait a few hours, but the paper is stuffed by 7pm and has to be delivered by 2am. Since my route takes almost 3 hours, it's easiest if I just deliver right after work. 

My questions are:

What should I do if the weather gets too bad while I am on the road?
What are warning signs I should be looking for during tornado season?
What are some supplies, if any, I could need in my car?
Best advice for taking cover in a tornado if the roads I drive on don't usually have homes/businesses along the way?",28Mar2017,2

212,"I responded to a personal ""casual encounters"" add on Craigslist.

I ALWAYS look at the age the person puts in the add, obviously. He put he was 18. He had a picture of himself and a picture of his penis. 
He was hairy and looked to actually be 20-23 if I had to guess. 

Well I responded to the add offering myself to him (offering him a blow job). He then told me that he was kind of interested but would like it if I would bring a female along with me. Well I was not up for that so I ended the conversation, after a few back and forth emails,  with I completely understand but if you change your mind let me know. 

Later that night I received a reply back from the same email address stating that ""*name* is a minor under 18, this is his father and I may turn this over to authorities"".... 

OMG! I about fucking puked, my heart sank and now I am scared as hell and do not know what to do. I did not send any nude pictures of myself but I did send a face picture. I use a fake name in that email account. 
I feel so bad. I would have NEVER responded to that add if I had know he was under 18. 

Advise, please. Do I reply back stating that I am sorry and would have not even thought about responding in the first place if I had any inclination that he was under 18. Or should I not, and see what comes of it?

217,"So, my life kinda felt apart in the lapse of just one month, a year ago I got a new job, it was far from home so I had to rent an apartment, my new job got me a boss position, a great salary and through it I meet a great girl.

Until a month ago me [26m] and my girlfriend [32f] had a good relationship, the only thing was, that I feel it was moving too fast, she has a kid [5m], and I didn’t feel he was a problem, but then she started to insist in including him in the relation, we were only been going out for 4 months, and in the end she felt she needed someone more mature and willing to accept her kid and their needs, and frankly I didn’t feel ready yet to accept such a huge responsibility, anyways we broke up a few weeks ago, it wasn’t horrible, but it was sad, she still loved me and I still loved her.

The first week after the breakup I was a mess, the second week I started going out with my small group of friends, I felt weird with them, I consider them my friends but I don’t see them very often, anyways last weekend I went to the birthday party of one of them, I got really, really drunk I blacked out, last thing I remember is one of my friends telling me to get the f*ck out of his house, I tried to talk to them in the morning to know what had appended  none of them talked to me, I eventually find out that I did some stupid shit, I don’t think there is a way of fixing things, the weird thing is that I felt relieved when i understood that I won’t see them again, there is a pattern with these guys, I get drunk, I do stupid shit that i later regret, and they laugh at me, it doesn’t happens in any other occasions but when I party with them, besides they are always doing drugs (weed) and drinking, I never hang out with them to do anything else, they are unemployed and bitter about it, i feel like it will allow me to become a better me to stay away from them.

The thing now is… that I feel lonely, I miss my ex, and though I have talked to her, she is still very intransigent about everything and unwilling to find a middle ground about our problems, and about my friends, I miss them too but mainly because I feel lonely, my family lives far away and i miss them too, the only thing that I have been doing this last days is watching tv and playing video games, I’m an introvert so it’s hard for me to meet new people.

TL:DR I broke up with my gf, alienated my friends and now I’m lonely.

Any advice on meeting new people?

218,"Okay so from the title it may not seem like much, and may or may not be deceiving depending how you look on it.

to make a long story short, I'm a teenager attending school in Ireland. there's this one girl, who for the sake of this post we'll just call 'R' after the first letter of her name.  Now, 'R' used to be friends with us in a group of about 4 or 5 people. It was alright, we had fun and did teenager stuff. Suddenly one day she just decides to become a complete asshole to everybody in the group, but mainly me and this other person who we will call 'S' also after their first name.

Now, after she became an asshole to us, we would occasionally fight in person and over text, for countless reasons both pointless and justified. We as in me and S. Now, during this time period of about 3 months, R was blaming me for countless things including being an asshole to her after her gran died. She said specific times and dates, but there's evidence to support that's not true.  It's sort of irrelevant to the issue, but it just gives you an example of what would happen, this on being one of the lesser ones.

Now, R had pissed S off very much, and S posted something on Instagram about her, which I won't go into details about. Long story short, it was uncalled for and the police had gotten involved. Even if S had many reasons to say things to R, what he said went too far in a lot of places. I told him this, and he agreed. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and we're waiting for our French teacher to show up. she usually takes a fairly long time to. Meanwhile, R had said something to another person, who was supposedly bullying her friend. Me, being fairly pissed off at a lot of things that day, intervened and said that she was very hypocritical when using the term ""bully"". She had gotten upset and told the French teacher. Luckily for me, the french teacher didn't really give much of a fuck. That was last Wednesday.


Now, before I continue to the next part, during everything that happened from last October to today, she told me many many things. I have many screenshots of her saying very horrible things about me. For example she had told me to kill myself, called me ugly, useless and even went as far as (she's extremely immature) tell me to ""go fuck my mom"". She also told me I was a mistake and should've been aborted. This was only what she said to me, she had said more to S. After what S said about her, she pretended like it was all his fault, and S didn't mention anything what she said about him. Continuing on with the story.


Today I was again in a very pissed off mood. I'm not in this mood very often, it's actually very rare. But I was scrolling through some Instagram posts (I don't use it very often compared to many people in my school) and saw a post by her, complaining how she lost so many friends. I commented, telling her that it's her own fault that she loses so many friends, based on all the messages she sent me. She proceeds to delete the messages. Then I DM her.

In essence, I tell her that she's playing the victim card and that in reality she's the bully here. Not us. I tell her that what S did was not justified, but that he's not the type of person to do something because he just wants to, at least not to that extent.  I then tell her if she wants to tell her family, that I can't and if I could, won't stop her. (This will make a teensy bit more sense in a second).

She replies almost immediately, stating to me that she screenshotted what I had said, and would show my school. I wished her good luck and left. Now, one thing she doesn't know is that I have all those messages saved. So if she complains to the school, I'll be able to show them the messages and prove she isn't goody two shoes. This would also take a lot of pressure off S, who's been taking the worst end of it.

Now, I'm fairly confident in myself that I have an advantage here. However, I'd like to know if anyone has some advice for me to make this go much smoother. I don't want to get suspended if she starts playing the victim card again. Thanks in advance.

220,"To start off, im 17 and still a junior in high school. Now so far my high school experience has been largely negative being placed on a tutor for most of my sophomore and start of my junior years. The tutor really led to me failing heavily in classes, after my tutoring ended this year I was placed in night school to ease me back into going back to regular schooling. The problem being I'm so horrified of school, I don't know why but when's there's other kids involved I feel like something absolutely horrendous is going to happen. When I actually do get into school I realize my worries were for not, normally my worries win over my rational side because I haven't gone in two weeks. Night school works where there's a class a day so If I miss a class I miss a whole week of work for it. I do amazingly according to my teachers when I'm there but that doesn't change it, im on medications for add and anxiety which help me focus. As soon as school comes into play my chest gets so messed up and I feel like crying my eyes out. I don't dislike school, I really don't because when I'm actually there I actually really enjoy everybody most of the time. I have always struggled with school heavily but its gotten worse since middle school. Me having a really crappy family as well as a dead father and disabled mother hasn't helped one bit but I know life doesn't care. I'm even scared writing this post, I don't know why, me sharing my opinions or how I feel truthfully just makes me anxious. 

  I guess what I'm getting at really is. I just want advice on how to manage my anxiety and turn it into something more positive. This has also led me to shutting out the girl I love and me not being open with her emotionally is tearing her to shreds. I hate being this way, I truly do but I don't know why I can't just stop it.

227,"I'm the mom friend. I'm very nurturing and I freak out when people I love aren't taking care of themselves, and this is where my controlling behavior comes in. 

My mother and I have a great relationship and we're best friends. She rarely eats enough and she procrastinates making phone calls especially if it's for making doctor appointments or calling about a medical test she had (she's getting older so that's a fairly often occurrence nowadays) and I cannot stand it! So I end up nagging her about eating breakfast and lunch, and practically beg her to make appointments because it's her health and she won't take care of herself on her own. 

It gives me tremendous anxiety so I basically end up badgering her to help herself. If she would just listen to me, she would be much better off as far as her health goes. 

Same with my best friend. He's had a bad relationship with his ex for years because he keeps trying to go back to her but she ends up hurting him every time. I hate seeing him miserable. I repeatedly tell him that cutting off contact is the only way to fix it but he keeps talking to her and the process repeats itself over and over. It drives me nuts because he's just hurting himself and if he'd listen to me he'd feel so much better in the long run.

230,"Hey, this is going to be a bit rambly, I'm kind of lost here and any advice you could give here would help. Thank you in advance...

So, to give some backstory. My parents' marriage hasn't really been a happy one. Maybe back when I was a kid, but certainly not when I got older and started to perceive things.

My father had a reasonably successful business and we were doing quite well financially. He was working a lot and my mom quit her job and was basically stay-at-home mom, unemployed for many years now, taking care of me, my little sister and the household.

Years ago the business got worse, then recovered a bit but never to the original levels. Few years back my father closed it down and went into early retirement. This wouldn't be an issue since we had money saved up. I'm not sure how much (he has always been greedy and protective about the money) but certainly enough to live comfortably.

However, all the time he's been getting more and more greedy about the money, especially when it comes to my mom. She does all the grocery shopping and he blames her she spends too much. He refused to give her money for some doctor's appointment recently. And just now he took away her credit card (for the ""family"" account, but only he has access to it).

Some time ago I've moved abroad for work. I'm not sure if that has changed anything or if things would go this way anyway. Doesn't really matter...

Now my mom and sister (who is now first year in college) can't take it any more. They are planning to move out to a little apartment we have. My mom is looking for a job, but with basically no experience for 15+ years (and health problems) the best she can do is just above the minimum pay.

That probably won't be enough to cover the utilities, food, insurance, ... for her and my sister. She wanted to take money away from her (small) savings. I told her not to do that, that I'll send them money if they need since I'm making more than I need. Since she wasn't working for so long her retirement will be even lower than the minimum wage and without any savings she couldn't manage.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know why I'm writing it here and what kind of advice I'm looking for. I guess it just makes me feel better to share this with someone. I feel like I can't really share this with my friends (which is why I made a throwaway)...

Right now what I would like most is to hop on the first plane home and give them a hug. But I need to stay here, alone, and work so that I can help them out.

I'm lost here... If any of you can relate and give me any advice I'll be grateful. Thank you &lt;3 ",28Mar2017,2
232,"Hey Reddit so here's my situation,  I am currently 18 years old and a freshman in college.  Towards the beginning of the year I really enjoyed it here as I enjoyed going out a few times here and there and meeting new people (my college is a huge party school and there's virtually nothing else to do here).  Then about two months into the first semester my father passed away and a lot of things changed.  I haven't really had the desire to party anymore and I enjoy being home a lot more (my home is about two hours away).  I feel terrible for my mom as she is constantly alone now so I often find myself going back every 2-3 weeks.  I can tell she doesn't like to let me know she feels lonely though as she doesn't want me to feel obligated to always come home.  There is a college ten minutes from my home that nearly all of my high school friends went to along with my girlfriend.  So, whenever I am home I always have a blast as these are where my lifelong best friends and my girlfriend have always been.

Recently my friend whom I am fairly close to started avoiding talking to me and I know 100% that she knows I'm around but she still doesn't even say hi. We had an event a few days ago which we both participated in and she wished everyone good luck except me. She literally seems to not want to talk to me (if we do talk it is rather short and depressing) and I'm sad because of that to the point of me not wanting to talk to her. Just a few days before the event she was extremely friendly and fun to talk to but after that she seems reluctant to talk to me. Everyone says she is acting normal but I know 100% that she seems to dislike me now. Honestly I don't recall doing anything bad because I'm a rather shy guy but I've learnt to have fun while talking to people. I'm a nice guy and I don't know what to do in this situation. I asked her best friend about this and she thinks im over thinking it. She is very nice and friendly to everyone and always pounces at an opportunity to say hi or talk. She has fun to talking to my other friends with whom she has known less and is less close to.

239,"First of all, I apologize for the bad english, and the length of this text. But I really feel the need to express my thought somewhere.

Let me introduce myself. I am a 20 year old male. living economically comfortable, having a car and a nice house. I attend to college to a degree on Financial Engineer, while at the same time work on a restaurant planned to be opened in 3 weeks. I'm athletic, friendly and somewhat handsome. Now, everything would indicate that my life's pretty much perfect. But I do not feel that way, even if good things happen. 

I also have to say that I am pot smoker. Now do not get me wrong, I fully understand the effects a drug can have on my life. But I have kept it mostly as a 'treat' to a hardworking day, and for this reason I believe its got nothing to do with it. This feeling did not started when I became a user (almost a year ago), but about two months ago. 
Also, these feeling of being drowning on my thoughts deepened some days prior to my 20th birthday, about a month ago. I am not sure this might have to do with my increased maturity, but I have started to notice nobody actually understands me. 

Writing is my side passion, so I started working on a regular basis in my novel. For this reason, I became a really literate person. I spent almost all my day reading, wether here, a book, or anything else I can find. This is when I began to notice how most of the people I know do not quite share that passion for talking about 'interesting stuff'. Now I know this is a regular, so I also try keep my conversations light with my friends. But still, even when reaching this type of profundity with people who could potentially understand, its like they are not in 'that level'. And so I do not find satisfaction on humans interactions because they seem empty and superficial.

Please, I know it totally sounds like its just me, trying to bluff about what I would try to call myself a somewhat 'superior intellect'. However, it feels like I'm drowning. Everyday when I talk to people there is this annoyance at not being able to connect with them, because I feel they do not care about the topic, or simply they only care about really superficial stuff.

I'm not sure what its going on, but its drowning me. I feel alone, with no one to talk to who can actually share my thoughts. What can I do¿

240,"Hey guys, I have this situation that I need advice on. 
  So, some context, I have this friend, let's call him Jim. Me and Jim have known each other for a long time and even though we have very different personalities we've gone through a lot together and we have a good bond. We both moved to study in the UK last year and he's been having a much harder time than me: he didn't really fit in, he was depressed and found no purpose in what he was doing. He also had serious money problems – he barely makes ends meet and the few jobs he got didn't work out too well. So this year he dropped out and since he had no money left to stay in his accommodation he asked me if he could come live with me with the plan of getting a job and an accommodation in Birmingham. I couldn't really say no to him, so a few days ago he came with all his things and literally no money. 
 
  I've been having a much smoother time here, but the problem is that I finish university in two weeks and have a crazy amount of work to do, as well as figuring out other issues, and also I have just started my second job. So I'm pretty overwhelmed and stressed. 

   But back to Jim: the problem with him is that we're completely different personalities and we can't really get along  over long periods of time (He came to visit for three days a while back and we had a few arguments and I felt much better after he left). We've been having a bad time since he arrived, as I'm a great control freak on top of being stubborn, and have trouble dealing with other people, so his presence stresses me out a great deal. Jim sleeps in my room and since he's been here I hadn't had a good night's sleep and take sleeping pills every night (with little effect). I spend all my day in the library because I can't get any work done with him around. Honestly, he hasn't been acting too bad, but I have a hard time dealing with him.
 
   My dilemma is this: I have some friends which live next to my place and they have a free room. I really want to leave him some money so he can get food and go there for a week or so, just so I could get some peace and quiet. But I'll feel bad for deserting him and I'm not sure how he'll take it. 

   I know his problems are a thousand times bigger than mine and he needs my support, yet I just don't feel okay with him around. I feel like a selfish ass, but I really can't live with him. The problem is not in him, it's in me, and I can't see any other resolution. Any advice guys? ",28Mar2017,1
241,I have been offered a job at a company(which I won't name for legal reasons). However I am 17 years old. They never asked me outstraight how old I am and I have written down my date of birth. It was never written in the job description that I needed to be 18 however I feel like when they realise I'm 17 they'll fire me as the job is in a gift store which has a lot of alcoholic related merchandise.However I read online somewhere that you can sell alcohol as long as it is not consumed on the premises which is the case here.I'm 18 in 3 weeks and have already started training for this job. Should I just say nothing and see what happens? Can they legally fire me or can I say that that is age discrimination under the employment equality act?What should I do? HELPPPPPP,28Mar2017,1
242,"I am a 23 year old female. I got talking to one of my friends best friends last summer (27yo male) and firstly we talked purely out of concern for our mutual friend. He is engaged to a woman and she has one child from a previous relationship and another child with him. He adopted the first child as his own but they are very unhappy together and have been for a very long time. She is very mentally unstable and hes quite passive so just goes along with it. He moved to the uk with her last year so that she could be close to her family when the new baby was born. After christmas he came to ireland to visit his family and I hadnt met him in person yet so I said I hope ill get to see him then. During this time we had both made it clear we were attracted to each other but it wasnt a big deal. While he was over in ireland he wrote to me at 4am and was talking to me about sexual things I was joking with him telling him we should meet up so we can do all we want to each other. We ended up meeting that same day he travelled two and a half hours to see me and we had great sex. Mindblowing. Afterwards we were texting and he kept telling me that he cant get me off his mind even when he returned to the uk. Weve met a few more times for sex but the more we met while he was over in ireland the more attached we got to each other and realised the connection we had was more than just good sex. Two weeks ago he messaged me and told me he was coming to ireland and booked a hotel stay for two nights for us. Everything was far too amazing and he stayed for longer than expected and spent loads of time with me. Since he went home I hate the thoughts of him with his fiance even though hes told me he has no feelings for her as shes mentally abusive to him and he cant leave her because she wont ever let him see his kids again. To this day out mutal friend does not know about me and him seeing each other. I know its best if I stop seeing him until he leaves his fiance but I font know how long that will take because he has to fight for the kids. He still has not gone to see any legal advice about having access to the kids because he says hes an expert and has found out everything. 

 Advice?

244,"I have around 400,000 followers online and over the last 4 years (high school) I have been working on building that brand. I started early on in my pre-teens by making some questionably cringe inducing videos and taking an annoying amount of photos of myself. Although this resulted in me being able to make money online and travel the world. It also “Ruined” a bit of my reputation. Most everyone in my town (that’s in high school) knows who I am, most don’t say anything when they see me but it’s evident that they’re looking but sometimes I get heckled, mostly by younger guys. It’s not fun. Groups of kids will run up on me, film me and toss slurs and poorly worded jokes. Being called a “Pussy” doesn’t hurt it’s just the fact that people would actually run up on a stranger and try and get a rise out of them like that. I can’t go for a walk into town with my girlfriend without my name being called out followed by “Faggot” It’s embarrassing especially when I’m with her. They always show up in groups never alone (obviously) I have no problem clocking a 10th grader in the jaw if it ever came to that, but it never does. I’m not a big guy so I don’t really know how to intimidate, I’m nearly 18, 140lbs and I’m about 5’10. I’m just looking for some advice on how to continue to go about my life without losing my mind.

I would get rid of my social media but It’s more or less my job, I pay for almost everything with the money I make on it. I’m in no way trying to boast about any of this, I just have nobody else to talk to about it and no other way to explain. Thanks for listening :)

TLDR: Guys heckle me in public because I have an online following and I’m not sure what to do or how to respond, I hate having to ignore it and walk away while they cuss me out and film it.

248,"I can't stand reading books because every few sentences or so I get distracted.  Just a couple minutes ago I was trying to read a book and by the second page I was having a hypothetical conversation in my head explaining the summary of another book by the same author to a friend.  This daydreaming happens 99% of the time I try to read.  In the past I've been able to read books if they are particularly thrilling or I can relate to, however this is a very small % of books I read.  Most of them I cannot focus enough on to read.

251,"Hi all, 

My girlfriend, who I absolutely adore, just told me that she was pregnant. We talked it over and have concluded that an abortion is the best course of action. We are both first year college students and nowhere near ready for a child. 

However, both are families are pressuring us to keep the baby (hers more than mine). 

I know that we can't care for a child, but I having this feeling that I'm making a huge mistake. ",28Mar2017,10
255,"Its probably going to be long so thank you if you read this entire thing. I live in a really big city that im not going to name. I want to rant about how much this place sucks, but im not going too. Thats my opinion. I live here with my SO and his family, and i love them all so much. Me and my SO have lived together over 1 year and have been together for over 3. Thats not alot i know, but we are perfect together. We have our problems like everyone else. But were capable of getting past things and weve grown together quite well. My SO is still currently trying to figure out his path. Hes going back to school soon and im so happy for him. But i am still here not knowing what to do. It sounds so stupid when i write it out, but this place just bogs me down. I hate it here so much. All ive talked about to anyone since moving here, is going back home to my green foresty place that i lived in before here. Crappy circumstances brought me to this place when i wasnt an adult yet, and ive been stuck here ever since. Now that im older, it feels like its really bothering me more and more. I cant find the energy to do anything. Im depressed. My anxiety is worse than ever before. Im just not in the place i call home. I love nature, and yes theres nature here everywhere but its not the same. Its still cement and bricks and people on top of people. 

I got off the phone with my mom a bit ago. She lives in the place i call home. I cried alot because i miss her and just miss my life there, and she told me she would help me move back if i want too. And fuck yes i want too. But i dont want to lose my SO. I dont want to do the long distance thing. I just cant. I dont want to throw away our relationship just to move away but at the same time i dont know. Half of me is screaming to leave and half of me is telling me to deal with what ive got. I try so hard to live an optimistic life and tell myself things will get better but lately most days im taken over by the anxiety that i could die tomorrow and all this time trying to reach something else was a waste of my life. It gets harder and harder to enjoy what i have here (not my SO just everything else in general). I want to ""man up"" and go out and get a job and save up for our future but i just cant even find the inspiration to do it anymore. It all takes time and i feel like i dont have any. I know no one can tell me what to do. No one can tell me what the right answer is. I just feel so lost, so fucking down and so unsure of what the fuck to do. ",28Mar2017,1
256,"Hi, I am a 15 year old guy. I weigh about 142 pounds, but absolutely none of that is muscle. I'm kind of fat, and I'm 5'10. When I'm wearing clothes, it's hard to tell, but I really don't feel comfortable with my weight.

Now, I've recently joined a gym (yay) and I try to work out around 3 to 4 times a week for an hour. But I'm having a hard time figuring out what I need for my diet. Ive tried to look online, but everything is either bullshit ""lose 20 pounds in a day by only eating this!"" Or stuff behind paywalls. I just want something that I can follow. Realistically, I don't even know any dietary language and facts (how much protein do I need, how do I get it, what should I snack on, etc) 

That being said, can anyone help me find/create a diet regime that I can follow every week? Thank you!!!",28Mar2017,2
257,"First, I'll start this by saying that my parents breaking up isn't the usual story.

I'm 23, living 80 miles away. My brother, 20, is still living in their (now just my mum's) house. On Saturday, my dad moved out into a flat. This wasn't the result of an argument, mainly the result of small nit-pickings and the fact they've been together around 30 years.

With my dad moving into his new flat, I want to get him something - Something I can maybe pass off as a house warming present, but is really a ""Hope you're ok, you know where I am"" kind of gift. My mum still has the house, the dog and my brother, so I'm sure she's fine (though any ideas for this too are welcomed).

Thanks guys!",28Mar2017,5
