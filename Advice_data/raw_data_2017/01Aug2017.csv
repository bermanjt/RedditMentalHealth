2,"Hello advice givers,

In December 2016, my mom was fired from her job as an office manager at a small medical family practice in Texas. Since January 2017, she has been looking for other medical office manager positions in North Texas but has not been hired because of the means in which she was terminated. I need advice on how to help her create a concise explanation as to why she was fired so as to appease hiring managers and dispell any potential concerns as to her performance as a new employee. I will do my best to stick to the facts.

- After 2 weeks on the job as the front desk lead, she was promoted to managing the back of the office.
- After 4 months on the job as the manager of the back of the office, she was promoted to the lead medical assistant.
-After 6 weeks as the lead medical assistant, she was promoted to the office manager for the entire practice and stayed in that role through December 2016.
-In light of her many promotions, she was never given a performance review, demerit or, raise in salary.
-In the 6 years that my mom worked there, 23 people were fired including my mother. Only 3 of whom were fired due to unlawful behavior on the employee's part (stealing and fighting). My mother did not order any of these firings, she was only instructed by the owner of the practice, the doctor, to inform the employees.   
-This is a very small practice that never employed more than 12 people at a time. I mention this because firing 23 people in 6 years is a lot when you already have a very small staff and are pertually understaffed. 
-My mom increased revenue for the practice by over 30% and earned over $50,000 in incentive revenue for the doctor. 
-In the 6 years that my mom worked there, she drafted 3 different resignation letters as a result of being disrepected by the doctor and immense unethical and illegal behavior by the doctor. My mum was stuck in a hard place because she is a single parent (my dad died as a teen) and helped pay for me to go to college. 
-On the day that my mother was wrongfully terminated,  the doctor said that she did not trust my mother. Her rationale being that my mother did not inform her of the rules of an incentive programe offered through one of the insurance companies they work with. This is not true-- there is a long paper trail of my mother informing her, however, it was the doctor who decided against enrolling in the incentive program and chose to blame my mom. 

My mother is in her 50s and is unwaveringly honest, dedidicated and hard working. In the job searching process, she has reached out to former bosses (from 20+ years ago in additon to recent ones) for recommendation letters and they all stand by the fact that she is a game changing type of employee. 

This situation is complicated as fuck. The general rule of thumb is that when you are fired you need to place blame on yourself and talk about what you learned from the experience. However, my mother is not to blame here. She was retaliated against by a vindicative and incompetent superviser and now my mom has been unemployed for over 7 months. 

I am desperate for fresh eyes on how to help my mom get her next office manager job. She has exhausted her medical field network -- the folks that she knows do not have any job openings at their jobs so she's been stuck with temp employment. 

What should she say when hiring managers/ interviewers asked why she left her previous job? 

Thanks in advance for reading.

The catch, I can't get on the plans until canceling the insurance I have through my dad (which is effectively null since he won't give us my updated info). My mother and I have sent several letters trying to communicate this, all with no response. How can I cancel my insurance through someone if they're refusing to cooperate?

4,"About a year ago, I was involved in an incident that resulted in the severe impairment of my vestibular system.  The vestibular system is what helps control balance and spatial orientation.  Because of this disorder, I experience a lot of vertigo, especially when triggered by certain things.  This causes additional problems, such as nausea (like motion sickness), and extreme disorientation.

So, that's putting it pretty lightly, but it's had a substantial impact on my quality of life.  I am cautious about the things I do; it's always on my mind.  The awesome news is, I was able to travel to go to a top doctor, and through physical therapy, I have come a long way in controlling it.  It's a lot better than it was, and I'm grateful for that.


I work at a small company.  We have two weekly meetings that are mandatory.  I work in sales.  The meetings aren't giving us any vital information; it's normally stream of consciousness, be a good sales person! kind of thing.  The meetings are very valued by the management.  In a way, they're a good way to gauge if the salesperson is working at all, and I understand that.  I love my job, the people I work with and I even like the management.  The meetings are a necessary evil for me having the job.  I've been with the company for several years.

In the meetings, the manager used to use a large TV screen to display his computer.  I can often watch TV (sometimes really flashy things make me sick but normally I am alright), but something about the refresh rate of a computer screen makes me very disoriented.  When it's done on a huge screen, it makes me so sick.  It's hard to explain - it's like getting really drunk, really fast without any control over it.  Disoriented and throwing up.  Violently shaking.  Extended exposure to these triggers will leave me in a bad spot for days.

My manager is overall a good person.  I brought up this weird disorder, he made a sort of effort to not use the TV screen.  But he forgot, and started using it again, or at least not making an effort not to use it.  I totally get it.  I wouldn't think about it all of the time if it didn't affect me so severely.  I had a serious discussion with him about it - saying if the screen was on, I couldn't be in the room.  It was hard to do.  I feel pretty humiliated by being this way; no one understands it.  I don't want to be the center of attention for something so dumb that no one gets.  I don't want to make a huge deal about it, and I also don't want to seem like I can't do my job because of this weird illness.  Luckily, I have been able to keep up with my job well; it's just extra hard and takes more time.

Okay, so my manager stopped using the screen for months.  It's been so, so much better for me.  I don't have to take days to recover from these meetings.  I feel a lot more like myself.

But recently, our company bought another small company in another area.  They've decided to use the TV to skype in with the other branch.  I don't look at the TV at all, but the light changing is still enough for me to feel really sick.  I'm afraid I am going to lose all the progress I've made.  Closing my eyes isn't really helpful; according to the PT, that makes the sensation of motion sickness worse.  

They know it is a problem for me, but I haven't said anything directly.  It makes me sick enough that I am considering quitting, but I love this job.

11," So for the last 3 years i have paid the internet bill that has been under my father's name. I just paid the internet bill for the month and that was the rest of my check. I paid it hoping that he would let me pay the rent the following week. If I didn't pay the internet bill the services would have shut off and I would have to pay the full bill which would have been over $200. I didn't make enough to pay him rent this week and I told him I would be able to pay him this week on Thursday. He told me he's going to hold the modem until he gets his money. I have no tv and the only source of entertainment I have is the internet like watching tv shows, YouTube videos, etc. Hes always been like this,We haven't had the best relationship, and I don't want to do something that I am going to regret. The only way he will talk to me is when the rent is due. I don't know what to do. This is putting more of a strain on what little relationship we have left. He doesn't care and he's told me.

This is the last big vacation we have before my 18 year old goes off to college.

We went to their favorite theme park and have ditched me the entire time. I get it, they don't want to be seen with their dad, but come on, I only see them after like 11pm because they stay til the place closes, then go out to eat and swim.

It's like I don't exist to them beyond being ""That guy in the room with us"". 

How do I get them to understand I want to spend time with them as well, because apparently asking them is going through one ear and out the other and if anyone has been to a theme park, riding things alone, is probably one of the saddest things about a theme park.

I just don't know how to get through to them, I mean I've ridden alone for the past two days.

I couldn't speak to anyone, I didn't want to get out of bed and I just didn't see me doing anything. It wasn't laziness. I would go to the gym but go home to the same routine. Now it's worse.

I'm 21 and I'm my 2nd year in college. I didn't want to go the first semester because I felt like I wasn't ready (which I wasn't). I didn't get any actual money from financial aid but I did get a BOG waiver to cover the fees for the classes. I was working at the supermarket at the time and I used my money to buy books and stuff. Yet I still failed some of the classes, eventually landing me in Academic probation. My transportation sucked and I couldn't rely on it. Eventually I got my car just this February. It's a little car but it gets me from point a to b. This helped me a bunch and I even got out of probation last week!

But I still feel horrible. My house is the source of the majority of problems. From having no food at the house to getting my hobby destroyed (gardening). I'm barely making any kind of money. I'm selling my own video games, plants (small rare fruit trees like Soursop and the like). But I can't better myself. Problems keep coming at me and I feel like it's getting too heavy to handle. This morning someone smashed my rearview mirro. My tags expire this month. Phone bill is finally here (I rely on it for job calls). I've been driving without insurance because I can't afford it. I do live with my family but I don't get treated like it. I can't eat with them. I pay my rent ($260 a month)  but get treated like a young kid. I might as well be on my own. My girlfriend is helping me when she can but I refuse for her to give in too much help. I want her to do what she's doing and continue her career.

22,"My older sister is pregnant with the first grandkid for both my parents and my brother in-law's parents. My brother in-laws parents have been divorced and remarried since he was a kid so there are technically three sets of parents. Unlike his family, which is huge filled with aunts and cousins and grandparents, my family is small with no living grandparents and only a couple (literally 2) aunts and cousins. 

When my sister was engaged, my mom and I hosted a bridal shower of around 30 people (majority my brother in laws side) at my mom's house. No one on his side offered to help, gave any money/time, nor did they really thank us for hosting. 

So now that they are pregnant, my mom and I wanted to throw a small, intimate baby shower for my sister at my moms house which would include only the moms, grandmas, aunts, and her closest friends ~ 15 people total. My sister, however, wants to have 30 people (similar to wedding shower) at a hall all because she doesn't want to have multiple showers and she wants to invite all his female cousins and close female family members.

My mom and I really don't want to do this as we don't really get along with his whole family, they don't contribute anything at all, and we feel it takes away the intimacy that we wanted to have for my sister.

24,"**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT AHEAD, TL;DR AT END**

So I know two people: a close friend and someone who I'm kind of, sort of friends with. We'll call them A and B, respectively.

A and B suffer from depression. A has very low self esteem and even cut at one point. B claims his parents died when he was very young and was adopted. A few years ago, B reached out to A, saying they could be friends because they could help each other battle their depression. Their friendship went on until somewhere last year, when school was on. B asked out A to be her boyfriend. A accepted. 

Some time later, B revealed that he had terminal cancer with about a year left and sent A pictures monthly reports from doctors on his progress with it. B's depression worsened as well, up to the point of cutting. A, wanting to be nice, dedicated pretty much all her time to being with B for the remainder of his days to the point of shutting out her closest friends and lying to her parents to visit B. 

However, B's behavior got very unusual shortly after. He started calling A many cruel names, blaming her for all his problems and spread lies about her to his friends, which they spread to everyone else in turn. He would threaten to kill himself if she didn't come over to his house, keeping her from doing what she wanted or needed, as well as if she hung up the phone during a call, forcing her to stay up hours past midnight to keep him alive. All of these calls ended in fake gunshots. One time, B's mother texted A saying he shot himself in the arm and was in the hospital. B himself would send pictures of his wounds saying A did this to him. B would keep sending pictures of cuts on his arm and a gun saying he would kill himself to endlessly torture A. One minute he would be spamming horrible messages to her, and spammed ""i love you please don't leave me"" to her hundreds of times the next. He would also badger her for sex, saying she was a horrible person for not fulfilling his last requests when she refused. Although it didn't really happen, she reluctantly gave him a blowjob once. This is just some of many horrible things B would do to A. 

Later, A got a text from another number. The person revealed themselves to be B's true mother, saying the previous person claiming to be her was just an impersonation by B's friend. She revealed to A that none of what B said about himself was true. His parents never died. He never had cancer. He forged all the medical reports and documents. He never cut himself or went to the hospital. He went on tumblr pages and retrieved pictures of other people's cutting. He did all of this just to get her attention. And the name calling and threats of suicide? He did it just to be a shithead. And he knew A would be too sympathetic to leave him because she thought he was terminally ill.

Anyone would have left him and report him, sue him, file a restraining order, take him to court, or hire a hitman, but A never left. After a few days of silence she started talking to him again, saying they can continue their relationship as friends. No one knows why but her. In fact, she only revealed her relationship to her closest friends. She doesn't want to report him to anyone, nor does she want anyone to do so for her, claiming it's so her parents won't find out she was lying to them about going to his house the whole year, despite the insistence of her friends to bring him to justice.

Someone vows to report B to authorities if he even approaches A again, which goes against A's wishes. I'm not sure which side to take. She may not want to report him, but the rest of her friends do. At the same time, his punishment would answer everyone's cry for justice. What do I do?

TL;DR: A friend was in an extremely abusive relationship with someone lying about having cancer, his parents dying, and him cutting. She found out but is still friends with him. Someone wants to report him to authorities, which is against her wishes. I'm not sure whether to join that person to make him pay for what he's done or just stay silent about it to follow her will.

26,"I'm 16, I live with my family, as one does at the age of 16. My parents divorced when I was like 4 and my dad moved to Tennessee so he's like gone. My mom started dating this guy about 5 years ago and he's actually the worst human being ever. 

       He calls my mom things like a psycho bitch or a cunt. He always makes her cry and whenever they fight she's the one that ends up sleeping on the couch. I would also like to add that he would literally be homeless without us supporting him. My dad doesn't pay child support so we're already poor as it is so we don't have extra money to spend on him.  

      He has punched my mom in the face before and she had a giant ass bruise on her jaw for a week. He smokes weed in our garage, and while I'm not one to shame weed smokers, it's where I live and I don't want it to reek. He also smokes cigarettes in there to which just adds to the smell. He hits my dog when she does something wrong, he actually has pushed her down the stairs before. 

     And as of late, he was in jail for a week, my mom bailed him out with money that came from nowhere, because he broke into a woman's house and robbed her. Now he's still living at my house but he's on house arrest! So he's stuck at my house 24/7. 

   Whenever I try to talk to my mother about how awful he is, she defends him over me which makes me angry and hurts my feelings. When I told her I was going to tell my dad about the weed in the garage she said that if I snitch she would be getting in trouble, so I can't. I cannot stand him, I hate him so much, I want to move out; but I can't. What am I supposed to do? ",01Aug2017,3
29,"For some background, my long-term, live-in boyfriend and I broke up in early May. We had a two bedroom apartment that we shared with my best friend, who had already been planning on moving out within the month. That put me in a desperate bind for a roommate, so I ended up moving a mutual friend in. We were not complete strangers, but we might as well have been, as we did not really know much about each other at all. This was not an option I would have normally jumped on, but I couldn't afford rent by myself and I didn't know anyone else who could move in.

 

She moved in mid-May. My other roommate graciously agreed to sleep on the couch until he had planned to move out in June. But he ran into a bit of a landslide of financial problems that lead to him staying until he gets a new vehicle and gets back on his feet. (He bounces back quickly but has run into a string of bad luck on and off since and his move-out date has been pushed back until mid-August as of right now). I gave this bit of info because it is important to note that there are currently three people living in the apartment (just like there had been when my ex still lived here).

 

Flash forward to the problem at hand. Our region has a credit option as one of the payment methods, which is what we went with. We essentially put money on a card that serves as credit to power our apartment. It puts a dollars and cents value on a certain amount of electricity, which works really well for powering a small apartment with inhabitants that work during the day and conserve power (it basically has the opposite effect if you use power carelessly, so this option isn't great for people running a lot of electricity during the day). My new roommate left town for the last week of June and did not return until the first week of July. My other roommate and I had put $25 each ($50 total) on our power cards before she left, without asking her to contribute for the week that she was gone. Up until that point she had been great about putting money on her own card, so we never even had to discuss how or when she would contribute her share. The week she returned my other roommate and I both put $20 on it to stay ahead of the game. Neither of us thought to discuss it with our other roommate, as she had always been on top of things, but I realized later that (based on how much money we used per day and how long it took for our credit to get low), she had not contributed since before she went out of town. After discussing things with my other roommate, we decided not to make a big deal out of it. We figured she was just getting back into the swing of things, but would surely remember to put money on her card later, as she had always done so before.

 

Counting from the very last time she contributed anything to our power, my roommate and I have spent $100 each on credits and she has not put money on her card once. When our credit gets low, there's a small box in our kitchen that beeps every few seconds as a warning. There is only one reason the box beeps (low credit), and you have to physically push a button on the box to stop the beeping. The past three times that our credit has gotten low, she was home to shut it off. The first time, I had anticipated our credit would have been low, and wondered why the box hadn't started beeping yet. I checked the box hoping she had added some money, only to find out that we had less than $2 left. The box starts beeping at $9, so I texted my other roommate and asked if he had turned the warning off, to which he replied that he hadn't. At that point, I had to leave for work and didn't have time to put any money on my card. New roommate was home and I was certain that the power would go out within the day, which was my admittedly passive-aggressive, friendly reminder that our house was powered by money and not a magic fairy. When I returned from work, new roommate was still home and the power was still on-- miraculously. We had almost nothing left. She had some company over and I decided not to outright say anything, as that is not a subject I would want brought up in front of my company if the tables were turned. Instead, I informed her that I was going to get power, hoping it would drive her to throw some cash my way or at least say she was going to contribute later, but that didn't happen.

 

The next two times, it was only be a miracle that I happened to see the words ""low credit"" flashing on the screen of the box. She happened to not be home either one of those times, but neither my other roommate nor I had been the ones to turn the warning beep off, meaning that both times she knew our credit had gotten low but said nothing and made no attempt to get money on the box.

 

At this point, I feel like her grace period is over, and after turning the warning off I know that she is well aware that someone is paying for power. As my other roommate does not have a vehicle, I always drive him to contribute money of his own, so I know exactly how much money he has contributed. In fact, we usually contribute the same amount each and do it all in one transaction. 

 

Today, after realizing that there was less than $2 worth of credit and that she had shut off the warning for the fourth time, I find myself so incredibly angry. I have two dogs, and although she is not responsible for caring for them in any way, it seems a little rude and selfish to me that she has failed to so much as give me a heads up when our credit is low if only for the sake of not having the power go out on the animals in 100+ degree weather. I know that at this point I haven't been upfront about it with her, and I suppose that part is on me. If you're wondering why I haven't said anything thus far, there are a few reasons for it.

 

The first and most important reason being that I really feel like I shouldn't have to. Because of this, I don't freaking want to. She is living here and using power, contributing to the bill should go without me having to say. Discussing money is awkward enough as it is.

 

Secondly, she is a terrible communicator. She approaches simple conversations with a very harsh tone. I think this is partially due to her being bad at communicating in general, and also partially due to her learning that people give in to her when she speaks so abrasively. I don't tolerate being spoken to in a disrespectful tone and have had to talk to her about it once before when she very rudely demanded that I do the dishes because she wanted a glass of water and I had used all the cups. I informed her that there were actually plenty of clean dishes in the dishwasher, and that I was more than happy to receive any concerns she had with me in a respectful way, but I did not appreciate the way she had approached me. After I was firm about that, she changed her tune and apologized, but there have been several incidences since where she has spoken to my other roommate and I a bit harshly.

 

Lastly, things are a bit tense between us right now as it is. Since she has moved in, my once near-perfect dogs have been misbehaving like never before. My roommate didn't work two weeks in a row (first she had a UTI, then she got a cold), and I came home every single day of those two weeks to her complaining about my JackChi barking ""all day long for no reason"". I assured her that he has never barked for ""no reason"" and asked her for the details of when he started to bark. Although my dogs are my babies and I know them and their barks very well, she insisted that he was just running around the apartment barking at nothing all day long, and had an explanation and possible reasons for why he was barking. I couldn't find any more polite ways to tell her that her knowledge on my dogs after two months of living with me was not going to surpass mine (I have already caught her making up and being completely wrong about things they've done before this, mind you), I agreed that she maybe was right to end the conversation. Last week my work schedule changed so that I now get off earlier, and I got a random day off in the middle of the week (which never happens), and I actually got a bit of an insight on what her days off of work seem to be like. I witnessed her bringing several strangers in and out of the apartment, multiple times a day, all of which my JackChi barked at. A few times she didn't realize I was home and I caught her using a really nasty tone with my dogs and threatening to hit them (I do not hit them), and then changing her tone when I walked out of my room and she realized I was there. One day last week my JackChi was barking at the door, and when I opened it she was sitting on the stairs with some random guy I've never met. No big deal, but for the fact that she said ""He wasn't barking at us, he's been barking all day long for no reason long before we got here."" I informed her that I had been home all day off of work and that I knew she hadn't been, and that he hadn't been barking, and she said ""He's just crazy"" as if I hadn't caught her in a lie. Another time last week she lied about the times he was barking again without realizing that I had been home with him at that time. I think she was trying to continue the charade that he was barking for no reason after I'd witnessed that he did bark on and off all day only when she was bringing strangers to him in and out of the house. So I simply told her that it was no big deal if she was bringing people over, and I understand why his barking was annoying from her perspective, but that he does bark at strangers, and gave her a list of some commands that get him to calm down and stop barking. She essentially refused to use the commands, so there really isn't much I can do to help stop him from barking at all the people she has in the apartment when I'm not there. Ever since, she has had a bit of a tone with me and it has been awkward and uncomfortable in my own house. On top of that, she has brought a few people in who have been rude to me and my dogs.

 

I feel that all of these things would be tolerable for the time being if she was contributing any money to power, but because she isn't it is all especially getting on my nerves. She responds in such a rough tone, especially when being confronted, I'm worried that saying something will turn into something more heated and that I won't be able to contain my annoyance and communicate maturely. Does anyone with experience with this kind of situation have any advice on how to delicately bring the situation to her attention without creating a bigger issue? I could really use the help!

30,"I live in a three bed room, one bathroom with two friends, the other two roommates only know each other through me. Basically my roommate's girlfriend sleeps over almost every night, five or six times out of the week, sometimes a week straight. Sometimes in the morning when I'm getting ready for work, she's in the shower when I have to be there, and my roommate isn't even home. This has been addressed, but it's just an example. Every night they come home and cook dinner and hang in the kitchen and the living room. 

Me and other roommate stared wondering whether or not she actually lives with us because it's so frequent. We sat roommate in question down yesterday asking if his girlfriend lives with us, to which he laughed and replied no. We said if she is going to be over as much as she is then she is going to have to start paying money to which he laughed. He doesn't think she needs to pay anything because he's the one paying his share of rent. He said he doesn't understand why her just sleeping in his room warrants her paying any sort of rent. I'm sort of a bad arguer so the conversation didn't end positive and there are weird house vibes now.

We were hoping that he would just get the hint and not have her over so much but she's over again tonight. I am assuming he never told her we talked because if I was her, I would have probably been offended and stayed away for a while. (I feel as if this was going to happen regardless of outcome) 

To my roommate's defense, he did decorate much of the place and does clean often. He was also denied being on the lease due to bad credit but I let him live with us anyways (he's a good friend and we go way back, I've also lived with him before with minor issues)

I don't know, sometimes I just want the living room empty or kitchen empty for me when I get home from work but I feel like I never have that. I know that this can all be sorted through talking but that's besides the point.

Should we have my roommate's girlfriend pay rent? Or am I just an asshole? ",01Aug2017,6

She is very nice, funny, outgoing, smart and amazing. Recently my cousin has been asking me to go hang out with the two of them, my crush and my cousin.  We have fun and all but I feel like I'm too shy. I really wish I could be more social. I want to be friends with her. She says we're friends but I feel like I need to talk more. I can't though, she makes me feel nervous. My nose starts to sweat when she talks to me and I can't make eye contact with her. Do I like her?
There's also another problem. I think my cousin might like her. I asked her one night if she liked her friend. She said no but the way she was talking to my crush made it seem like she was interested. I haven't told my cousin about my feelings. I haven't told anyone yet about what I'm feeling.

38,"I was talking to some coworkers today and I commonly hear people say things like, ""I regret so much of what I did in my 20s"" ""In your 20s you always do things you regret"" and so on. Basically suggesting that your 20s is a time to be reckless, let loose, and do things you later regret.

Well, this is a good problem to have, but I'm 29 and I honestly can't think of one thing I did that I regret. Am I just wrong here? I'm having a hard time thinking of something.

And they say you regret the things you *don't* do but I also can't think of something I *didn't* do that I regret. So I'm at a loss there, too.

Seems doing stupid things in your 20s is a very common experience I'm missing. I'm seriously considering doing stupid things in the next year before I turn 30 so that I can relate to other people.

But I think doing something *knowing beforehand* that I'll regret it defeats the purpose.

I guess perhaps it's better for me to ask **how to identify things that I regret?** I find it hard to believe there is really nothing I regret, but I just can't think of anything

49,"About 9 months ago my sister and i had a huge argument. She is a feminist i am a mens rights supporter, egalitarian, and im even sex postive, but i am very much anti feminist. I have never once in my life said or done anything hateful to an ethnicity, gender, or orientation. 

The argument started when our mom (i was driving them to an event) brought up my going to a male support group. My sister started to hesitantly as the nature of the group, and when she asked if it was a mens rights group i asked why that would be a problem? The next words she asked were ""Do you believe in equal rights?"" 

She has known me her entire %*$&ing life, she knows how deeply i care about justice, and equality. After that we had the fight you might imagine between an anti feminist and a  feminist.

51,"Hello, all! This is my first post to this thread and I'm coming here to ask you all if anyone has gone through something similar to me.

Minor Life Details:
 
* Raised by non-religious, modest middle-class working parents of whom have done a great job of providing everything I needed. 
* I'm 20 Year-Old White Male
* I'm politically considered a ""Young Outsider"" with a tendency to lean towards Republican
* I currently work 2 nearly-minimum wage jobs
* I attend a University that I PAY FOR outright in bulk payment (saved from my jobs)
* On my 13th birthday, we were evicted from our home and had to live in a hotel, then move into a 50ft single-wide trailer. (we have since moved into a nicer home)
* I'm greedy
* I believe money dictates a person's knowledge and can determine their life structure
* I live in a very low-socioeconomic town in North Carolina that has an average wage of $27k.
* I currently commute to college via a 40 minute drive from my house.
* I recently purchased a car last year that's basically a piece of shit, but I intentionally purchased it so that I wouldn't have to worry about scratches, car payments, etc.

----------

So now that I have a few details posted about me personally, I reached a conundrum today whilst browsing the Walmart isles buying my personal groceries. Every time I pass an individual, I make an instantaneous judgement against them according to how they look, act, or are buying.

For example, I view a Walmart worker and instantly think they are 'lower' than me. And I believe this because: 

* 1. I am enrolled in an University 
* 2. Have a financial sense to save enough for college 
* 3. Have enough self-discipline to want to do better 
* 4. Acknowledge that my part time jobs are bullshit anyways

I sound like a douche, right? I'm completely fake to people and I would rather them all leave me alone because I inadvertently feel as if my association with anyone 'lower' than me will bring me down. Admittedly, my ego is quite large but most would not assume that since I don't seem arrogant on the surface.
The only two people who truly understand my arrogance is my long-term girlfriend of 5 years (who I think I'm better than), and my mother. Both of which have told me that I need to reach out to someone about this.

I'm coming to this subreddit in search for something that I can either read, go to, etc. to better understand why my brain instantly judges peoples' worth by their appearance or money.

Also, this issue is rooted a lot deeper than I'm making it appear in the text above. I personally think my parents are dumbasses (they blow money) and I believe my girlfriend is a true dimwit. Of course, this pushes them away in the sense of how I talk to them and act around them.

However, over the years, I've gotten better with controlling my body language and word usage when talking to someone I believe is 'lower'. It's almost as if they don't even know I'm judging them right to their face.

PLEASE. I want to attempt to fix this before my ego gets too large. I can't just STOP thinking about it.

54,"I've been seeing my girlfriend for a little over three months now but I have known her for years. She had broken up with her boyfriend rather recently before we started talking about our romantic interest in each other. In the first month of our relationship she would talk about her ex a lot but that has pretty much completely died out at this point. She has celebrity crushes, but who doesn't? the thing that alarms me is how she talks about them. Just the other night we were talking and I had mentioned something to do with James Franco and she said ""If I had the opportunity I would shove James Franco up in me"". I didn't really know how to respond I just couldn't believe that she would say something like that to me. She says stuff like that a lot though about other people. Another thing she does is she has a collection of ass pictures that other guys send her. One time she had told my best friend that she missed being single. She is also in a chat with two other guys and they often talk about sex and their personal kinks. All of these things weigh a lot on me and I was wondering if it is completely outlandish to be upset over these things. Am I just being a jealous asshole? ",01Aug2017,2
55,"Ever since I can remember, I have always had a problem with connecting with the world. I vividly remember standing against the wall in primary school on my own at break time with no one to talk to everyday. I was relentlessly bullied by other people and teachers (which people find hard to believe about teachers but it happened). Then I would come home and just numb the pain through video games. Everyday at that young age was a mental challenge. I was pretty much alone from the moment I entered that primary school to the day i left.

This loneliness continued in junior school with only short bursts of social stability but bullying or exclusion continued at nearly the same rate. A short but shameful side came out at one point where I would just be a dickhead to try desperately fit in I.always struggled to maintain any friendships or even create a true friendship in that matter. 

I have pretty much been alone all my life.
College was just as hard. The day I started college, my grandad passed away and people wanted nothing to do with me so I ended up dropping out. After that, so much fucked up shit happened. I was in and out of homelessness, I managed to get a girlfriend but she ended up sleeping with my best mate at the time . People I thought were my friends just fucked me off , however I tried my best at not letting it affect my way of thinking.

Fast forward a few years later, I started to seriously struggle with anxiety and depression . It was a very introvert experience that ended up overloading my mental health because throughout all of it I externalised ridiculous and comical behaviour to try and drown out how sad I felt which in the long run has caused a lot of damage to my mind and left me unable to speak to a councillor because the sadness  became an abstract mess.

Months into the severe depression, I found a friend randomly on a night out and from day one we got on so well. Our friendship was unexplainably special. And it got to a point where we were spending nearly everyday together. For the first time in my life I had real friend, someone who felt like a brother. He helped me so much and we did a lot of things that were wasted in time by my inability to connect at school. We had a lot of crazy adventures, one specifically were when we were in the middle of a forest with no other humans for miles and then we ended up seeing some mad crazy ufos close up which we managed to run away from and after we escaped he said specifically 'I will take this to my grave.' 

A year later he was stabbed to death. I heavily disconnected from my family soon after because it was just such an emotional mimdfuck. I was told to just get over it. My mother even ripped up the speech that I read at his funeral 
His death triggered an abstract explosion in my mind,  which is impossible for me to express. The best way to explain it is in this scenario:

When a person is doing something such as simply polishing a spoon, they are either thinking about nothing , dreaming for their shift to be over, just thinking about the task at hand or just simply thinking about the day 

When I polish a spoon, my mind is just disconnected,I can't stop thinking about how cruel life is,  why are we here , unexplainable concepts



After his death, even less people wanted to talk to me or on the flip side they just felt too much negative pressure (which always pissed me of a bit because I went to great efforts to normalise and emotionally digest this tragedy I still have along way to go but I am making progress.

This is where my nan ties in. I use to be very close to her and would always do anything for her. We even shared the same birthday. After my friend died , Everytime I went to my nans, she couldn't cope with my emotional heartbreak so it was just easier for me to stay away but now she has gone too.

So after around 20 years of loneliness or shitty friendships or anxious friendship , two people I love the most and that I were infinitely comfortable with die and it's hard to process 

In a nutshell how do I deal with this, any tips ? 

How do I stop myself from internalising how insane I feel?

56,"I know I don't need to, but I'm very appreciative because of the way they found it and also because they looked me up on Facebook to contact me (my ID's address is old so it would have been bad to just mail it).  Replacing my license would have required me flying to another state. 

Also I don't have much money since I don't have a real way to take out money. It seems awkward to open up the wallet to take it out? Like I'm checking they didn't steal the money?

I love her to death and I hate that I question her intentions at times because I truly trust her with anything but I question everything she does that makes me even a little bit uncomfortable.

58,"Some context: yesterday was a fairly normal day for us. We took our dog for a walk from about 630 to 730PM. We're in Houston so of course it's pretty hot, but she's used to her walks and seemed totally normal after we got home (she did let out a slight yelp upon getting into the car as we left home, but I think she made slight contact with a hot seat belt buckle and it momentarily startled her). 

We left for a brief trip to the store later, came home about 930PM, let the dog straight outside. While she was out there we didn't hear any noise from her or in the yard in general, but when she came in her head was extremely low to the ground and she was circling. We were bemused for a moment but pretty quickly became concerned by her demeanor, which resulted in us essentially chasing her upstairs to try and check her out and make sure she wasn't hurt. Probably an unwise move in hindsight because she was panicked in the first place and we didn't help matters any. She seemed to trip a bit and I was convinced something had happened to one of her hind legs, but after inspection we could find nothing on her, and no spots she was especially tender to the touch. She panted relentlessly for a long time, settled for a bit, and then that pattern repeated off and on throughout the night/has persisted throughout all of today and this evening as well. Settle, pant and pace, settle, pant and pace, etc, etc, etc. 

Her only incredibly worrying symptom seems to be that she cannot stop panting. Anytime she's at a casual rest/isn't sleeping, she's breathing pretty hard and seems restless. Her demeanor is only slightly off otherwise, as in she hasn't barked in the yard like she normally would and hasn't seemed especially playful, but she is still responding to noise/her name/wants to be close to us, etc. Her bowel movements are normal, she's eaten a bit and drank water. She doesn't visibly limp and hasn't whimpered or become aggressive/antisocial. She does seem to walk at a crooked veer sometimes though. 

We already took her to the vet and they ran blood tests, but everything came back fine. They also couldn't find any visible/outer places of trauma or tenderness. They gave her tramadol in case the panting is in fact pain related, and it made her sleep peacefully for awhile, but the panting still resumes pretty consistently anytime she's up and about. 

They instructed us to wait a day or two to see if she improves before updating them, at which point if nothing has changed they'll refer us to a specialist. I'm just worried and incredibly prone to anxiety in the first place, and thought it couldn't hurt to at least try throwing a line out to see if anyone had theories or suggestions.

64,"I have struggled with crippling OCD and depression for the last 5 years. I have dropped out of school, quit numerous jobs, and basically have turned into a person I am disgusted by. I am super indecisive and impulsive (which I can assure you is not a good mix), and I spend the majority of my days obsessing and avoiding difficult situations that might require me to get out of my comfort zone or do work.

I realize I am at rock bottom right now and the only way I can help myself is by taking medicine. I realize my brain is not producing chemicals that I need to be a functional human being, and I know that it never will without medical help. Despite being aware of all of this I am still *terrified* of taking medicine. 

A major part of my OCD is an aversion to drugs, or anything that might potentially alter my mental state. When I was 15-17 I took 10 mg of prozac and eventually bumped up to 20 mg for around 6 months before abruptly stopping. I never took a therapeutic dosage so I'm sure I never got any benefits of the drug. I was too scared to even take 20 mg at the time honestly, but now I can't believe I even did that much.

I have tried therapy and have quit that every time I made even a modicum of progress. My OCD makes me lose interest in things I feel super passionately about even hours ago, so often times I would leave therapy highly motivated and ready to do the things my therapist and I mapped out, and then the next day I would change my mind and succumb to depression/anxiety.

I have also heard that if you are under the age of 25 taking antidepressants can be detrimental to brain development and can even cause some people to become suicidal, the ""Black Box effect"". I am a 20 yr old male so I worry that I could fall victim to this.

I am kind of a mess right now and I'm not even sure if this was a coherent explanation of my problems, but all I know is I can't keep living like this and I need to get over my fear, but I have heard and seen far too many horror stories on reddit of the negative effects of antidepressants and how they can alter your thinking and brain chemistry permanently to willingly take the meds and help myself. If anyone have positive experiences with medication, or can refute some of these ""horror"" stories that would be amazing and I would be so grateful.",01Aug2017,3
67,"Hello everyone,

I'm 20 and currently on my first year of software engineering at Sydney. Recently my mom has been aggressively pushing me to ""do something with my life"" because I'm always on the computer a lot. I am currently studying full-time, going to university 4 days a week, and am getting straight A's.

She always rants about a lot of things like, ""Why don't you find a job and be useful? You don't even need to study because you're so smart."". She also once recommended that I ""take a couple of years off university"" to go apply for her cousin's company, although I feel like she just wants me to drop university completely to work there.

Another one she always brings up is, ""Think of something and start a business."" or ""Why don't you figure out how to invest and do it and become the next Warren Buffett?"". She constantly talks about how her co-worker's children are actually doing useful things and I'm just sitting here doing nothing.

Everyday she would come home and start ranting about how useless I am and it's really starting to break me down. I really do quite agree with her, but I guess the main problem here is that I don't know where to start.

Should I be looking for a simple part-time job? (Would people even hire me even when I'm only free 3 days a week?)

Should I try to find an internship of some sort? (Paid or unpaid?) Although I believe that my university makes us do internships somewhere around the second or third year.

I've read about the very basics of investing, but honestly don't know how to start. I understand that time is on my side when it comes to this.

I was the one who applied for it, but the money was deposited into my mothers account because the government had to check both of our credentials.. I guess she has better credit than me so that's why the money was deposited into her account..but my mom thinks that I shouldn't have access to it.. mind you she's already spent $5000 of this money, and everytime I ask her about the money she gets defensive..

78,"My landlords are an elderly Chinese couple that speak almost no English. Their son, who lives in the home manages their property. 
I have decided to get a service dog , to act as a medical alert dog for my diabetes. I told the son this, he said he needed to 'ask' his parents. despite their already being 3 dogs the parents originally said no, I realized then they had no clue of the laws in place that make it illegal for a person who needs a service dog do to denied by their landlords who have it. I asked the son if I could give him some info to pass along to his parents and if we could talk in person because I needed to explain some things (as we only speak in text because he's never home and when he is I don't ever see him) and he just said he'd ask again and mention that it's a service dog. 
So this time he's telling me that the parents say I can, but I need to pay an extra fee each month to keep the dog, which is also against the law. I don't know what to tell them, but I don't want to upset them because they've already raised hell for the owners of 2 of the other 3 dogs in the house (the other one being the sons dog) and I don't want them do get pissed at me and start giving me issues too. 
How do I handle this?

To be honest, I am a person who has no secrets. I don't mind about sharing everything with the people close to me, because I like people being the same way. And I don't think I have done anything that needs to be a secret.

I was raped and it's sensitive. I have a few close friends, and I alredy told them, some of them cried and were very supportive. It's okay I told them? I told them with the purpose, of talking about it once in a while, i think about that very very often, and also I will go througt legal process, since I pressed charges.

Rape it's a part of me. It is bad to share it with the people close to me? It's bad if I share it with a person that might be special (loved one) somehow someday?

86,"Hi, long post coming, sorry... so I'm a 27 year old female currently living in the worst country for quality of life in Western Europe. I was not born here, I came here for a student exchange (from a country where education is free) and stupidly stayed because I met my boyfriend (who is a native) here. I've been here for 4 years now, so in a year I could apply for permanent residence. Trouble is, every day I am less and less willing to spend my life here. I would love to go back to my parents and restart my life, either self-teaching myself programming or trying to figure it all out from scratch. I have a BA in linguistics with a spec in translation but apart from an earlier vague dream of being a literary translator I haven't actually a clue what I want to do with my life, and I feel like I have lost a ton of time already. I currently have an office job which I tolerate (although early morning starts are killing me - I'm a night owl). I tried learning stuff after work/weekends but I am just too tired and depressed. I love my boyfriend, but he is not very intelligent (he's not retarded, but he's dyslexic and has some form of ADHD) and he cannot move away with me (at least yet) because 1) he has an 11 year old daughter (he's older than me) 2) he does not have an education (he works in construction) and 3) he only speaks English. I'm terrified of the prospect of leaving him because I'm, as he says, the best thing that ever happened to him and he has really worked hard the last few years to make our life better and I do love him most of the time, but recently I've realised how boring and poor our life is and how little we have in common. Even if we could somehow make a life here, I just don't believe I could be happy here.

89,"Hey r/Advice,
I have a good buddy I've been friends with for a few years now. He and his family went out of town and they asked me to take care of their cat, to which I accepted. They pretty much just gave me some cat food that only lasted 3 days (they were gone for a month and come back this Friday). When I talked to my friend about the cat, he said not to worry because she always just hid from people, wasn't friendly, and very anti-human in general (never let him pet her besides when he first got her). He also told me that the cat wasn't treated well/was *abused* by his dad, to the point where his dad would kick the cat across the room. That really scared me. So I got the cat, expecting a completely anti-social, anti-human creature that wouldn't let me pet her and would just be left alone. After 2 days, she let me stay in the same room as her without hiding, and on the third day she was letting me pet her. A week later we were cuddling in my bed. Over the past month I have made a very genuine connection with the cat, I love her so much and I know she loves me too. I don't want to give her back to her abusive family that treats her like shit. I talked to my friend and asked him if he could ask his family if I could possibly pay them to keep it, they refused. I am at the point that I would go to the police to keep it, but I have no proof that they kicked him besides what my friend said + it's my *friend* and I don't want to end our friendship by screwing over his parents. I'm going to be so emotionally devastated when I have to give her back, and I can't do it on good heart, but there's nothing else for me to do. What do I do?",01Aug2017,1
90,"I realize that this is a hallmark symptom of Asperger's.  I'm not especially socially awkward or inept, and having done some reading about Asperger's, I'm not sure that's the answer.

I go through periods of obsessing about things.  I think about it all the time, learn everything I can about it, and depending on the obsession, sometimes get quite good at what I'm obsessing over at a relatively rapid pace, I assume because I'm devoting so much of my thinking to it.  But, this is always followed by a complete disinterest, and a sensation that I've ""worn out"" the thing.

Have you ever heard a song you loved so much that you listened to it over and over until it completely loses what was initially so special about it?  That phenomenon pretty much defines my life.  My obsessions have included:

- Military/special operations/Navy SEALS

- Stocks/investment/finance

- Aviation

- Acting/theatre

- Boxing

- Law/politics

And lots of other things that I can't think of at the moment.  The only constant in my life has been music (I just finished student teaching as a music education major).  But even within that, I go through phases of obsession, and general disinterest.  For a while I thought I wanted to be a studio engineer and eventually a producer, then I wanted to write musicals, then I wanted to develop music notation software.  I think music has survived the ups and downs because I've been doing it so long, and it's the one thing that I've been doing long enough to be relatively objectively ""good at"".  

This has made figuring out my life trajectory difficult.  Student teaching went well, but by the end of it, I simply didn't feel like being a music educator anymore.

Given that getting really good at something to the degree that one can make a career out of it is often a decades-long endeavor, this has made figuring out my life trajectory especially difficult, because I recognize the fact that what I'm so passionate about today will not interest me at all a year or two down the road.

So, it's quite a complicated story. My twin sister has always had mental health problems, ever since she was very young. She's been on and off medication since the age of 11, which may or may not have been a factor in what happened recently. About three years ago my twin sister suddenly accused my father of molestation. She claimed that this abuse happened from the ages of 3 to 21. She was able to recount 'repressed' memories of the alleged abuse. Later, she recanted this accusation and instead accused my mother of the molestation. She has these 'memories' of abuse and even includes me and my sibling in them the only problem being that I have no memory of any abuse or any wrong doing whatsoever done by either of my parents. There is just no way that the molestation could have happened, at all. It is untrue, and just not possible. We didn't have a perfect childhood, but I believe in my gut that she is either making up these accusations or can't discern reality from this delusion she's living. Due to these accusations she's caused quite a rift in the family, and it is a hard subject for anyone to talk about. She's gone to multiple therapists (One of whom my family believes may have planted this molestation seed). Over the years her accusations have gotten more bizarre and have started to involve some of our childhood friends. I've tried multiple times to get the rest of my family involved in some sort of intervention for her, to help her. It's obvious there is something very wrong and she needs some sort of mental help. The problem is that my father is very against any sort of intervention, and he is the only person who is currently talking to my sister. What do I do? Do I keep pushing for an intervention? 

tl;dr: Twin sister accused both mother and father of molestation, recanted about my dad but still says my mother molested her for years. I feel very strongly that this abuse did not happen and that my sister needs mental help. Need advice on what to do. ",01Aug2017,1

I'm talking out of hundreds of people. But there's one big catch, it won't be available until October 1st. The original listing said September 1st which was also a bit of a stretch but the current tenant is now resolute for October.

People don't move from this building typically so I have no hope of something else opening up. It's extremely cheap for the area, size, and it's completely upgraded inside. I'm still on a lease until next April but I'm living with an ex boyfriend. We are on amiable terms now but it comes and goes, he broke up with me almost two months ago. He will be taking over the current lease as I can't afford it. 

I'm having an extremely hard time finding a place that someone else doesn't swoop in and get and that I can afford. I've been looking multiple times a day for a month now. It's prime season for moving and to top it off there are a lot of computer programmers that earn significantly more than I do that usually win out. 

I offered to buy the current tenant out but it sounds like it's going to cost me a lot of money to get her out faster as she doesn't have anywhere to go.

I wouldn't say I'm depressed as much as I'm just bored with my life routines right now.

Whether it be travel, watch a huge backlog of television/films etc and even attend medical appointments due to my current setup.

I don't have too much passion for the career I'm in, I'm 25 and would have ideally wanted to go into science, although coding/computer engineering is a big interest of mine. I would be able to give up my job and downsize my car to get a bit more in savings in order to get by for a 2-4 years while I spend time doing the things I want to do such as learning how to code, spending time with the family and sorting my health out.

However my dilemma is that I'm in a stable job with a decent-ish income for my position in life right now and should I give it up and in 3 months regret if I won't get it back, although right now I'm unable to spend proper time with family and friends and doing the things I enjoy.

Is it worth handing my notice in, taking a few years out, retraining and getting myself on track and refreshed and into a career I'd love, or should I stick it out as a stable job is something a lot of people would want.

I can talk for hours- and on dates, im always the one talking, entertaining and initiating conversation. Safe to say I have a TON of life in me...more than lots of people, def more than the idiots saying this to me- yet I'll meet people who will try to judge me and say ""you're so shy, or you're so timid.""  There is nothing 'shy' about me and compared to them---they would be ten times more 'shy' than me...but they have to put me down....

Most of the idiots saying this to me are 'smitten' by my charisma, beauty, and everything else so they resort to calling me 'shy' to bring me down...it's disgusting and pisses me off.

109,"This is gonna be a bit lengthy so please bare with me. In order to provide good advice, you'll need a lot of context. So about four years ago I formed something of a hangout club with my friends. We get together once a week to play some games and watch anime. We've watched countless shows and played through plenty of games as a group. Some shows we all loved, some our opinions were divided, and others... well, one person likes while everyone else completely trashes. Sadly these are usually the shows I pick.

To start out, I'll introduce the players. 

First there's Twitch(LoL main substituted to protect his identity). Not particularly good at games. Though he tells the best jokes, and I'd say has the best sense of humor. My problem with him is that he's contrarian by nature. Any game or show I introduce he will instantly dislike. Once that opinion is set, it's very difficult to change it. Despite this he is still reasonable. Just last week I asked him to stop shouting ""That guy is gonna die next! Oh here we go, he's dead! He's dead!"" during the show we were watching and he actually did. So that was nice.

Next there's Nasus. Easily the best player of the group. He's super coordinated and I rarely beat him without a ton of practice. He's also got a bit of a sharp tongue, and a short fuse. He tends to hold grudges if wronged and will usually act on said grudges in ways that hurt most. But more on that later.

Last there's Jinx (in real life he's a guy). Basically the wildcard of the group. Every group has one. He's an excellent statitician and can rival or even surpass Nasus in a strategy game if given the prep time for it. We share a lot of common ground when it comes to hobbies and I've spent many a late night playing LoL with him and chatting through skype. He's also, for lack of a better term, a sociopath. loss and grief have no effect on him (The way he puts it, ""death happens""). He finds all emotional scenes in any tv show, regardless of how well done they are, to be purely and utterly hilarious. This kills the mood for a lot of more serious shows. Also he hates Neon Genesis Evangelion and will get mad if someone makes a reference to it. Which really sucks because it's one of my favorite shows and I don't get to discuss it. While I hate that he passively ruins emotional scenes, I know he can't really help it and sometimes he apologizes when he goes to far.

Now as a group we've had plenty of hardship. Lots of heated arguments were had, both through instant messaging and in real life. There was the great Smash Bros debate of 2016. We haven't played that game since then. And of course debate usually sparks whenever Neon Genesis Evangelion comes up. 

Yeah, you can tell by my hobbies that I'm a pretty lonely guy. As a human being I can't function without social interraction. At times I've jokingly stated that this is more of a support group than a club. This is why I try to value the friendship more than the petty disagreements. It's why I've stopped talking about Evangelion when Jinx is around. And why I've put up with everyone's little ""eccentricities"" when they should offend me. 

At first it was just a way to hangout when we got out of high school. Just me, Nasus, and Twitch in the basement watching Attack on Titan or Cowboy Bebop while eating cookies and drinking a 2-liter soda. But things change. They started Talking more. Less about asking questions and more about criticizing the show. Jinx got added to the group. Nasus and Twitch got laptops and began browsing the internet instead of watching. Even when the show we were watching was one they suggested. I tried to get them to stop (since they tended to complain or ask questions about something when it was already answered earlier when they weren't paying attention) but my efforts were in vain and their distraction abuse grew. Eventually though I relented because I knew if I forced them, they'd just focus their efforts on trashing whatever we were watching. Also As I've said, I value the friendship more than the argument. 

This one day we were talking and I brought up the most recent season of Attack on Titan and how awesome it was to see that show come back. Jinx mentioned that he loved that show too. Which surprised me, since I expected him to hate it. Remember, this guy laughs at tragedies and hates characters who wear their heart on their sleeve. So I suggested we watch the new season together and the group unanimously agreed.

Fast forward to last week. For some reason everyone was especially Ornery this time. I don't know why. The game we played just minutes prior was pretty positive and lighthearted. Regardless, they questioned and complained about everything. Also I'm basically going to spoil a few major scenes from this show so if you were planning on watching it, you might want to stop reading here. 

Jinx: ""Wow, you can literally see an outline of a person's body in the wall there. See how it's darker toward the center?""

me: ""that's a pretty nice detail. I'm glad the animators put that in there.""

Nasus: ""Then why is titans being in the wall such a surprise to everybody?""

me: ""I don't know. It's not that big of a giveaway.""

Jinx: ""How would that shadow even get there though?""

me: ""Well it's been sitting in there for like hundreds of years I don't see why it wouldn-""

Nasus: ""That's fucking stupid!""

me: ""...""

A few scenes later, a bunch of teenage soldiers (typical for an anime) are holed up in a castle that's being raided by titans. One of them turns into a titan to save the others. 

Teenager: ""She was a titan this whole time? Are we sure we can even trust her?""

Nasus: ""She just saved your life! Why would you question her motives!""

me: ""Well the titans have been a threat for hundreds of years, it's no surprise that they'd question someone's allegianc-""

Twitch: ""But Eren Just turned into one last season! They don't have to not trust them anymore!""

me: ""I uh... (trying really hard not to reveal that this character betrays everyone later) There's a good reason for him to not trust her. I can't say much more than that.""

Jinx: ""They're so fucking stupid for not trusting he-""

me: ""I swear there's a good reason for it!""

Moments after saving the teenagers the girl is caught out and being eaten by titans. The teenagers, stunned, run towards her to attempt to save her. This is a very short moment that is interrupted by a fuckton of experienced soldiers showing up to eradicate all the titans in the area. regardless, we have this exchange.

Jinx: ""No! Don't run towards the titans! What the fuck is wrong with you, get out of there!""

Nasus:

#""EVERYONE IN THIS SHOW IS FUCKING RETARDED!""

me: ""that's barely even... that's just nitpicking. Look they're getting saved now...""

A few episodes later we have a very important scene. The identity of a certain Armored and Colossal titan is being revealed. As a way to subvert the audience's expectations, the reveal basically happens in the background while two people are talking about something in the foreground. During this, Nasus and Jinx are talking about some new Magic: the Gathering cards. I try to signal Nasus to quiet down. He stops talking for two seconds. And when nothing happens he just says, ""Wow, very important, twinfyre"" and goes back to talking. The reveal happens *literally seconds after he starts talking again*. I heave a sigh and say, ""Fine I'll just rewind it."" At this, Nasus locks up, aggressively opens his laptop, and ignore everyone for the rest of the episode. What was I supposed to do? I couldn't just tell him, ""hey they're about to reveal the identity of the titans here!"" The whole reason why that scene works is that it catches the viewer off guard. I didn't want him to get mad at me, but I didn't know any other way of getting him to pay attention!

Eventually that session ended and we all went home in pretty okay spirits. We told some jokes, watched some Youtube videos. There wasn't any lasting anger from the first few episodes. At least not from them. Try as I might, I can't bury the resentment I feel from what they said that night. I'm an enthusiastic guy. When I like something, I want to share it with someone. But the way they all acted is irreversibly grafted onto my memory of those scenes now. I can't remember them without also thinking about their over-reactions to them. And this is how it is with nearly every show that I like. Yes, this isn't an isolated incident. I can't remember Re:Zero without Jinx's laughter during the emotional scenes. I can't remember Mob Psycho 100 without Nasus's angry ranting about how much Mob is a terrible character. And I can't bring up this pain without starting another argument. At least not yet. That's what I need your advice for.

See, I'm not an eloquent speaker. And I certainly don't have a silver tongue. I stutter, I avoid eye contact, and my words don't always sound as good out loud as they did in my head. When I try to bring up a grievance I have, even when I do it politely, I risk starting another argument and ruining the mood for the next few hours. I can't afford to fail the speech check here. So I need your help. How do I get my friends to not be so irritating when we finish the show next week? I understand that this is just a stupid japanese cartoon and all that, but this is kinda a big deal for me. Especially since I loved the final episodes of this season so much.

111,"On a promotion list, have 1 month to decline or accept. If I decline, I am no longer welcome in the organization, with zero chance of returning. Been with the organization 22 years, am eligible to retire. Will be forced to retire if I decline. 

Staying 2 years more with additional obligation means about a 30% increase in retirement, plus a raise of about 15% for the next two years. Pay will be well above civilian market for working here in the US.

Leaving/retirement means looking for a new job, but I can't secure one too early, no one will talk to me 8 months from retirement (been trying for the last 2), which is why deciding to stay or go is so hard now.

Obviously it's a good promotion with great tertiary effects, (but wait, theres more!), but unfortunately family life suffers, wife is sick of current location, wants to move home, and we can't leave if I take promotion.

I have felt out the outside market, it's good now, but average pay will be almost 40% less for the sure thing positions and with retirement I'm barely bringing in what I make now - the only way to have a salary better than what I'm making now is to go overseas and do contract work in Saudi or Afghanistan, which I actually don't mind, but again wife doesn't want me to do that... rock and hard place, again, also these contract jobs come and go, driven by politics.

With all these details - what makes sense to an unbiased outsider? Oh, forgot to mention, I'm scared as hell about leaving, it's all I know, and I honestly feel as if I'm abandoning my counterparts I'm leaving behind... This is a behavioral health issue but it's an added stressor.

This is keeping me up at night, and I cannot for the life of me see one option as better than the other.

TL;DR -  I'm being forced by a job to decide right now to retire in 8 months or accept promotion in 1 month and incur 2 year obligation. Turning down promotion means forced retirement (still get benefits), without being able to find work since it's 8 months away. Both options suck in their own way, and both have pros, I can't see one side being better, any other perspectives will help.

113,"I recently had to break it off with this girl that I had been seeing. In our final correspondence, she was telling me that I was going to 'wish that I was dead' and that 'it's on' and that I need to 'watch my back.' I don't want to sound like a wuss, but I'm not entirely sure what she's capable of, as she's a history of mental illness.

114,"Hi all,

I am 8.5 weeks through a 10 week internship and I need some advice. I've already been paid the ten week salary from the internship yesterday, however last night I've noticed my left hand twitching.

So I am conflicted on whether I should call in sick due to a twitching in my hand? It has started last night and through a lot of research online I found that it is probably benign. However, I fear that it could be an underlying early symptom of something more serious such as carpal tunnel or ALS. 

However most of the time while reading about calling in sick, employers usually allow it to prevent a cold from spreading. But in my case it's to make sure I don't have an underlying serious neurological disease. So should I do it? I fear that this could be serious and if so I want to get it checked out asap.

One fear I have is my ""mentor"" in the program. He's told me on multiple occasions that he doesn't care about my life or what happens but just wants me to get my work done. So I don't know how he would react to this. However his boss, the director of my internship is very nice and doesn't like my mentor too much. I think she will be fine with this I guess.

I don't know. I feel that it is common sense as my health is my number one priority but what if it is benign? ",01Aug2017,3

118,"Sorry for the really long post, probably too long for most of you. To say thanks, I'll gild anyone who comments with a genuinely (or at least trying to be) helpful comment.

So, myself and this girl (C) were going through some issues in our relationships. We'd been gaming together for a couple of months, but nothing too in-depth socially. As such, we began to talk to each other about our issues and slowly realised that we should leave these abusive relationships (mine was 3 years long, hers was 4 months). As I knew she wouldn't have a PC to keep gaming afterwards, and she was poor, I promised to build her a PC from my spare parts because they were just lying about the place anyway (I actually bought most of the parts new, but that doesn't matter).

Over time with talking to each other about these issues, we gave each other the confidence to escape our relationships. The conversation began to get deeper, and before long we were flirting. She even told me she liked me (and I responded in kind).

During said flirting, she expressed a desire to see me naked, so of course I obliged (being completely against unsolicited photos of that nature). C feigned shock for some reason, which I misunderstood as a genuinely bad reaction. Panicking that I'd completely misread the situation and had become exactly what I hated, I blamed the hacker who had previously broken onto my facebook account and posted my nudes publicly for everyone to see. Stupid thing for me to do, I know.

She realised she'd left things at her ex's house, so tried to organise meeting up with him (I forgot to mention that he's in a drug peddling gang of some kind and has frequent run-ins with the police, beats people up for fun, gets violent with girlfriends etc). He purposely didn't bring the stuff to the meetup, so persuaded her to come with him to his house, where he confiscated her phone, went through it, saw the messages with me and went berserk, sending me death threats etc.

He wouldn't give her phone back, insulted her a lot, and something snapped in her so she didn't speak to me for a week.

In this week, my ex I'd left killed herself over me leaving. Her constant threats of this whenever I had to do work instead of talking to her are part of the reason I left her. Of course, I took this somewhat badly and needed c there to help me, but she'd gone.

Finally, C came back, called me and told me she just doesn't feel anything at all for anyone anymore. Just numbness. I thought that's fair enough, and just wanted to make sure she was alright.

We organised a meetup, I went to her house and we had sex (she initiated). I admitted what I'd actually done with the nudes, and she said she thought so and not to worry. Had sex again the next night where she initiated by placing my hand high on her thigh and making me stroke her whilst we were spooning.

This was when she began to mock me physically. She'd tell me how my penis wasn't as big as she had expected it to be, that she would be with me forever if I had a bigger penis etc. Told me she was out of my league etc (at the time I was fine with this as I thought she was too).

The following night, whilst she was asleep (but I thought awake), she placed my hand on her thigh in the same way again, so I began to stroke it gently. Up and down her thigh, stroking for quite a while. Later on, she opened her legs, put one leg over me so that she was on her back with her ***area*** open, facing upwards. I assumed this was a hint, so began stroking closer to it until I touched the outside of it, when she stopped me and asked me what I was doing.

Thinking that I'd misunderstood the situation, I stopped what I was doing and went back to just lying with her in bed. She kept pushing, trying to accuse me of wanting to rape her, saying why would I do that to a sleeping woman.

Later, she told me she wasn't actually sleeping, but was pretending to sleep and seeing how far I would go if she behaved like that. Obviously it backfired because I thought she was awake (and she was) and was trying to get me to do stuff (and I guess she also was?). At the time, I was incredibly apologetic because I never meant to do anything she didn't want, but slowly I've come to question everything with it. Was I being unreasonable there, or was she?

After this, she became a lot colder to me, mocking me more and more in any way she could. She'd pick arguments with me, target the exact things I'd told her I was most insecure about, and would bother me the most. Occasionally, I'd even get frustrated and argue back (I don't like arguing so usually I just let their anger fizzle out whilst agreeing with their points).

After she went home and I'd given her her new PC, we had another argument where she directly brought up my biggest insecurity as a personal attack, and even admitted it afterwards (but didn't apologise). This time, I raised my voice for the first time against a friend in years, and she kept bringing it up to tell me that I'm the only one of her friends who has ever done so to her. After this, she went off on one telling me how I wasn't who she expected, how I'm not a good person and that the things I do are only to make people think I am. She told me that I use people and she thinks I manipulate to get my own way.

A few days after this, she went back to her ex, and told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore (but we can still game together? Whatever that means). Unless I really have been such a terrible person, I really don't see how she can justify letting me spend over £1500 on her only to tell me she doesn't even want my friendship anymore.

I feel used, shit about every aspect of myself, feel a need to hang on to her because I invested so much. Usually I can kind of deal with breakups because I've never even been accused of being the unreasonable one, but the way things unfolded has genuinely made me question myself. I've never been a confident person, but now I'm struggling so much to see my worth after her.

I don't understand why this girl I wasn't even with has shaken me so much, and I don't really know what to do to deal with it.

TL;DR: liked a girl who liked me back, she changed her mind and I can't decide if she's messed with me or I'm a shitty person.",01Aug2017,6
119,"I live on the corner of an intersection in a suburban neighborhood. I'm 19 and my room has a big window facing the main Street at the front if my house. I was up pretty late last night and around 3 am I was lying on my bed with my window open watching stuff and i heard a weird noise outside. I opened up my blinds a crack and looked out and there was this red car at the opposite end of the intersection just parked there with their lights flashing. It's not a parking spot and there was obviously somebody inside. I didn't think too much of it but I kept hearing noises and I kept looking out and there it was. Eventually it drove off. I continued with my business and I started hearing noises again. The car was back. I checked a few times and it was there still. Before I went to bed i checked one last time and it was gone. I went to sleep and here I am its 3:28 am the next morning and it just drove off about 10 minutes ago or so. I heard another noise at about 3 or so and I looked out. Sure enough the same red car. This time as I watched it I saw somebody open the door then shut it again. Then somebody opened up the door a second time a few minutes later, got out and walked to the front of the car. I couldn't see very well without being too obvious but it looked like they did something at the front of the car for a few seconds. I didn't see the hood open but I'm not sure. They got back in after a little bit but didn't shut the door. They drove forward a little bit with the door open then stopped. They shut the door and sat there for a little bit before driving off. The incident is just so weird and random
 I don't understand it at all and I don't know if I should be concerned. I don't even know if this is a new thing. They could've been doing this for years and I just didn't notice.

I really want to take my parents out for a picnic, I live in Switzerland and there are some extremely nice places with waterfalls and rivers nearby. 
Though everytime I try to invite my mom and stepfather, if my mom refuses, then so does my stepfather.. She has narcissistic traits, but I love her overall, she's just so dominant and if she says something then everyone should follow her opinion or she will be pissed off for days even if the answers she gives aren't really adequate. I had deep depressions in my teenage, I'm hitting 20's soon. It's a little mountain village here and I don't have bike or car, no guitar or any freetime activity... I just want some company to join me for a picnic dinner near a fireplace. How should I come up to my mom to ask her? 
I usually come and sit right by her bed where she watches TV, and gently ask what she's up to and if she would like to go for a hike or just a chill'n'grill near the lakes. But she refuses everytime no matter what idea I would come up with. It's either ''I had some wine already'', ''I need to take care of the garden&flowers'', ''my TV show starts soon''.

123,"Hello. I will be putting in my two weeks notice this week, and I am extremely nervous. I've been at this company for a year, and I recently received a job offer from a very respectable company that is a great next step. However, I am extremely nervous about putting in my notice for a number of reasons. First, the last guy who quit said it was ""ugly"" and that the boss was angry when it happened. Second, I was told about a month ago that leaving would be selfish and that in doing so, I would give myself a bad ""reputation"" in this ""small"" industry. Third, I'm critical to our team. We are a small team, and I handle a lot of tasks that make us *go*, and so I'm afraid it will be hard to replace me for a little while. Without going into specifics about the other reasons why I'm leaving, I will just say I often times come home depressed and frustrated.

So my questions are as follows. Am I really selfish for leaving? We aren't in the midst of anything important right now, and I've been here a year. A good opportunity has come to me and I can't turn it down. Also, I'm going to have to give my two (and a half) weeks notice tomorrow. Is it best to give this notice in the morning or before I leave in the afternoon?

128,"Context: I started uni about a year ago, and out of all the people I've met, the ones who seem most interested in me/flirt with me are gay. I find it somewhat flattering, but I am straight. Of course, this evolved into most of the members of my college circle of friends presuming that I am gay. What gets worse is that it's become hard to convince people otherwise. But ya know, it's fine, that part doesn't really matter, at least my parents think I'm straight and it's sorta become an inside joke with my close friends. The worse part? This theme of mistaking and presuming my sexual preferences/behavior has also been prevalent amongst my close friends and family. My dad thinks I am a boob-obsessed, masturbation addict, pervert. My older sister thinks I am bisexual and/or a pedophile. And my closest friend (also I'm interested in her/like her) thinks that I am masochist. I've been able to shoulder this labeling up until now, when it's actually started to become damaging. My aforementioned closest friend (that I like) is turned off by submissive/masochist men, and being presumed as gay has very likely prevented few girls from asking me out. How the hell do I clear up all this misunderstanding when despite all I say, no one believes me?

Tl;dr: Sister thinks I am bisexual and/or a pedophile, friends think I'm gay, girl I like who hates sub men thinks I'm masochist, father thinks I'm a pervert.

I have been constantly applying to do anything else and trying to get qualified for anything else, but it's a very competitive job market and I haven't had any luck transitioning out. I don't know how to get out of it and it's terrifying to picture myself stuck there forever.

This is compounded by the fact that I'm now two weeks into going through a breakup after a relationship of about a year (not very long, but long enough for this to hurt like a motherfucker). I know it will stop hurting eventually, but, right now I feel very isolated. I moved cities about a year ago, and have made some progress making friends, but no one close enough that I feel I can really talk to. Before, I felt if I really couldn't take it anymore and had a mental breakdown, I could go stay with my bf for a month to get back on my feet, and having that safety net taken away is really scary.

I was reassured that we were fine, not closing, so I stuck around and it's still here (she yelled at me once about it too). They told me repeatedly they were ""paying me more than they wanted to"", which feels terrible.
My main problem is slowly becoming my manager. She gets insanely intense about really small things. She rolls into the office around 11 usually, and then leaves by about 2-3PM. She also usually takes one to two days off a week. I'm here 9-5 every day. One day she literately screamed at me for a half hour when I punched in ten minutes early to go see a client first thing that morning. She was fully aware of the appt. Another day she screamed at me for emailing a client that I had actually emailed six months ago, thinking I was making a new appt with said client when the interaction was way past. She would not listen to me when I tried to calmly explain her mistake. I could hear her screaming at me from her car in the parking lot before she even ripped open the door to rip into me. It was actually terrifying. When she finally calmed down enough for me to explain it to her, she said ""I'm sorry, I'm going on vacation tomorrow so I have to be like this right now"". Yesterday she texted me a joke at 11, and by 12:30 I asked if she was coming in (she had a sick child on Friday and didn't come in, and also told me that she wasn't feeling well either), because she wanted me to make some deliveries, but I could not do them without her being there (I would be screamed at if I did). When she came in she said ""are you okay? Is something wrong?"" Like I was a child. I replied ""no, nothing's wrong, I just wasn't sure if you wanted me to make those deliveries today or tomorrow, you said Friday you weren't feeling well,"" Manager huffed off and then came back with a vengeance. She said ""Do I need to babysit you? Are you a child? You have to understand that the reason I love this job and work here is because of the freedom it allows me. I've been working here for fifteen years and I don't have to tell you or anyone where I'm going or when I'm coming in. I know it isn't easy to work with but you have to deal with it."" She didn't scream this time (bonus points!) but she was very rude and abrupt. I said back ""I'm not trying to keep tabs on you, but you asked me to do these tasks and I didn't want to be in trouble for doing or not doing them. I just appreciate being kept in the loop, you said you weren't feeling well Friday so I just wanted to check in."" I never text and ask her when she's coming in normally, but she made it sound like I was a clingy ex bf.
She once ignored a customer complaint for eight months. He returned some merchandise and wanted his $200 back, but she just wouldn't do it. This guy was a real loose cannon and would call our office/email is every day and ream us apart. Manager never dealt with any of it, I always had to take his thrashing and try to calm him down to work things out. Honestly I didn't blame the guy for being so pissed off, but he was threatening to come to our office and that scared me. When I told her she said ""dude, I don't care, he can come here and scream at us if he wants to"". There have been other instances similar to this, but not as extreme. 
Additionally, I'm now in charge of our other part time employees and have to make decisions/ask questions for them. I do about 3/4 of my mangers job on top of my own every day, due to her just not being here. I feel like I'm always tip toeing around the office and trying to do the best I can. When she comes in I give her a full run down of everything I've done that morning, every person I've talked to and every appointment I've made. I don't email any clients without her being here, and run every email I shoot off by her first. Boss and Manager took off for two weeks and left me 100% in charge of the company by myself, which was a nightmare for me. Manager said ""if you need anything don't hesitate to text me!"" but then got annoyed after the second or third text, so I stopped and tried to handle everything by myself. 
Manager also yells at Boss all the time, they get into screaming matches every now and then, but usually its Manager calling Boss nasty names (dickhead, cunt face, stupid fucker, to name a few) and Boss just laughing it off. Boss loves to get Manager riled up and then leave. They're good friends, but I certainly can't go to Boss to talk about Managers behavior. 

I feel just insanely overwhelmed and burnt out. I never know if I'm doing the right thing or not, if I should make a decision or wait. Honestly I kind of think that I'd like to quit, but it's a nice office job 9-5 M-F that pays okay, $15/hr. I'm also close to my year, which means I'll finally get paid sick days and vacation next year. But I'm constantly stressed out and depressed, and this is just a job, not my career. Should I start job hunting or stick it out a little while longer? Am I a sensitive little flower or is this actually the way most work places are? Since I have a whole new set of tasks thatve been assigned to me that were not in the initial position, do you think it's fair I ask for a raise, even though they tell me they're already paying me more than they want to? 

TL:DR; my manager isn't around that often but always screams at me, regardless of the situation. I'm 22 basically trying to run a company, am I in over my head or just a sensitive person who needs a thicker skin? ",01Aug2017,2
155,"I (25M) never knew the exact reason as to why he (27M) decided to stop talking to me, he just stopped calling me and texting me altogether, and when I called him this past Christmas to wish him Merry Christmas, he dismissed both of my calls. 

There were some events that may have led to him getting mad at me, but it's not relevant anymore since it's all said and done and as months go by, I don't see any way to fix it, as he refuses to have *any* communication with me at all. At first, I had to text him to let him know that his bank was looking for him (he didn't have a phone when he opened his account and therefore noted my phone as a contact number), and he would read my messages and not reply to them. Now, I had to text him again a  few weeks ago, since a mutual friend had died and I had to let him know about the burial service. The messages reached him, but now he didn't even open them to read them, which in my opinion gives me a clear picture of where I'm standing.

However, while he was my friend, he was the best friend I could ever hope and pray for. I still miss him, I still cannot get over the loss, and I'm still willing to talk and sort things out, even if my family didn't like him from the beginning (the typical ""bad influence"" thing) and probably like him even less because of this. So I still want to wish him happy birthday, because I truly hold no ill will towards him. The question is, given how he responded to my previous attempts at contact, should I?",01Aug2017,1
158,"So just to draw a picture, I'm 21 and spent Saturday and Sunday drinking the entire day. As soon as I woke up I just started drinking. I'm not sure why I was so adamant about wanting to be drunk, I guess I've been stressed out and wanted my mind off reality for a bit.

After my period of being drunk, come Monday and I have a pretty bad hangover and I have this extreme feeling of sadness, no motivation and just total hopelessness. I left work early because of how bad it was. I've had hangovers before and was sure it was just part of it but those feelings haven't left me. 

Now here I am today laying in bed - I left work early again because this sense of hopelessness and sadness has been persistent. On top of that, I only got about an hour of sleep last night and felt like my mind has been racing and I've never had problems with anxiety. I've only ate a meal once in the past couple days, I have a total loss of appetite.

I might go see my mom (she lives about 5 hours away from me) for a couple days since we're really close. I don't feel like telling anyone else because I don't want to burden them with my feelings, plus I don't even feel I'm close enough with my friends to talk about how I feel.

I messaged this one girl the other day that asked me to text her so I did. We were just talking about things we are into. She told me she was turning 17 next month and asked me to send her a nude picture. She sent me 2 nude photos and I said she looked great. I was being very stupid. Im in a depression right now and i get excited when girls are interested in me so I wasnt thinking logically. I then thought about that and I realized that she was underage and that this isnt right. I told her not to do anything else ad then I deleted the messages and pictures and stopped texting her.

We are reimbursed for mileage when we drive to a job site, and the company decided to pull driving records of anyone getting reimbursed (10 months after DUI). It is optional, but it could add up to thousands of dollars per year.
I know that the DUI will be expunged within 7 months from my criminal record, but not my driving record.
I work/live in MD and the DUI occurred in PA. Is there a way to pull my PA driving record? It asks for my PA drivers license, which I don't have.
I'm leaning towards just not agreeing and eating the costs, but that has to seem suspicious. Has this happened to anyone? Is there a good way to find out what my company's response would be to finding out about my DUI? There are over 1500 employees so I'd bet there's more than just me, but they might be avoiding the MVR as well.

Also, is there any way to see what databases have a record of the DUI? My lawyer said that sometimes the state where it happened will expunge it or the record will expire over time, but that it can be recorded in random databases.

173,"I was supposed to move in with friends in May but that fell through. I've been back at home with my mom and sister since I graduated over a year ago and as much as I love them I gotta get out of there!

So now I have the opportunity to move into a one bedroom apartment attached to a family home for $500 a month. The place has a living room, full kitchen, bathroom, bedroom w/huge closet, and washer/dryer. It also has a private entry. I've known the family since I was 15, dad coached me in softball and I've babysat their kids as well as gone on trips with them and am SUPER close with the mom. It's also pretty close to my mom's house so I'd never feel alone having her nearby plus the family. I'd be moving into the place in August, and I'm taking two hard online courses in the fall so it'd be really nice to have my own space to study and all that since my current room is a mix of my childhood and my sister's childhood since it's her old room. The price is an absolute steal and it's a pretty sweet set up for moving out for the first time (besides college).

Buuuttt I'm torn because I could also be using that $500 a month to save up for nursing school so I'm not in as much debt. Plus I'll most likely need to travel for school since the one I'd love to go to is 3 hours away, and would need to also save up for the expense of rent during that time.

Upon first inspection we asked the building manager about paying rent, they responded with ""You have up to 7 days to pay rent, after that we have the right to give a notice of eviction.""  Sounds fair right?  I work a 8-6 job, my job is very long and stressful. Some days I work 8 hours some i work 12. 


My issue is, since I was using debit to pay for rent every month, I had to pay in person. This was no problem because I had 7 days to pay rent right? So for convenience sake only, I ended up paying on the 1st some days, and on the 4th others, since the office closes at 5pm.


My issue is that we need to move ASAP. We have a new roommate + a baby that needs a place to stay and we cannot wait any longer. Homestead, the company we are renting from offers the ability to move to another Homestead building within 1 months time, or sooner. 

Luckily we found a town house, owned by Homestead. Great size, not cheap but good for 3 + a baby. This place was available August 4th 2017, perfect for our situation.


However, we got declined. Apparently it is because we pay late almost every month. She said that we are more than welcome to wait 6 months and be re-assessed. But my issue is we need to more ASAP.


We offered to set up pre-authorized payments, as a ""we can afford this no problem"", but she declined us. I told her our circumstance and she said I don't care.


How is this legal? I feel like being declined for this reason should be illegal.


Also, will this hurt my credit rating? If so, I feel like i should fight it.


Like i said, its not that I can't afford the place, just out of convenience, we choose to pay a little later. If one person told us within that 1 year and 8 months living here, that what we were doing was wrong, then this whole thing could have been avoided.

192,"First, some background. I graduated high school about a month and a week ago. Right now since then, I am working part time at a department store, which is nice and all, but nothing that I could live off of. 

For 7 of the 8 semesters there, I was very adamant about the fact that I would not be attending college; that I would start a business or something like that. Therefore, all of the first semester of senior year, I was quite content with what I would be doing, and admitedly got a few giggles from time to time from the surprise people showed when I, a person with very good grades, said I had no college intentions. 

Then, come February, doubt started setting in. Of course, by then, most had already gotten their acceptances, so I couldn't apply anywhere big and quelm that fear. 

See, my endgame goal is to do something in government. Not President by any means (whoever wants that job is nuts), but maybe in a few years be in a state legislature and in my older years be a congressman or something. I am still technically correct in that a degree is not necessarily needed to get that high. Whatever you think of them, Scott Walker and Steve King, for example, never got a college degree. But one in maybe polisci or an MPA for example would still help me gain even more connections in the right places than the ones I have from local leaders who just happen to be family friends, and also allow me to move to a more livable state (the place I live now has an insane cost of living and it's insanely hard to start a business, throwing out that plan) because of a potentially higher income. In other words, it would only help. There's a reason most members of congress are millionaires. In addition, the realization of just WHAT kind of work I would be doing set in. Because of my state's hostile business environment, I would have to resort to grunt work, blue collar stuff with sweaty guys in wife beaters (lol), and I despise manual labor. There are of course other options, but I don't know if I could have the money to live on my own and get a transfer to do my job somewhere else. I could potentially, but haven't particularly looked into it. My friends probably know people in places I am looking at, so that is not an issue, but again, the problem is mobility, or right now, my lack thereof. 

The likely distaste for the work I would be doing and probable lack of mobility is the rock in the rock and a hard place I find myself trapped between. I have an application to my community college all set and ready to mail. After two years there, I would, through the program, be automatically transfered to my state's ""University of"" and be on my way, most likely to the aforementioned MPA. 

But, then the hard place came in. At the community college to get my application to fill it out, my mind had what can best be described as an allergic reaction to the college setting. It was like the college was one positive end of a magnet, and I was another. I just was not liking how the school felt, how soul destroying it all looked, its culture, how things were done there, and just the academic setting in general, still being exhausted of it from HS. I also was not keen on having tens of thousands of dollars in debt as I try to adjust to a life I just went here to secure. 

Filling it out at home, I realized, ""my heart just isn't in this."" I was doing this for all the one reasons. I didn't fall for the downright conditioning that high school counselors put you through to think ""MUST DO COLLEGE, MUST DO COLLEGE,"" and am instead just doing this out of fear of what could possibly happen if I didn't, and the dreams that would be crushed in the mediocrity that could *possibly* ensue, but *probably* not ensue if I did college. It was for all the wrong reasons and because of it, my heart isn't in it. Everyone has told me that if your heart is not in college from day 1, you are doomed to sink. 

So I feel trapped. What should I do? Go to college for 4-5 years and hate every waking moment of it with every fiber of my being, then come out with 5 figures of debt before I even step foot into my new ""good"" job I just destroyed my soul for, or do full time work, hoping to God that I find something I don't hate but potentially never being able to buy a house of my own in a place that's better than where I am now, even if my friends know people there that could jumpstart my career in public service? The application needs to be in within a few days, so any ideas to kick around in my head would be vastly appreciated :)",01Aug2017,1
195,"My true answer is complicated. I am in a 5-year dual degree program (bs/ms). Normally, in such a program, you get the bachelor's degree at the end of year 4 and the master's at the end of year 5. In terms of pure time that has passed, I am entering year 5 and all of my peers just graduated. However, during year 4, i dropped out in the middle of the first quarter and came back to take only one class for the last quarter. So, credit-wise i am still a 4th year student. I expect to get my bachelor's degree at the end of this year, and then have one more quarter of graduate level classes to do. So do I say I'm a senior? 5th year student? Grad student? None of those are either entirely true or false but I'll have to answer this question a bunch over the next year.",01Aug2017,1
196,"Hey guys.  I'm a 26-year-old male living in a rural area.  I graduated from college a couple years ago with a degree in Computer Science.  I promptly got a decent job in my field nearby and rented a townhouse for myself.  Right at the end of college I met a girl who I then began to date for the next couple years.  We just recently broke up, and I'm at a loss of how I get my social life back on track.

All of my friends have either moved away, gotten married, or have grown apart for good reasons.  None of this really bothered me when I was with my girlfriend because I always had her to hang out with.  My town doesn't really have much of a bar scene, just mostly little dinky country dive bars.  Not that I really have many friends that would go to the bars with me anyway.  I've tried MeetUp and Living Social, but there aren't any groups in my area.  

Moving to a more populated area sounded appealing, but I just signed a contract with my work that I would stay on for another year (they paid to send me to some $5,000 training).  I just don't want to feel lonely anymore.  I miss doing stuff with people.",01Aug2017,1
197,"There are guests who are staying at my house for 3 weeks. Everything was going okay, until we went to Washington with the guests and another family. We went on a trip with a tourbus and they would tell us where to meet up etc. Anyways, wherever I wanted to go, the other family would say, we're wasting time, get out of here,hurry up etc etc. Wherever my dad and I want to go the other family would always say hurry up, don't waste time etc, even while taking photos. They didnt ever talk to me once, they only talked with the guests and the only time they would talk to me is when they wanted to say no to something.


 My dad bought chips and snacks( similar to what the other family got) Whenever my dad offered snacks to everyone else, they would always say no, and when the other family offered snacks the guests would eat everything right away (even though it was the same snacks....) 


Also we went to an outlet store in our last day in Washington, and the other family wanted to go to the washroom, and we went to a store that was nearby(right in front of the washroom), the guests said they will wait for us. But 7 minutes later they left and we didnt find them for 2 hours until our bus was going to leave, when we found them they were having lunch with the other family. I think they wanted to wait for the other family to come back to the washroom and go to the outlet stores with them. Before going we told them we wanted to go to addidas with them, and they went and got something from there w/o us and we couldnt even find the store bc we were to busy looking for them


Then my dad got pissed and had a fight with the other family, he told them they wouldnt eat the food he offered and wherever we wanted to go they would say we were wasting time etc etc, then the other family started screaming and shouting in the hotel, theyre like we do everything for you (which they don't), we give our lives for you etc etc, and they said my dad has a dirty heart for saying things like. Even the guests who are living with us are on their side, they keep telling my dad to shut up but they didnt tell them to shut up whenever they said no to me for going somewhere. BUT the way my dad talks he makes everyone scared and panicked, he did say a few rude things but then he shut up and was trying to act nice with the other family again. But now they won't talk to us or call us. While we were coming home they said they wanted to call someone so i tried giving them my phone but they didnt take it and didnt even look me in the eyes when they said no. Then they asked someone else to call someone.

198,"I'm a teacher. During the summer, I work odd jobs, or sometimes get a part time job to help cover the two month gap. I also work side jobs during the school year, because, let's face it, teacher pay really isn't that great.

I picked up a job a few weeks ago that I thought would be up my alley and flexible enough that I could still do it during the school year. I got the job because I am close friends with the CEO, and she thought I'd be perfect for the job, so there was no interview or application process. Easiest job grab ever. 

However, I'm already regretting the decision to take this job. While I knew the pay wasn't fantastic (it's only about 10 hours a week), it's proving to be way more stress than it's worth, and it's distracting me from what I really need to be focusing on. I love the idea of helping my friends by taking the job, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with them, but I absolutely am going to have to quit, especially once the school year gets going. 

I'm in the middle of a project right now that is due to end in two weeks. In that time, I have another event I have to help out with, and then a company meeting after the project and event are said and done. The school year starts right after this event. Obviously I shouldn't leave the company hanging in the middle of a project. When should I quit, and how - *oh how* - do I quit without looking like a total schmuck? I know that the CEO and office manager will both be really disappointed. :/

Thanks in advance.

I have so little in common with my old friends, they just quote the same shit jokes over and over, they are too old to go to festivals and concerts but not too old to go to shitty nightclubs packed with underage people, which they than give out about but god forbid the college students go out where college students do, or that they actually spend money on anything other than alcohol, even the ticket to get into somewhere that serves alcohol.

I have not seen any of my college friends since college, (Irelands not that big of a place) they have met up but I wasn't invited, and any time everyone was going I couldn't go. They were going to festivals with friends from back home and college friends but I was just at home.

Now I am studying for exams I don't want to pass to get into a degree I have no interest being in, all the while being told anything other than college is a waste of my potential.

I spend my days looking for alternatives, some way that I can turn my life around, look back and think 'yeah that was the worst I've ever felt' as opposed to the feeling that I am sinking further and further and the worst part is I can already see the end of the tunnel where it's not worth turning back.

Recently, his job has made him move out of state so when we do get to see watch other, things are much more physically intensive than before. I'm currently visiting him for two weeks. The first day we had sex and I woke up with a uti. Once I got on antibiotics we started having sex again and this time I found myself extremely itchy in the morning. Ive had a yeast infection once before so I went to the store and got the monistat one day insert. I inserted it on Friday night and felt better the next day.

214,"I [16F] will try to keep this as short as possible. I live with my step-dad, step-brother [24M] and my mom. We'll call my step-brother Marty.

So recently I have been waking up very wet in my panties. This is unusual for me. It also sometimes seems to be on my inner legs as far down as my knees. On its own I would chalk it up to weird biology but.. 

So Marty has always been weird guy. Our parents have been married for about 10 years now, so we sorta grew up together. When we were younger I remember him getting in trouble for chasing girls down and licking them everywhere he could. When he was around 15, I remember him trying to introduce me to his porn collection, which consisted mostly of BDSM type stuff (girls bound in ropes, gags, tied to strange contraptions) I didn't want to watch and he hasn't really pushed it since then. Once, about a year ago, when I was being nosy I opened a minimized tab on his computer while he was helping his dad with something. Holy shit. It was a picture of a naked girl with a garden hoe shoved so far up her vagina only the metal end was sticking out. She was obviously dead. The website was called ""Best Gore."" I've looked into it a bit but it's really bad. 

Marty is prescribed several medications, at least 3 different ones. The only one I know of for sure is Xanax, because he talks about selling it to the local highschool kids. Also, even though he is 24, his dad keeps hold of them. He keeps them in his room and gives Marty one a day (amoungst the other pills) but he doesn't watch him take it, he just gives it to him. So Marty says he took it and goes and sells it. 

The final piece of the situation that really has made me start putting the puzzle together is the comments he has been making to me. I am a virgin except for messing around a bit (not sex) with a boyfriend once. I have never spoken at all to Marty about my sexual life so there's no way he even knows about that. 
We were standing outside with my cousins and they were talking about Bikinis and I said something about wanting a new string bikini. He retorts ""you'll definitely have to shave to get away with that."" For some reason it just hit me across the face to hear him speak about my netherregions. 
And then last week I had bought pineapple slice fruit cups, and as im watching tv eating it, he comes by and says ""you know what you're doing, don't you?"" Winks, and leaves. 

Anyway, this is getting long, and I don't even know what I'm asking. I just don't know what to do and I'm terrified that I'm right. But I could be so terribly wrong, and I would feel awful if I was. How do I confirm one way or the other? 

I tried setting up a hidden camera, but the whole video just came out dark and I didn't hear anything specifically. I could try again with some sort of lights, but I feel that could be suspicious. ",01Aug2017,3

222,"I recently started my first job out of college a month ago and so far I'm enjoying it. However after reading the employee handbook I noticed some things that were misleading about the job offer. 

They tout their excellent retirement benefits and on the offer letter it shows in bold what my total compensation would be if i worked the entire year. It doesn't mention that you must be employed for the entire year to receive any retirement, half of which is $6500 (which is what I was expecting since I'd work for 6 months this year). 

In the vacation policy it states that employees who have worked for less than 6 months receive 5 paid vacation days and there's a list of special rules, one that states if you get less than ten days you can take up to 5 unpaid days. This lead me to believe that this year I'd get 5 paid and 5 unpaid vacation days. In the handbook however, there's a slightly modified set of special rules, the second of which explicitly states that new employees are not entitled to paid vacation until the following year. 

I asked for specific dates off before I accepted the offer and they came back and gave me 5 paid days once I started, however at the time I didn't realize this probably meant that's all I would get (I thought the policy was saying no time off regardless when I first read 

I honestly care more about the vacation days because I need two more days to be able to take a week off in the fall, but I'm afraid to push my luck since I somewhat brought it up already. I also know that as a new employee I probably don't have a lot of leverage. 

I'm pretty bummed because the vacation policy is already pretty shitty and I didn't have a lot of options when I accepted the offer, although the pay and the work itself are both pretty good.

230,"Hello.. I'm an 17 year old 3rd year high school student from Serbia.. I'm having some real issues that are affecting me mentally and physically.. The issue are my parents unfortunately..
They started their divorce in 2012, they were married for 20 years and have made 3 children.. My elder brother who has now 21 years, myself 17 and my younger sister which is 12... They made a lot mistakes, some that are financially killing us all, the thing is they did that to themselves... The main source of that was my ambitious father who saw everything perfectly in his head but failed in practicing.. He got into business with mobsters, he was in jail and so on while my mother was unfaithful towards him, aka. she had affairs.. Now they hate each other and are using me and my sister(mostly me) to indirectly wage wars with each other... Which hurts... My father has left my mother's bank account in a huge debt like 300k euros while her monthly pay is a meek 370 euros, while he has no job whatsoever and is probably going to end up jail for a long long time because he is in his 7th 
 year of court against a mobster who has what he doesn't, money... I'm trying my best to ignore it, but it has the greatest impact on me ether way.. I cannot communicate with both of them because as soon as I do, they get angry at me for doing so.. I love my parents no matter how much **** they did to me and to my siblings, it's just the way I work.. It's summer holiday which means I don't go to school until the 1st of September.. I got a girlfriend which I love and who loves me back, but because of my parents' mentality, mostly my mother's I get to see her rarely even tho she lives 45 mins away from me w/a bus.. I've never done bad things to get into trouble, I'm always honest no matter what and I've always been a great student(still am).. But even all that doesn't matter, no matter what I do or how hard I try, they're never pleased... I live with my mother who is very strict and unfair towards me, she let's me go out here in my town which is very small until like 11PM, literally never let's me visit my girlfriend because her excuse is that she has no money to give me for the date even tho I never asked for it because I know in what financial state she is.. She is never pleased when I go out and it irritates her, yet she always gets angry at when I'm sitting home at my computer doing nothing else, and every time I tell her why I do it she gets even more pissed and grounds me, I've spent nearly the entire holiday at home because of her and I know when the school starts I'll be too busy to have lot's of free time like now, I basically live in a home prison.. While my father beat me as a child very much but on the other hand understands me(to some point), let's me go out for as long as I keep my end of our deal, he let's me to see my girlfriend and to invite her to his place but he is demanding stuff from me for an example to make my mother speak to him or to bribe her and what not...

I just really don't know If i can keep up with this and stay mentally healthy.. As much as I try, I just cannot keep my mind off of it, they don't let me to... I've tried the Social Workers but they made the conclusion that I'm using my parents' relation for my plans and that I'm an unreasonable child who doesn't understand anything...
My parent's say that they do everything for me and my sister, but they are the ones who hurt me the most... I don't know what to do anymore..

231,"Like the title said, I didn't realize I had summer assignments for school until now. I can finish most of them, but one of them had 11 things you had to do for each week and they needed to be turned in by email each week of the summer, otherwise they would be counted as 0's. There're only 3 things left in that assignment, but is there anything I can do about the other ones that I missed, or will I have to take the 0's? This is my first year of high school and I don't exactly want that happening on the first week",01Aug2017,1
234,So to begin with when I was filling out my medical forms with my recruiter and I mentioned I might have OCD as when I was little my doctor thought I might have had it so he gave me the medication Prozac to try out. I took that medication twice once when I was little and for a 2-3 month stint in high school. In the end he told me just not to list it essentially so I didn't. Fast forward a couple days and I go to meps and everything's going great I got a 97 on the asvab and then I go to medical and hear that there could be punishments for lying so I decide to tell them and as you can guessed they disqualified me. And now I am home and I have learned that I was probably never properly diagnosed. I should also mention that I don't have any of the symptoms of OCD now and I haven't taken the meds in over a year. I just don't know what to do because my family can't afford college so this was my only shot of having a good career. What if anything can I do to rectify this situation.,01Aug2017,7

239,"My title is a horrible way to put my situation, but I have no clue how to make it short.

Ok so, a few years ago, a friend asked for critique on her art. The way it was phrased, I thought it meant that she would want critique on all her future pieces, not just that one. So whenever she would show me something and ask what I thought, I would give critique. As it turned out, that was not what she wanted me to do. One day, when she asked me what I thought of something she made, she started to cry when she heard my response. I apologized a million times, but still feel so bad about what I did. The year was very rocky for us anyway, for a lot of reasons. (I'd rather not revisit some of the details there, some of it still stings a lot). Anyway, we eventually moved on from this and we are friends today. 

On that day, I completely changed. Before then, I was always an advocate of giving people the truth when they asked for help, no matter how harsh. After then, I try to avoid being in situations where people ask my advice at all. I can't bring myself to critique anything that someone creates. If I have to (which has happened in art classes before), I would give a handful of compliments before giving the critique, and I would try as hard as I could to soften the blow. 

So, last year, another friend would always ask for critique in her art. I was really garbage at giving it to her. She was annoyed at how bad I was, and would always tease me for it. She was very inquisative about it, asking me if there was a reason I was so bad at it. Honestly, I kind of wanted her to lay off. So, at some point, I told her why. I did not reveal the identity of the girl, because our school is very small and everyone knows everyone. I really, really wish I didn't do this, it was such an invasion of privacy, and just downright embarassing. Anyway, it was in the nature of our relationship to joke around and tease each other, so she would tease me about how I made someone cry a lot. I felt bad every time, but eventually it eased off and she mostly stopped. Towards the end of the year, she rarely brought it up. 

Next year, though, all of us will be in the same art class. I am so terrified that the girl is going to bring up the time I made someone cry, and that someone will be there to hear it. I really don't know what to do. I only told the other girl the story so she would lay off of me (a mistake), but the story was so embarassing and specific that the other girl would know instantly that it was about her. And she is not a forgiving person, the reason she isn't still angry at me from a few years ago was because (I think) she did some mean stuff too. That entire year was a mess for us. 

I realize I was being an asshole in this entire story, and I feel awful, but I really want to know how to rectify it and stop myself from being an even bigger asshole. I'm such a shitbag in this whole situation, and I am sorry. 

Thank you everyone.",01Aug2017,3

241,"So I'm 19, live in Melbourne with my parents and up until recently was studying at uni until I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I was pushed into the course by them even after telling them that I want to take a little time off to work and travel and figure things out. They told me to go into it anyway as it's a good course and if I finished it and still didn't know what to do with my life at least I'd be able to get a good job.
 I recently stopped studying and told them that I want to defer and work instead. They were very angry about this and we got into quite a heated argument where they told me if I didn't study that I'd be moving out within a couple of months and told me that I wouldn't ever be getting any help from them or seeing the family again. I didn't respond to this because I was shocked and lost for words. Dad then kicked me out of the house and told me not to come back during the day, basically saying that if im not going to study I was going to be treated like a working member of society and not given access to the house during the day. Ive asked work to up my shifts and they've given me a couple more for the time being before they give me more contracted shifts. I'm trying to save money and have been looking for a room to rent. Unfortunately I'm not too sure what to do, or where to go from here. I can see a point to the way they're acting but it seems like it's more pettynes that anything. Anyway I don't have a car, have a couple hundred in savings, but have a part time job I've had since I was 16, at the moment I'm just trying to save as much money as I can so I can move out as soon as possible, but I'm also unsure how to deal with the situation or them. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks. ",01Aug2017,5
243,"Earlier today my car window was broken, I live in a not terrible, but not great part of my city so this stuff happens sometimes. Problem is, I can't get my window fixed for two days, so I have to park my car in the city for two nights with plastic covering my passenger side window.

I was thinking about just leaving my doors unlocked and taking everything of value out (though there's still a board game, some really old golf clubs, and a sleeping bag in the trunk). Or should I lock my car, even though it doesn't have a window? I'm afraid this will further entice onlookers to rifle through everything. Not sure how to handle this...

Side-note: I did notice that someone had rifled through my car the other day but didn't take anything (after accidentally leaving it unlocked)",01Aug2017,5
245,"Hey, I just want to give you all a brief reason why I'm stressed out. Firstly, I live all by myself far away from family in a area that I'm not that familiar with and I'm on a year lease that I signed myself into and I kind of live in the hood. Secondly, I work and have to see all my money go towards rent, bills, food etc and have not done anything fun. Third, I am on probation and I'm sober so it's really hard not to mess up but I always tell myself when I have a thought is it really worth it to use drugs again (the answer is no). Next, I am starting school in about two weeks which is very stressful just thinking about it because my hours are going to get cut down at work which means less money.

I've recently been having these thoughts coming to my head, that usually don't cross my mind. Some are like is it really worth trying this hard, would it be easier if I was just gone? Self pity about why is it always me who has to do the hard work get in trouble, etc.. I'm super stressed out I don't feel like myself anymore I hate this feeling... just looking for advice thanks...",01Aug2017,9

247,"To start, I don't have the power to kick him out of the program. And im gonna call this guy ""jake""

Setting: week long program at a very professional organization. The program is a training program that all new employees get but this week it's for people who might be interested in a future (not anytime soon) job there. Today was day 2/4

Over 250 people applied and 50 got in. I was one of those 50, in fact, the organization asked me to be a squad leader. I am mainly there for chain of command reasons but I am still my squad's leader. 

I am a squad leader of 9 other people. I learned today that only 2/10 (that's including myself) people in the squad are interested in a job at this organization. 

On day one I was trying to get to know my squad and learned very quickly who the social people were, who the quiet people were, and a little bit about each person. All of the people were great. Except for jake, when jake first spoke, I was really impressed with how social he was. I was happy because I thought I have some one to help me break the ice with these other people. But by the 3rd sentence that came out of his mouth, I knew exactly who he was. He was one of those fake guys.

Jake is the type of guy that is all talk and no walk 

EX: ""yeah I was thinking about charging people to take their online tests in high school because they're so easy but it never panned out""

Jake always one ups everybody 

ex: I was thinking of becoming a fighter pilot, but I just didn't like flying that much when I flew this plane this one time. And I would never be a cargo pilot, like that's just not cool enough for me.

Jake is in EVERY conversation. 

Ex: Me and this other guy were talking about our favorite movies and technology products and he decides that he will interrupt me and give his input of, 
""Some animated movies are better than live action films (this has nothing to do with the movies that me and the other guy were talking about) and i know Steve jobs was really smart, but I don't know, I think I'm more of a wasniack kind of guy.""  

He doesn't have any original ideas 

Ex: he tried to argue that the public schools in our area focus too much on grades and not learning. And I explained to him why this thinking was wrong and he couldn't come up with any response other than ""I don't know that just my opinion."" It all came off as very fake to me.

He brags about not working hard and getting really good rewards.

Some examples: he says that he didn't prep for his standardized test and says that he got a 1450. He says that he never completes work before it is due. He says that he used the same essay at every college he applied to. He says that colleges don't really care about GPA, but he also claims that colleges don't really care about test scores either (wtf?). 

He is extremely immature. (He is also the oldest out of the 10 of us) 

Ex: he makes fun of people for the way they talk, look, and for asking dumb questions. The way the training room is set  up, the people in the back don't always hear the main speaker and the people in the front, this leads to repeated questions. Jake makes fun of these people for asking stupid questions. I tried expanding that they can't here but he still makes fun of them. 

How do I deal with this type of person as a leader? 

TL;DR: Jake is too cool for school",01Aug2017,10
248,"Hello everyone.

I have my good days, much more than my bad but when the bad days hit I feel really crappy.

The storie is this. I met a friend through Facebook a couple of years back. She is visually impaired and I am blind.

We started talking and for the month I new her I was quite pushy. I wanted to know secrets that I probably had no right knowing. I found out a couple things that I was happy to have found out because it brought me closer to this friend.

I will not say what these things are for privacy reasons, let's just say they're not good things.

She called me her little Brother and that meant so much to me.

I told her one day that I liked her and she said she was sorry but I  was too young for her.

She was so kind about it, not mean at all. We even went out to a Chinese festival together.

I then made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I wrote to her on facebook explaining that I think it is best if we delete one another as I liked her and felt that because she didn't return my feelings that it would hurt every time we spoke as I would not get what I wanted.

Stupid I know, as I could have kept her as a friend but back then I was not sure how to control my imotions. My grandparents never sat me down and spoke to me about these kind of things.

I said that I would give her two days to respond, another stupid idea as she was and probably still is a very very busy woman.

I deleted her a day later I think. I know I said two days but I couldn't control my feelings at the time and felt it was best for me to let her go.

Now? Now i regret it...

I messaged her a year later then emailed her within that year, I even used an app for the blind called vorail to send her a message, but in the second vorail message I said it was probably best we didn't speek anyway. (I got no replies to any of these messages.)

I miss her so much. OH I'm not suicidal but if my sis would only write to me saying that we cannot be friends but I forgive you that would mean so much to me.",01Aug2017,8
249,"I have this friend by the name of T. Her and I met through unusual circumstances. This is not the first time I have stopped talking to her. The first time was because she would be jealous of me (loving family, financial stability, boyfriend she wanted) but these are things I cannot control, I tried being there for her but all she did was talk down on me. She apologized and we tried being friends again. 






The second time was because she would constantly talk about my boyfriend to the point where it made me uncomfortable, when I addressed the issue she said I didn't deserve him because I am, according to her, ""a girl whose nose is always in a book and a sex life dryer than the Sahara desert"". Which of course infuriated me and we stopped talking. She doesn't have any friends and I felt I could be her friend despite her issues and she also apologized. This time every time I try to talk to her about issues I am having she tells me they are hardly issues and how she wishes she had my issues because they are, ""first worl problems"". When she has issues I listen to her and let her know that her emotions are valid and that I am here for her, but she cannot do the same for me? Part of me wants to be her friend because she always says her mental issues (Boderline Personality Disorder) is the reason why she always snaps at me. 






The most recent snap at me was because she chooses not to work and just gets government help but she wants money, I am the opposite and countless times I have told her to go to school and apply for a job but she says her mental issues prevent her from working. So I told her about ""sugar daddys"", she tried it but was always encountering scammers, and she blamed me for her not being successful for having a sugar daddy. This happened to me while I was at work, my job can be very frustrating and this day was extremely frustrating, I told her off. I said that instead of marrying into money she should go to school and get a job like the rest of us, that I saw a man with no legs working as a cross guard and how she is able bodied and is too lazy to work. I felt bad but my boyfriend said I was just telling her the truth. 





My counselor gave me some advice and said, ""there is a reason why you have maintained friendships for so long and a successful relationship, because you are a caring person who places other's feelings ahead of your own. She does not have friends or a successful relationship for a reason, maybe you should really evaluate if she reciprocates what you put out in the friendship."" Part of me feels bad if I do not continue being friends with her, because I feel everyone should have a friend to talk to. However, the other part of me says enough is enough and friends should be supportive, trustworthy, and listen to your issues. 

Sorry for the long story but if you can help me and give me advice I will be very grateful. Have a great day! ",01Aug2017,1

252,"TLDR: Lived in house for 2 years, new roommate comes in with hippies and boyfriend, roommate leaves island for a month, I kick hippies out, roommate returns today.

I've lived in the same 2 bedroom place for at least 2 years now. 2 months ago I had a new roommate move in. The girl is young and cute and seemed nice enough. My ex-roommate told me she does cam work for money. Unfortunately this was a couple of days before I had a planned trip away for a month, meaning she had the whole place for herself. I wanted to be a good roommate so I stocked the place up with essential supplies which I told her she could use as long as she replaced it.

Fast forward a month and I come back and my place is pretty dirty. She threw a party a couple days before and it was barely cleaned up. The place was cleaned out of essential supplies as well; spices, oil, shampoo, soap, condiments, food, toilet paper, etc... I had to spend $50-100 to replenish these things. However there was a couple of couches in front and a washing machine to replace the one that was broken at the house. Some weeds were also cut in the yard. The next morning I was greeted with two hippy guys crashed out on the couches in the front. They had been the ones responsible for the couches, work, and washing machine--all free craigslist stuff. My roommate then told me she was leaving for the mainland for a couples of weeks and that I'll get along with the hippies who were going to be staying in her room while she was gone. Being blindsided by this I didn't argue to much because I was just dropped into this situation. I figured fuck it why not. 

That first night there with them there was five hippies at my house. Still I held my laissez-faire attitude. After a week of random friends I had had enough. I spoke to them and I told them I didn't want other people around. Still they brought other people around. I then went to speak with the landlord and he was absolutely not okay with them staying there. According to him the hippies and possibly the roommates boyfriend had been there for over a month. I told them and my roommate that they couldn't stay there and that they had to go. They still hung out there a couple more days until I told them I really wasn't comfortable with them being there And they finally left after ten days of me coming back. They still contact me saying they want to come by and shower which I have begrudgingly accepted because they give me a decent deal on pot. 

I wanted to have a plan for when my roommate came back and I spoke to my landlord once again. Although there is no lease He said I'm the established tenant and that if I'm uncomfortable living with her than she has to go. I laid down some potential rules to him and he agreed.

* Your friends and boyfriend can come over twice a week. (He said explicitly that the boyfriend can't sleep over more than twice a week)
* Your hippy friends cannot sleep over.
* Your friends cannot use the shower or stove. I'll allow the boyfriend to.
* If people are over you have to be actively hanging out with them. They can't be in front on couches while your in your room.
* All food that I purchase is mine and should not be touched 
* Any spice, condiment, household utility cost that we both use will be split
* Keep bathroom/kitchen relatively clean 
* Dishes go in the dishwasher and clean dishes come out.

My question is do these rules sound reasonable? I don't wanna be a dick but I also need to be assertive. How should I approach the situation when she comes over?

Thanks!",01Aug2017,50
