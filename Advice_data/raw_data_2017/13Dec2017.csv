0,"Hello all, so on 12/2 I started talking to this guy I met through a mutual friend. We met up on 12/4 and on 12/6 we had sex. We’ve hung out just about everyday for a little while since that Monday we first hung out and I like him, I feel like things are going well. And although he asked me if I thought it was okay if he introduced me as his gf to his brother which he lives with, I didn’t think much of it but now I’m second guessing if that actually means I’m his girlfriend?? Yesterday he told me “I fucking love you” via text and has been saying “love ya”. I didn’t reciprocate it as I’m not in love with him but I don’t know if he actually is in love with me after a week of knowing me ? He’s 23 and I’m 22. I like him but I don’t know if things are moving too fast. Are these red flags, should I be concerned as it’s only been one week? I feel like it’s worth mentioning that he’s never been tested for STDs and and had never had sex with a condom prior to being with me so I was concerned about that, he also started making fun of the cashier we were talking to while I thought he was a really nice man, idk if these are red flags or what actually constitutes as a red flag? Should I proceed with how things are going or have a talk to slow the brakes on us? ",13Dec2017,1

2,"I'm a 13 year old girl in the 8th grade with anxiety. (Sorry if this seems strange to include, I just thought it'd be useful information you might need?) This may seem like a petty middle school problem, but it's actually really bothering me so much I've had panic attacks about it. I've grown up with this guy ever since I started going to kindergarten. In late elementary (5th and 6th grade), we became friends. Not close friends, we just played games together and talked. The thing is, I hate my past self. I was a cringeworthy piece of idiotic trash who  was pushed around and used. I was the stereotypical ""fake gamer girl"". I was so ashamed and embarrassed of what I was like around him, I stopped talking to him for a year. Recently, I've talked to him here and there, online and offline. I even sat with him and his friends at a restaurant while our class was out on a field trip, and invited them to sit at my table at lunch one day. (My lunch table consists of me and my only friend.) They never showed up. I messaged him on Instagram about it, and he sent back a kind of dramatic apology for not siting with us. He said he'd sit with us the next day, and, again, he never showed up. I'm not sure if he just doesn't care or thinks the worst about me. The thing is, I have a crush on him. To make matters worse, I go to a school that is super immature about relationships and even two people of different genders speaking to each other. (Teasing, etc) I have anxiety, so the idea of this happening to me would drive me mad. He also isn't the most ""attractive"" guy, which would make the ridiculing worse. I really want to be friends with him again, (and maybe be in a relationship in the future) but I'm not sure how given our history. (Side note: His best friend kind of creeps me out, which I know is stupid, but I want to advoid him.) I feel EXTREMELY awkward around him, so where do I start?",13Dec2017,1
3,As the year 2017 is coming to an end I think that it is okay to conclude that i have never felt worse. I have been searching for someone to listen but noone seems to so I feel comfortable sharing it here in hope that someone might hear me and maybe help me. Im a 20M and I feel really lonely. Im and introvert and im fine with spending time alone but it came to the point that i have noone close to me that i talk on day to day basis. I have spent a lot of time in developing a skill so that now I make some money and help my parents with paying my rent and my grades have never been better. Im trying to fill that hole I feel inside of me with great results that will make people I love happy but it certainly isnt making me and I end up crying myself to sleep. I dont think it is going to go for much longer like this. I have tried on mulitple occasions talking to people and making new connections which I was very good at few years ago but now its not working. I got hurt in my last relationship but that was more almost a year and a half ago. What do I do?,13Dec2017,1
5,"I created a GoFundMe campaign (goal of $525) to help me get a service dog for my severe depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.

I have lots of friends that care about me, and I know that a lot of them don't have the money to help me out, but it seems as if no one cares at all. I have made zero dollars. Is there a better way to go about raising money, or do I just need to try to reach out to even more people?",13Dec2017,1
6,"**TL;DR:** A few friends come to my place for dinner (all 19 year olds), afterwards one of them returns a chair to my room while I'm in the kitchen, he has a habit of opening my right sided desk drawer when we sit together in my room (the one he usually sits by), now I'm afraid he opened the left desk drawer (with 4 psychiatric medications that he can't know I'm taking) while I was not in the room - he was in there for at least 20 seconds before I noticed, and pressed on my keyboard in the dark. Can't know for sure if he opened it, want to end the friendship if turns out he did - this causes me great discomfort.


****

A childhood friend was at my house today (we're both 19 years old), with a few more friends of us. One of the tables around the table we ate with was from my room, so after the meal, I was with another friend putting dishes in the dishwasher, while he took the chair back to my room.

I then went back to the table and saw he was not there for at least 20 seconds, and then I went to my room, and saw him in the dark just pressing random keys on my keyboard (PC was shut down). When I came and he saw me, he just asked ""Why haven't you replaced this shitty keyboard yet?"", and just went out.

Now, whenever this friend comes to my room and sits next to me at my desk, he has this habit of opening the desk drawer he sits the closest to, just to explore what is inside. Just opens it and looks at things, asking me why I keep them there.

When I went to my room today after he returned the chair into it, I think I've heard the drawers being opened and closed as I approached the room. Maybe I imagined it, but considering that he opened them near me in the past, I think he might have done it this time too.

My desk drawer that he usually sits far away from is the one with 4 different psychiatric medications that he CAN'T know that I'm taking. I'm afraid he opened that drawer while I was in the kitchen, and saw all my meds.

This is something that to me, I think worth ending the friendship over, as weird as it sounds. But now I can't be sure if he did this or not.

What should I do? Am I panicking for no reason?

8,"Hey reddit,


Compared to many other people, I live a great life; I have a family, finances aren't a worry, I do really well in school, so on and so forth. Overall, I'm very grateful for what I have, but I guess you could say I'm not the best at showing it?


Lately, things have been going horribly for me. For the past year or so, I haven't been able to get along with my dad whatsoever. It's usually about school or grades, but also because our personalities clash in a lot of different ways. He's a slow person (and probably wiser in many ways), and I don't have the patience to deal with him, which just ends up getting both of us mad and starting horrible fights and arguments that go on for weeks at a time. When we aren't fighting, we treat each other more like friends and not father and son, which I really like. However, I hate how cyclic the nature of our arguments are, and it doesn't seem to stop. Maybe this is common between sons and their dads at my age? Idk, that's why I'm here.


I figured that rather than finding ways to make him change, I might as well try to change myself. It basically boils down to me having a low patience, a bad attitude, and being disrespectful at times that I shouldn't be. To clarify, I do respect my dad and what he's done very much, but I want to learn how to control my attitude towards him when I'm angry or ticked off. 


In school as well, I've made steps towards improving my character into being someone who doesn't judge people and is generally more positive and accepting of others. 


Maybe I'm just off, but school's been going rough recently (trying to hang on til college in a few months), and paired with the fact that I have these types of conflicts at home, it feels like that side of me kinda shows or bleeds through to others, and that's not at all what I want. 


Reddit: what advice can you give to a young adult who's about to leave for college on how to be more patient, respectful, and honest to his/her parents and peers? 


Thanks

9,"This is quite a heavy/serious one so get prepared I guess. So basically I’m in Year 11 at school, and last week a guy in one of my classes was reported for sexually assaulting 14 different girls. The police got involved, and he could likely be put on the  register. By this point his future’s more or less fucked, and at first hearing of that, I was glad to be honest. I hadn’t liked him before anyway, but after knowing that he’d traumatised 14 girls, I had no sympathy, and I wanted him to fully suffer the consequences of his actions. And he did, and still is. All his friends understandably cut off all contact from him, everyone now hates him, and soon he’ll probably face some official punishment from the school/police. He’s a piece of shit, but I’m worried for him. From what I know he’s a pretty unstable person anyway, and apparently he wants to kill himself. That’s why I’ve just made an anonymous Instagram account, and sent him a message basically telling him to not kill himself and just some general motivation I guess to lift his spirits, cuz I don’t want him to die. He definitely deserves to reap the punishments he should get, but death isn’t one of them. But I just don’t know if I’ve done the right thing or not. I’m genuinely torn if what I’ve done is right or wrong. The reason I did it was because I feel that no one else would/is offering any support, and so he might actually do it, and then I’d never forgive myself that I could’ve prevented his suicide.

11,"A little background: 

My parents are saying I have become a burden to them. They pretty much do everything while I do nothing. I have NO life experiences, no skills, and no friends. When I get kicked out, I will surely become homeless or end up in jail.


I do not even know how I can go about surviving on my own at all. Since college years ago, I have been emotionally and mentally dead inside due to multiple attempted suicides and the brain injuries from them.
I have a processing disability so everything that takes a health brain 1 hour to do it would take me 2 or 3 solid hours which typically means much longer ""rest"" periods to avoid being overwhelmed. 

 My parents valued the grades over my own well-being so trying to ""off myself"" was to spite them. And I got grades because they either paid me directly (high school and below) or for the tuition (college). And the only true motivation was my constant PTSD engine running at high speeds. 


How can I even function on my own? Get a job? I have nothing.

14,"Hello all, sorry about the wall of text but I kind of need to set the stage. 

I just graduated college not too long ago, but have a girlfriend who is still in college and has anxiety and depression. I work but not in the area so I can only be with her on weekends, so often we communicate by text or phone call. We've been dating for 8 months. Here's what's going on. 

My girlfriend has never failed a class before and this semester has been really hard on her. Whenever she feels like she isn't ready for an exam or if she doesn't do well on something she gets really down and hard on herself, even so far as to saying things like ""I can't do this I'm just going to drop out"", ""I just don't want to exist anymore"", ""I just want to kill myself"". These are pretty serious things for someome to be saying and I always talk her down but it's really emotionally and mentally exhausting. I love and support her but I can't pick her up everytime she feels down without help from her side. She doesn't understand that it is okay to fail, and her fear of this drives her into depressive moods when she feels like she is not doing well. I've tried explaining to her that failure is a part of college and that it helps strengthen you as a person but it never seems to stick. 

I want to have a conversation with her about how when she says those things it really worries me and it's emotionally and mentally exhausting to have to calm her down every time this situation happens. I NEED her to work together with me to develop coping mechanisms she can employ on her own so it's not always so downward spiraling. Not only for my sake, but also because it's healthy to be able to deal with your own problems without leaning on someone else. 

/r/advice, can you help me come up with some talking points? I don't want her to feel like I'm blaming her for her depression. What are some coping techniques that I can suggest? What is the best way that I can help? 

Thanks!

15,"(Originally posted in r/relationships)

I'm a 15 year old American straight male who, for a few reasons, is not quite ready to start dating yet for a few reasons: a) I'm really socially awkward, not very astute, b) really scrawny, have always been that way my whole life (I mean, can't do a push-up, that's how bad it is). I used to also consider a hindrance my nerdy attributes, but now, not at all. Obviously, I have ways to go.

However, things are looking optimistic for me in the long haul. In my new school, I've slowly been making progress socially since the beginning of the year, and over the break I intend to start working out (with mid-terms coming up, I don't have time to start right now). Ultimately, I think I will reach a point where I am ""ready"" to look into dating.

I've ""wanted"" to have a gf for a while, but long accepted the fact that those cards were simply not dealt in my favor. Socially, for many years, I simply had bigger fish to fry; now, having started fresh at a new school, I think that, in 2 months or 5 months or 10 months, whenever it may be, this will no longer be the case. However, such pursuits are, unsurprisingly, uncharted territory for me, and this is where I need your advice.

You see, I could pretty easily go up to a girl and start talking to her. But about what? I don't want the convo to last 10 seconds? I mean, it seems kind of weird to me to target a specific person to be your friend and then actually forge a friendship with them, especially one of a nature which I've never experienced; like, I know that's how it goes, but it just isn't at all something I know how to go about.

I know in general how dating works, but are there specifics?

It can be something as general as ""be yourself, don't try to be someone else"" or a more specific point; all is welcome. Just keep in mind that I'll still be a socially awkward, somewhat scrawny 15/16 year old trying to take dating baby steps.

17,"I have about 1.5 years left until I'm done high school. I have no idea what to do afterward. I wanted to do YouTube as a career right after high school and although I have made a few thousand off YouTube, it's not enough to justify doing YouTube full time. And I got kinda lucky when I made that few thousand too. I think my vids are good enough for me to get big enough to do YouTube full time but I have no idea how long it would take for me to get big enough. 

My parents want me to do traditional jobs (doctor, lawyer, business, engineer, etc) and I am doing well enough in school for those but I don't wanna. In the long run, I wanna get involved in politics. My reasoning for that is that this is the only life we have, as far as we know, so it makes sense to aim for the most that we want. And I wanna change something about the world, preferably in a 3rd world country (those guys need help way more). 

If you're rich, it won't matter after you die. If you're famous, eventually your name will fade away. The only permanent things really are the consequences of our actions on the world and I wanna do something permanent in that regard. And politics is obviously the best field for that. There are also some people I wanna get rid of because the world would be better off without them. But I have no idea how to get started there either. Maybe pull off something big on my own, others see that I'm capable, and then I get donations and help, idk.

26,"**This is actually for my grandfather, I am here on behalf of my mother. Please let me know if I should be posting this somewhere else.**

Location: DFW, Texas

Almost 2 months ago my 85 year old grandfather fell and broke his hip. He has parkinson's and a mildish case of dementia. We called an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital. He was out in a few days but sent to a skilled nursing home, which medicare paid for. He has been there for the last 7 weeks, but has not improved. His hip has healed, but his mind has collapsed and he can barely move his hands, let alone walk. Some days he is better than others, but he is never talkative and usually only talks when he is angry. If he does not show signs of improvement soon, Medicare will stop paying and we will have to pay $185 a day to keep him there. He is fairly well off money wise so he can afford it, but paying that much is not fair to my grandmother, who still has her mind intact and should be able to enjoy that money. 

At this point, my grandfather is little more than a corpse. It hurts to say that, but he doesn't move on his own and usually needs someone to feed him, wheel him to the bathroom, put him in bed, etc. He is not responding to any therapy and probably never will. We can't keep him at home (even though he wants to come home) because we have to carry him everywhere. My grandmother can't do that by herself and it would not be fair to make her do it. 

Is there any alternative to this skilled nursing home? Something lower cost? He is a veteran, if that makes a difference. My parents do not live in Texas but my mother wants to move the family to Texas to help take care of him, which will make her more stressed and drive up her already high blood pressure. His living will states that he does not want to be resuscitated, or put on a feeding tube or anything like that. 

TL;DR 85 year old veteran grandfather is little more than a vegetable at this point. Can't feed himself, can barely move his arms, won't/can't talk. Skilled nursing home cost is $185 a day. What other alternatives?",13Dec2017,1

I have nearly two weeks off of work starting this Thursday that I requested haphazardly without any plans for going somewhere.

What do I do? If you were in this situation, what would you do? I'd like to hear something concrete, and preferably not something generic such as ""be positive"" or ""practice gratitude"".

I want to get going with things - not more of this slow crawl. I'm appreciative of what I have but getting tired of what I don't. I understand I can't control everything as well.

I'd like better quality friendships. I'd like to have people to share in my hobbies with. I'd like to go on more dates.

Thanks for reading. I truly appreciate your advice on this.

38,"I've always struggled to find motivation to do the majority of things that I need to do in my life, I always leave anything until it becomes a big enough problem that I have to deal with it, and I'm never proactive about anything. How do people do it?

For the last two years or so I've been in a vicious circle of self loathing where I don't do things and stay on top of my life and then hate myself for being this way, but eventually get so down when I confront myself that I hide it and just try to live in denial, but I really feel like I'm struggling inside. I can't remember the last time I've felt freely happy without things weighing on my mind and dragging me down, and I don't know how to get rid of this feeling. If anyone has experienced this sort of feeling then how do you deal with it? I can't see myself living my whole life like this I don't know how I'd cope. Or does everyone really hate themselves, and it's simply that we always see others as having their lives together so much more than us?",13Dec2017,1

40,"Hey guys, I'm wrapping up my first semester in a computer science phd program and I feel like I will be wasting my early/mid 20s. From what I can tell, your 20s are a really crucial point in your life for personal development/career development. I think being in this program will really hinder my personal development... I spent my entire day either in the gym or in the lab/classroom. I try my best to carve time out to do social things, but, because I've had such a hard time making friends outside of my lab, that little free time goes into extra sleep or netflix. And to be perfectly clear, I am trying really hard to be social and meet new people. This can't be good for my personal development if I do 9 more semesters of this. I also don't have too much dating experience.. I started making the effort to date in the summer but its been tough to find a girl I connect with. (I've met all of my dates via online dating) I'm worried I won't 1) find a girl in grad school because its tough to meet people and 2) maintain a healthy relationship IF I find someone.

I tried everything possible to try to get them to get along again but I have been unsuccessful. I keep them separated at all times now. I’ve never seen my female cat attack me or my children before. Tonight my son was in the kitchen and the cat comes in with her tail all fat and hissing. She attacked him. At first I thought she just swatted at him but she got him good. Deep scratches on his back and put a hole in his brand new Christmas jammies. I put her in the basement and shut the door. My husband came out from the bedroom wanting to know what happened. He said she has to go. She needs to be put down because she’s dangerous. My question is do you think she should be put down? I am NOT HAPPY  at all with what happened and agree she needs to go but I don’t have the heart to put her down. Shes been apart of the family for 9 years.

42,"Hi r/advice,

I work in a technical sales role (ie. ""sales engineer"") at a medium sized company. My compensation is 80/20 (base + quarterly bonus). I've been with the company for over three years, and have consistently been a top performer. Our sales org is doing some restructuring, and as a result, it was decided that this quarter, our team of 6 would have a ""team quota"" to assist in the transition. No one really had a say in the matter, it was simply relayed to us.

With only a few weeks left in the quarter, myself and another teammate have closed 85% of the teams revenue. Due to the fact that the other team members have under performed, our bonus will be substantially impacted. Had we been measured as individual contributors, which is how we have always been measured, we would stand to earn a large bonus (low five figures).

I want to approach my management to discuss, but unsure how to do so. While the team quota could have worked if the majority of the team performed, it has worked out quite the opposite. I am on good terms with management, and have rarely voiced any sort of concerns during my time at the company.

Am I being unreasonable here? I had no objection to the team quote initially, as this is not how I envisioned it working out. Additionally, even if I had voiced any concern, I am doubtful it would have gotten me anywhere. I'm essentially be punished because my teammates have underperformed. How do you think I should approach this?

Edit: Wanted to clarify that the decision to have a team quote was made prior to the start of the quarter. It was not just thrown at us now.",13Dec2017,1

I have never felt that going to college is the right choice for me, and I do not want to waste my time and money on something that I do not want to do.

We've been hanging out since and I've helped with taking her to the shops and shit like that and yeah I'm young so got attached. But as soon as I mentioned my ex popped back up to me she funnily enough said the same thing. I'm not around her all the time but naturally this guys being better I'm a little jealous. But I mentioned that I was going out to see my ex tonight (lit just tech support that's all) and she went mad. I've never said anything bar 'Ok' when she stays at her ex's but this isn't ok to her for me to be seeing my ex. And now she's gone my life is shit I hate my life and it's not just me causing it.

48,"I have a lot of superficial friendships in my life. People who I don't feel much of a connection with, yet am equally extremely close to. Who know a lot about me, who see me quite often but who I feel if it came down to it, I would be the last person on their list to think about. I don't have a mom, I don't have a dad, I don't really have anyone who exists on that level. Who, if a hurricane hit, would say let's go check on her house. Or if I didn't show up to work one day, let's go see how she's doing. Or if I didn't answer the phone, do you think she's okay?  If I died, my neighbors would say she was quiet and kept to herself. But what am I supposed to do, knock on your door with some cookies?  I'm 25 years old, not 90. I just feel so isolated from the people who are in my life and to bluntly put it, like no one actually gives a shit. I once told someone I would rather die at work, that way I would be around people instead of rotting away in my apartment. Nearly every hour of my day is accounted for, and I value my alone time so it isn't like I'm alone or lonely. I just have a hard time being intimate with people, trusting my vulnerability with people, and feeling connected with those who I call my friends. Someone can hug me and say I'm like a sister to them and I feel nothing. 

So I don't know what to do but I feel like I need to change some things. Its like having a pair of socks, but wearing them on your hands. I have relationships with people, but I'm not really investing in them the way that I should be. Everyone goes home to their families at the end of the day, or over the holidays and I go home to an empty, dark house to feed my cat. I love my cozy little home, but there's something missing. And I can't just snap my fingers and build my own family. So again I guess, wtf do I do. I took a sick day off work just to wallow, I mean this really affects me, this feeling of emptiness and hoplessness and lack of intimacy. It makes me turn to all the wrong things, and I quit drinking about 5 months ago so it cant be alcohol anymore. Sometimes it's the wrong men and dysfunctional relationships. Sometimes it's allowing depressive episodes to swallow me. Sometimes it's working 7 days a week and only allowing myself 6 hours to sleep.

My mom has had stomach issues as well as problems with heartburn/acid reflux for quite a while. The acid reflux has been going on since she was a kid, and the other stomach problems (nausea, diarrhea, occasional vomiting) have been on and off for several years. Eventually she had to get her gallbladder removed in April 2014. There was a short period of time after her surgery where things were fine; she didn't feel sick anymore, no heartburn, etc. But eventually the heartburn started again. By early 2015 she said she felt sick every time she ate, and over the past two years the diarrhea, heartburn, and nausea have become more and more frequent. It's at least once a week at this point. She has a shitty diet, is overweight, and has a plethora of health problems including type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, etc. She takes medication to help with these conditions, but doesn't do much else. Like I said, very unhealthy diet and she doesn't exercise. She acts like the medication will just fix everything. She insists that her stomach problems are all because of acid reflux (though as far as I know acid reflux doesn't cause diarrhea.. but maybe I'm wrong) and take tums by the handful, but that's about it. I feel like there's definitely something else going on though. Whether it's just because of her diet, or if it's something else like ibs or even celiac disease. I have problems with gluten and stopped eating it in 2015. I made the mistake of going gluten free before getting tested (i couldn't eat without feeling sick and was just desperate at that point), so I don't know if I actually have celiac or not.. but I suggested that maybe she could get tested. Just a blood test or maybe testing to see if she has the gene, because she has so many of the symptoms of celiac. She even said that she feels better when she doesn't eat gluten.. but she refuses to get tested because she doesn't want to change her diet. Plus, my dad got the celiac blood test a while back and it was negative.. so according to my mom that means that neither her nor I can possibly have celiac. But regardless of whether or not it's celiac, there's definitely something going on and she doesn't care one bit. She complains about feeling sick and tries various otc medicines, but refuses to bring this up to her doctor or try changing her diet and start exercising. I really worry about her and I don't want anything to happen to her. How can I get her to actually do something and take this seriously?",13Dec2017,3
60,"in october, a friend of a friend asked me and my gf to cat sit for about 2 weeks. well it's now december 12th and we still have this cat. the owner has basically ghosted us several times, making dates to pick up the cat, but then doesn't show up and doesn't warn us, only asking us after she has missed the pick up if we can keep the cat longer. she's gone weeks without contact. 

she has said she will pay us back for the food we've purchased in our now two months of keeping this cat, but we don't really care -- we now love this cat and want to keep it. the owner seems basically neglectful. i don't know anyone who would remain out of contact with the people taking care of their cat. we're giving the cat a great quality of life and are basically caring for it better than the owner.

71,"Pretext: There are a few people whose names I have changed. They include: Pam, Lee, and Will. 

I'm currently a first year research fellow in Dermatology at a well known hospital in Texas. Prior to me joining the team, Pam was the previous research fellow and has gone on to now doing residency at another program. Pam was the first research fellow and you can say I'm the second. During Pam's time at my current program she was guided and assisted on how to go about things by Lee. Lee is the administrative assistant for Dr. Will. When I was interviewing for the current position Lee interviewed me and gave the final recommendation to Dr. Will on who to hire. 

We currently use a national database to write papers and publish into journals. Our hospital has access and pays for this database whereas Pam's current program does not. There are times when I want to use it, and because Pam is on it, I simply can't. When I was hired, Lee spent roughly a day teaching me how to use it, but it was a complete disaster. Since I've been at my program I've been emailing the help desk of the database and to teach me how to use the software better. The people there have been so fantastic, they have even setup personal 1-to-1 time with me to help me better explain things. 

I've currently written 3 papers since I've started. I finished them the week of Thanksgiving. I've given them to Lee to review and to Dr. Will. The papers have yet to be reviewed and Christmas will make it 5 months since I've started. I brought this to the attention of Dr. Will and he said he will review them over the break since he is not going anywhere. He told me the same thing over Thanksgiving break. 

Today, I log onto Facebook and I see Pam recently published a paper that she submitted in October and it was accepted in November. Wtf? I started in July. I look at the authors list and I see that Lee and Will are on the paper. I'm extremely disappointed at this point, on how she's no longer here and is still getting support from the people that are supposed to be moulding me into a future medical scientist. I'm enraged that she's still using the database from our hospital to write papers, even though she's no longer here. Pam has over 40 publications since her time here and has been accepted into a residency program. I don't understand the need for why she needs to continue to using the current database from our program, whereas myself and the other research fellow could benefit from using it instead. 

There's nobody here that I can talk to about this because I know it'll eventually come back to Pam, and it'll make the situation more tense. I just really don't know what to do. We have a huge conference at our hospital at the end of January. I keep telling myself that Lee and Dr. Will are busy because of that, and to give them until Valentine's Day to resolve my current pending papers.

The last six months (maybe longer?) have just been a long series of unfortunate events. Bad news out of our control happening to me &amp; my family. It adds up.

Fortunately, with each bit of bad news I've had friends reach out and offer their support, as a shoulder to cry on, a person to vent to, or as a distraction from it all. I took a few up on their offer at the time, but...

I mostly just decline the help. Or downplay the problem. Or deflect their concern. Not even consciously, sometimes. I think I've just got a finely honed defense mechanism to make everything seem okay when it absolutely is not. 

I'm also reluctant to ask my friends for help, even the ones that had offered their support earlier. I don't want my burdens to become their burdens. I don't want my friends to become my therapists.

When I talk to my older friends, my speech flows much more naturally, and I have a dark, random sense of humour. I have relaxed body posture and don't strive for attention more than the next guy.

Around my newer (and arguably closer) friends, my speech is slurred and awkward, my humour is mostly sarcastic and sometimes bordering a bit mean, I'm slow to react to things, my walk changes to look as if I was drunk, and my hands are always folded in front of me or in my pockets.  
I can't wake up in the mornings, I miss my paper route and am late for school all the time. I used to be intellectual and ambitious, independent and happy, but that all changed. This leads to my biggest problem.  
Ultimately, the biggest problem is my sense of individualism. I find myself becoming the people I see on TV or in movies. My personality, my dress sense, everything will morph to match my favourite celebrity to a scary extent. First. it was Sherlock Holmes, and I found myself dressing in trench coats and scarves, and I told everybody I was sociopathic. it ruined friendships.  
Now, it's Johnny Depp. When I was younger, his Pirates movies were an escape from an otherwise neglected childhood. I cling to them as a way to break free from the pressures of society.

78,"Please Help. I [21M] have been dating my [21F] girlfriend for 3 years now, both in college, active, happy and healthy. we've pretty much done everything together and have a strong relationship IMO (besides when we have fights about porn). We've been really good friends for 7 years. She doesn't like me watching watching porn and is somewhat okay with me masturbating without it. I'm probably addicted to porn because I've let it threaten our relationship. I have loved her for 7 years and don't want this to get in the way.



That being said **I think porn and masturbation are very normal for a guy my age** and I know a lot of girls who don't care about porn in a relationship and I know some girls don't like it/won't allow it in a relationship.



My gf and I have had the porn discussion several times. I really do want to stop but go back and forth between rather she's being irrational or not. I will go a week or so without porn then ill go a week or so with it every single day, sometimes twice. I am in no way attracted to porn the way way I am attracted to her. I still have a high sex drive so it does not effect our sexual relationship at all. 



Regardless of whether I think shes being irrational or not, **she absolutely has the right to ask me to stop watching porn and I fully understand how bad it hurts her feelings and how it can be considered cheating.** I want to stop watching porn and don't want it to damage our relationship.



I get a lot of sexual and personal/emotional satisfaction from only having orgasms from her. I am a fairly masculine person (sports, party, etc) except when I'm with her and especially in bed I am submissive. She is a fairly strong feminist (not a feminazi) but about as strong as a male feminist would be. I explained to her how hard it was for me to resist porn when she's gone for a few days so we recently (2 weeks) got a chastity cage (I brought it up) I wore it for a week (took it off for sex) and she hasn't asked me to put it back on. She lets me masturbate whenever I need to but she tells me how, when, where, etc so that way it feels like I'm masturbating for her. I liked wearing the cage because I has so much more energy and worked out everyday that week and slept really well, and especially because I did not have to worry about fighting my urges. She is absolutely against porn, she really likes the whole controlling my orgasms thing but understands sometimes I just have to masturbate.




TMI Warning but she usually holds my balls tight during sex and cuddling and she likes face sitting and stuff, all of which I also enjoy. Shes not huge on the chastity cage I think she'd just rather have me control my own urges. She's pretty against anything that would make her the submissive one or ""degrading to women"" like cumming on her face or anal. I want to give up control on some level because I lack the self-control, but I'm unsure of if I'm doing it in a healthy way. I consider myself to be socially dominant, I am a engineering student, and often take leadership roles in class and sports and life.



**Now I'm concerned if I have a femdom fetish or If I am actually just submissive and want to be a good bf.** Also somewhat concerned that I'm ""whipped"" for lack of a better term, my friends have jokingly called me a cuckold before but this was before the chastity cage and everything. I'm submissive in bed but we've never done anything weird/kinky. I've watch femdom porn before and got off to it but really don't think that's who I am because I'm not like this 99% of the time. **where is the line drawn between femdom, submissiveness, and being a good boyfriend?** If the submissiveness helps me stop watching porn and therefor helps our relationship should we continue our current route or is it just part of a fetish that will hurt us in the long run?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

80,"So there is this cute guy in my school, who I've had a crush on for about year and a half (I know it's sad). I can't figure out what to say to him. Should I become friends with him first?

82,"throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

Little backstory, I don’t want to sound like I have a huge ego, but I’ve been told by several good looking women that I myself am decently attractive. So, I talk to girls and they talk to me... online. You see, I’m in my “teenage” years so I’m on social media. Snapchat, instagram, etc. and I talk to girls in and outside of my school. Even different grades. What scares me is real life. I’m going to a friends house this weekend, and it will be just me and him and 2 other girls. He’s “hooked up” with many girls and knows about this stuff. Me, no. What am I supposed to talk about? How do I avoid awkward moments? How do I not sound like I’m scared? I feel embarrassed typing this, but I’m not just going to ask any girl on Snapchat what to do.

TL:DR- can only talk to girls confidently on social media. Hanging out with two girls this weekend and don’t want to make anything awkward.",13Dec2017,1
84,"I graduated university this spring, and on a bit of a whim, moved from BC to Montreal with 3 friends to try living in a big city and to have more opportunities. 

I've been here for three months now, and things just aren't feeling right. I'm still unemployed, but working odd jobs and just barely scraping by. Jobs are hard to find here, but thankfully it's very cheap to live in Quebec so luckily I'm not dirt poor.

My friends and I are living in a tiny, disgusting apartment. It's in a great location and rent is cheap, but appliances and heat keep breaking and the landlord is very shady and keeps delaying fixing things. Our neighbours are very noisy and unfriendly. We tried befriending them but they ignored us, and keep stomping around in the apartment above us, late into the night.

Speaking of befriending, I've found people here to be unwelcoming and cold. Don't get me wrong, there have been some nice people, but I've made zero new friends in the past three months. I've even tried going on Tinder binges to attempt to make new connections, but they never go anywhere either. I love my friends, but I'm with them every single day and worry I'm starting to get sick of them.

I'm also getting used to the harsh winter here. It's cold, makes going out extremely unpleasant, and the nights long and uncomfortable. I know this sounds whiny, but it's just making me miss British Columbia a lot.

I've also considered just ditching my friends and moving back home with my parents to think about my next move, but we're in this apartment lease until September 2018, and I don't want to ditch out on my friends and leave them with more rent to pay, or a stranger moving in.

I'm just feeling a little adrift and stupid. Why did I leave behind my life where I had friends, was close to my family, and had more job opportunities? Everyone says you should be used to a new location by now, but I just feel even less at home than ever. I can't even afford to visit home since flying in Canada is so insanely expensive. 

I dunno, maybe I just needed to rant. I'm feeling very sad and lost. Does anyone have any similar experiences to moving to a new location, and how things changed for them? Thanks for reading.",13Dec2017,0
85,"My mother - 47 years old. Has worked in the food industry as well as holding the title of a CNA for several years. Used to be heavy into meth (Only reason this is relevant, is because this does make getting a job a bit harder since her appearance is that of an ex-user). Never had a 401k in her life. Never had any money in savings her whole life. She also has a lot of ""problems"" which I can't confirm since she has a history of lying about her medical records (Claims she has ""mild Fibromyalgia"" ""Mild Spina Bifida"" ""Diabetes"" etc. etc. The list goes on, with little to no evidence). She currently lives in my garage in a makeshift bedroom. She currently works at a casino as a Graveyard porter. She makes around 400$ every two weeks, which is not nearly enough to live off of, especially not in our state where the low end apartments still cost 700$ a month for studios. She has no friends because she has burned every bridge ever. With all that information about her, this is my problem. She has lived with us for three years now. She pays us 200$ every two weeks, and doesn't save any money otherwise, and I see no end in site for her to move out. I have encouraged her to seek better employment. I have encouraged her to find a boyfriend. I have even encouraged her to try to move up at the casino instead of settling as a porter. The thing is, she has little to no desire to do so. Even when I have set goals for her, or tell her she has to move out by a certain point, it seems none of that gets into her head. She has no ambition (which is crazy since she always forced me to be ambitious and set goals for myself). I would hate for her to live on the streets, but at this point it seems like thats the only option I have left. So now I turn to Reddit in hopes that someone has gone through a similar situation and has a reasonable answer for me. How do I get her on her feet and encourage her to live life independently instead of in my garage for life? I would be willing to provide more info, if needed to make even more sense of the situation as well. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Cheers. ",13Dec2017,1

The good news is, I will be fine in the short term. I won't have trouble continuing to go to work or eat or anything. But what if I want to pick up a second job? Or buy alcohol after a shave? I might be screwed because this isn't my home state. In fact, it's a bit removed overall.

I was born in Pennsylvania, spent a decade in Indiana and last had an 'official' ID made there, which I got a new one of in early 2015, and I carried that around because it was good for ten years... and now that's lost.

I talked to the train company and went to the station, a manager was very helpful and called the lost and found and others for me, even let me see camera footage. No luck though.

I'm not mad at anyone at the train company. Can't even really be mad at whatever bastard found a wallet with no cash or feasible profit and just tossed it away. This was my stupid mistake, but I now have precisely these means of ID and nothing else..

A prepaid debit card with my name on it.
Some old pay stubs from earlier this year (local job).
A couple of pieces of mail.

That's it. My lease is a handshake agreement with my older cousin, who subleases his house in Florida to me. I deposit the rent into his bank account at a location down here every month and always get a text saying 'thanks :D ' like an hour later.

The guy at the DMV was sympathetic but he said that since I don't have a birth certificate, a passport, a social security card or an ID made on record in this state even, my only option would be essentially to make someone with all their forms of ID and a bonafide lease copy of their own come down with me and say they're my housemate/roommate or such and they're essentially vouching for me. 

Is there any other option I have here?

My best friend and I were talking and she’s got a really high sex and can’t get over the fact that my partner and I haven’t done it in over a year and that I have no desire to either.

Ever since having our daughter, I think we’ve had sex maybe 20 times? I am never, ever in the mood for it. The thought of having sex makes me feel physically sick sometimes. I could honestly go the rest of my life without having sex, it really would not be an issue for me. 

I have no problem masturbating but it’s only ever out of boredom or like, a stress release maybe. I know aswell that if my partner and I were to split for any reason, I wouldn’t be seeking another partner.

I originally planned it out that it would take me 5 years to do my 4-year computer engineering degree (basically do my first 2 years of the degree over 3 years). First semester was very decent with a 3.0 GPA. Second semester was 3.7 GPA. By second year first semester, my GPA was 3.9ish (4.33 scale). All was going fine up until third year second semester. In third year second semester, I was sick for a month in that semester and I ended up failing all my courses. So I wait a year so I can redo those courses in fourth year second semester and I find I have literally zero motivation and fail once more. At this point, I become very depressed. I decided to take the year off and I finally pass in the summer in fifth year in the summer term.

Okay, whatever. So I basically lost 2 years, no big deal, right? I pick up the book ""How to Be Miserable"" by Randy J. Paterson and it really helps me a lot (anti-depression book). Well, in my sixth year fall semester (now), I'm doing the third year of the degree. Apparently, I'm a dumbass and somehow I have forgotten to keep up with the pace of lectures (probably because it's so long). Up until finals, I was 100% deluded into thinking I was going to pass. I thought I was doing the minimum effort to be able to pass and skirt by.

Room mate and I started living together this year, I’ve known her for two but never lived with her like this. She broke up with her boyfriend in October of almost a year. 

Lately things have been getting worse for me due to small things related to her...she:

- ALWAYS talks about herself no matter the topic or brings the topic back to herself somehow
- talks over me or cuts me off. She even finishes my sentences or tells the rest of my story for me
- doesn’t stop talking even when I go into my room or have head phones on
- when my boyfriend comes over, she makes herself comfortable in my room and doesn’t leave until I say something or I say nothing and it’s silent. She will also self invite herself on our dinners if we ever go out. We’ve resorted to saying we’re having x place that has foods she doesn’t like even if we aren’t to have her not come
- anything that I do that is different to what she does, she will always comment on it and drag it 
- very bad with confrontation as she will ignore you 
- yet had such strong opinions about things and will let you know how she feels

I don’t think she notices she does these things. I feel like she’s lonely from her recent break up but always talks about how she has so much time for herself now. I feel suffocated and am getting annoyed by her so much that I’m thinking “shut up” in my head every time she talks. I’ve stopped inviting her out because we get into arguments as she always has to be right and doesn’t drop the topic until I admit she is even if she isn’t. 

Honestly there’s so much more but I hope you get the idea. She’s very passive aggressive and I don’t know how to confront her about her behaviour.  I’ve resorted to being in my room or having headphones in and just not reacting to her when she tries to get my attention (unless she really needs it). I feel like she just talks or texts me because she has no one else to talk to and sometimes it’s just empty things. Even at home she will talk louder or scream/make sounds when she games and looks at me go see if I react but I’m so tired of feeding into it, I just don’t anymore. 

I think she’s always been like this but because I’ve never spent this much time with her before, I’m only noticing it now. Please help me before I lose my mind. ",13Dec2017,14

I’m 14, and in 8th grade. I’ve made a few posts in the past about this kind of thing, but I didn’t really explain my true problem. These posts were always something along the line of, “How do you talk to people?” but that doesn’t address my issue. I know how to talk to people. I’m pretty bad at it, but I can hold a conversation well enough. The problem is that when people walk up to me and go, “Hey Vortex!” I ignore them.  


I don’t know when I started doing this. I don’t know how to stop now, though. When people talk to me in the hallways or whatever, I’ll just walk faster, and when they talk to me in the classroom, I’ll go sharpen my pencil or just keep working. I always regret it afterwards though. But in order to reply to someone, I have to make a focused effort, and I often only think to make that effort after my stony silence, far to late, as whoever tried to talk to me is often now talking to some other person.

What I'm really torn on is where to go if I pursue oceanography, currently I have two choices. Either I go to UBC and do my first year in my home city then transfer to Vancouver to do the rest of my schooling , this one concerns me as the city is extremely expensive to live in and I want to do things with as little debt as possible but it is only four hours away from my home city. My other choice is to join the Canadian Coast Guard, If I do it through them my schooling and what not is paid for and I serve in the coast guard for a mandatory four years after my schooling then can do whatever. The major draw back is I'll be moving to the other side of the country to do the schooling.

117,"This is my first post on Reddit, so please be gentle.

Here's a quick backstory:
I'm a kind of a socially awkward pushover that wants to help everyone and will even self sacrifice (sometimes) to make people happy. I am also an executive member of my college's student's union and an alternate member of the college's Academic Council.
At the beginning of the school year I joined a student carpool to help out people who were having trouble getting to school as our town doesn't have any form of public transportation besides taxi cabs (that cost A LOT). Sally, another executive and one of the two regular members of the academic Council from our campus, also joined said carpool, but was charging students almost as much as a cab to bring them to school even though the students don't live far out of her way for her to pick them up. All of the people who once carpooled with her are now asking me to take them in instead because I charge a fraction of her price. Needless to say, but Sally is quite unhappy with the situation and with me..
We, the executive group of the Union, have been busy planning a Christmas party for the student body and the only available date to host it is on the same day of an academic Council meeting that's two hours away. Naturally everyone wants to be at the campus to prep for the party, so I offered to go. Sally even made it clear to everyone that she couldn't/didn't want to go at several of our recent meetings. So I've been insisting that I can go and be back in time to help serve food and such at the party.

My dilemma starts here:
Today, I and a fellow member, B, who volunteered to go with me to the meeting in Sally and the other regular member's place were greeted by Sally who informed us, matter of factly, that B couldn't be an alternate because she wasn't on the list and that she, Sally, was attending the meeting herself and that I was to ride with her and go halfsies on everything. I'm broke as f.. I was looking forward to going alone (before B offered) and spending the relatively cheap $50 on gas (and maybe a coffee or two) and getting $200 in return. Sally expects half of that $200 and for me to pay half of the fuel and half of her meals (I plan on waiting until the party to eat lots of yummy FREE foods) whether we use her car or mine. We each get a $50 honorarium for our SU for attending the meeting but only one of us gets paid the mileage because the Student Association expects members from the same campus to carpool to the meetings, so they'll only pay once. On top of that, Sally can be unpleasant to be around and she smokes.. I've been in her car before and I came out smelling like an ashtray. I'm not a fan.

Also, I didn't know at the time how to respond so I didn't say anything when she told me how things were going down. I only have 2 days to figure out how to stand up for myself and to her about this.

So I guess my question is, how do I tell her that I'd like to use my car, that I'm going to pay for the fuel, that I want receive the whole mileage payment, and that she pays for her own food without her being a grump the entire duration of our trip or making a big deal about it to get her way and take all the money? Am I being unreasonable? Or should I just bite the bullet and take the $100 and pay half to keep her happy?

I'm a good actor and I know how to respond in social situations, but it gets tiring and sometimes you slip up and people do notice  
  
Is there a way to fix this? I'm willing to go into more details if you ask since this is a throw away

A couple weeks ago I got a letter that I may have been impacted by the breach and since then I've had several very minor events happen, which sort of raised my eyebrow but now my debit card got frozen.  First facebook deleted a post I didn't make, so it looked like someone got into my FB.  It was a picture of a shoe and I thought maybe FB is just trying to make me paranoid and have me change my password.  

Then I got a message from an app I use called SmartApp (I've used this for years, it's basically just a company that pays you to send them traffic usage statistics, it's legit) saying that my account was locked due to suspicious activity.  

I went to use my debit card today and it was declined.  When I checked my account ledger, some company called AMI Lawn and Landscaping deducted a payment for a whopping 13 cents.  So I called my bank and they said there were a bunch of attempts to use my card to pay for UBER rides in San Francisco.  I live in Wisconsin.  So the card is frozen but no attempts seem to have been made to use my checking account directly.  

I do not use or access my banking on my phone but because some of the apps I use seemed to have been accessed I changed all my passwords and factory reset it.  I ran some malware scans on my computer and didn't find anything on there but I might just reformat it to be safe.

132,"Hi fellow redditors. the abridged version is: I want to leave my job because they owe me 3 month's payment but I can't bring myself to do it because apparently they really need me.


here's the long version: 


A few months ago I was interviewed for a job at a small deisgn business. They needed someone who could do design but also marketing on the side (basically looking for jobs and clients).


I've only worked on sales a few times in my life and I'm an easy speaker so I figured I could do it. How hard could it be? I did tell the boss that I had no previous experience in marketing. He said no prob, as he also gets jobs for the place


The first month was great: got paid on time, landed a few jobs for the business and did design, which is what I majored in. But just after that things began to take a dive; suddenly clients didn't give us work, no work means no payment and the boss told me and the other designer to hold on and for me to keep looking for jobs


We've had a few jobs come to the business which gives enough to pay the bills of the place but no enough to get payments on time. I've been paid intermittently and doing the math I've practically worked 3 months for free. I'm not the best salesman in the world but I do keep on visiting clients and offering our services though none of them are comissioning.


The boss has talked to me a couple of times about my performance but I haven't told anyone that I want to leave because I feel like I'd come off as the bad guy of the story: leaving them in a time of need.


I'm a college graduate living with his parents so I have nothing to worry about if the business sinks; the owner of the business is a very decent person and I understand what's happening is not his fault but damn, I miss money.

134,"TLDR: 
Friend invited me to her birthday dinner so that I could pay for an expensive $40 meal so she could get a free one-instead of me paying for a $12 meal. I already bought her a present and didn't feel the need to spend $40 on a meal I didn't want. I left now trying to pick up the pieces.





THE BACK STORY:
My friend and I are from fairly wealthy families, although hers is worlds above mine. Her dad was a multimillionaire and was murdered by his girlfriend in order to collect the money. My friend is one of 3 sisters who each received 9 million dollars each when he passed away.

I met my friend, 26, through her sister, 23, at school. Her sister and I were friends first and my family hosted many events, slumber parties etc. and her 23 sister and I were close but eventually drifted apart. I became closer friends with 26F in the last two years.
My mum is not the best person to trust but she recounts to me how the girls' mum would fight over having to pick up her daughter because of the cost of driving (10 minute drive lol).
The girls are very stingy with their money apart from the fact that they live in big houses, with nice cars etc. 

My friend lives in a big house about 10 minutes away which is why we see eachother lots.
On the other hand, my family is wealthy, but I am not that wealthy. My dad is a millionaire, but he doesn't exactly share the money out. Most of the money has gone to my brothers because of the patriarchal family structure.
Anyway, one of the perks of being semi-wealthy is that I am a member of a tennis club. This was my 18th birthday present (18 is a big thing in Australia). Every year I get $200 to spend at the tennis club restaurant and I normally save this for my birthday dinner-where I foot the bill.






THE ACTUAL STORY:
My friends 26th birthday was on last month. She and her sister 23 have birthdays in the same month so had 2 joined different parties at their house and beach-house, and sent me an individual text inviting me to a dinner at the tennis club.
Initially I assumed that the family would be paying for me. This is the way things work in my family-we always pay for any friend I bring to events etc. 
The dinner was reschedule 3-4 times until they eventually settled on a date which was actually rather inconvenient for me.
F26 informed me that, ""by the way you can use your voucher for the tennis club-since I know you never use it!"". I explained that actually I use it for my birthday dinner. She said nothing. This got me sort of weirded out they she had to point that out and I mentioned it to my mum.
Mum said, ""That means she wants you to know she is definitely is not paying for you.""
The different parties they held at their house I attended and gave both the 23 and 26 presents totally about $75 all together.  Mind you, 23F has been invited to several of my parties prior to 26F and I becoming friends and failed to bring me presents.....but I really wanted to give them presents because it felt weird if I didn't.

I realise since 26F is an adult so it made sense that even though her family was going to this dinner in Kooyong, I was an adult too-I have to pay for myself now.

I barely made it to the dinner in time because they scheduled it very inconveniently straight after uni. I was about 30 minutes late. When I got there we looked at the menu and I kinda of freaked out because I forgot how expensive the meals were. I would have to pay $40 for 1 meal. That half the money I spend a week on food and I was trying to save money. I know I was had my voucher and I was meant to spend it according to 26F but it was for my birthday and I wanted to be able to use it for that...
I looked at the specials and saw soup-$12. I remembered how big the soup was last time and said ""OH soup! I want to get that""
23F was not privy as to why I was a guest at 26F dinner. 
in fact the mother had brought a guest, the 23F had brought a guest and I was 26F guest. 23F guest was her boyfriend.
23F, ""you can't order a soup because then we don't get the free main meal"".
Suddenly-it clicked. I had forgotten the deal because on my birthday the bill was normally so high that I forgot about the main meal deal.
Because the mother, sister 23 and other sister 26 all had their birthdays in the same month they could attend a dinner and receive a free meal per every main meal they ordered.
I had been primed-told that I had to pay for my meal by 26F. And I'm sure 23F and her boyfriend, well they were both aware about the main meal thing, they were splitting. I had been told I was not allowed to order the soup. I looked at the menu again and the waiter came around. I said ""Since I'm not allowed to order the soup I'll get this ____"". 26F looked at me seedily and I excused myself to to go the bathroom because I was seething. I realised I had been invited since 26F wanted me to pay for a main meal so that she could get a free meal. It pissed me off the so much. The stinginess. The trickery. I felt used. I am probably one of her wealthier friends which is why she felt less guilty about doing it. But even so, I am not made of money! I already purchased you a present-I don't owe you anything. My family always pays for your family, hosts events. We owe you nothing. I called my mother who told me to stand my ground and change my order. The idea of facing them with my change of order despite being told no, worried me. I said-I'm just going to send a text that I'm not feeling well and leave. I did that and left.
Sarah messaged me some rude things about being able to invite someone else-I should've told her I was unwell. I'm guessing she was mad because she had to pay for her meal lol. 
The problem is this whole situation has cut me up bad. Not only that because I have lost her friendship I can't make anymore friends via her. She has a lot of friends, albeit not close friends I imagine because of this issue. I have heard other people complain, ""You are the richest of all of us and you are complaining shutup"".
I was told by another friend not to mention money at all-its too sensitive of an issue.
Recently a mutual friend of hers, 28M, who likes me messaged me asking if I would go to boxing with him. I asked if 26F would be there and he said maybe. I said we had a fight. To be honest he rarely fb msgs me anymore so I thought 26F put him up to it. He then asked me to get lunch after instead if she does end up coming. We didn't end up hanging out because I was too busy. I told him we had a fight-but I didn't tell 26F it was a fight I'd always maintained that I was unwell. 26F send me a snapchat asking me what the real reason for leaving her birthday dinner was. She even saved it so I can't ignore it.

I was thinking about sending this- Thoughts?

""I didn't feel very welcome to be honest. I don't have that much money at the moment because I've had to drop hours at work to prioritise uni, and R still owes me heaps of money, and I felt like I was being pressured to spend a lot when I was trying to save my voucher for my birthday. I already spent plenty on ur and 23's birthday and didn't feel like I should be pressured to spend anymore. It got me really upset and I wasn't actually even hungry because I felt sick from the heat and rushing from uni to make it on time.""

Okay, so, I have what I think is a drug problem. My partner, who knows a lot about drugs and their scene, agrees that it's trouble. So does my psychiatrist. As well as using weed reasonably heavily, I have some medical conditions which have opened me up to Valium, Seroquel, Tramadol, Temazepam and codeine.

I've been using the pills completely innapropriately - straight up popping them get high, fucking with my dosages (the worst example was 23 Valium in the space of an hour because it ""wasn't working well enough""), using Seroquel to sleep every day when it's prescribed only for anxiety attacks, mixing them with each other or with weed for a good ride. I'm blessed with an addictive personality and the impulse control of a five year old so I don't see it getting better, and I'm interested in stopping it before it gets worse. 

Trouble is, my state has a huge ice (crystal meth) problem and a healthcare budget of approximately $10 so I feel like I'd be told to GTFO if I went the professional help route.

136,"I’m having trouble communicating simple things with a business partner without her getting emotional. We are going through a bad month in terms of cash flow and need to cut expenses. I’ve cut everything down to the bone but we still aren’t breaking even. My last solution to fix this problem was to shorten the hours of an employee my business partner is fond of. The employee isn’t all that necessary, has a steady income outside of her current work, and would handle the news that we needed to reduce her hours well. However, when I brought this up with my business partner, she became very upset and refused to allow me to do this. The issue is there is nowhere else to cut and I’ve asked for her advice on where else we could cut expenses. She has no solution.

137,"Basically I've been racking my brain looking for a good, high calorie, reasonably sugared, packaged meal. Food bars are generally what I check. I haven't tried buying emergency rations yet, but that seems to be the only thing I can find in this vein.

Too much is focused on body building, or weight loss, or ""low carb"" nonsense. I don't need anything special. Just needs to be affordable, last at least a few months, not need to be cooked, and have at *least* 300 calories per package. No extra flavors, or high lean protein, of whatever the fad is.

All they are used for is a breakfast substitute when I need it, that has enough calories to fill, and enough carbs for some basic exercise. I'm not hitting the gym, I'm not marathoning, I'm not going to sit and do nothing while I eat it. Just something as a back up for a meal. I shouldn't need to eat 4-5 just to feel like I ate one. I mean, I usually eat around 3500-4000~ calories a day. With what exorcise I do get in, my body height, age, and metabolism that how much I need to maintain myself regularly.

Part of this ENFP gift I've read is reading others and anticipating the needs of others. Reading the mood of a room for instance, or I can tell when someone doesn't like me, instantly. Although 9/10 I can't understand why. 

Well, actually I can tell why but I don't want to accept it/it doesn't make logical sense.

It mostly happens with other women. They are vicious with me, percieve me as threatening. I don't engage them in drama and nastiness, I continue attempting to be kind and try to iron out the issue. 

Then they start prying into my life. 

Then once they find I don't take the bait or they can't find any dirt on me (Seriously, guys, I really am not an asshole, but am so perceptive that I see this coming a mile away) then they decide that finding nothing is the problem they have with me. 

Then they start accusing me of being a saint because they legit have nothing else to attack me on, and then attack me worse for it.

It always seems to backfire and I lose (part of that ENFP thing apparently is being naïve enough to think I can diffuse the situation) and I don't even feel like I even did anything wrong except try to make friends or try to make people understand I wasn't what they thought.

I don't flirt with their boyfriends, I don't talk shit, I don't tell lies, I don't fucking get why they hate me so much.

I typically keep to myself a lot because of this. I'm lonely. 

And I just lost a job over this, I quit because the girls at work were making fake profiles trying to talk to me and spreading rumors and....think Carrie with pigs blood. Just a girl minding her own business and wham, some bitchy girl comes along and acts like a complete asshole for no reason.

I asked people around me about it and they said ""Oh they are just jealous of you"" or ""You're pretty and that's threatening"". I don't feel like I am allowed to believe these things because that's kind of arrogant. 

So I started fucking up my make up on purpose, putting less effort into my appearance, eating more to fit in and not be so ""put together"" and ""threatening"" and it started *kind of* working but only slightly and I still had to quit because the claims I made to my bosses about the bullying weren't being addressed and I feel like even *they* turned on me.

So...what can I do to fix myself so this doesn't happen to me anymore? This hurts. I'm lonely and I want to make friends and being nice to people and minding my own business doesn't even work.

161,"Oh this has been fun. Just looking for general advice. 
I'm in college and I am a week before finals and I work part time. I'm actually a pretty early riser every day, usually up by 9 to go to the gym and bed by 11 or midnight. I have a roommate who was randomly selected so as much as I've explained to her that I get up and go to bed at a certain time, she goes to bed usually at 5am or 6am and gets up at 2.pm. That's fine, we are both quiet and respectful of one another. We get along just fine. 
Heres the problem- she's a deep sleeper, I'm a light sleeper. Usually though if there is any kind of background noise, I manage very well. I put on ambient noises on my phone and am back to sleep at most within an hour. 
So I have a presentation for my 9am class in 5 hours- I forget how much but a huge chunk of my grade. I set my alarm for 6:30 thinking I could shower get dressed eat breakfast and review my presentation for a half hour, run to the library to print, and then run to class. I went to bed at midnight, and I know 6:30 is still early for that but I was in bed by 11:30 and tossed and turned for a bit.
At 2:30 in the morning a door slams  and shes bringing in a guy to idk cuddle with? Make out with? Nothing too racy. But shes been doing this all semester. The past few times its guys I've never met before, which for me is a little strange but its her choices. I 100% am cool with  people hooking up and what not but she never gives me a heads up when someones coming over at all that night because I think she doesn't know either. Then the guy usually is there until 2 in the afternoon for me it's a little awkward because its a shared room. 
But yeah they came in were talking and I dont know why but some noise scared the shit out of me so much its currently 5:01 right now and I flat out can't sleep. My mind is racing I think about the presentation but yet I am so sleepy at the same time, He's also snoring his head off like crazy so I spent three hours with my earbuds in tossing and turning and now I tried to go to sleep on a recliner in the lounge. Nothing. No sleep. 
I know I am going to speak with her later today and that I'm just whining and that we need for communication. We have one more week of finals left, and I wont be in the room on the weekends because I visit my own boyfriend off campus. I'm just gonna ask her if she can not have anyone come in late from Monday- Thursday so I can sleep at least 5 hours a night for finals. Hope thats not too unreasonable.
HOWEVER, I'm not really asking for finals help or help to get to sleep. I'm already wide awake.

I really care for them and they constantly tell me they care for me too, but I just feel like after all this time they still haven't done anything to show me.

176,"So I been seeing my current boyfriend for just over 8 months now, and really hit it off from the start. 8 months on and our feelings are really strong. On our 3rd time of meeting up, we sat down and he told me about one of his ex-boyfriends. 

Turns out this ex was his 1st proper love, and they were together for 4 years. They were really happy untill his ex cheated on him. They broke up after, and that was 2 years ago. The ex went off with the guy he cheated with, and he was alone and couldn’t get over him. 

In September last year, the ex-boyfriend went to a forest near his home, and took his life. No one knows why, as he left notes but the police have them. Of course, this shattered my boyfriend and he really hasn’t got over it. Over the months after, he was in a really dark place. He told me how he couldn’t see why he should carry on. In the end, he got himself a dog and tried dating again. 

The dog turned out to be a good idea as it kept him occupied but the dating didn’t go so well. He had one boyfriend for a few months but he got aggressive, so they ended. He was ready to give up at this point. 

So in April this year, in I step. He now tells me I’ve sort of rebooted his life and made it worthwhile. That he’s extremely happy, and loves me more then anyone. The thing is, he’s told me he still loves this ex and always will too. Can there be room for 2 people in his heart? Even if one is gone. He still gets upset from time to time, and has cried on me a lot. Especially around the anniversary time and what would’ve been his birthday. A few weeks ago, he actually told me why it shattered him so much, as I couldn’t work it out. Turns out that they were actually seeing each other behind the ex-boyfriend ’s boyfriends back (hope that made sense!), before he died. I’m guess the boyfriend thought there’d be a chance of them getting back together. 

So what do I do to help him?
1. How can get him to fully move on? The ex’s family has set up a charity since his death and my boyfriend has since said he will do whatever he can to help. I feel the fact he’s going to be constantly reminded of it is going to be bad for him. Plus I think it’ll come between our time. Or perhaps I’m being jealous/selfish? I don’t know. 
2. He always seems to think I hate him and want to break up with him. I reassure him that, that’s not what I want and he tells me the same. How can I convince him?
3. This probably leads on from 1, but whenever we watch a film or program that contains the subject of suicide, there’s always an atmosphere. A few times he has ran off upset due to it. This is partly why I think the charity work is a bad idea. How can I get him to deal with it? 

Everything has been steady lately but I feel with xmas around the corner, it could kick off with him. Just want to be ready. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post! Any help/advice will be huge appreciated! x

My mother has a bad history in buying snake oils. One time she bought some special water with detoxing effect and when I told her about it she just got mad, so I just shut up when she buys those kind of stuffs. However this time since it is harmful and not only costing a lot I decided to get involved.

She told me that she got it for free from her friend in USA (I and she live in SEA) who used to have Morgellons due to getting a flu-shot since he worked at a medical institute or something (I have searched about it and it is a self-diagnosed illness with no medical proof). He said that it cured him of his illness at his brink of death.

Also my mom's brother is also sold on this. He used to be skeptical about this too and he finally got convinced about it since his wife is in the last trimester of cancer and they are desperate about it. He also have used it on himself and on his wife for 10 days.

What should I do? Based on my past experience I have learned to not be confrontational about it and say that we are both on the same side to make my grandfather as healthy as possible.

It's very small and I work very closely with my manager while I'm being trained. In the past 2.5 weeks, he has gotten more and more critical/micromanaging about my work despite the fact that I'm trying my best to do a good job. It's not like I don't care, I genuinely want to succeed there and help the company reach their goals. But I've gotten to the point where I'm afraid every time I go into work in the mornings... His criticism is bordering on verbal abuse.

Yesterday, for example, he implied that I smelled like pot even though I don't smoke.. He has very clear favoritism and while my coworkers are met with smiles and encouragement, I'm being met with snide remarks that have left me feeling worthless.

If I quit, it looks really really bad. Staying with a company for only a few weeks is a red flag for employers, and if I leave it out of my resume I probably won't get a job until February. Recruiters will also wonder what I did with 7 months of my life after graduation.

To add to that, I'm being kicked out of my apartment on January 1st and was planning on finding a place that's a little bit closer to my new job. If this doesn't end up working out, then I'll be living 30 miles out of my hometown with a slowly dwindling bank account and little chance of finding a promising job in my field.

She refuses to adapt/try new things (suppression of certain aspect of her personality?). The same things have been happening in my family for years because of this. It's a bunch of cycles. Nothing ever goes anywhere.

She refuses to accept responsibility for anything and constantly diverts the focus of conversations and situations to other things in addition to accusing people of their own claims. She refuses to perceive other possibilities when it comes to her hypothesis about other people as well.

She thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants from her kids, because she wants it, and she's their parent.

I flat out tell her what the truth of the matter is, but she refuses to accept it, because she needs to take responsibility in order to do so.

If someone is hurt by her, she'll turn it around to that person hurting her, because she refuses to accept responsibility.

It's as if it hurts her too much to accept responsibility for these actions as if she's failed as a mother/feels like a horrible mother.

My brother is a destructive person because of her, and my sister is spoiled, has self-esteem issues among other issues, and is heavily addicted to social media and her phone because of her.

She's manipulative with conversations in a negative, toxic way.

She chooses to believe what she wants to be true and chooses to not believe what she wants to not be true. Actual truth is irrelevant to what she believes.

I know logic does a poor job of persuading her, and I'm aware I'm dependent on her in three regards. However, she doesn't understand how authority works and wants certain things/doesn't want certain things. Therefore, I know there's a way to fix this.

I have never been particularly close to them and my Dad married when I was in highschool.  I saw them a few times a year while a minor, took a few vacations and did have fun but never really felt like I fit in, more like I was a charity case they were taking care of.  
All of this is complicated by the fact that I know for a fact my Dad is not happy in the marriage and plans to leave when his other two children reach 18.  They mutually live as freinds/roomates but are not in love with each other.  I do not have any interest in maintaning the relationship with his in-laws.

I, naturally, am 100% ready to go call Alex out and beat the shit out of him, but Amanda says that I ""can't let him know that I know""

Alex is super liberal. He hates trump, pro-choice, and incredibly against rape and assult. He even wrote an entire paper (and a few poems I think) on the subject in my social studies class.

Alex is also rather sexually open. He has mentioned doing the do many times and got rather pissed when I mentioned how he probably shouldn't be doing that at 16 (we're all 15-16 btw)

The mailman I'm having issues with has always been a little rude but it's getting out of hand. Last week he delivered a registered letter to my door, the knocking of course caused my 2 miniature dachshunds to bark. I couldn't tell who was at the door from the peep as the mail man was not standing close to the door.  I had to open the door wide to see who it was and my dogs escaped, ran down the hall way to the elevator (wanting to go for a walk) also the UPS guy always give them cookies and takes selfies with them. Mailman started screaming so I tried my best to quickly round up my dogs. I scooped down to pick up my 5 pound puppy and looked up to see a can of pepper spray pointed at us. That was the end of that. 

I called usps to get some info on their policy for use of pepper spray - was told his safety trumps mine...ok?! 

Monday the same mailman refuses to bring up another piece of registered mail so I have to go to the post office, fine no big deal. 

Yesterday I happen to be walking into the hallway from the basement with my 2 dogs right as the mailman was sorting mail. My dogs were not on a leash and walked past him to go the elevator. If you don't have food my dogs aren't interested. He starts screaming that there are leash laws (I'm in the lobby of my building) and pulls out pepper spray and aims it at my dogs) 5 seconds later my boyfriend comes around the corner and the mailman instantly tones it down but it's too late I'm mad and it turns into a yelling match. The postman basically tells me to calls his supervisor if I have a problem and then laughs and says he's supervisor is going to back him up and he can do what he wants. More words/yelling are exchanged until the elevator arrives. I should have not engaged in conversation with him but he seems to have some huge problem with my dogs. The funny thing is if my dogs were on a leash it would have been any different, they would have walked past him just the same. I live in one of the most dog friendly cities in the US. If this guy is genuinely scared of dogs I have no idea how he makes it through his day. 

I'm sure how to articulate this but I feel the postman is baiting me or trying to pick a fight. My boyfriend was pretty shocked at the situation but I'm glad he was able to see first hand this guy threaten to spray my dogs with pepper spray. I know this sounds crazy but I think he is really looking for an opportunity to spray a dog with pepper spray. 

I have no idea how to handle this situation, I try to avoid him but sometimes our paths cross and he delivers our mail between 2-7 so that's a big window to avoid the lobby. Is he overreacting? How do I document these interactions?

Part of the reason we live with them is because they wanted to be involved with our daughters life and insisted on living with us. Plus it was nice having someone who paid half the bills while also being a free babysitter whenever we felt like.

Over the last 6 months my daughter has more than doubles in size. Today she weighed in at 16.7kg (about 37lbs) at 90cm (3'). This is up over 2.5kg since her last vaccination less than 6 weeks ago. They took her and the doctor said she was overweight and told them she shouldn't be eating sugar, cookies, suckers, etc.

My wife then told them (they don't speak English) and her uncle got pissed off about it. 6 weeks later she has gained a bunch of weight and they still give her junk food every day. They say they give it to her because she wants it and will cry. We've both told them this for 6 months that she doesn't need it and I've even taken food away from her that they had just given. 

I've on numerous occasions told them to give dried fruit, it's the same price but far healthier and she still likes it. Yesterday on the way home she was sleeping with a giant lollipop in her mouth still sucking on it. 

My wife messaged me this afternoon telling me what her weight was. I did some research and it made me worried. She's above the high end of sizes for boys her age. Then there is always the possibility of shit like childhood diabetes due to the insane amount of sugar (she eats more sugar in a day than I do...). On the way home her weight came into discussion. I was getting on the heated side but I was still calm and controlled. 

After we got home and talked more, my wife went out to tell her what we had discussed. She basically said ""we will feed her whatever we want"". When she came in and told me this I admittedly lost my temper. I yelled for a good 30 minutes in the room, not at my wife directly but because I was so furious with the situation. 

It made things bad. Her aunt was yapping at my wife because the baby was crying and was blaming her for it. Wife broke down in tears and went into the room. We talked a little bit then she went to their room. 

They got all pissed off, slamming doors, etc. They were pissed because ""it embarrassed them having the whole neighbourhood hear you yelling"". Said it's numerous times now that I've been loud and embarrassed them in public (Thais are all about saving face and try to avoid public outbursts, I on the other hand will show my emotions when I feel like I'm being fucked). 

There had only been one other occasion where I yelled in a situation involving them. I was hit buy a drunk on a scooter causing me to tear my mcl. She stopped them from giving him a breathalyser because I wouldn't get insurance money from him. Well it turned out his insurance was fake anyways and I've been completely fucked financially because of it. Her choice stopped me from at least getting some justice. And it's not even so much that the choice was made, it was the fact that she didn't bother to talk to my wife or I about it. 

Now they are being childish. Because of my accident I have been driving a scooter they had bought for my wife as a gift. Now its apparently not a gift anymore and I can no longer use it. On top of that she called my wife's mom and grandma (who babysit while she works) not to watch the baby anymore. Which is essentially going to stop both of us from working (my wife works with them 3 days per week but I just need to boost my CBR and it'll drive at least). 

What I want to do is get the fuck out of this shit hole of a country and move my wife and kid back to Canada but financially not able to at the moment. The house is definitely going to be a hostile environment for a while.. I don't know what the fuck we are going to do...

I just don't get it, why is it so hard to just follow a simple request? Especially when you can visually see that she is gaining too much weight. I hate having to act like this but it seems like the only way to get the message across. As I told my wife ""I don't want to be an asshole, but if I have to be an asshole for the health of my child then I will. Her health is more important than their happiness"". 

I guess this is more of a rant than advice but could definitely use some of anyone has any. 

Tl;dr live with wife's family in Thailand. Have 18 month old daughter, they keep feeding sugar, chocolate, cookies, chips, etc every day. Have asked numerous times to stop feeding. Today during a discussion they basically said we will feed her whatever we want. This caused me to lose my temper and yell a lot which ""embarrassed them in front of the neighbours"".

222,"I work with a girl who is a painter, she has painted a lovely picture of my daughter on another occasion. For Xmas, I asked her to paint a small picture of my daughters dance teacher and her daughter together. The painting is beautiful, except for the little girls face. Her face is awful, if I saw this as a 7 year old I would probably cry.

223,"So to explain i recently set up a patreon for my writing, i thought why not give it a try the worst i could do is just sting my pride a bit but I’m not sure if my bio is really saying the right thing, my writing tends to fall under the side of melancholy to outright sadness ha but I’m not a super sad person and i want to convey that in my bio, or any other tips for improving it would be helpful. I will paste it below because i would feel dirty by linking it here but if you would like to read my stuff search Aaron Nelson on patreon. 


 Hello all, my name is Aaron, if you have read posts before the bio don't worry i'm fine ha just sometimes I get a little sad and when the feeling builds I bleed it off through my writing. A little about me, Despite what my writing sometimes suggests I love to laugh and make jokes, and listen to music. I am a student working towards a degree and i'm having a tough time working my current 40+ hour a week job and making ends meet. So I came here. Is my writing not catching your eye yet?No. Probably not, or at least I hope its not yet, to explain, my life most certainly could be far worse, but I have experienced things and I let them out with visceral detail. I hit all the classics, my father walking out on my mother, leaving her with no job and two children, my fear and revulsion as I sometimes find, and try to fight, similarities with him. My heart being broken not once but twice by the only girl that I love, truth be told i'm a bit of a glutton for punishment in that respect. Feelings of impermanence and futility especially while working a job that others have made in to a career that I do my best fake smile at being sure to be very polite and witty the whole time my mind races with these little pieces that build and build until they burst forth from me. I guess this is a little bit scary sharing my writing with strangers in exchange for money... Like a prostitute but, instead of using my body I'm just letting you take a ride on my soul. That felt less dirty before I actually typed it out. Any Hoosier if you become a patron you can expect uploads of short pieces of writing, some might call them poems, short vignettes, maybe a limerick or two who knows? I do there shall be no limericks ever. I can only promise you a window in to another person's life. If you continue on this emotional voyeurism feel free to contact me, maybe if I get some traction I can accept little requests and challenges and we can see where my mind might take us. Until that day I guess I'll keep ""selling my soul for a nickel and and dime” as Peter Bradley Adams would say. ",13Dec2017,1
224,"Recently single, still at a loss at whether I should try and get my ex back or move on however, I'm okay with where my current thoughts are and this is not the issue. I had run into my old co-worker the other day and after we talked for a few minutes, decided we needed to hang out as she's also going through a serious break up. So yesterday were texting and she invites me to the club, I say yes right away without giving it a second thought as I am pretty lonely since my ex left. I've made it my personal goal to talk to some girls at least while at the club but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. I'm really hoping to hit it off with at least one person and to start my snowball of social rehab but I have no idea how to go about it. Like what do I say? What do I talk about? I feel extremely uninteresting since my hobbies revolve around gaming, smoking, and computers. How can I reliably express to others that I am a confidant guy?

The only problem is that she'll threaten me with it when I haven't lost any weight and I'm not thinking of suicide. Basically if we have any disagreement she'll threaten to commit me to a psych ward, and let me tell you I do not want to go back there under any circumstances. Like seriously, today she literally dialed them because of the classes I picked for next term, and I had to change them because of this to get her to stop. I find this behaviour disgusting, like I swear to god if someone dies because of my mom using paramedics as thugs I will be so pissed, as well as sad. So is there anyway to get her to stop? Or stop people before they come so they don't waste their time? I really need this to stop because it's fucking ridiculous.",13Dec2017,168
229,"About two months ago I moved out of my parents house and into my own house. I was given the option to live virtually anywhere I wanted, and I chose to live in a really sketchy area to be closer to this person who I was (and still am) madly in love with. It was a horrible idea! I'm young, stupid and overwhelmingly emotional.  

On paper, however, things are going super well. I've got a full time job, I have far more to be thankful for than the average bear, and the person I love loves me back.

Trouble is: 
I feel as though I've made a terrible decision on where to live. Not to mention that, pretty soon, the person I love will go off to college and I'll be left in this town with a dead end job. The relationship itself is starting to feel a little bit like work since we don't have as much time to spend together throughout the week. 

I also know I can work myself up over every little thing and I really oughta just slow down/calm down but I can't help it. I'm overwhelmed and terrified that my mistakes seem pretty much unfixable. I know this isn't true because I've already got plans in mind to better myself and I guess I just have anxiety about it. 

I'm either super stressed out or falling out of love and I really can't tell. I also know that I need to pay attention to the good things while I've got them, because college will inevitably change this person. Nobody stays the same as they were as a teenager. 

As y'all can see, I need some advice. ",13Dec2017,2

233,"So... I'm a junior at a university, and my family has always pushed me towards getting a really good degree (engineering, science of any sort, become a vet or doctor, etc). My eyes had been set on some sort of engineering like bio or environmental engineering, until I recently learned about my passion for web design and development. 
It's frustrating though because the degree I'm looking into is Communications Technology/ New Media. And I think it sounds awesome because it's a mixture of computer science, design, and psychology!!! I think I feel embarrassed though if I get a degree in communications, while my parents have always pushed me to do otherwise. I've started learning HTML and CSS, some photoshop, and I'd like to learn languages like SQL and Java- in order to be a good developer with design skills. So I think I know what I want to do, plus I've already had a communications related internship before it was even required. I know this all sounds ridiculous and I shouldn't care about what other people think of my degree, but it's mostly familial. I just don't know if my parents will be behind a liberal arts degree. 
So that's my rant. Any advice or words of wisdom is appreciated. Should I just get a degree and then go to grad school and become something respectable? Or should I follow this web design burden?

236,"So, for some back story, I have been friends with this girl for almost 20 years. This is not a friendship I want to end. I love her like a sister so it is more of a delicate situation than just an easy, harsh ""don't come here any more."" Our husbands are also friends and probably text and talk more often than we do and I definitely don't want the hubs to offend or piss off his bestie.


We recently moved from a northern state to the south. We have worked very hard and finally bought our dream home on the beach. It is no mansion and if it were not on the beach most people wouldn't think anything of it, but it is ours and we take exceptionally good care to keep it clean and in good condition. 


Since we moved here my friend, we will call her Liz, has come with her husband and 3 kids 5 times, yes FIVE. We have only been in the house for about a year and we are still working on remodeling it but for the first 6 months we basically lived in a construction area. That did not stop or even deter Liz from coming for vacation with her family. The first time it was under the guise of helping us with the remodel. Surprise! They were not helpful at all and set us back two weeks. After that, it was just because they had nothing else to do and wanted to come see us/the beach. The husbands have a good time together going fishing and kayaking and stuff but even the hubs is just exhausted by the time they leave. We both feel like we have to stop our lives to entertain this family and we aren't retired or anything, we still have regular full time jobs and any time we have had off to do some work to the house or take our own vacation, we have had to entertain. 


But that isn't all. When they come, they destroy our house. Not so much the husband but Liz and the 3 boys are pretty much slobs. Everything was brand new in our guest room before the 2nd time they visited. Now everything is stained. There were skittles smashed into brand new bed sheets and several spots on the floor and I have had to just throw away several pillows. Last time they came, I put protectors on the pillows under the cases and on the mattress and those will now need to be replaced before anyone else comes to stay. The carpet has permanent spots and they do not even attempt to pick up their messes. They also don't pay for anything, including food and drink and the 3rd visit, they had to borrow gas money to get home because of some ""issue"" with a bank deposit. 


I would never do this at anyone's home. I would never do this at a hotel. I would really prefer them to not come here or keep it to once a year, but I am pretty sure they are spoiled because they already have informed us of their plans to visit again. I just can't stand that I will just finish cleaning from their previous visit when they show back up and they don't even ask any more, they just inform us. We even had my husband's parents staying with us one time and told Liz we already had company and they came any way. 


I know first instinct is to just tell them to fuck off. But we do love them, I especially love seeing the kids, the late night bottles of wine and fun talks. We enjoy their company, just not so much of it and I really hate that we feel used. I know they couldn't afford to go anywhere if they had to pay for a hotel and food for their vacations but we shouldn't be the ones to have to flip the bill. I probably resent that they don't even seem to bother to try to save. I just have no idea how to handle this, especially because it almost seems unreal or like some bad national lampoon movie.

Did I mention, they stay for up to 2 weeks, their shortest visit was 6 days. Their welcome has severely bet worn out.


For reference tactics we have tried with no success has been 

-having other guests

-Saying we had plans (they still wanted to stay at the house because we allowed my husband's family to do this and so they think it is an option)

-One of us being away for business (they didn't care)

-Saying we were under construction

-Being sick (I was actually sick with a bad cold and strep throat, they didn't care, they all went home and of course got sick, immediately posting on Facebook a thank you for the cold - Haha NO not funny)

-It was a family Holiday

I appreciate any helpful advice to deter them from being here so much. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR Long time friends come to visit from out of town way more than they should, expect us to pay for everything and all while ruining our home. We love them like family, but want to keep it that way, right now they have completely worn out their welcome.",13Dec2017,3

She has the number 1 team in her department (statistically proven) consistently drives progress and results and has never called out sick, although I have tried to have her call out, she denies. 
Now, she has lost out on yet another promotion (4 positions 5 people applied) yet her white counterparts with formal discipline, lower team results all got the position. She feels that it is racism. She pointed out that that since she has been there (5 yrs) not one person of another ethnicity besides white has been promoted. 
Her Hispanic all feel the same way she does. Her boss only makes her get water for her, a white coworker of her’s who goes out after work with management has admitted to her that they do in-fact make fun of the other races outside of the workplace.

240,"6 years ago i met the greatest girl on a stupid mmo game, we always hanged out together and it wasnt long before we started skyping, seeing eachother through webcam and eventually met in person.

She was always the total opposite of me, a very good student and studying at one of the best universities of her country, me on the other hand had to scrape to get my high school diploma and started working minimum wage jobs after that just trying to enjoy life.

She didnt mind what i did, she loved me and i loved her, i still love her, her mom hated me though, she hated the fact that her daughter was dating some low life foreign guy without great education

We had a long distance relationship for 4 years, seeing eachother during holidays but communicating every day, we had our ups and downs and talking online was hard sometimes but as soon as we saw eachother in real life we knew it was worth it. Deep down i know eventually i had to leave her tho

I had been struggling with that for over 2 years (i didnt want her -or anyone- to support me financially and didnt want to just follow her everywhere like a puppy as she was making a career). people in love do the most stupid things tho so instead i went to her country to try and live together, to try and make something work.
I had a hard time adjusting and coudnt find a job there, it was then i fully realized i needed to get my shit together and find my own path, give up the only girl ive ever loved and make some sort of career for myself.

Skip forward 9 ish months and a lot of heartache later and i have landed a very well paying job, am in the best shape ive ever been and i feel like myself again. A day hasnt passed where she didnt cross my mind tho... i have been with other women since then but she is still the only one i want. She wrote me a few days ago, wanted to say hi and talk about how it was snowing... i just talked back a bit and told her i was working.

I'm saving up for something i never thought i'd be able to own at my age, a new mercedes. When i have that i feel like contacting her again just to tease her mom and how she felt about me... what i really want tho is her next to me, i just wanna hold her again and tell her we can make it now.

243,"So I have known this guy since elementary school, and we've been good friends ever since. We helped each other through rough times and we're sort of like brothers to each other. We had a few hiccups during the first years of high school but nothing too major. This year however, I realized that he's grown distant with me. In class (we sit in rows of 4), he sits beside a girl from my elementary school, and another guy from another elementary school he went to. Now that guy who went to another elementary school, they're best friends, and are extremely close with each other. I sit at the edge of them and while we did get along during the year talking with each other, I started realizing that he is completely blocking me out of their conversations. No biggie, I don't go to class to socialize (unless we have group work), though I do feel alone at times. However, the three of them are planning to do events without me, even though us four usually hang out with each other during lunch. Oddly enough, whenever he's not hanging out with his best friend, he does talk with me quite a bit, although that's probably because he has no one else to talk with. I also noticed that he rarely interacts with me whenever we hang out with our group of friends. It has gotten to the point where I am considering in cutting off ties with him, even though my friend group is good friends with him. I feel that my relationship with him is starting to get toxic. Of course, I don't want to do this, because we've been very good friends for a long time, but it bothers me to think that he is just ignoring me. We help each other a lot when it comes to homework and life problems. I'm not sure what I should do in this situation, any help would be greatly appreciated.

247,"So my brother is now 23 and he is still in college trying to obtain his undergrad degree. He started out as Chemical Engineering, but now he is saying he just wants a BA in Chemistry.

My parents are immigrants and have worked extremely hard. They never deny my siblings and I anything, but in return, comes responsibility, respect and promise that we will do our best make good decisions in life. My dad went through chemo 3 years ago, and he is doing a lot better in comparison, but he has aged a lot. My dad makes about 90k a year, he lives in a small ass house in the middle of no where Texas, where his monthly house payment is $300. For the past 4-5 year my dad has been helping us 4 kids get through college. (He hasn't paid full tuition, but he helps when we need it). For example, I moved to San Francisco for a job, and he helped with a deposit. So my dad does his best to help in important matters and I am so grateful for that.

So the deal with my younger brother: He is extremely intelligent, good looking, but he lacks confidence and seems like he isn't self-motivated, disciplined or hard working. My parents have been really proud that he is pursuing a Chemical Engineering degree, because they want him to get  ahead start and live comfortably and independently post graduation. Being able to start at 60-80k, rather than starting at 30-50 k with a liberal arts degree. My brother is smart, and he has the passion for environmental policy issues, but the issue is that he isn't freaking doing anything. Like absolutely nothing.

Let me tell you a little bit more about what I mean. So in the last year, he start the Spring '2017 semester dropping out of a great college, and going to a community college. I supported him and we kept this secret from my dad because we didn't want him to be upset about it. I thought that this might be good for my brother to take some easier general classes, and think a little bit more about what he wanted to do. I honestly don't know what he was doing, but from what I could see he was wayyyy more focused on dating girls, trying to find ""the one"". He was also smoking A LOT OF POT and going out ALOT. 

After one semester, he transfers back to his college, but decides that he is no longer going to be an engineering student.

He doesn't have a job, he isn't doing an internship anywhere, and he wasn't studying and pursuing a degree that will make his like 1- times easier. 

He has a really negative and cynical view that all engineers are one way, and that you are stuck being like them. His perception of the world is extremely cynical and he doesn't take control of his life. It is so frustrating because  in my opinion, how I view life/work is that I see it as that I have everything in front of me, I just find the opportunities that excite me and make moves towards them. You can do anything you want in life. Absolutely anything. 

So basically this is what the issue is: My dad took out a 20k loan to last my brother 2 years of college (pay rent, tuition, etc). My dad did this thinking that my brother is pursuing an Engineering degree, so my dad wanted to help relieve some stress. My brother instead, was at community college, he was buy a lot of weed each week, he was taking girls out on dates (really shitty girls), he was going out to parties and bars. When he went back to his regular University, he dropped engineering and decided to pursue a liberal arts degree. He talks shit about my dad, says my dad doesn't help any of us kids like other parents do. He isn't respectful or caring or understanding that my dad went through serious health issues and now he working so hard to help my brother. 

Today, my dad texted me saying he wants to transfer more money to my brother, and this was a wake up call for me. Like what? Didn't you already give him 20k? It shouldn't be gone by now at all. He hasn't even had the money for 9 months. MOST KIDS DO NOT HAVE PARENTS THAT DO THIS SHIT FOR THEIR 23 YEAR OLD KIDS. 

He is is a privileged  kid, acting like he has hard problems, and not working hard. Yes, I know he has a good heart inside, but I feel like my parents need to cut him off financially for him to grow up. 

What do you think is a good solution?

248,"     So 2 weeks ago I bought a 2010 Honda Civic from a BMW dealership. The price was a bit high, but they assured me the car was in excellent shape and I needed a car desperately. It drove great when I test drive it but as soon as I drove it off the lot I had issues. The brakes were making horrible noises. To their credit they replaced the brake pads. Next, I had a Honda dealer inspect it and they said a wheel bearing needed to be replaced, oil changed, and transmission fluid done. I was getting a bit of hesitation when shifting gears so I though transmission fluid would do the trick. The car ran great after that for 2 days then the hesitation came back along with a horrible grinding noise. I’m within 30 days and 1000 miles of the lemon law, but the car was sold “as is”. I know next to nothing about cars and I’m transferring colleges for the spring semester. BMW isn’t returning my calls and I’m transferring out of state so I need a car soon. I have no idea what to do and need advice.",13Dec2017,2
249,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone can help me out with my situation. I live with my cousins with my mom and little brother. All they ask for is to help with rent. No problem.
 I pay on time for me and my little brother. I've been staying there for a good 4 months now and I get a feeling they don't want us there anymore. We're always in the room so we don't see them alot n they don't get home till 12 or 1 am.
 I hear one of our cousins is having problems with us but my other 2 cousins, one that owns the house and the oldest, are cool with us there as long as we don't bother then too much. So my mom says we should move and get a place but she say it like it's easy. 
She is unemployed, and cant get a job because of her background. I would be the only one working for a long time. I would have to pay the bills, get food, give my brother who is locked up some money. So I'm almost would be left with nothing. I have no car to stay over time at work or else I would. I only have one ride and if I miss that. I have to wait till my other cousins get off which I mentioned before., 12 or 1 am. If it helps I make about 300 each check, but if I worked 12 hours each day, I would roughly get about 500 each check if i had a car. I know this is a long read and I hope someone can help me out. 
Also I'm thinking about talking to them about what's going on and hopefully they could see my side of the story. 
Thanks for anyone that can provide me with advice. I would appreciate it.

255,"Hi reddit, i create an account because i do not know where else to look for advice, so here i am; i'll try to explain everything from the beginning. In advance, i am sorry for my bad grammar and poor writing, English is not my primary language. Well this is my story: i was a twenty years old student of geoscience when i met this girl (I will call her “Amy”, not her real name obviously), she was 2 years my senior, we met because of a math course we were studying together. We instantly were hooked and began meet at my house, she had a boyfriend and a kid with him (she was not married) and they lived together so our relationship was always ""secret""; she told me she only lived with and was with her ""boyfriend"" because her parents forced her. We saw each other for about 3 months until she dropped out of college and returned to her hometown (about 10 hours from our campus). I asked her to begin a distance relationship with me and i were utterly rejected (she say she never wanted to have any serious relationship with me), she left, and i was in a depression for about six months (later i found out that while she was dating me she was seeing other people).


Months later I was getting over her and my depression when she started talking to me via Facebook, she obviously wanted to have something but at that moment, i was dating an old acquaintance from primary school (I will call her “Amanda”) so I rejected Amy advances. I began a relationship with this old acquaintance but never truly forget about Amy, so Amanda and I were a couple for 4 years until we break up because of the distance (I ended working in the hometown of Amy) and because she wanted to live together and I wasn’t ready. In these 4 years, I saw Amy like two times (nothing-serious just small talk) and when I break up with Amanda, I immediately looked for Amy. Many things changed in those 4 years, she had another kid (same father), still not married, and long story short we began dating (I know it was foolish start something with her without before settled myself with the previous break up). My god that was one hell of a ride (in the bad way), so Amy and I dated for like 8 months, I knew her parents, her kids, her friends, we never were a couple “formally”; but it was very difficult, she had a ton of problems, stalker ex-boyfriends, mood changes in a span of hours, the total opposite of Amanda. Months later Amanda and I started to talk, nothing serious just small talk and I think that helped me to see all the problems I was having with Amy. Therefore, I break up with Amy but we still talk, same story with Amanda. 


Nowadays I can talk to the two of them and this is what I think about each one (Pros and cons):
Amy:


Pros


•	Great sex (I don’t know if the fact that she was my first affect this)


•	Great Chemistry


•	Don’t take herself too seriously


•	It’s a good person


•	Laugh a lot with her


•	Support me


•	Isn’t not a distance relationship



Cons


•	Emotionally unstable


•	Doesn’t like to work or put effort into nothing (she depends economically on her parents)


•	Never ends what she starts


•	We don’t share many “values”



Amanda:


Pros


•	The most charitable and gentile person I know


•	Love the animals


•	Is a hard working woman who do things to get what she wants


•	It’s very intelligent


•	Many similar hobbies and interest with me


•	Family woman


•	I was his “first”


•	She is the only woman I have been considering to be my future wife


Cons


•	Very hard to get into her in an emotional level 


•	Sex life need to be polished


•	Can be hard as stone


•	It will be a distance relationship (at least for a time).



So that is my story, love both of them albeit in different ways, I think I have an 80% of success rate if I decide to go for Amy and a 50% if I decide to go for Amanda. I do not know what to do, it is driving me crazy, I been living in this emotional hellhole for months. 



I want to apologize to you if the way I told my story made me look like an egotistical asshole or jerk I just wanted to tell my story in a subjective and honest way (that’s the reason why I wrote the pros and cons part). I do not want neither of them to get hurt and obviously, I do not want to keep this situation going on for more time. (Also sorry for any errors in my redaction).
Thank you for your advice and for reading me.

257,"Hi everyone. This morning, my dad went through my messages on my MacBook and found out that I've been sleeping with this guy. For context, I'm 21F, in college right now. I'm an ITS (information technology and systems) major. My parents are VERY conservative. They don't believe in sex before marriage. My father basically gave me an ultimatum; live at home by our rules or move out. Their rules from this point forward will probably be no car, no being home alone, and no hanging out with anybody, period. They caught me with weed once, and since then, I've really been on lock down. It's about to get a whole lot worse. 

I have a full scholarship, so my parents don't pay tuition. I will also be getting a $1000 stipend in the beginning of January. 

Should I move out? I found a place to stay; rent is around $300 to share a bedroom in a 2BHK. Am I the one that's being unreasonable? Sorry if this seems like I'm rambling, I'm in full panic mode right now, I have no idea what to do. ",13Dec2017,2

I have great grades in nearly every subject, so my parents tell me I could do just about anything I want to, but I love music.  I've looked into that industry and composing sounds fun, but unless I get lucky I don't feel like I could make a great living.  

I don't want wads of cash to live like a king or to own the nicest car on the block.  But I would love to have a family (down the road) and that means I would need a decent salary, right?

Though I don't have much blue-collary type experience, working on tanks and shit would be freakin amazing.  I also live fairly close to Fort Carson so that's not out of the question.

Does anybody know how easy it would be to land a job doing just that?  I also feel like I'd disappoint my parents throwing away all their years of education investment (I'm homeschooled) if I didn't go to school and make the most of my smart brain.

I can't decide on which is going to be better for me, my cumulative GPA is 3.3 and I'm ranked 102 out of 360 right now. I've been talking to an army recruiter and already did the ASVAB, I got a high score and should be able to get a good computer job. If I were to go with the college route I would try to get a computer science degree. I'm in an AP computer science class right now and have been enjoying it a lot, so I'm thinking of going down that career path. Also, I've been playing around with the idea of trying some art related job, possibly for game design, just as a side thing though not as a main income. I just don't know what would be better to do, for army the pros are

* Free Dental, so I can have ""perfect"" teeth.

* I'd have more pay probably.

* Experience in a possible job.

* College would be payed for.

* I could go to any college.

But, the pros for going to college are

* I would be going to the same one as most of my friends.

* I should be able to get a lot of the price down from FAFSA and other need based scholarships from the college directly.

* I would be able to grow my hair out, which the only reason I cut it was because I started thinking I would go with the army (probably doesn't seem important, but I really do miss it and was happier with it).

* I have a close friend that offered me a graphic design job, I have class experience with that.

* If I ended up with a programming job the debt might not be a big issue.

* One of the bigger reasons I first wanted to go military was because I had no idea what I wanted to do, but now I have an idea of what I want.

* I would have more freedom this way.

So, I just don't know what I should do, I have people suggesting to go with both side. Any opinions on this would be appreciated.

I don't have much experience with major failures, so this is all new to me...I'm currently majoring in computer science and math taking a bunch of classes, working full time and trying to do a capital raise so I can get an equity position in this startup. 

I messed up big time. I am not apt at managing my stress nor communicating it and I destroyed my relationship with a lady, whom I've committed to for almost two years. I interpreted her actions (being vague here on purpose)  as a stressor and didn't communicate what I needed from her effectively, I thought she understood. This occurred for three months. I felt like she was the cause of my stress because whenever I had free time, I was with her. I did not allow myself to have the proper emotional space to handle myself.

I ended up breaking up with her after being convinced that she was only a source of stress and that her actions that were causing turmoil for both of us would persist indefinitely (usually, we usually resolve these things). I realized shortly after a few days that it was me and that I did not know how to take care of myself and handled the whole situation without a holistic perspective.

I reached out to her and scheduled some time to talk and give her a more in-depth understanding of the events that led up to our breakup. She was (is) hurt and so was (am) I. I broke under a stress build up that I've yet to experience and I'm learning how to navigate it, at the cost of our relationship. I attempted to salvage it but it was a futile attempt...she's moving on.

Overall, our relationship was extremely healthy and I'm content that she is doing what's best herself. I learned a lot about myself and what values I deem important in a person. Along with that, I learned what I need to work on.

It's week three and I feel like I'm on autopilot, navigating through each day without much thought. I've passed all of finals, have been performing a lot better in work, and I'm close to reaching my goal for the capital raise but I feel pretty indifferent and I'm lost questioning my values and why I made the decisions I made...I know that if I knew how to cope with those failures and stresses, I would not have gone down this path, but I have...so, how do you:

274,"Last week, the vacant apartment about my boyfriend and I flooded for several hours. I came home to see water dripping from a hanging(and connected to the ceiling) pony wall where the water was dripping from the bottom. Maintenance abruptly came and said they fixed the issue. One week later, last night we come home to a massive leak. By the grace of God or our sheer laziness our crock pot had been sitting in that right spot, empty and happily collecting this water. We were gone for approximately two hours, and this relatively large crock pot was nearly full of disgusting water. 

Okay, so this is about 930 PM, maintenance is upstairs attempting to resolve the issue so we can stop the leaking. He then says to us ""he turned off the water last week, when they did an inspection of the unit above yesterday someone must have turned on the water. This caused the same (but worse) flooding to occur in that kitchen again). So he didn't fix it the first time, who knows if they fixed it now. The wall in our apartment is severely damaged, the entire lining of the base is cracked, and definitely still not dry.

It's difficult to offer advice or to point out something she's doing wrong if she refuses to acknowledge it in the first place. This happens all the time but here are some examples I can remember from the top of my head.

Example 1. I see her mashing potatoes with an egg beater. Offer her a hand and tell her to buy a potato masher or to use a fork. Then I say she's ruining my egg beater. Gets pissed and continues to ruin my egg beater, which I use for baking or whisking. I ended up throwing it in the trash the next day cause it was so fucking mangled.

Example 2. Tell her I'm going to hem a gown of mine that is too long because I am constantly stepping and tripping over it. She says it's pretty but not to hem it because ""that's how it's supposed to look like."" Gives me an example of how Cinderella has a long gown that droops on the floor like that. (Cinderella's dress just barely brushes the floor, so, terrible example.) I tell her I will trip over it and ruin it. She tells me not to hem it and to listen to her because ""she is teaching me the right thing,"" and that she has more experience than me in fashion because she is older. 

Example 3. We have a set of knives in our kitchen that is so dull, I nearly cut my fingers with one of them but ended up unharmed because the knife barely made a scratch. I mean good for me but I need to be able to cut onions without it slipping cause our knives can hardly land a dent on the thing. It's almost Christmas so I ask her if she could maybe ask one of her friends to get us a better knife set cause ours aren't working anymore. She gets tense, says no, we have a knife sharpener - I tell her it doesn't work: it's a rusted, steel tool made for *honing* rather than sharpening. Refuses to acknowledge me, says I'm not doing it right, and proceeds to tell me she is older and is ""teaching me the right thing."" I walk out and cool down. Just happened thirty minutes ago.

Call me Joe. 


I grew up in the Midwest and am currently 24 turning 25 in June. 


My parents divorced when I was 14 and lost everything. Included with the divorce is an estrangement with my father that is still current.


Grades tanked when I went from private to public high school.


Delved deep into heroin by 17 and used IV from 17.5 to 19. (This February will be 4 years clean. This past part of my life is completely over. My emotional and mental health is stable for the most part) no HepC- no HIV- and no health defects from using. Thank God by the way.


During this sobriety - I worked as a case manager and a facility for addicts for 2 years and with that held a CDCA-II (OH credential) for roughly 3 years.


I am back in college (community) and am essentially almost done with an Associates.


Here is where I need advice- and the reason why I an reaching out. I have never felt this good - let alone progressed in my entire life. It is almost as if I am literally closing a book and beginning to rewrite my entire history and this time for the better. My family has their issues but at this point I realize that they must deal with their issues themselves and I do not have to stoop to their level of nonsense at all anymore.

I am afraid. I don't know exactly where I will work - nor where I will be living next year but I figure someone out here must have been in a similar spot. I'm scared that I am going to drop the ball at the end of the day and I worked diligently and harder than most have had to strictly because I decided to be am idiot when I was younger. I am so close to something- right? Like - this pressure and perservearance that I am putting in *will* be worth it right? Anyone? If it is relevant - my long term goal is to finish a BA by 30 and make a minimum of 50k a year. Am I doing this right ??


Thank you for reading. If you respond I'll be sure to read ANY ideas or advice. Much love Reddit...

281,"I was surfing the comments section on a CNN story and saw something I've seen too damn much of lately, a Trump supporter threatening to kill journalists.  Not a veiled threat even, he said it all flat out.

He deleted his comment, but not before I got a screen capture and his profile also shows his home town.

What would you do?  If it was directed at me I'd be on the phone with the FBI right now. I also thought about posting the screen captures somewhere.",13Dec2017,2
283,"I'm African American and I have a White American acquaintance that I've known for roughly 10 years.
We follow each other on Facebook and SnapChat, but I haven't seen this person in several years. 

My acquaintance usually posts pics of the kids and pets, but today decided to share a video on Snap of the kids dancing and singing to a rap song where the N-word could be heard clearly multiple times. 

My first thought was why is this person letting their toddlers listen to something so offensive. My next thought was does person realize they have black friends that might be offended? Honestly, if I were listening to a song that had the C-word or other racial ly offensive words, I would NEVER record and share. 

I'm considering cutting communications with my acquaintance because of this. I would never film my children or spouse singing racial/sexual epithets.

284,"This may seem like an everyday dilemma that everyone goes through but some explanation might show its unique nature. It's 4:37 am currently and I haven't slept yet. I need to wake up early tomorrow, to me that is 10:00 am, because of the crazy amount of things that I have to do tomorrow.

So starting from why I have to wake up early tomorrow, I have to pick up my girlfriend at the airport at 8 pm. It takes around 2 hours to get there so I should leave my house at 6 pm. Now, things would be so fucking simple if I just had to wake up before 5 pm, wash up, eat something and leave at 6. It turns out that my glasses just HAD TO BREAK TODAY (yesterday technically) and so I have to get new pair of glasses before I leave to the airport. Also, my girlfriend enjoys flowers so I would love to give her some sex organs of plant, which means I have to buy flowers before I leave. 

This wouldn't be so much trouble if I were to be like a normal person with a normal sleeping schedule. BUT, I'm not, hence this post. I sleep a lot, like 14 hours if I'm tired a lot. I was diagnosed Excessive Sleepiness Disorder and take medication for it. Furthermore, I've always had troubles with keeping time, mainly due to my disorder. I literally take a nap and miss my date. Once I kept my girlfriend waiting for half an hour before she left because I was taking a nap for 20 minutes, that went on for 4 hours. (she's awesome because we're still together after numerous accounts of me doing this) Now she just doesn't leave before I confirm that I'm awake. Anyways, getting back on track, I worry that if I sleep now, I won't be able to make it to flowers, glasses then airport on time.

Most of you who are still reading are thinking, wow, why not sleep 6 hours and do your shit. I can't. As an anecdote, which happened today, I slept till 3:30 pm and last night I went to bed at midnight. Again with the near 14 hours of sleep. So today I tried to go to bed by 1 am ATLEAST and I set 2 alarms, spaced 10 minutes apart. But I failed and by 2 am, I recalled my girlfriend suggesting that I watch ""The Big Bang Theory."" I stopped watching at season 8 and now I'm on episode 7 of season 9.

If this was last week, I would've just stayed up all night gaming, I play Paladins (rip) and Rainbow 6. But my chair HAD TO FUCKING BREAK and now it's like I'm on a rocking chair. I'm getting nauseated just by sitting on it, let alone play a FPS game.

Staying up all night isn't a big problem if I just take my medication but I do feel like shit the whole day and I fear that I'll just fall asleep and miss everything. I guess my mind is already made up but if this kinda thing happens again, what should I do?

If anyone is doubtful about this whole story, I'm willing to post pics if deemed fit.

tl;dr I've always had a shit sleeping schedule and the sun's about to rise but I have to wake at around 10 am to pick up my girlfriend and get her gifts. I'm just gonna stay up probably but what should I do next time?",13Dec2017,2

297,"Kind of a weird question but I am curious if anyone has ever dealt with this and can offer insight.

Currently in therapy, and the big issue I'm dealing with at the moment is really poor self-esteem/self-image. Something that comes up a lot is the feeling that I really shouldn't feel good about myself, because I don't deserve to. I have a lot of faults, and if I feel good about myself, it strikes me as self-enabling.

I carry around a lot of self-loathing. One of the issues that accompanies this is a weird kind of self-righteousness about it: that I should hate myself because I *deserve* to. My therapist asked me why this might be, where I got that attitude from, what feeds it, etc. I honestly have no idea. I mean I rationally understand that I treat myself better and engage in healthier behaviors when I feel like I deserve to be treated well (that is, when I have those brief moments of high self-esteem); yet I still struggle with the nagging attitude that these brief moments are delusional attempts to justify bad behavior, that I'm not being real with myself, that I'm being way too nice to myself. That nagging attitude quickly spirals into self-loathing, which tends to devolve into the bad behaviors that I'd like to stop engaging in, which feeds the self-loathing, and on and on the cycle goes.

Where the hell does this self-righteousness-that-feeds-self-loathing attitude come from? I'd love to know, because I feel like it's really holding me back from being able to live a happy, healthy life. I can't help but feel that it's an attitude I witness a lot here on reddit (seems I come across the ""shaming people for their bad habits makes them stop engaging in those bad habits so we should shame people for their bad habits"" attitudes a lot, despite there being a growing body of evidence to the contrary), but I'm worried that I'm just projecting.

I never ""followed"" him on Instagram (his main social media platform), but unfortunately his account was private prior to his passing. Due to this, I am unable to look through his pictures when experiencing days where I miss him the most.

I have since contacted Instagram, through their email support, begging them to accept my ""follow request"" as I am a member of his immediate family. While this did change his Instagram profile into a ""memorial page"" to avoid Instagram deleting the account altogether, they have told me that I am not able to follow him due to privacy policies. 

Below is one of the many conversations I had with multiple team members whom all had varying email addresses. This means that I never spoke to the same person more than once...

The Instagram Team (info+jfcgzmsr.aeaqc54b5atj4@support.instagram.com):

I have no idea how to get them to budge with this, or how to even cope with the thought of being cut out of his life entirely because of a mistake that I made while he was still alive. 
I understand that I can look at my other family member's phones, and unfortunately the brother we lost had his phone destroyed in the accident so we have no way of accessing his accounts, but I regret not wanting to intrude on that part of his life.
If he were here, he would be livid that Instagram hasn't helped. We were extremely close and almost identical people, which is why I can't seem to let this go.

I was kinda taken by surprise and said no, because we can financially do it if it happened (we are using two forms of birth control so it’s like .01% of anything happening). He was really upset by that answer and said he would leave me if I got pregnant before then and it kinda stung. Am I overreacting by being a little upset?

302,"Hi everybody,  
I've come here for some help about my situation, because I really don't know how to deal with what is happening to me right now.  

Basically, I had to do an academic exchange for my school in order to get my diploma. I chose to study in Spain despite my mediocre spanish level (I had the minimum requested by the host academy, no more).  
Since my arrival in Spain, I have been facing many problems: the place where I'm sleeping is way farther from school than what was advertised (It takes me more than 1 hour and a half to go to school when it was advertised that it would take me 20min). But more importantly, I can't understand a single thing when I'm in class: people are talking way too fast and my spanish level is just not good enough.  
My daily routine is basically reduced to this: get up, go for 1 hour in public transports and a 30min walk to go to class, sit down and try to understand a few bits here and there without much success and go back home. I'm the only one speaking english here so I don't have many friends to talk with unfortunately.   
It has led me to feeling really lonely and a bit depressed. I stopped going to class as I was feeling really unwell, and was solely planning to go to my finals in january. I know it isn't the best thing I could do but I wasn't clearly thinking at the time.  
The problem is that I've been asked by the school to attend a meeting next week; to sum up with them how my academic exchange has been going, how I dealt with my exams (mid-semester exams where I didn't go...)etc. I have absolutely no idea about how to deal with this meeting: should I go there and be completely honnest with them? Or should I try to invent a little story and act like it's no big deal?

It all started randomly a few days ago when I had started thinking of him then I had a nightmare about him, in my dream he was trying to kill me and I woke up feeling overwhelmed with sadness.

It’s been almost 5 years since we ended things; we were together for 3 years, I even moved 10 hours away from my home to be with him. But our relationship was nothing but torture for me in hindsight and he hurt me more times than I can even count. Constantly betraying me, leaving me and then coming back just because he knew he could because I was so pathetically in love with him.

I’m happy and in love with the man I am with today, and we even just found out we’re expecting a baby. I just don’t know what to make of my recent thoughts.. I don’t understand why I even care anymore about the way things went with him and I.

314,"Here’s my dilemma:

I’m a high school student, so between school from 7-2, homework, family life, extracurriculars, sleep, etc. I have very little time to work out. The best time I’ve found so far is the time right after school (around 3) where I don’t feel particularly motivated to do homework, so I usually do a run/home gym combo for about 30 minutes - not a super heavy workout, but enough to get a sweat going. After sweating, my body has a bit of sweat and my hairline definitely is a little sweaty as well. Here are the facts:

- I have very thick hair and even on first-day hair it’s a bit greasy looking post-workout; washing it would certainly make it look more presentable.
- I am an avid night showerer. I love to relax right before bed with a nice warm shower and really would prefer not to take that out of my routine. My hair also takes a while to dry and I don’t like to go to school in the morning with wet hair. 
- I know that washing your hair too often is bad for it, and I don’t want to mistreat my hair :)
- I also know that sitting in your sweat is not good for your skin, so I generally try to wash my body right after working out.
- I would prefer not to walk around with wet hair for the rest of the day (if I washed my hair post-workout, I’d be showering around 4:00).
- I’d be willing to shower multiple times in a day - of course I’d prefer not to, as it takes away precious sleep time (any other students relate? lol) but if it works it works.
- I’ve heard that exercising before bed is generally a bad idea - it gets your endorphins going right as you’re trying to slow down. 

I know this is a lot, but these are essentially the pros and cons of my situation from my perspective. How do you think I should schedule my time so that I can have clean hair, a clean body, time, and meet all of my other “requirements”?

315,"I will try to make this as short as possible- My SO and I moved into an upstairs apartment in the summer. The apartments are all fully carpeted except the bathroom and kitchen. We are both very considerate of our neighbors and never even have company out of respect for our neighbors. We keep the TV low after 10 and never walk with shoes in the house. I usually come home from work and do my grad work on the couch all night... so I barely move around.

When we moved in, the woman downstairs blasted her TV all of the time and music too (loud bass). We reported it after dealing with it for weeks. She was sent a warning letter and we received the copy. That seemed to die down a bit but she started slamming doors, cabinets, her toilet seat, and stomping everywhere in the apartment. Am I the only one who doesn't feel you are supposed to hear someone walk on the first floor?

One morning she blasted her TV SO loud that it shook the floors.... and it went on past a half hour. I wanted to avoid reporting her so I tried to be polite and go to her in person. She was EXTREMELY aggressive and ""in my face"" about the whole thing. Her response was that she could hear us walking around all night and day- well yes, how else do we get around in the apartment? I told her I hear her too, all of the time, so I do not understand the issue. She snapped at me and I just told her that this type of interaction was not for me (because I am not a child and wanted to come to an adult agreement and make peace). I documented it and wrote to the supervisor. That proved to be no help. They just want us to call maintenance when these issues arise.

Move forward a few weeks and shes at it again. She went on a tangent the one day from late afternoon to late evening-sounded like she was jumping off furniture, running around in the apartment, started vacuuming at 9 30 PM.... slams her toilet seat down and doesn't even use the bathroom (we can hear it when she flushes). I pretty much got no sleep. The next morning I sent a letter to the supervisor again and told her I recorded the time with the vacuuming. She said the girl complained too and said we woke her up at 2 am. We were both asleep. Basically the supervisor wasn't happy with either of us. 

So she was quiet for a week and as of 3 days ago has done nothing but slammed doors, started chores at 9 PM to make as much noise as possible, and then randomly run around loudly after 11 or after 12. Here is the problem-she is clearly doing this to get us to react so she can record it and report us (we won't do anything though). We have to call maintenance to come listen to it and report it. If maintenance shows up she will hear them come in and she will stop what she is doing. Can someone please tell us what we can do to make sure this is addressed and it is taken care of?",13Dec2017,3

Almost immediately they asked for him to take all these test. They had him take a ultra sound, draw blood, and take a urine test. None of this is what upsets me though. I have no problem with them being through, i'm glad they are. But just a few hours ago, my father got a call from the hospital. Telling him that they've found a ""growth"" in his stomach. And told us to come back down immediately. I didn't take the phone call, my dad did. so, i don't know the details. but from what i can gather, she was strongly hinting at the possibility of cancer. 

Needless to say, my mother was panicked, and crying. Me, and my dad were holding back tears as well. And we actually lied to my brother so he wouldn't worry- he's only 11. So, we go to the ER. Have more tests done, have more doctors tell us what will happen if it is cancer. I.E. travel to the other side of the state to get further test, possibly having my 11 year old brother stay at a hospital nearly 3 hours away, ect. So, at this point my brother already knows what's going down. and he's holding back tears now. Which literally breaks my heart. After all of this, we finally get to speak with the doctor who had been evaluating his tests. And he tells us there's nothing of serious issue right now. Flat out telling us there is no growth present to point towards cancer. Basically telling us that call was probably complete bullshit. We're still going to travel to a specialist tomorrow per the doctor's recommendation. (Which is about a 6 hour round trip.)

But i can't help but feel slightly pissed off that we received a call like that. It was all completely unprofessional, and thoughtless. I'm not saying she shouldn't have called us. But, maybe she should have figured that hinting towards the possibility of cancer- wasn't a great thing to do...",13Dec2017,2

334,"Edit: Looking at my post again, the title may be a bit overly dramatic...

I honestly don't know how to write this out. I feel like there's a lot of background info that plays into my current situation, but maybe that's not necessary for these purposes. I'll try and keep this post to the point, but if more info is needed then I can provide that.
  
First off I'd like to acknowledge that I've lived a pretty fortunate middle-class life compared to others I know, but I have almost certainly wasted most of the opportunities I have been afforded.

I'm currently 28, living in Texas with my mom and step-dad, unemployed and attending university. I quit my full-time job over the summer so that I could go back to school and finish my bachelor's degree, which I need about 30 credits to complete. I have used up all ""free"" financial aid available to me so my tuition and other expenses have been coming out of the little savings that I had (now depleted). I have thus far avoided taking out any loans.
  
The semester is ending this week, and it's been a pretty shitty semester, solely attributed my laziness, lack of focus and drive to succeed in my classes. Most likely I will be placed on academic suspension, meaning I would need sit out a semester and have to re-apply for admissions to my university next fall. 

Earlier this week I received a text from my old boss who offered me a job as their assistant at a new company. I declined their offer yesterday but that was before I learned that I may be suspended, so now I am debating whether or not to accept it. That's if it's not too late.

If I'm suspended then I have no idea how I would spend the next 7 months, given that I won't be able to take any classes. So I am thinking that I should reach out to my old boss, but I'm also worried that if I accept the job then I may never go back to school and finish my degree. And I need my degree in order to move up in the career field I want.

I don't know what to do, and I'm seriously stressing and panicking.",13Dec2017,2
335,"Here’s the deal, I have a Bachelors of Science in Biology which I got in 2015. I had to take out student loans which had terrible interest rates (I was young, dumb, and had no financial guidance). Right now I am considering going back and getting a BSN though an accelerated program through a local hospital. It is a 12 month program which is paid for through the hospital as long as I sign a contract to work for them for 2 years as a Nurse afterwards. Which is great, 

Heres my issue. 

During the time I’m in the program I would only be able to work part time. (Advice from current people in the program and advisors), which would force me to defer my current student loan payments. Is it worth the risk? Idk if I could afford to pay just  the interest of the current student loans, rent, and stuff like car insurance/ medical. 



Summery: is it financially smart to enter a 1 year BSN program and defer current student loans?

337,"Hey redditors, unusual situation here. I live in a share house with my boyfriend and two other guys that we know. As with any roomie situation, its not perfect, however this time we feel a line has been crossed and just chasing some other opinions before we take it further.

One of the roommates (lets call him Jack) is heading back to stay at his parents for 6 weeks over christmas. He is a uni student, and money is sometimes tight for him. However, rather than just pay his rent for those six weeks, he put an ad up online for someone to stay in his room (and live with us) for just six weeks. This might've been ok if he'd vetted the applicants, but he just accepted the first person who emailed him. 

Two days later I come home to find a very high, very strange couple in my kitchen. Jack never even met the guy, just told him where the spare key was and left before the new guy got here. Now I'm left living in a house with a complete stranger, and my gut tells me I shouldn't ever put myself in the house alone with him. 

Jack is also very selfish, and won't listen to others opinions/feelings unless it directly benefits him, so I'm not sure where to go from here.

338,"Hey,


I don't really know how to phrase my question as I don't even really know how I should tackle this altogether. To begin with, I started my third year of electrical engineering at university, and my grades are getting worse and worse all because of me. I have for years been depressed (and I have developed an inferiority complex as well, even though I was born in the same country I do look quite foreign though of course I'm not implying that this is the only reason. And yes, I do know about therapy but it's firstly expensive. Secondly, I first want to try it myself.  I  firmly believe that only I can make a real difference here). I managed the first two years of university even though I also had a surgery which had forced me to work extra hard so I would not get kicked out of university. However, I'm tired of depression and this anxiety holding be back. I have lost motivation to study and my work ethic is completely out the window, I am a complete mess and want to reorganize my life again. I'm sorry if my problem is not clear and if this is not in the right sub because I will delete it right away then, but I hope some of you are able to give me some advice what to do. 


Thank you for reading ",13Dec2017,2
340,"Hey
Not really sure who to open to on this so thought I would come here. Im going to make this short as I can but basically I've had the same group of friends since I was 14  and we literally have done everything together. Theres a group of about 4 of us and lately I can't help but feel like we're all slowly becoming more and more distant but understand how close we've been for so long that no one has said nothing. This last while my phones never been buzzing to go do stuff with them or when Im with them in person I feel like Im holding them back from talking about what they really want to talk about. Conversations just feel so dead compared to the old days, I've really felt this shift this past few days. I went to meet up with them and it was almost a struggle to speak to them even though we've known each other for years. They're apart of whatsapp group chats without me and Im seeing them do stuff all the time. I dont wanna confront them about it or talk it out. Im moving country now at the end of this month for a year internship but I fail to see why this would occur as a knock on effect. Im really bad with putting this into words. Basically Im feeling like Im losing some of my best and genuine friends for a long time now and just wondering if anyone has similar experience?

341,"I am at a cross roads with this. My fiancé and I have been engaged since 2014 and together for over 10 years. We have been putting off setting a date since we couldn't agree on how to get married. For example, ceremony vs. courthouse. We have also put getting married on the back burner due to purchasing and renovating a house and suffering some personal tragedies. My fiancé has a mental health issue that needs on-going treatment. (For both of us to keep some sort of sanity). His employer stopped providing healthcare years ago and he has been getting coverage through Obamacare. Well, the rates for 2018 are ridiculous and he only qualifies for $25/mo subsidy. I now feel pressure to marry him in order for him to have access to the healthcare he needs. 
I was raised in a very traditional household and getting married in a courthouse was never what I had pictured for myself. Plus given the short notice, my parents (whom I have a close relationship with) will not be able to attend. Am I being petty? Do you see any other options?

343,"Background: I'm a 21f college senior. I worked at a research lab during the this past summer and at the end the head of the program said he liked my work and final presentation and would be willing to have me back during the year, and I checked with my two mentors and they said that would be good too. I couldn't the following semester because my schedule was too full with classes, but I asked if it'd be possible for me to contact them for the spring semester and maybe go back then. They said yes.

I know now that I would probably be able to fit it into my schedule, but when I emailed the head of my research lab he didn't reply. I also sent a follow up saying like ""just checking that this did send"", but still no reply. Should I contact the program head? Or maybe my other mentor? It just seems odd to me that I would get ignored when they were so open to the idea of me returning at the end of summer. I'm really hoping to go back both because I really liked the project and because it would be a great option or gateway for a job during the gap year I'm going too take before grad school.

Just looking for general advice on how to handle a situation like this, how to be polite and not come off as desperate (even though I kinda am). Did I go wrong somewhere? Should I have kept in better contact in between the summer and now? Thanks in advance.",13Dec2017,2

My partner is Latvian and we are flying to Latvia to spend Christmas with her family - it's the first time I and our son (9 months) will meet his family.

It's a Latvian tradition for each family unit within the extended family to perform a 5 minute bit on Christmas Eve. The catch is most of them do not speak English and I do not speak Latvian. We don't have time or money for any costumes or anything overly fancy and we are having trouble coming up with something to do. Neither of us have any particular talents like juggling or what not....

346,"So I’ll start off by saying I’m hoping this is right place to post this. 

So as the title states, the previous homeowners have clearly not updated their mailing address 5 months after selling the house to my boyfriend and I. We constantly get mail for them, packages, official letters, and even more recently Christmas cards f their friends. I’ve reached out to the post office once already to ask them to stop delivering their mail to my house but to no avail. I constantly put their mail back in with return to sender on it.

Does anyone have any other advice or something I could try to get this to stop?

Thanks!

Edit: I have tried to contact them through our realtors to give them a package that was clearly for work (we had a hooligan kid opening up packages to steal stuff and a kind neighbor put it back on our doorstep thinking it was ours) their solution was to just give it back to the post office.

I recently met this girl and from the moment I had my first conversation with her I had this inside feeling that we were meant to cross paths. 

I know this sounds awful, but I can not stop thinking of her and it’s driving me insane. I would love to be with her, but I’d rather her be happy, and if that means life without me then that’s fine. 

Basically the gist of the situation is I chatted with this person a few times over the course of a month and then we ended up meeting to talk more. 

It’s not that far into things but I asked how they viewed this and they see it as hanging out and not dating. 

They want to be friends and do so for a few months before calling it dating if it even comes to that. 

I’m choked up and think I’ve already ruined it asking them how they felt, but I want to still try and see if it’s possible.

352,"Hello, I'm going to make a long story really short. My boyfriend and I broke up for the final time because he just valued his friends more than me. The rest of his friends were fine with me but there was one that did not like me because he thought I was too emotional, so he basically straight up ignored me. He is also very rude to other people in general and I speak from an unbiased view point, several people I know don't like him. 
My boyfriend chose his friends over me, they're all rooming together at the college which they and I are going to. After many painful months full of tears, I said no contact forever. He wanted to stay close friends but I don't. I can't stay with someone that chose an awful person over someone that would've dropped everything to be with said person. I ended up isolating myself from my friends but am slowly getting closer but I won't have anyone when I get to college. It's a state public unviersity so I feel like everyone that goes there will know each other already. I feel so jealous and lonely.
