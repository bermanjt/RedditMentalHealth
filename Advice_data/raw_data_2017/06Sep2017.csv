I live with my dad who is emotionally, verbally and physically abusive and because of it i have a plethora of issues, and i want to get the hell out of here. I realize that its smarter to wait until im a legal adult and plan on moving out. The problem is that i doubt i can find a job that can support me. I dont want to burden my friends or their parents by living with them either. Is there a place by any chance that can help support teens in my situation?",06Sep2017,11
1,"I'm 23 years old and an electrical engineer I'm currently in a job that I'm finding really boring. I've been researching for about 2 months about moving to a different country, I don't speak any language other than English so my options are limited. I don't have a girlfriend however I do have friends that I would probably miss. I don't know what to do, do I take a leap of faith and just move to a different country or stay in England and be bored for the rest of my life?",06Sep2017,1
2,"So as the title says, my foreign girlfriend really wants to stay in the U.S. Her visa is almost up and there aren't many other options, other than marriage. And with DACA being revoked today, things aren't looking very good. I am way too young for marriage and more importantly I'm not ready, and we're both very transparent with each other about this topic. And so another option she mentioned was to pay someone to marry someone else in order for her to stay, but I don't support this. I really care about her, but I really don't want to be in a relationship with a married woman, no matter the circumstance. How would you guys go about this?",06Sep2017,9
3,"An associate professor at my school thinks I should publish a paper. I love my the subject of the paper but writing it will take a very long time and I just cant get motivated to write a paper about it. Plus, I just finished my freshman year and I am very sure I dont have have half the knowledge to write it. Also I am failing at my classes, and if I put the very limited energy I have into this, I will probably totally fail this year. How do people get motivated about writing a paper? I think they do it mostly because its a thing they have to do, but I'm not getting a phd or something at the end of this, and I honestly dont think other people are gonna get excited about my ideas.

8,"I'll try to keep this short. I moved into an apartment for 2 months over the summer at college. I subleased from a guy I knew. When I moved in, the apartment was pretty nice, but definitely not pristine. Anyway, when I moved out, the guy I subleased from texted me saying I owed him $300 for a cleaning fee. Here's the thing, I didn't clean as well as I possibly could've (the place didn't even have a damn vaccuum cleaner), but I scrubbed surfaces and the floor with clorox wipes, ensured ALL of my trash was thrown away (Even threw away some of his trash), emptied the fridge, swept, etc... 
The thing that pisses me off, is when I moved in there was moldy jello on the table, paper and trash everywhere, old meat in the freezer, the sink and bath tub were a fucking mess, etc... It irks me that somehow I (after living there for 8 weeks) am responsible for the mess that is a majority his (he lived there for a year). Can he force me to pay?",06Sep2017,1
9,"Hi there,

I recently started at a new university and I'm in love with their art museum. There's a lot of cool stuff there and I have a class there so I'm there twice a week. I have a few questions:

1. Is it weird to be there so often? I liked to walk a couple laps and see all of the cool stuff before class.

2. I also was chatting and introducing myself to the nice security officers. Was hoping for a selfie to commemorate my first day of classes but they don't do pictures. What's worse is that the female officers are gorgeous and look amazing in their uniform (#fetishalert). I just want to be friendly and at the same time fulfill my hormonal needs... but be friendly more. I'm worried that I'm just being weird. I might go to their student engagement council info meeting because I wanna do something extracurricular on campus and museums have always interested me.

18,"***Help ME decide MY approach to college***

I just started Senior year of High School today, and I'm going to get right to business on my current situation, hopefully you guys will help me out:

I am 17, male, and looking at filmmaking for my career choice. I am a B student, and work stage crew for my High School. I also am looking into Sports Photography as my own entrepreneur job for the year.

Before I go off to college I want to complete two things:

- Release my Short Film (as writer, producer, director, editor, and camera operator). This is a ~17 minute long horror/thriller screenplay which I will begin filming with my cast and crew this Thursday.

- Become an Eagle Scout. I have 6 merit badges left and my project, with exactly one year until I turn 18 (the age of which you are no longer in Boy Scouts, aka Eagle Scout deadline)

But I would like to have both of those completed and on my application when applying to colleges.

Here are my options:

**A**

- Work on both my Eagle project and Short film this semester, which is on top of school, working stage crew, and a job (Which would be ridiculously packed) and having both on my college application for Regular Submission (around December &amp; January)

- Have the second semester to wait to see what colleges I got into and have nothing on my plate, just free time and a waiting game

- Go to one of the colleges of my choice

or

**B**

- Work on my Film this semester (still on top of school, crew, and job) and work on my Eagle Scout all of next semester

- Take a year at my local community college for $3,000 getting gen eds out of the way and being able to transfer to a better school from there (Since I don't need Eagle Scout on my community college application)

- Go to one of the colleges of my choice

**A** is the standard High School way of going about things, **B** takes a little more money and a full year of community college but maximizes the time I have to work on my projects and is stress-free

Some caveats are that A is more jam-packed but a kick back and relax payoff, but I realistically believe I do not have the capability to pull all that off. B seems great but the college I might want to go to is a conservatory style program and I have no choice but to do exactly that many years the program requires on top of the extra year at community college.

&gt; Thank you if you took your time to read through all this, I immensely appreciate it. There are of course other ways to go, like a year-off etc but I am set on these options. Personally I'm more of a B and my parents an A, but lmk your thoughts. My Dad wants me to go full 4 year and thinks that ""community college is for people with low grades, that's not you"" and my Mom said I should still pack myself this semester with both projects and get into community college for free on Eagle Scout scholarships (saving $3,000 but costing my sanity for a whole semester packed to the brim?)

Thank you!!!",06Sep2017,1
19,"I don't have great work ethic for things I don't enjoy doing and I'm in no way my class's valedictorian, but I do learn quickly and I'm pretty smart. I'm in all advanced classes (PreAP for Pre-Cal because AP Pre-Cal isn't offered/doesn't exist) such as AP and Dual Credit, as well as extracurriculars I'm passionate about such as Orchestra, Computer Science, Robotics, and my foreign language class. However, I'm getting very tired of all the homework (more on that later) and the slow pace of classes.

I'm supposed to be in Calculus AB or BC by now, according to my academic level, but my poor work ethic in intermediate school cost me the opportunity to take classes ahead of my current grade level. Being a senior taking Pre-Cal is difficult because of 1) the lower maturity of my classmates and 2) the lower academic rigor of the class. When I sign up for advanced classes every year, I look forward to more challenging material, not more busy work and extra reinforcement assignments. Although I'm right on-level with the rest of my graduating class, I'm not in the advanced classes that I need.

I fall asleep at least three to four times every week in my math class every year, although I get plenty of rest every day (including 6-8 hours of sleep). The drowsiness is only present during the lecture time of the class, and is only during my math class every year - unless, of course, I didn't get the proper amount of sleep the night before - regardless of what part of the day I have the class.

I often get close to failing my classes toward the end of the year because my work ethic is constantly diminished by the incessant onslaught of daily/busy/reinforcement assignments presented by my teachers. My daily grade average is often a low C or D and my major grade (tests and such) average is always an A.

Being a student in a public school in a large district with a very good reputation, I have little opportunity to deviate from the standard curriculum of classes. I appreciate the hard work my school faculty do for our students, and I recognize the value of homework and reinforcement work for the majority of students. People learn through repetition. However, I require very little repetition (Ideally, I would like one page of exercises, front-and-back for every major unit.) to learn and can often walk out of class - having forgone note-taking - and tutor my peers for as long as needed.

I'm a senior and I recognize that college will be different than high school, but I'd like to resolve my issue now (it's something I'm passionate about solving) instead of suffering through the year.

Here's my question (and my **TL;DR**): How can I create a learning environment that allows me to move through subject material more quickly and be relieved of the stress of compounding reinforcement/busywork assignments while staying within the bounds of what my high school can allow me to do?",06Sep2017,1

25,"From a young age, it became apparent to my parents that I was smarter than the average child. They understood that, and then chose to force me to study and not play outside, or talk with other kids or really go anywhere at all. I never really minded it, and thus grew up and eventually started going to a special college program around the age of thirteen. My parents were overjoyed, seeing as I had received an extremely rare and high score on my SATs when I was forced to spontaneously take them when I was eleven. I grew up thinking that I would be who my parents wanted me to, as my father only really cared for my smarts and usefulness to him, not actually for me. Now, I've begun to realize that I truly hate this, and want to make my own life. I hate the jobs my father wants me to have, what he considers 'successful' enough.

28,"(f/16) There's this one guy who was in my history class last year, I'll call him Steve. He was new to the school and pretty much my only friend in the class. After a while I found out theough a mutual friend that he had a crush on me, but I kindly shot him down. After that, he said he hoped we could remain friends, but started to talk shit about me behind my back to my best friend (which, he knew well she was my best friend). He told her stuff about how I ""ask for attention"" because of how I dress, how my sexuality is made up, and about how he would bang me. Of course my best friend was telling me all of this, and when Steve found out he got pissed at her. We didn't really talk to each other after he asked me out, and eventually the school year ended.
Well I just found out today that I'm in history with him again this year! I have no friends in the class and few people I could be friends with, and that combined with Steve being there makes for a really uncomfortable last period. I really don't want to be around him, it's upsetting knowing all the disgusting things he's said about me. What should I do? I really like the rest of my schedule and don't want to switch things aroynd, but at the same time it's getting to me and making me upset outside of class- what should I do?

29,"About a week ago my bank called and said two checks were cashed but the signature didn't match - I assumed the checkbook fell out of my wallet. Anyway, I sucked it up, filled out the affidavits, and opened a new checking account. 

A little backstory, my mother passed away in May and her wedding ring was given to me. As it is too big for my finger, I had it hidden in a small metal container within my bureau drawer.

Now, a little under a week later, I went to look at the ring and noticed it was missing, along with a necklace that belonged to my grandmother. That was when I noticed the two checks that were cashed were the first two taken from a new checkbook. 

I called the police back to add to the original case that I believe someone broke into my apartment. The woman's name on the check showed up on Facebook and a mug shot online and I realized I know the woman. My next door neighbor just moved in last month and this woman is his cousin and is always at his apartment. 

My apartment is in an old house and used to be an office. It has a weird set-up, and importantly there is a door that is in my living room which was permanently locked, as it leads to what I can only assume is the bathroom of the only apartment. It doesn't lock from my side. 

I am more than sure that it is my new neighbor who broke into my apartment. I told the police and they told me to wait until the detective looks into it, as it's not necessarily incriminating evidence. I understand and I don't mind letting them do their job. 

My concern is getting the ring back though. I'm going to pawn shops and I'm not really sure what to say when I go in. I feel like I can't tell them that it's been stolen because then they lose out on money, right? So what do I do tomorrow when I go looking around? What do I say? If I see it, do I call the police station?

Fast forward to now. STILL have a huge cockroach infestation, but because they ""spray every month"" it shows they are trying, and from what I understand, makes me unable to do anything. 

But now, get ready for this, there is black liquid oozing from my walls. Yupp. That's right, black liquid. Most prominent under my window AC, but it's also In other places. In addition to that, I came home today, and half of my apartment is without power. My kitchen and living room do, but my bathroom and bedroom do not.

I might as well add the fact my cold water doesn't work in my bathroom, my neighbor just died of a heroine overdose, I had to lay down new carpet, my apartment wasn't cleaned before I moved in (there was still cigarette butts all over the ground and shit everywhere), and the fact that my landlord has hung up on me during two phone calls, in addition to my neighbors screaming and slamming each other into walls at all hours of the night. 


Is there ANYTHING I can do to either A) get them to fix this shit ASAP, or B) attempt to find a new place and have them compensate or let me out of my lease? I'm torn because this place is so cheap, and it's just me, but I can't deal with this anymore. I come home everyday to a new fun surprise.

I'm shy so I was sort of reluctant but eventually agreed. I gave her my number but I didn't get a response and I thought she just never texted me.

After hurricane Harvey they reopened camp so parents had a place to keep kids during the day. Emma showed up and she kept looking at me in a weird way and I overheard her talking about me to her friends but I tried to ignore it because I figured she had no interest in me after she sort of bailed on me.

43,"A good friend of mine started renting a pretty big place recently; it's the first floor of a duplex with a basement. She's paying $1650. 

I'm hoping to get out of the house soon, and I think we'd get along well as roommates (she agrees). Her cousin just moved into the other upstairs bedroom and is paying $500. That leaves the basement room for me.

It's the smallest ""bedroom"" (I think it might've been a playroom before), and there's a door directly to the backyard in the room. Another door in this room leads to the laundry room, and you access the garage from the laundry room. So, two doors that lead to my room from outside, and no closet. Kind of iffy. 

 There is, however, another kitchen right outside my potential bedroom and a half-bath. There's also a big living-room type of space in the basement. She wanted me paying $600 originally. I thought that wouldn't be too bad if I had the entire basement, but still more than I'm willing to pay. She knocked it down to $500, and mentioned she and her cousin might want to turn the big room into a home gym, so it's less space than I thought I'd be getting. That said, we would still all share the living room, kitchens, etc. so it's not like I'd be confined to the basement.

The thing that bothers me is that the initial price she offered me was higher than what she and her cousin would be paying. If my math is right, if I paid $600 and her cousin is paying $500, she'd be paying $550. Her bedroom is literally double the size of the one I was offered, with a walk-in closet. Her cousin's room is also bigger and I'm pretty sure it has a closet. The upstairs kitchen is a lot nicer. While the basement has a nice floor and is nicely finished, it's still a small room in a basement.

Does it make sense that I would've paid more at first? And do you think it would be fair to ask her to knock the price down a little more, maybe to $400? I feel weird asking about that because she's in a tricky spot financially as of a week ago, but I work part-time and don't want to pay more than is reasonable.

44,"For the last year Ive been plagued with an unknown physical ailment. Ive been to a doctor 4 different times, gotten my blood taken 3 times, had my stool taken, and got a half assed and different diagnosis from each doctor.  

Basically, Ive been having chronic diarrhea, loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, had blood in stool for one month, and a weight loss of 20 pounds ever since lance year. Every test I've taken came back negative and or normal, and my parents now refuse to take me to a doctor. The best way to describe my symptoms, is like having gastrointestinal infection that won't go away minus the nausea, and vomiting. 

What the fuck am i supposed to do? I feel like my body is giving up on as each day goes by. How the fuck am I supposed to get a diagnosis? Are there any free clinics that can help me out? I just cant take the stress anymore.",06Sep2017,2

I'm thinking this all sounds ridiculous.   ",06Sep2017,1
57,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here's goes.
I'll most likely get ridiculed on this but.

Some background information on me: I got out of a long, abusive relationship about a year and a half ago and have kinda frayed against getting serious with anyone ever since because i'm scared. I tend to like people if I end up connecting with them quite easily, but I've been able to avoid it for a good while.

Anyways, here's the story. I started my freshman year of college about 3 weeks ago. My first day of English class, I caught my eye on someone I thought was really cute. I didn't really think anything of it. But as classes kept going by, I kept noticing him. I never really talked to him, but his best friend was in that class as well and we made small talk. On Saturday, my friend and I decided to go out to the club. I was walking downstairs, and I saw him and smiled and he smiled as well and said hi. I just walked past him after that and went my way. My friends and I ended up going upstairs, and as I was getting drinks I saw him again. And then again. I just ignored it even though I wanted to go up to him. My friends and I are dancing and about 10 minutes in, someone comes up behind me and I'm still dancing and my friend looks at me and she looks at me with a really shocked face. I look behind and it's him and he just smiles at me and i laugh and continued dancing with him. We ended up being with each other for the rest of the night which was until 2 am. Then he asked if I wanted to come over, I did. Which looking back now, is crazy to me because I never do that. 

Anyways, we uber back to his apartment around 2:30, we're sitting in the couch talking, and he tells me all about how when he noticed me on the first day of class. We're talking for a while and one thing leads to another and we end up in his room. After that, we stay up until 5 AM talking about things and end up dozing off to sleep. I wake up around 8 to use the restroom and I get back out and he's awake, so we talk more and more and we're laying in bed face-to-face and in that moment he was just the cutest thing to me. It was nice, to talk to someone and be with someone like that again. He kept caressing my face, and telling me how pretty I was, kissing my forehead and cheeks, and cuddling me. We were both super tired so we stayed in bed just talking, singing songs, and laying there. Around 3, he had plans with his friends so I uber'd back home and he walked me out and I hugged him, and he told me to let me know if I wanted to go out with them tonight again. I left at that. 

My only issue is, I'm not very good at seeing signals. There are some things that seem right, but also some things that are off. We haven't talked much since then, (it was 3 days ago) we snapchat occasionally but then he won't respond and open it and not reply. We had our English class today, and it was super awkward. I couldn't even make eye contact with him. I just kept looking away. Our professor let us out early, and he got up and left but his best friend was walking with him and opened the door for me. So i continued walking with someone else in our class, and he's behind me but he doesn't say anything. I get home and around 3 hours later he snapchats me a random video and I respond, and we exchange a couple of snaps and he's stopped responding again. I'm not really sure how to act.

I'm sorry if this seems kind of childish, I've been out of the game for a little bit. I shouldn't have let myself get a little bit of feelings for him, but it did and I'm not a very confrontational person so I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared of getting hurt. I don't want to ask him about it and he not even feel the same way and look stupid for feeling the way I do. Was this just a hook-up? Or was it something more? I'm ready for the harsh truth

Tldr; Met someone in a class, saw him in the club, ended up spending the night, stayed over for the day, thought it was going okay, went to class and didn't make any contact with him. Occasional snapchats here and there, but confused what it is.",06Sep2017,1
58,"This was a very jarring incident that happened today and I want advice on how I should approach management tomorrow.

I am vacationing in NYC and I'm staying in a 4 star hotel. I am here for two weeks more and have been here for two weeks so far. 

Twice today a middle aged cleaning person entered my room while I was naked in bed. I was clearly naked both times, trying to cover myself up. 

The first time, I was asleep. She barged in despite the do not disturb sign, and woke me from my sleep by chastising me for having a pizza box on the other bed I was not using. She made ""tsk"" sounds at me while I stared at her incredulously. She said, ""What is all this?"" While gesturing to my clothes and day old takeout food on the counter. ""Damn! With the pizza box on the bed and all this?"" I was just woken up straight out of a dead sleep and was so groggy so I just covered up my boobs and said, ""Yea?"" She stood for a solid fifteen seconds and then shook her head and stormed out. 

I was quite shaken and embarrassed and worried she would come back in so I locked the safety bar, got dressed, and left. I came back several hours later far after the cleaning staff was gone, took my clothes off and got in bed.

This fucking woman came in without knocking. Now I was awake at this point and said, ""excuse me please come back tomorrow."" She is staring at me while I'm holding the covers up to shield the merchandise and says to me, ""you need towels."" I said, ""No thank you I am fine just come back tomorrow."" She walks into my bathroom, remember that I am STILL NAKED and tells me that I only have one towel. I informed her, again, that this is fine, and firmly ask her to come back tomorrow. She says, ""I'll tell you what. I'll go get lunch and then I'll come back and give you towels for the bathroom.""

By this point I just want her out of my room. I am in an extremely vulnerable situation as I am naked and my phone is out of reach. I say, ""Okay?"" She then looks around and asks me where the pizza box is. I point to where I had moved it on the counter. She asks me, ""Is there still pizza in it?"" Normally by this point I would have been very snappy but given that I was in such a compromising state, I say yes there is still pizza.

She finally leaves, turning around once more and reminding me that she will be back. I am, at this point, kicking myself for not bolting the fucking door. So I dress myself, bolt the door, and seethe. An hour and a half later she returns, and attempts to open the door. She tries for what felt like an eternity, but was probably only a minute, knocking and jiggling the door handle. I just ignore her. She finally leaves. 

What kind of steps can I take in a situation like this? I kind of feel like it is my fault since twice I did not bolt the door. I have never run into a situation like this before, and all advice is appreciated. 

Edit: To be clear, I wasn't ""paint me like one of your French girls"" naked. I was under the covers with my shoulders exposed. 

Update: 
So I should preface this with the fact that making a fuss gives me huge amounts of anxiety. I am the type to never return my food, clothes, etc. One time I forgot I had a nail appointment and was so embarrassed I never went back. Part of this is that I tend to doubt myself and feel like things that really disturb me just aren't big deals. I'm glad that I'm not the only one put off by what happened. 

I spoke to two men, neither of which were the housekeeping manager, as apparently that person wasn't in today. I don't know if this is actually true. They told me that if by chance staff didn't see the sign, it was still unacceptable that she wouldn't leave when I told her to. He basically just listened to me quietly and told me he was sorry, that the hotel expects more from staff. He told me that he would check to see when her card was used which is nice because I could give him pretty specific times given that I immediately texted my mom and husband after each incident. 

After seeing some of the reactions from the other subReddit I cross posted to, I feel that maybe he doesn't believe me. I hope he still talks to her and hopefully she feels she has nothing to hide. Either way, I'm glad I told management. If something like this ever happens again I will call immediately so that I don't have time to second-guess myself. 

Thank you for the advice, seriously. I think I would have talked myself out of complaining without it. ",06Sep2017,137

71,"So I'm in a little bit of a pickle. To give some background, I'm a 20 year old college student (will have my AA by December) and I live in Florida, and if you haven't been living under a rock for the past week then you would know that Hurricane Irma is coming our way, *hard*. I live in a smaller town (&lt;50k people) and I will say I absolutely hate living here. The only thing that is keeping me here is my family and college since I have in-state tuition. Two or three good friends of mine are talking about worst case scenarios and if our town gets completely decimated by Irma then they are thinking about getting a fresh start somewhere else in the country and they want me to join them, and I'm not gonna lie, that sounds very very tempting. As I mentioned before I hate living in my current town and never really liked my state in general but I have made a couple good friends here and most of my immediate family lives here as well. I currently live with my parents and don't have to pay rent and some food but I pay for mostly everything else.

I've been thinking a lot about a change of scenery for the past year or so and now there is a possible opportunity for that to happen and I don't know what to do. Should I stay and finish out college which is going to take another 2-4 years in my comfort zone in a place I know well but absolutely hate or do I take this opportunity and enjoy this new ticket on life and see where it takes me. I have already talked about moving away eventually with my parents and they have said that I'm always welcome back home if needed which just further pushes me towards taking that golden ticket and risking it because I'm young and can afford to pursue it...

The possible options we were thinking about moving to are Washington, Denver, Phoenix, Raleigh, and Las Vegas...

Again, this hasn't been finalized but I like to be prepared and have all my options on the table. And who knows, if our town still stands at the end of it then I can continue on with life as usual and finish out college then move to where I want or just wait for a better time to move...",06Sep2017,1
74,"Hey everyone. I am currently in my senior year of high school-it's going great and I enjoy my classes and such, but am very busy. I have a heavy workload, do cross country (which takes a huge chunk of time), and live far from home; thus, I tend to be constantly on the move. Here is where the issue lies: I've been playing piano for 7 years now (outside of school), and am currently on my final year of lessons. Being a senior (and only in week two), I've already got a lot on my plate with school, athletics, and the beginnings of college applications. My mother has told me that it is alright if I drop piano classes (something I have been considering for a 1/2 year, as I already have a lot to deal with). Thus, today I took the hard decision of telling my mother that for my sake, I have to drop classes in order to keep a good, healthy balance.
Flash forward to a couple minutes later, after having showered (XC practice), my mother tells me that she has called my teacher of 7 years to tell her the news. My teacher had reacted very upset, and perhaps a bit angry that I wanted to drop the class. To make matters worse, my mother has basically suddenly changed gears and is now saying that I should stick with classes, especially because I only have one year to go. She has also told me that my teacher wants me to call her, in which I will do so sometime tomorrow.
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love piano and I will still play when I have time, but adding weekly (once a week at night) classes with practice on my own has added a huge amount of stress to my school life, and I feel like something has to be dropped in order for me to healthily complete senior year. This is an absolute passion of mine and it hurts to consider dropping it, but something has to be done for my sanity. 
Should I keep doing piano classes for the remainder of the year, leading to more stress, lack of sleep, and additional work, or should I let go of the class, helping lead to a slightly more relaxed year (which is already hectic enough)?

79,"Hey everyone, I created a throwaway account for this post; I hope this is okay. Also, I would like to apologize in advance for the length of this post. A lot of backstory is needed in order to tell the whole story, but I will try my best to be as concise as possible.  To preserve anonymity, I have changed all names, as well. 

I have an older sister named Marissa and she is 30 years old. Around 6 years ago, she revealed to my parents that she was pregnant, but didn't give too much detail about the father. She didn't have a lot of money and was living with a roommate who ended up (sort of) screwing her over, so she moved back in with my parents. I was still living at home, at the time, but only for a short period before I left to pursue a job. During the time when my sister was pregnant, she did not help my parents out at all, in any way. She was working a part time job, but my parents never asked her to pay rent or contribute anything monetarily. My mom just wanted her to help around the house, with whatever she could do. However, Marissa was selfish and only thought about herself during this time. Not only did she practically refuse to help around the house, she also started bringing random guys (like 2-3) to my parents house. That's where my parents drew the line. They told her that she needed to quit her current behavior if she expected to receive any help from them. Little did we know, that during this time of bringing guys around, she was trying to not only find a father figure for her baby, but also find a way out of living with my parents. 

Once the baby was born (daughter 1), my parents helped her out more and more. She was still working, and helping my parents a little, but my parents forked over a lot of money in order to help support her and her daughter. Now, it may sound (at this point) that my parents are a bunch of pushovers, but this isn't the case. Honestly, they're just a couple sweethearts who will do anything for any of their 5 children (and grandchildren). Anyway, my sister lived at home for the first 1.5 year of her daughter's life. During this time, we all helped her with the baby. At the end of that year and a half, my sister gave my parents more news that she was pregnant, again, by a different guy. She stayed at home until she had the second child. At this point, she started dating another guy (not the father(s) of her previous children). She was pretty secretive about their relationship, but after a few months (I'd say 2-3), she brought him over for dinner. Now, this is after I had already left home, so this account was given by my family who were there. Apparently after dinner, my father asked to talk with her boyfriend and told her, straight up, ""please don't get her pregnant"". What he meant was, don't get her pregnant anytime soon because you two have known each other for approximately 2 seconds. The boyfriend said that he was a stand-up guy and that he would honor my father's wishes. About 2 months later (around 4 months of dating), Marissa moved out of my parents house, with her two girls, and moved in with her boyfriend Mark. 
Now, Mark has a daughter of his own and has joint custody of her. He gets her every 2 weeks, or something along those lines. She is also the same age of my Marissa's daughter 1.

After a few months, when daughter 2 is around a year old, my sister announces that (surprise) she's pregnant again, this time, the baby is Mark's. So, at this point, they have a total of 4 children at home. Marissa was working a part-time job at a daycare, but decided to quit because she wasn't making any money at her job (because daycare was being taken out of her check for 4 kids). Mark has a job doing maintenance for the city and only makes as much money as any retail manager would make. One thing that he didn't tell Marissa, until much later, was that he had a trust fund from his father and that he got an allowance from his father every month. The money he received from his father went toward the ""lifestyle"" Mark had to uphold (buying vape supplies, paying for unnecessary subscription boxes, etc...); all the while, Marissa is asking my parents to buy her kids diapers, formula, shoes, clothes, etc... My parents obliged and they were smart about it. They never once gave Marissa any money. They just asked her what their grandchildren needed, and they would go out and buy it themselves. They also kept all the receipts. At this time (and also currently) Marissa, Mark, and their family are living paycheck to paycheck, with government assistance (food stamps). 

The point of this entire, lengthy backstory is to give an account of the type of person my sister Marissa is, and how much my parents have helped her throughout the years. It's also to give insight into how much my family has never really liked Mark. He's the type of person who will talk over you in an argument, and when you try to prove a valid point, he will yell louder, saying random words, just to tune you out, like a child. Mark also has some weird idea that we all secretly shun his daughter, although his daughter was immediately accepted by our family. We made sure we were accommodating to her; we bought her gifts at Christmas, for her birthday, and my parents even babysat her (along with their other grandchildren) without asking for anything in return. We didn't really have to do any of this because Marissa and Mark are not married, but we knew that his daughter was just a child and, unfortunately, couldn't help who her father is.

So one time, Marissa and Mark got into an argument. She wanted to be able to take her children (along with his daughter, if she was at home for the weekend) to spend time with my family, including their cousins, to play. Mark said would always say ""no"" because it ""didn't fit into [his] schedule."" Marissa tried to reason with him, telling him that she felt he was being too controlling, and he blew up. She was holding their son, and he snatched the baby out of her hands and locked her out of his nursery. He told her that she had 24 hours to pack up and take her girls with her to live somewhere else (she wasn't on the lease for the apartment that they were living in). All the while, she is keeping us updated through my family's group chat an he is refusing to let my sister near their son. We all immediately thought he was going to harm my sister, or her children, so my dad said that he and my older brother were going to go by and set things straight. She begs and pleads for him not to, so my parents decide to call the cops and tell them to stop by for a visit. After this happens, and after Marissa and Mark have talked it out, Mark tells my sister that she and their kids are not allowed to see my parents until my parents have apologized to him. He said that his reputation was ruined because the city he works for is small and that people will find out about what he did/did not do. I mean, the nerve of this dude to ask my parents to apologize to him. Anyway, my parents decided to make peace in any way, only because they wanted to be able to see their daughter and grandchildren. To this day, Mark has never once apologized to anyone in my family about his behavior and its effect on my sister or her children. 

So fast forward to where we are now. Back in July, my parents planned to visit my husband and me where I live (a large, tourist city). This was obviously during the summer, so kids weren't in school. My parents knew that my sister didn't have the money to take her kids to do anything too exciting, other than trips to the park/grocery store, so they thought it would be a good idea to take Marissa's girls with them for a few days so that they could experience being in a new place, and also get out of the house for a while. Marissa was all for it because Mark's daughter was going to be with her mom during this time, so that meant that instead of having to watch 4 kids, Marissa would only have to worry about one. When he got home, she presented the idea to Mark and, again, he blew up. He told my sister that my parents conveniently waited for his daughter to be gone to take Marissa's girls so that she wouldn't be able to go. Nope, wasn't it at all. The date just worked well with my parents' and mine and my husband's schedule. Mark told Marissa that he forbade the kids from going with my parents. When Marissa told us this, in our group chat, we all had something to say. We talked about how it wasn't fair to the children, to Marissa, to everyone else. My younger sister and I voiced concerns for Mark's controlling behavior, and its effects on their family. We honestly thought we were being helpful, but apparently, we weren't. The messages Marissa sent after that sounded as if Mark was sending them. The messages were all about how Marissa ""knew she was the joke of the family"" and that no one would understand her relationship and how great a father Mark truly was, and that we all just refused to see it because it was our goal to run him, and his daughter, off. We all just sort of sat their baffled and so we all didn't talk for a few days. My parents came out here for their trip, had a great time, and then went back home. Now, let's progress to now. My mom called me the other day because it was a few days away from her side's bi-annual family reunion. She told me that she asked Marissa if she was coming, but Marissa told her ""no"" because she didn't want her children to be around my family, until they apologized. My mom didn't understand, and when she asked for an explanation, Marissa told her that she didn't appreciate how everyone spoke so poorly of Mark. She also said that my mom (and dad) were the sole people to blame because, as our parents, they should have reprimanded my sister and I for what we said. Granted, both my sister and I are well over adult age, and while my parents are great for offering sage advice and guidance, they cannot make our decisions for us. She told my parents that she was standing her ground and that she wouldn't bring her kids, my parents grandchildren, around until she and Mark received an apology from everyone in my family (confusingly enough, even my brother, who had little to do with any of it). My mom told me that it has been since the beginning of July, so well over 2 months now, since she and my father have seen their grandchildren, and my sister lives 15 minutes away. 

When I spoke with my mom on the phone, she cried like I had never heard her cry. From her voice, I could tell she was hurting. The protective daughter in me sprung to action and I told my mom that I would call Marissa immediately and give her a piece of my mind, but my mom asked for me not to, because she thought it would only make things worse. I told her I would honor her wish, but that didn't change how I felt about the whole situation. 

So now we are at the place where I am on the internet asking for advice. I want so badly to try to get through to my sister, but I also want to make my mother happy. I honestly think Marissa is making a terrible mistake and she is seeing her stubbornness as strength. I also am afraid that Mark has oppressed her so much that she doesn't have a voice anymore. 

So what is it that you think I should do? Like I said, I am at the point now where I don't know what else to do and want to get an outside perspective on what's going on. Ultimately, I want my family to get along, but right now, it doesn't seem too viable an option. 

Thank you for taking the time to read such a lengthy post; your advice/suggestions are much appreciated. ",06Sep2017,5
80,"I recently went on a trip to Mexico and brought some souvenirs back home for my colleagues.
And as I know that my boss really likes coffee, when I was grocery shopping in Mexico's Walmart, I grabbed a bag of Mexican coffee beans for my boss.

Now tomorrow I am back to work and as I was preparing the gifts, I noticed on the back of the coffee bean package, it says ""Hecho en México para: Nueva Wal-Mart..."" basically it says made for Walmart.

Should I still give this to my boss? Or does it now make me look cheap to give this as a present...

Even when we have eye contact, he immediately breaks away. Especially with friends around. I dont know what i did wrong. The only thing i could think of is the many times I've said no to him hanging out at cafes or video chat during the summer. Is it me or did he lose interest in our friendship?

**Facts of the case:**

* Rented a car with 2 friends for roadtripping 
* Rented car under Person A's name and legal responsibility
* 500 dollars deposit from Person A's card was put on hold by the rental car company 
* Person A dropped off Person B (other person in the car) home but scratched bumper on Person B's driveway. 
* Person A drove against the road signs to reach Person B's driveway. 
* I did encourage Person A to disregard the traffic rules but Person A would have probably done it regardless of my comment since the road was clear and empty 

**My assurances and implications**

* I helped Person A to call a mechanic friend who gave a figure for damage repair 
* She seemed distraught and I felt slightly at fault for suggesting she go against the road signs (knowing that it was probably on her mid anyways) 
* I told her I'm happy to share the burden to comfort her
* She said its fine as she was the driver
* To console her again, I told her that I'm happy to chip in a bit (like 50 bucks) just to help her out 
* she said ""thanks man"" 

**fast forward to this morning**

I realised that indeed it was more her fault than the passengers' and that the other passenger didn't offer to split. Additionally, i'm very tight financially as I lost my job recently and in college so money is always tight. She knows that I lost my job and only making money from tutoring kids for 2 hours a week. 

How do i back myself out? She will ask me for my share of the roadtrip expenses soon. How do I tell her I can't offer any financial remedy anymore and basically letting her know it was more of consoling her than actually intending to pay...

I literally grew up with her as my sister as I've known her longer than ive not known her and I can't even remember my life before her. I love her as my own. She even lived with us for the Last 3 years of their relationship. My brother and I also have a really great relationship. I took their break up really hard and didn't speak to my brother for over 6 months because I was so angry he stopped loving her. I mean how could he? That was 1,5 years ago. Eva and I remained close but of course it's less so than it was before which is understandable. Now my brother has a new girlfriend. A year now. Melissa. I've only hung out with her a few times and I didn't really like her but I don't want to judge her too soon so I'm still feeling her out. 

Ok so here's the issue. Melissa has a problem with me hanging out with Eva and posting pictures and being cute. I can't invite Eva to anything anymore like birthdays and what not because Melissa will be there so we hang out on our own time and yes I post lots of pictures because I don't see her as often as I would like. My brother and Eva remained friends and he didn't have a problem with it. But now all of a sudden he's asking me to stop posting pictures with Eva and try to see her less and spend more time with Melissa and I DONT WANT TO. but I don't want to make my brothers relationship hard or anything.

A couple of years ago, I was in two situations that have made me nervous. First situation, which I'm not going to get into atm, has made me more wary around people, and being alone outside walking. 

Second situation, has made me not feel as safe in my own home at night. There were some guests sleeping over at my family's house. I woke up and there's the older teenager staring at me, in a very strange and creepy way (this happened in the same year as first situation...so around 18-19 years old me). Door was closed, so I was instantly on alert. ""What are you doing here?!"" He made some excuse about thinking that this was the restroom, ""...this is not the restroom"" He then said that he didn't know where the restroom was (despite the fact that it was directly in front of the room where he was sleeping in, open), and he went out. Since I didn't have a lock, got a make-shift one until he left (took around 3 days). 
 

I'm also anxious in general; my thoughts jump all over the place! I wake up randomly in the night (just by myself), and I get up to check to see if my grandma's alright (she's been sick, so I get worried that one day she might stop breathing. She has also had some...episodes? where she just stares and talks gibberish and has done things she has no recollection of doing, so I've been really worried about her. 

I constantly feel as if I could be in danger, like someone might come into my room, or someone's room, even though that has never happened before (minus the guest). 

I have trouble sleeping--I feel exhausted, but not sleepy, if that makes sense.

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my friend, who took his own life in 2014. I wish he were still here to talk---we both had helped each other. We were going to start playing a game together. He was about to graduate. I think that's also part of the reason I can't sleep. I can't concentrate, and can't sleep. It's very hard for me to make friends---I can't talk well, and get nervous and don't know what to talk about. We met online, and we had talked almost everyday for a bit more than half a year. We had the *same interests, we could just talk all day.

99,"I am a 22 year old male and I have only 2 friends in my vicinity, and everyone else is gone and I haven't seen or heard from them. I am a senior in college and decided to try the dorm life again, and my parents said that was a good step bevause I used to only go to class and back home, having the bare minimum human interaction. 

I've had some stuff happen in the past so it is hard for me to approach, interact on a personal level (no problems with interviews or professional settings), and open up. For the last 4 years, I have tried to avoid people in general. I know my anxiety and drug use doesn't help (makes me feel less alone and stuck in my head), and I want to try to make a fresh start but don't know where to begin.

It used to be worse in the past and I think I made some progress. Back then I wouldn't even post on the internet or play video games that require talking, not for any reason like toxic communities but because I didn't feel comfortable. I can now communicate in games, can post and respond on the internet, and tolerate being in a crowded place even if it is just me.

I sort of feel that my interests developed around being alone all the time so it is hard for me to connect even with people in my class. I want to start to change this around and be more like the person I was over 4 years ago.

I am so out of the loop as to what adults my age like which probably doesn't help. I don't use social media (I have installed discord today to try to find some online friends to play with from time to time), don't understand sports, listen to completely different music, and watch anime rather than something like Game of Thrones, and don't understand as many cultural references. 

I have started talking at least to my professors in the hall and hold up small chat like weekend plans or discuss the day, so that is a pretty good step if I say so myself.

I think I should do this slowly and maybe add milestones for motivation, but what should I try doing next to try to integrate back into society becoming a ""normal"" person. I would also like maybe baby step advice so I can learn to do this without the use of Xanax as well.

101,"I started noticing that I cannot live with another person who will constantly be in my business. I started noticing this when my mom moved back with me for a few days. She has all her stuff in my room. The first few days, she was sleeping on my bed as well (one room suite), and I didn't mind it while I sleep in the living room. However, I started getting frustrated beyond my control (I guess I do mind) and insisted she move back to her own place (Why she moved out is irrelevant to this topic).

Days past, and she started reorganizing the stuff in my room. It got me frustrated even more, because I just like the way my things are. If things are at reach from my desk, my bed, etc.

And everyday, she would be constantly asking me pointless questions and questions that have very simple solutions to that she just can't come up with. For example, she asked me if I wanted her to buy an extension outlet as I have told her I needed one. I told her over the phone ""don't worry about it"" because I ordered from Amazon. Then, she goes on saying we should get one because it will take several days to ship, yada yada yada. I mean, I don't care what her choices and decisions are. If she's gonna do something, just do it. Don't ask me for my opinion or answer, and then when I give one, she goes ""but this and that"". If she wants to buy it, just buy it, why ask me?

It's just that a lot of the things that I do, I have my own reason to do it. And she always questions me or tells me ""but this but that"". It gets me frustrated just trying to explain to her. I try to tell her that if she wants to stay with me, she has to respect my ways of thing. Then she goes on saying that I'm bullying her and such. It's been only 2 weeks and I'm almost flipping out.

My parents never sat me down in high school to talk about work, driving, college, nothing.  I do everything essentially for myself.  I make my own appointments, I apply to things on my own...  It's hard when I don't have someone to guide me or at least say ""how fun!""  I feel like it's going to take a hardship like living on my own without transportation of my own to force me to gain confidence, later to *become* that confidence, maybe leading to a license after awhile.

Gaining that confidence is more than just a mental obstacle.  I have to physically gain it, but I can't in a town with no room to advance.

My parents want us kids to succeed, but they don't put any effort in.  I'm not asking for the work to be done for me, I'm just asking for someone to be there *with* me.  As a parent should, right?  Parents should be there for the firsts of their children.  How else will the kids learn if there's no example?!  I feel like a 5 year old being told to figure out what kindergarten is and put myself there somehow; that's how lost I am.

Anyway, I'm confused, anxious, hurt, embarrassed, and ready to do something.  I miss doing productive stuff.   It's too late to apply to school for this year, but I'm seriously considering for next year.  Since I don't have parents that want to be involved, can you guys be my e-parents?  I don't know where to start.  Apply for scholarships in advance?

122,"I'm a young woman and I really want to either be able to feel comfortable about my name or change it!!

I'm worried if I change it people will think I'm inauthentic or something. I feel like your name is part of your identity, when someone gets to know you they want to know your name. 
I feel like people who already know me might get confused, not know what to call me anymore. 


It's a weird name that doesn't even sound like a girls name and to me the name just isn't pleasant! My parents were not born in this country. 
I have not met a single person in my life with the same name as me! 
People constantly tell me I look very Caucasian typical white person for someone with such an exotic and Indian or colored person sounding name. 
In the US in 2016, an estimated 8 births were given to a baby with my name. 

I used to not mind it as much when I was younger, I thought it was kind of cool. In the past 2 years however this has changed and I do not feel comfortable with it anymore!


I always get super anxious about telling someone I dated my name (only like 1 person ever pretty much but I want to date sometime soon and when I do I'm dreading telling anyone my name). 
I also am scared to tell new friends because I feel like my name is too weird and they'll be put off by it and not want to be my friend as much! 

Has anyone changed their super weird name before legally and has it been a good experience or a bad one?  

Or how can I just overcome caring? Can I pm anyone my name so that I can tell someone and you can honestly tell me if you think it's an ugly/cringeworthy name or not? ",06Sep2017,4

It's really impacting my social, emotional, and physical health. I've been feeling very nihilistic lately, like nothing even matters at all anymore, and I should stop caring. I don't know what to do besides wait until I can move out and cut all ties with them. I feel extremely sad all the time as well. I can't even talk to my friends normally sometimes, and other times I genuinely don't feel like it because I'm so sad. I've been losing self-worth recently as well. My emotional and mental states are crumbling. I need help.

My dad doesn't like talking to me, he hates me and thinks I'm a full blown failure. I can't remember the last time he said ""I'm proud of you, son.""

135,"My fiance and I lived in a 500sq foot apartment. Very very small for myself + her + dog + cat.  Her good childhood best friend reached out to us and we all became friends.  Shortly after, she ended up leaving her boy friend.  She lives 1 hour away and we were constantly asked to drive out to get her and bring her back to the apartment. Her ex was scary AF and I didn't want her near him or have him near her baby. 

For for about a month out of the 2 months, this girl and her baby lived with us. We drove a total of 24 hours of driving to go get her and bring her to our apartment.

We mutually came to the conclusion that we need a larger apartment. So we put in our 60 days notice and we were aiming to find a place by Sept. 1st. Unfortunatly we could not find a place so we resorted to finding a place for Oct 1st. 

This girl has joined school here where I live, and we needed her here by Sept 1st. My parents being super nice, said that myself, my fiance and her + the baby can live with them. Currently they are trying to sell the house, so it is a lot of stress to be putting them under.

Without going into details on how shitty a person this girl became regarding our kindness, she just annouced last night she is moving home to her new BF. (2 week relationship old).


She said that she wants her 800$ back, and I dont think I have to do it. We move into this new place Oct 1st. She screwed us.

LONG STORY SHORT... She used us, screwed us and left us to an apartment we can't afford.

A roommate a who was a close friend of mine, bailed on me before our lease even started. She is not on the lease, but she gave me 800$ for last months rent.  She wants it back. She screwed me over and now I can't afford this lease. Do I legally have to return her money?",06Sep2017,1
136,"I recently just started volunteering for a local lifeboat station and I am fucking feeling it.  

Monday there was a reported jumper on the bridge and we was packing up ready to go home when the call came in, we had lifeboats, coastguard and emergency crews scrambled in 20 mins.  Myself and two new guys were on road duty blocking the traffic from going to the scene without appropriate authorisation and leading the tractor to the water, etc.  

I can't give specifics on what happened, but as you can imagine my adrenaline was going. The night ended with us finding the casualty and unfortunately she died, again can't give specifics on how she died.  

It's been on my mind for 2 days now. I had a bit of anxiety last night feeling sick and shakey but generally felt OK. Mentally I was wondering whether I can do it again and I told myself I could, because this is what I want to do. I want to be dedicated but not feel like this every time.  

As I write this, my stomach is churning and it's making me feel uneasy. I can focus on my current work no problem, but when I'm not distracted by something I have images in my head. I don't exactly know what the cause is whether it's seeing the body or the thought that it actually happened, not sure. My mood is also very reserved at the moment too, I'm not as talkative as I usually am and I'm very thoughtful thinking about that night and everything that went on.

138,"Hi all,

recently when I moved in to my grandmother's apartment while she was out of country, I saw she didn't have a toilet brush.

Since I didn't get a chance to buy one right away, I had to take some toilet paper in my hand and clean it 'manually' after usage.

When she got back, she said that's how she cleans the toilet: ""Why of course! You take some paper and clean it by hand! Having those brushes is not hygienic due to it keeping the feces particles.""

Then my father (her son) started explaining how actually *not having* the brush, and having to clean the toilets by hand is not hygienic, due to the 'almost direct' contact of our hands with feces, and having to ""breathe in"" the vapors.

So, what do you think? I agree with the 'need to have the brush' theory.",06Sep2017,5

140,"My boyfriend is perfect, he's never cheated on me or treated me wrong. I developed terrible trust issues and relationship anxiety with a couple of guys I had dated before my boyfriend, and even though I truly do trust this guy, I can't seem to shake the feelings because I just always expect the worst out of people.

My boyfriend doesn't go out much at all, but when he does, it's always with his friend group that lives 30-45 minutes away. Since he doesn't have his own car right now, his friends pick him up and he stays out at one of his friends' house every month or so for about 2-3 days.

I know they play video games a lot usually when he's out there, but this time I know he's going to be partying with them. He's not a huge drinker, but all of his friends are and that's basically all they do every weekend. We're all 21 now, so I know they'll probably take him out to a bar.

How do I not get all jealous over this kind of stuff? When he's gone, I literally just sit and obsess about what he's doing, even though I know he's just with his friends. It especially makes it hard because he's going to be gone for a few days. I don't want to outwardly act like something's wrong with me, but I have terrible anxiety and I can't control my feelings.

I think it's also worth noting that I don't have many friends. I recently just cut ties with my friend group because they were toxic. However, those were the friends that were always down to be out and go out whenever. It made it easier to get my mind off of my boyfriend being out with people, but now I have no one it seems.",06Sep2017,3

I got to know about his past, his fears, and what he wants. He asked me out and we've been dating for 8 months now.  I've been slowly trying to open up to him. Lately however it feels like it's pointless. He belittles me when frustrated and I don't understand something, his humour is rather dark (sometimes I worry he's  slightly psychotic), and always wants me to pick up the bill when we go eat. Those are his flaws, he has a nice side to him (which I fell in love with) he can be extremely generous and thoughtful. He wants to change the world and make it a better place. And he cares about me and has been a good boyfriend overall.


Sorry if this post is all over the place. I feel like I purposely sabotage most of my possible relationships by pointing out the flaws of the other person.

144,"31/M/non-white American.

I followed a pretty unconventional life course in my 20s. I lived in a very isolated place in a foreign country, where I had basically no life, spent almost all of my free time psychologically recovering from my very depressing work, had no meaningful emotional support, and made nearly no money. Due to low self-worth, a ""go with the flow"" approach to life, and a manipulative boss, I ended up staying for 4 years in what can be best described as a bad marriage, except with no spouse. I was promised a large sum of money for a project on which I worked alone for 18 months straight, but that later turned out to be a lie. During this time, much of my old passions and social network faded away, as you can imagine.

I left that place last year to stay with my parents before I decided I was done with the US for various reasons, and set off on another adventure, this time with no job lined up beforehand. I decided to come to Southeast Asia. I had some money saved up that would have hardly lasted one season in a major American city, but was more than enough to live quite well in this part of the world. I picked up some remote work along the way that is making me slightly-more-than-enough money given my current very simple lifestyle, but the income fluctuates from month to month, so to rely on what I have now will only remain sustainable for so long.

I feel like I have finally started to take control of my life, and I want to keep up this momentum, but I lack direction to some extent. While I wouldn't say that my life is a *completely* blank slate, here are some basic bullet points about my situation:

- Would like to continue splitting my time between Vietnam and India

- No SO

- Not interested in marriage or kids

- No social circle, no friends in physical proximity

- No debt

- Money-wise, above survival level but not enough to invest in profitable things

Do you have any ideas for how I could take my life to the next level? Book recommendations are also welcome. I could provide a little more information about myself, but honestly, I am just curious to hear random (serious) ideas, so I'll leave it at this.

154,"I feel like I have to rant right now. I feel like I have a very good marriage, but sometimes she's so incredibly needy despite everything I do for her, and sometimes it just wears me down.

We both have about an hour commute to work, but I start an hour before her, so she calls me every day on both of her commutes just to talk. I'm *really* not a phone person but I deal with it because I love her. In the mornings I'm driving and usually still waking up and wanting quiet time. It's just how I am. I'm usually not in the mood for chatting first thing in the morning. In the afternoons, she usually calls me exactly as I'm getting home, after working all day, and I just want to sit and unwind instead of trying to maintain a  conversation. Conversations are usually hard to stir up for very long when you live with the person and talk to them every day, but like I said, I try.

The problem is, when we're on the phone I feel like she's always so critical of what I say. We'll be talking about some random thing and I'll say something to add to the conversation and she'll just shut it down or argue with it. Then I get slightly annoyed and stop trying to add to the conversation as much, and it gets quiet, and she starts getting annoyed because I'm not adding to the conversation, and it inevitably ends with some passive aggressive: ""Well ok I guess I'll let you go if you have nothing else to say.""

It's the most frustrating thing. I've even tried explaining this phenomenon to her, but her response is usually something like: ""We have serious problems."" Which is *not* reflective of our real life relationship. I always try to answer her calls with a positive attitude, but the second I can't maintain a conversation or it gets quiet she assumes I'm made at her, and starts to get snippy. This is the whole reason I don't like phone conversations. And even if the conversation goes well, then we have less to talk about when she gets home.

I want to get back at him at any cost, regardless of whether I take some damage in the process. I know that's probably not the sensible thing to do though. My plan is to instigate a fight tomorrow based on what happened two days ago, but what would your advice be for me to do? What would the sensible thing to do be?

169,"I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend for over 4 years and I love him very much. Initially we met when he was in the military in San Diego where I am from and a year later we moved across the country to his neck of the woods to live together. Since moving away from home I have had pretty much no luck finding happiness here. I've made no friends, I have no hobbies here, and have no interest settling down here. Almost everyday I think about moving back home but that would mean breaking up because he neither wants to move back to SD nor wants a long distance relationship. Things have been going alright for us, not perfect, but is anyone's relationship perfect after living together for 4 years? Guess the most important thing is that we are both willing to improve ourselves and the relationship, but overall I am just really unhappy being here and in turn it is negatively affecting the relationship. I'm really just trying to figure out what I want to do and what is going to make me the happiest but I don't want to hurt him in doing so, he makes me happy, but living here does not. Not to mention moving back home would mean turning my life upside down, i.e. finding a new job, hauling all my stuff cross country, breaking off long-term relationship. ",06Sep2017,5

171,"I'm a generally antisocial guy, and I think I've narrowed it down to a few reasons, and one of them is my height (for reference, I'm 5'6)

When I was in India for vacation for a month, I was noticeably taller than the family and friends we were visiting. I looked down at them (physically of course, not disrespectfully), my voice could be heard cause I could project it easier, people quietened and listened when I spoke, my posture got better cause I was standing up straight cause I was confident about my height. Around the local people, I could talk to girls easier, they wouldn't give me weird looks and actually liked talking to me. People would voluntarily walk and sit with me. It was amazing. I had never felt this powerful before.

But when I went back to the UK where I live, it all went to shit again. I'm the shortest person in my year group at school, and once again I was overshadowed by these 6 foot masculine giants. Whenever I approached girls they looked at me like I was some gremlin. I got pushed around in crowds, no one could hear me in conversations, and my posture is awful now that I feel less confident and even more tiny. I'm the one that people look down on. I feel suffocated by all these tall attractive guys walking around. It doesn't help that girls (in general) prefer taller guys anyway, and it also doesnt help that I'm Indian, so I look like one of those creepy guys on r/indianpeoplefacebook

176,"I currently live in North America with my bf and I am making about 76K/year. He is at about 50K/year. 

&amp;nbsp;
My dad is looking into retiring soon and asked me to manage it. He would train me for a year or two and eventually I will take over. He has been asking me to do this for about 2+ years now. He is offering me a manager's share which is 20% of profits, which at the very least is 234K/year. 

&amp;nbsp;
I mean it feels like a no brainer, I'd be pretty much set. However, it is a HUGE move. I'd have to move to Asia. 

&amp;nbsp;
I've made a pros/cons list, but still struggling with the decision. Reasons to move would be: $, Near family, flexible holiday, more opportunities for future kids, more business opportunities in general, cheap travel, work independence, no winter, we'd have help, lower cost of living. Reasons not to move would be: traffic, stiffling community we live in, crappy internet, the heat, mosquitos (huge for my bf because he gets very allergic reactions), poverty, distance from bfs family (17 hours away instead of 10), rocky relationship with my mom, very hot for our furry dog, lack of friends that we truly connect with, language barrier (mostly for my boyfriend). I am finally eligible for citizenship where I live now which was a huge reason I wasn't willing to move previously. 


I also have no idea what my bf would do. To make good money there, you pretty much need to be an expat who is brought in by a company or have your own business. Working a job would mean at most $1K/month salary. Not that I think we'd be short of money, but I worry about his self esteem if he's making so much less.

I also know that I want to pursue grad school and I've had some better options west (more arts centered work) than the east (tech/medical; I am horrible at any math and science due to difficulties when I was younger; long story)

I live in NC and I really don't have much to apply for but cold sales jobs. Please understand I've done this work and it depresses me to no end. I've been conned into countless work that was disguised as promising but ended up selling internet packages to people who clearly are not and never going to be interested

I want to get into QA/ community management/customer service for the video game industry. And where I am working now, my contract is going to expire in September (basically I'll be jobless with loans and bills to pay), most of the people I am close with here are getting engaged/moving on with their own lives, or leaving the state, and someone very important to me is looking to move away as well. 

Basically I have nothing where I live in NC so why stay? I've always wanted to try new things, and explore new worlds and I feel as if I'm young now, I need to go do, and stop talking about it.

I'm 23 years old, female and I live with my mom and uncle and after a few arguments and tears my mom is starting to open up to helping me move out on my own and she wants to help. This is a good time to try and pop the clutch and make things happen and soon. 

I have put in for over 100 jobs in the last 2-3 days for internships with Sony, Ubisoft, Apple, Facebook, Reddit even, and smaller companies looking for immediate work. I'm ready to just start...living. Where I am now, and it affecting my mood and mental health is just unacceptable. It's affecting my sleep, I hardly can make it through a meal sometimes. Some days, I'm fine and doing well.

I guess I'm just looking for some solid advice on where to go, who to talk to and what should I do. Should I have a conversation with some of the people I know who are leaving? I don't want them to feel like I'm following them around or anything but where I am feels like a dead end. 

In terms of work, not to brag or anything but I'm super easy to train, I could do literally anything and learn it fast if someone taught me. 
I don't want to give up on anything, from jobs to a personal future, I'm super persistent and perseverance is a trait I pride myself on having.   If I want it or want you, even if that means dropping everything to pursue it, I'll do it or try within my powers to at least try.

Additionally, I am realistic. So I'm not looking to chase fairy tales and false hopes, if there are none. Thanks. I needed to get this off my chest

As a result of this, I've been making online dating profile after online dating profile. Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid, Match, you name it I've tried it.

I'm trying so hard and staying after school every day. I'm still only barely passing though.

I want to study BIS Multimedia and I did qualify for the 4 year course but I just couldn't and after weeks of struggling I finally got a reply to my email that said that they don't teach the 4 year course anymore. I'm so completely fucked, the 3 year course has much higher requirements.

There were so many things I was so slow to catch on to, that so many other kids seemed to grasp instantly. So many things I would hang on to for days post-failure guiltily regretting my actions.

I never had that incessant need to learn, the mental speed, urgency, determination, and foresight required for most things- or the confidence to pull through with what would be deemed necessary.

Over time, it seems that I have dug myself a hole too deep to escape from. I feel ashamed of my past actions, and despite my best efforts- the cycle only repeats itself.

Growing up, I was very sheltered- I was always told: ""You have time..."" That confidence and self-worth kids get from personal independence never happened.

They basically just clean what they have to in order to cook, but avoid the rest of it. The worst part is the laundry room.

So the only way for me to learn about being a man was through my surroundings, which were not positive at all. My peers were getging high and running around the streets since like 1st grade. Everything was about being tough and bad. I was never too deep into trouble. I mostly just chilled and played video games and shit. I was the cool guy( as in i was a good guy and most people liked me beacuse i wouldnt act tough to fit in) from the neighborhood. The only times i would do bad shit was just for money not because i really wanted too. Eventhough i was accepted, i still felt like an outcast my whole life because there was never no one like me. I either had to hang out with the super nerdy kids(no offense, i love them to death) or the street dudes. But in reality i was neither. I just want to hang out with regular people who are into film, music, and just art and enjoying life. Its so hard for me though because of my old neighbor hood. I was raised to never show emotions cause you cant trust people in the streets. Also i started smoking weed and drinking alot to take the pain away. I stopped going to school and im a fucking loser now. I dont know what to do. I want to start going to nice places where they have museums and shit like that, but its in my head that im a kid from the hood and i dont belong there. Its harder cause the people i used to call friends wont do anything positive. They just want to keep fucking around in the streets, so i cut them off. I feel so lonely. Its hard for me to make friends because of my trust issues, and because i dont relate to normal people. For example there was this cute girl i met but while she talked to me about how she loved an amusement park all i could talk about was the stories i remembered from hanging out doing dumb shit in my old neighborhood. I feel so alone and i know a girlfriend, or a new group of positive friends would help but i just dont know where to start. What do you think i should do???????

Oh yeah , the reason i said i felt like my life was about to end is because most of the guys i looked up to on my block didnt make it past their 20s. They were either murdered, locked up, or just gave up in life and survive day by day however they can, and i dont want to end up the same.",06Sep2017,1

208,"I'm 15 years old and live in Germany. My parents, my 3 siblings and I are/were refugees from Chechnya. 

My father is an abusive narcissist. He used to beat and emotionally abusive me, my older sister, my mother and somewhat my younger brother. 

He doesn't anymore, but is still, sometimes, verbally abusive and really controlling and power hungry.

211,"Long story but I live in a 3 bedroom house - rent is separated out by number of people - not by room size (i.e. everyone pays $750.).  One of the roommates has a girlfriend that is over CONSTANTLY.  

I get home from work...she's there.
Getting ready for work in the morning... she's still sleeping and/or getting in our shower to get ready.
I see her do laundry at our place.
She does all the cooking for him so they share food in our kitchen and are constantly extra bodies in the kitchen/living room.  At one point, my boyfriend and I would even come home to JUST her in the house cooking, tv on, laundry going...

A roommate moved out not too long ago so my bf and I approached him about her moving in.  She's 32, lives with her mom, steady job, and a brand new Jeep (so clearly, not doing too bad).  Roommate replied that they wanted to travel and save money so now wasn't a good time (uh, hello? Bf and I live together in our mid 20s and want to travel too...)
Eventually I put my foot down and sent a long, elaborate text explaining why it wasn't fair for her to not contribute with everything she is using and how often she is over. He was super cordial and friendly with his response saying how glad we were to point it out and he apologized. Felt great.

2 weeks later, we are back to the normal 6+ days she is over a week (minus her having a key and coming and going as she pleases so that's a plus) but he's still not getting the point of rent is paid per person, not room so her extra body is living for free when we are paying $900 a month.

I have become a savage and have yelled at her from the other room to go home, I've tried to make her as uncomfortable as possible getting in her way and making it less of a convenience to constantly be at our house, and really am at a loss on how to get them to see the point and how DISRESPECTFUL it is.  It especially irks me because, as mentioned, my boyfriend and I live there sharing a room for $1500 while she is essentially living for free.

213,"Seeking advice on a situation and how I should handle what's turned out to be an absolute nightmare. The obvious answer is leave the gym and don't come back but it's 2 blocks from my house and the only facility within walking distance of me or the public transit I take to work. I chose my apartment partially to be closer to this gym as it's the best equipped gym in the city and it's ~$50 cheaper than the next best/closest options.


Earlier this summer I was on Instagram and I stumbled on an account that had photos of people from my gym. Some were clearly consensual and meant in good humor, however I saw photos and a video that were clearly of my butt (clothed) with insulting captions and nasty gesturing. It's around now that my anxiety kicks in and I start panic working. After searching through all the followers of the Instagram and reading through comments and captions I narrowed it down to one person from the group of people that was there that morning who matched the writing patterns and emoji analysis (seriously) I saw.


I immediately emailed the general manager screenshots who looped in the owners and we went back and forth after I identified the folks who were present that morning and commenting on the posts. He emailed me back 4 minutes later apologizing and promising to resolve this. I tried going to the gym in the morning and had pretty severe anxiety anytime I was near the people there that morning. After that I rescheduled some late meetings to go in the afternoons.
A few days later the owner and I were able to meet face to face and discuss what happened. Very nice guy, clearly good intentions and he asked for my input. He told me that when confronted the person who took the photos immediately admitted it and took down the account (made it private). I told him I was very concerned with a gym culture where one person could think it was ok to take photos of strangers without their consent with captions like ""This Bitch."" I talked through how if it had happened on the street I would not have been upset but the fact that it happened where I felt safe and where I thought I could let loose and relax while I was working out. He agreed that it was a breach of trust and culture and that it was a priority that this never happen again and he told me ""[that person] is gone, I've known [person] for years and this is unacceptable."" I told him that it was very comforting and that i hoped it was just a short term lapse in judgement but I would not be comfortable working out at the same facility as this person again. He asked if I would be open to speaking with the person if they wanted to apologize and I said potentially in the future but not right away.


The person is gone and I continue working out, work is getting crazy and the only time I get to the gym is in the morning. The other people who commented or gestured in a video disappear for a few weeks then come back. Anxiety spikes up again but I keep my distance and finish my sets quickly when they're there.


Fast forward 4 weeks after the meeting with the owner and I get an email asking if I'd be open to meeting with the person who took and posted the photos. As it turns out the person was still working out at another location and had run into the owner and asked to return to the location I work out at. I told him I wasn't ready for either of those options as I was still fairly upset about the situation. I noted that we had agreed it was a massive breach of trust and culture and that I didn't even know she was working out at another facility. He sent another email pressing me to forgive this person and reconsider. I did not respond.


After that I noticed a few morning regulars and staff the person is friends with staring at me pretty consistently. Made me uncomfortable but I thought nothing of it, just crank out the work.
One week later (late last night) the owner sent an email letting me know that this person would be starting back on probation at my gym and that he was happy to explain his reasons why he decided to give her a second chance. I went to bed early an didn't see the email so when I came into the gym this morning my stomach lurched when I saw this person working out. I made a b-line for the locker room to email the owner and I read his note and sat dizzy for 20 minutes trying to figure out what to do.


Grabbed a barbell as fast as I could and took it to the far side of the gym away from the racks and platforms and worked through a minor anxiety attack. Only made it through about half of my workout because I needed the equipment from the other side but I felt sick anytime I came over.
I'm not a generally anxious person but I got bullied REALLY badly growing up from getting ""Fag"" keyed into my car to similarly embarrassing photos popping up on social media fairly consistently (came out in a really really conservative town).


On the way out I ran into the general manager and visibly fought to keep it together. I told him that I couldn't work out with this person there and explained the anxiety I'd been experiencing since finding the photos. He apologized and said he hadn't realized that the incident had caused such anxiety and that it was the owner's decision. He told me he would talk to the owner and figure out what to do by the end of the day. Still waiting on a response.


My work requires that I be focused and on for 9-12 hours per day 5-6 days per week with sometimes going 16-18 hours during events and conferences. The gym is about the only place I get to turn off and focus on something I'm really passionate about. It's safe and I get to be goofy while training with some of the strongest competitive powerlifters in the world.


At this point I REALLY don't want to leave my gym. My concern is that because he allowed this person back in and we made eye contact while I was there it will be obvious that I made the complaint personally. Given that this person is friends with a lot of the regulars and gym staff I'm worried about informal consequences that I might face. More than that I'm extremely confused by the owner's decision to allow this person back and I am at a loss for how to handle this situation.

Hello Reddit. This is my first time actually posting something here so I apologize if any of the format is messed up.

I am a wife who wants to surprise her husband with anal sex for his birthday in a little over a month. I feel a bit of backstory is necessary so I will do my best to explain. Please forgive any mistakes as English is not my first language.

the other week my husband calls me from work and asks me to pull some information off of his work laptop. During the process I saw his history and it was full of videos involving anal sex. Now before I move forward I want to say that I don't care that he watches porn, we are in fact very open to the idea of porn and watch it together even.

I know, and have known, that anal is something he is into. We have never brought it into the bedroom. He has never brought it up. In fact our sex life is pretty vanilla. Other than the occasional blowjob we stick to missionary and doggy-style vagina sex. This isn't a problem for us. I and very satisfied with our sex life and I know he is too, but I always want  to do more to please him so when I saw all the videos he has been watching I got the idea to surprise him. I had to make sure I was ready first so I decided I was going to try anal without him first to ""test the waters.""

We don't really use sex toys. I have a small vibrator that stopped working a long time ago and I don't want to use it because it isn't as big as him and for other sanitary reasons so I went to the store and got a few cucumbers that are roughly the same size and shape as him. I left them in the fridge for a few days and started doing some research on how to ease into it. I was worried about 3 things. Pain, blood and poop. Everything I read told me that blood is a little and not much poop so I figured if I prepared correctly I wouldn't have a problem.

---

(here is where it gets kind of gross)

---

So last week when my husband left for work I used the bathroom to make sure I wouldn't have any surprises and then I showered to clean myself as I would if I were to have sex with my husband. After I dry off I lay towels down in the bathroom and I clean a cucumber. I bend over and apply a generous amount of lube to both the cucumber and my anus. When I tried to put it in it hurt really bad. I took it out. No poop or blood. Just pain. I used my fingers for a bit until it wasn't uncomfortable. Again, no poop or pain. I apply more lube and try the cucumber again. It hurt, but not as bad. I let it sit and then slowly pushed it further in like the website says. After a couple more seconds of pain it didn't hurt anymore. Just a lot of pressure. I moved it in and out a bit, slowly at first and then faster (not too fast) and it actually started to feel pretty good. This lasted for about two or three minutes and then I saw a small brown streak run down my leg. I slowly pulled out the cucumber and was horrified at what I saw. There was a lot of poop on it. A little bit got in the towels i put down but most of it was on me. I don't want to get into too much details but it looked like I full on pooped my self. When I sat on the toilet nothing came out but when I wipe it is just a lot of poop (and a small bit of blood). I clean up and disinfect the bathroom and shower.

a few days ago I wanted to try again, but I figured that I would need to prepare a lot more. For 2 days I cut out all meats and eat a lot of greens with fiber. I poop and make sure I cannot poop no more and I prepare my space again (this time leaving wipes on the counter for easier cleanup just in case) and I shower. In the shower I try using my fingers again. I go as deep as I can and still no poop. I get out and start to try again. I grab another cucumber and use a lot of lube. The results are the same. Hurts at first then feels good but when I stop there is still a lot of poop. This was yesterday.

---

So my question is this: What am I doing wrong? Most articles say there is no poop, but in my case there is so much and no amount of cleaning or prepping I have done even lessens the amount. Does anyone have similar experience as me? What have you done that helped?

217,"      The fact that I made a reddit account just to ask for an advice about this says how much this means to me.
Im serious and I think this is worth to be read. 
(My English isn't the best)
         I've been with a girl for 1 year and 7 months now. She was 14 when I met her. It took a long time till we get in a relationship and we were both very happy beingh with each other. Because I was a bit older (17 now and 16 then) and she never had a boyfriend before I was the person in the relationship who had to do all the job, so I did it. Learning her how to kiss , hug , hold hands and everything. She was living with her mother, because her father died in an accident , so I took care to help to her family  even with a small things (mostly technology). My girl was very childish, she was wearing funny clothes , acting like a small kid, she had a low self esteem and my target was to make it different. So for the next year and months we had a lot of break ups and difficult times. But at the end everything was achieved. She was looking like a real women , she was very good looking with a lot of confidence. But fuck it , for a reasons (most of them stupid and pointless to argue about) we have a lot of break ups and we cant just get over being not with each other , we always search for one another and we get get in a relationship again. Today she came back from a vacation (7 day) , I was very happy to see her and taste her lips and feel her big hugs , but in the end of the day , she broke with me for a stupid reason saying that Im guilty and that pissed me a lot. I went home and she messaged me some insults , she said to me that she is tired of everything. I told to myself that I wont insult her, I wont scream at her or type stupid things , I told to myself that I will be nice to her and just stay calm down or at least pretend that I am. Give me an advice how to get over it and forget her or at least wait some days , because I know she will be the one apologizing to me. 


Edit: When we break up , because of her confidence that I gave her she is super rude and dont give a fuck.",06Sep2017,0

220,"**TL;DR** Do I need to give my ex closure? If so, how?



When you Google that, most if not all results are shown for How to GET closure. But the person on the other end might need help giving it.
How do I give closure to my ex? Or, rather, do I NEED to give him closure at this point when I thought I already had? 


Let me explain:


My ex and I had been together for 6.5 years. I had tried ending things a total of 3 times. 


The first, I was in another country studying abroad. He ended up crying on Skype and begging me to tell him that i didnt love him which would have been a lie.


The second, it was in person at his house. Failed because of bad communication and him being able to talk me back into staying.


The third and final time was a little over a week ago. I wrote him a letter and sent it to him in a message. 

Our mutual friend has said the following things to me:


""He told me at this point he's figured it's over. He just wants closure.
so, eventually someday you'll be able to give him that.
but i think he'd like closure where he can actually tell you how he feels and where you can tell him how you feel without you sending a word doc to him and then disappearing""


I didnt just write a word doc and disappear. In fact, he wrote a letter back to me and it was all cordial. And we even texted back and forth for a while. (Which has stopped since yesterday because it was giving him hope that we would get back together.) I thought it was pretty clear that he fucked up this time. Also, I told him everything he needed to know during our second breakup. 


So I'm just guessing he wants me to answer the question ""If you still love me then why arent we working on our issues?"" He and I had a very codependent relationship and I'm just not sure how to give him this closure whenever I see him again.",06Sep2017,1
222,"Hey all,  
I need some help sorry for the wall of text I'm not the best at Reddit.   
Anyway I'm stuck and because of those involved I can't really turn anywhere else for help.  
I'll just dive in. I have had a roommate since April, whom have known for 2 years, and I knew going in that she had what I thought was a crush on me but I was seeing someone and really needed a roommate. Now enter my best friend, from the start I could see he thought my roommate was attractive  but he too was in a realtionship. Then a few months ago I am suddenly single and after a long day of intoxication my roommate professes her love for me. We end up falling into bed that night and are now in this awkward relationship because we live together right away. When I had to leave for a week my now girlfriend was feeling down so I suggested she hang out with my best friend, who was recently broken up with, because they both were bored and don't have many friends. Now they are friends and talk semi frequently.  I recently got out of a long term relationship and one not so long term one so honestly I'm not stoked to be back in one. Before you say I should have avoided it in the first place let me tell you I thought I had strong feelings for this girl but i can see now I was trying to match her affection level because I do care about her just not like that. These days I see her more as a roommate and friend.  I can tell my friend likes her and he brought up how similar they were just last night, although to make a joke about how I'm dating him. The thing is I think they would be a great couple and I would love for them to go out. The problem is I don't know how she feels about him but I think her attraction to me might be dropping. The thing is I cannot afford my place alone and I'm nervous.",06Sep2017,1
223,"This is gonna be a hard one for me to formulate. I'm 23 years old, not bad looking, not necessarily unconfident, not depressed except for short phases every now and then. My life's going a good way, i'm proud of a lot of things and i have a lot of friends, a couple really close ones aswell. Overall, nothing too special but i'm rather satisfied with how everything is going and that also shows in how i behave socially. However, whenever I get into closer contact with girls, i tend to very easily fall into very weird behaviour patterns. I don't feel like this is just a typical ""i'm not good at handling girls / i always fall in love too easy"" issue, but rather something more complicated. I feel like, behind the way I behave, there is a deeper reason that I just can't figure out. Let me give you an example. For a while now I have been meeting up with a girl, we're basically having a friends with benefits relationship kind of thing. When it started off, i was very unsure if I even wanted to get with her, i found her reasonably attractive, but her character wasn't really matching with mine at all. However, when we had a talk about what we're expecting from the whole thing and she told me she'd rather stick to a sex-relationship, i felt bad. It felt like it hurt my ego, in the sense of ""I'm not relationship material"". Partly understandable, i guess. Yet, after that, I keep finding myself overthinking messages I had with her, jumping on the train when she asks if I wanna do something else (apart from sex) and hoping, subconciously, that she actually DOES want more. At the same time, I'll find myself starting to act very weird, behave ""Diva-ish"" in like be very annoyed over small things so she gets a bad conscience, try not texting her for a couple days so she feels like i'm not interested and fights for it, making unappropriate comments in order to make her feel a little bad and make her look up to me. After all, behaviour i disgust and don't want to represent and usually also don't do. Very much passive-agressive behavior. At the same time tho, I often don't even feel like meeting up with her and have to convince myself of doing it and often the only reason I do is the urge to have sex or the hope that she does / says something that hints to her wanting more. But i'm not even sure i'd want more, I think if she did want more i'd just flake out. So, my emotions get me into a place that whatever I do i will eventually be unhappy with it. I try to take time for myself, just sit down, confront me and my emotions, try to look behind them and see what i really want / hope for, but I always end up feeling like I'm stuck. I hope i somehow lined out my problem and maybe someone has some advice for me. This whole concept also always happened to me when i got closer with a girl, the more she gives in and reacts to my manipulations the more i push her away by getting even more manipulative. The momentanous relationship actually is very similar to one i had 6 or 7 years ago, where i didn't even have sex with the girl and it scares me that i haven't made any progress since then.. One thought of mine was trying to hook up with someone else and get to meeting other girls, but i feel like whenever i actually TRY doing that, i just seem very desperate and become very unsuccessfull.
Sorry for the long text, I hope it's understandable.

226,"Hi! I was pondering the above question for quite some time, so I decided to consult Reddit's collective mind.

Let me give you a little more background. I am 25 y.o., living in a first world country, average looking and earning quite a lot. So basically I have almost limitless possibilities, with just a few exceptions.

For the past few years, including now I was working on my career. I do this just because I can't answer this question, and it's better than doing nothing. But I don't feel like I achieve anything, I want to make a choice.

So, to the problem. It is not that I'm not interested in anything or not wanting to do anything. On the contrary, I am interested in almost anything, would like to try everything, achieve everything and basically live multiple lives. And that's impossible. Especially in the current world of 7 bln people, where often mastering even a subfield of a knowledge field is impossible.

So how can I devote myself to becoming a top-class neurosurgeon if I know, that then I won't have a chance to become a soldier, a criminal mastermind, a chef or basically anything. Anything is interesting, even going to the jungle and trying to survive there. Even if I made one choice, and I liked it, I would still feel the burden of all the other possibilities I didn't get to experience.

On the other hand if I don't devote myself to anything, that means that I won't use the only life I've got on something. So I need to make a choice somehow.

I even experience the choice problem on a small scale. It hurts me that even trying out every food in my local supermarket would take me at least a year. There's only so much you can taste, read, learn and experience in your life, and it hurts me that it's just a tiny fraction of everything this world has to offer.

So, maybe some of you had some thoughts on the matter, know some philosophical system that addressed this or just have an idea how to choose what to do with your life and feel happy about it.",06Sep2017,1

232,"Currently, I'm a senior in High School, though I'm taking a couple of classes, A+ certification preparation and Computer Networking, at a local community college. Today is the last day I can drop with a refund, and I'm not sure if I should. 

Oh, also, today is the final day to drop out, so I need to decide soon.

To start, I'm not paying for this class. Because I'm still in High school, the district is actually covering the class. That said, I went into the class with the understanding that everything would be fully covered, but was informed a couple days after the class started that they won't pay for my textbook or course materials. This would be fine, but I have to get the $120 textbook, and I have to pay for over $250 for practice tests. So, in order for me to take this class I was told would be free, I now have to pay over $350, though that's not a big deal. 

The instructor in A+ certification hasn't exactly impressed me thus far. In class, all we've done is read out of the textbook and do the activities in it, and there has been a ridiculous amount of homework thus far. 

The entire course just follows the textbook, so I could just leave the class and do the exact same work in my own time, without having to deal with the teacher. The class doesn't even pay for A+ certification, so regardless, I would have to go do that in my own time weather I stick with the class or not. Plus, transportation has been a major issue for me, so it would make life substantially easier if I didn't have to go to two different schools. 

On top of it all, my high school schedule conflicts with the college one, so being in this class means that I miss out on quite a few different opportunities. I'll be missing out on trips and various classes that I want to take. 

The problem I have is that, if I drop A+ Certification prep, I would also have to drop Computer Networking because it has prerequisites that I wouldn't meet without A+, and that other class has actually been extremely good thus far. Not only that, but it's been fairly useful, and in these short few weeks, I've learned far more than I have in a long time. 

If I could only have the Networking class, there wouldn't be nearly as many scheduling conflicts for me, and I would have a much better time, but unfortunately, I have to choose between taking both or taking neither.

234,"I'm lost in a bad way, not sure what's next in life. I didn't get into the school I applied to, would have been my third year in college. I'm not too upset about it because it was really going down hill.

Since I found out I didn't get into school, I've been going about my days...doing nothing. I don't want to work a 9-5 and get trapped into a job I hate life other people.

I passionate about writing and digital art. Been told I'm pretty good, tried to put these skills into working freelance, but that hasn't gone great, ie: no one want to hire a no body.

Most recently I thought about just packing up and leaving my house. I don't have anything here tying me down, but I don't want to end up on the streets. Then I got the idea to work on a farm somewhere in return for free room and board, which is a thing that exist. 

Maybe I'm just trying to find myself or some shit, I don't know...I'm just so lost since things didn't go as planned. If I left I would have no where to go and I don't want that.

235,"Hello everyone

I took an online class at a Community College last Spring. Long story short, I failed the course due to misunderstanding the syllabus and not completing work that was critical to my grade. 

I met with the professor who was extremely understanding and could tell by the work I actually turned in that I was a better student than my grade reflected. I'm planning to attend a 4 year institution this Fall and the professor offered to write me a letter of recommendation-style statement for me to give to Admissions basically saying that I'm not a total dipshit and I'm definitely capable of being successful in college level courses. 

Anyways: this professor is pretty busy and would prefer that i craft up a few sentences so that he can sign off on it before I bring it to Admissions. Unfortunately I'm drawing a blank in terms of what to actually say. I'm not trying to come off like a complete asshole by saying I'm a genius and should be at Harvard, since I'm not and I shouldn't, but I want this statement/letter to reflect that despite the grade I earned in his class I'm intelligent and can handle the workload of legitimate coursework. 


If you have any ideas about what I should include, I would really appreciate hearing them. Thanks guys!!!

239,"            I'm 16 years old and one of the only people in my group of friends that has never had a girlfriend. I occasionally get teased for that, but it's all I'm good fun. Anyways, I've been best friends with this girl I met on Facebook since we were 12 years old (we are both 16 years old now). We were friends for the better part of a year before I started developing a small crush on her. Nothing big, really. I saw her face for the first time and thought she was hella cute. I was little and naive and I didn't really know how to approach the whole situation. I ended up telling her at age 13 that I thought she was cute. She was flattered and said the same thing about me, and that was the end of it. We started talking more and more, over both Facebook and Xbox and I found myself doing the one thing I had told myself not to do: I started falling in love with her. 
              
      Hanging out with her, even if it was only through Xbox, made me feel happier than ever. It took a couple years before I finally told her how I felt. A few months after I turned 16, I told her how I felt. I poured my heart out to her; told her everything. Told her how my thoughts would always drift over to her when I'm supposed to be doing homework. I told her that when I hear her voice over the Xbox microphone, I always get butterflies. I told her that her personality was the most unique and amazing personality I'd ever seen. I told her I loved her. She seemed to be very surprised by me admitting this, and didn't OPENLY return those feelings. She said she doesn't know the meaning of love, but that she really REALLY likes me. However, I feel as though that's changing. 
           
     Apparently, her parents are incredibly over protective and would ""freak out"" and ""separate us if they found out that we talked on anything other than Xbox."" We secretly messaged each other on Instagram. We actually messaged each other almost every day and we'd talk for HOURS. But recently, she blocked my Instagram account with NO explanation whatsoever. I tried talking about it over the Xbox, but her parents seem to be in the room 100% of the time, so she never talks about it. I dunno why she blocked me; don't even have a clue. But it gets worse. 
             
     I thought for a while that her parents would freak out if she talked to me on Instagram and shit like that because they've never met me in real life. However, we were talking with one of our mutual friends over Xbox not long ago (he is 17, so only slightly older than us) and he said something that reeeeally spiked my interest. He was talking about texting her; he said things like ""Hey, check the picture I just sent you."" He said her name in that sentence, so it was OBVIOUSLY directed towards her. She got kinda quiet after that, and so did I. My mind was racing. She told me it was too dangerous to text because of her parents...but she'd never met this other guy. I mean, she's never met me in real life, but she's never met him either. What's the difference between me and him? Why is it dangerous for me and her to talk but not for him and her? I brushed it off as me overreacting, however, I discovered something ELSE last night. 
            
      I was supposed to be sleeping for school, but instead, I got on Facebook. Keep in mind that my Facebook was deactivated when I was 13 for reasons I'd rather not get into and my parents just recently allowed me to have it back. I told her ""If I ever got my Facebook back, would it be dangerous to reconnect on there?"" She quickly replied with a ""Yes"" and that was that. Anyways, I decided to see if her profile was still up on there and, sure enough, it was. I was looking through some of her old pictures (simply to see if I could find some that I had seen of her before, just for a trip down memory lane if you follow me) and I found a name on one of her posts. It wasn't a comment, they just liked the post. Guess who's name it was? That fucker from Xbox. You know, the guy that told her to check her phone? The guy she's never met? The parents who would apparently lose their shit if they found out him and her were talking? Yeah. That guy. 
             
    So basically, she can talk to anyone she met online EXCEPT me. Why is that? I dunno, but I was up damn near all night thinking about it. I got shit for sleep last night. I'm homeschooled, so there's not a specific time I have to get up, but I slept through 3 alarms and woke up at 12:30 instead of 9 like I had intended. Maybe I'm overreacting, maybe I'm not. I really need some advice here, though. Thank you if you somehow managed to read this entire thing. 😂😂 Anyone got advice? I've been thinking about confronting her, but I'm not sure that's the right call. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! (By the way, it won't let me space out the top paragraph for some reason. Not sure what's up with that.)",06Sep2017,0

Over the last few days though, I've had the urge to make a drastic change. Some people hate change but I WANT change. I also don't want to make some rash decision over possibly fleeting feelings. 

If it were reasonable, I'd sell my house, quit my job and move  far away to experience new things but it's not.  

SO suggested finding a hobby I'd enjoy but I don't even know *what* I'd like to do. Maybe I just need a vacation to recharge and refresh.

241,"So first off, this isn't about disappointing my parents so much. I'm 17 years old and I graduated high school a whole year only. I'm working as a merchandiser at a local retailer, 40 hours a week. On top of that, I have 5 online college classes (all paid for by scholarships). So basically 2 full time things, school and work.


I like to play games and I record and make youtube videos and stream to twitch. I find that stuff fun and that's ultimately what I want to do in the future as my career. (I'm very determined to get whatever goal I set, so please don't try and tell me it's too hard). Since I want this to be my goal, I have to put in a lot of work, this essentially takes up all my time outside of work and my college classes online.


Then I have karate, which is only 2 hours on Monday and Wednesday. It's not one hat you've seen before, it's atleast 6+ years to get your black (im only blue belt). The instructor is in the world's hall of fame, so there are no little kids that have black belts, I think the youngest was 19. I joined 7 years ago because I used to get bullied. I was made to go by my parents at first and then I could keep doing it if I enjoyed it. I did, so I stayed for 4 years, then I was taking 2 college classes while still in high school and a part time job, so I temporarily quit karate for roughly 5 months. Then I came back and it was quite refreshing, then I quit about 6 months later. This time, I thought I was completely done, I never wanted to go and I was skipping a lot. Not to mention it's $700 a year. But I came back in June, which was about 1 year since I quit. I enjoyed it, but now it's only 3 months later and I'm already not wanting to go.


I am friends with all the people there (they're like 40-60 years old except one 20ish. Before I was the instructors favorite student (maybe not) because there were days when I was the only one who came because it was close to a holiday. I was really good and maybe still am. A lot of those older people look up to me to teach them and show them stuff and I don't want to quit for a 3rd time. I feel like I'm letting them down. Now I never feel like going, but when I do go, it's refreshing.


I think part of the reason is because I've messed up the creed twice before I quit the 2nd time. It's like our motto that we say at the beginning of class and he picks someone at the beginning to say it. And frankly, it's really embarrassing when you screw that up. It's like 50 words or so, not super long but still. This is why I enjoy it after I actually get there, but I never feel like going before. Another reason is because I feel like I just don't have enough time to actually relax and I'm always stressing about college or youtube (not work because it's easy, it just takes up so much time). I don't have any free time anymore, and when I try and have some free time to watch a movie, hang out with friends, etc, I get screwed by time and get behind on youtube or school. Plus all that time taken up by my full time life means it's harder for me to find time to practice karate. (Which is a must to get better and learn)",06Sep2017,1
242,"Think about one of the good looking girls you know and then imagine if she had a dick. That's me. I used to be scared to tell people I was a transsexual but now I'm showing my dick to people.

So this guy I was sort of into was flirting with me often, eventually he wanted to know if I really truly didn't want to make love, why I always turn him down. So I admitted I had a dick. He was shocked for a bit, then it got to the point where he would say mine is bigger than his and that's completely sexy.

So basically breaking off our relationship, he decided to give me a ""reward"" for a favor. He wanted to pay me like 500$ to jack off and cum on his back porch while he recorded it. I took the deal and well... he didn't actually pay me. He said he didn't think I'd accept and deleted tiphe video in front of me. 

Now he wants me to be in the living room when his parents leave and he will bring my sister in ""accidentally"" while I'm jerking off, he says she already likes me but when she sees that, plus how big I am, she'll probably let me fuck her like at that moment. He says it's the reward since I didn't get the money and that I can close her door so it's private.

I don't know what to do, in my opinion, I want to actually take it. I'm a virgin, I want to see what sex feels like. And I'd maybe get a friend with benefits. Is this wrong though? Should I just stop here and give up this? Any advice for me before tomorrow? ",06Sep2017,0

So a few months ago I was talking to this girl on snapchat (we had been talking for awhile now) when she all of a sudden blocked me. So I had created a new snapchat to ask why she blocked that one so I did again and finally got a response and then blocked again I ended up creating 5 snap chats to find out why she blocked me and she said that her boyfriend didn't like me. But I was aware that she didn't have one and she blocked me again then her friend had messaged me telling me to leave her alone so I did and then I decided to apologize for what I did and asked her if we were still friends and she said yes then I asked her if she could unblock and then she blocked that account. 

So now school has started up again and I see her a few times during the day. I also had created a twitter recently and added her on there an I wasn't blocked so my question is...

256,"So long story short about my past: I went to college for 3 semesters and dropped out because the usual ""college life"" wasn't something I could responsibly handle at that period of my life. I've worked low wage jobs since then, but things took an upturn 3 years ago when I started working in irrigation. I went from making $10 an hour to now making roughly $40k a year.

I have a girlfriend who I want to start a life with, we're both 30, but she's unable to work and has been fighting for disability for a few years now. We currently live with her mother since she'll let me stay for cheap rent, but we want to be on our own to start a family. We're working on reducing my debts so I can save money.

The big issue is I need advice on bettering my ceiling for a career. School vs. trade. If I go back to school, we'll likely have to stay here with her mom for the entire duration, which will put us at 33-34 before we can really get out on our own. Sacrificing heavily short term for the long term. I will be studying electrical engineering if that matters.

If I go the trade route (electrician), I will take a minor pay cut until I work my way to journeyman, where I will be making roughly $65k per year before any potential overtime. It's less hindrance now, but is worse long term. My main issue with this is, I have old injuries that are already starting to become arthritic and I don't want to hit 50 and just not be able to do this anymore.

I'm not sure what is the best route. Writing it all down makes me think just go back to school, but I'm honestly not sure. What do you think?",06Sep2017,1
257,"Hi everyone,
I've been thinking about ending my friendship with my best friend (I don't think she cares tbh). I feel like this friendship is one sided and she hangs out with people that intentionally hurt me. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but let me know what you think. We met in middle school and has been best friend until about high school.

In high school, I introduced her to this one girl I knew in class. The three of us hung out together and we were a group of friends. After a year, that girl back stabbed me and burned my hand in cooking class. My best friend knew about this and continued to hang out with her like nothing is wrong. That girl eventually kicked me out of my own group and I was alone.

After high school, I dated this guy who cheated on me. I didn't find out until after we broke up. During our break up, he exploded and called me a lot of mean words (bitch, pathetic piece of shit, go fuck yourself etc.) Our mutual group of friends cut me out without saying a word. I went into depression and therapy because I had to cope with a shitty break up and losing friends at that time. She knew about this and still continued to hang out with them like nothing happened. She even continued to talk to my cheating ex even though she hates cheater (her ex cheated on her). She doesn't even care how he(they) treated me. Btw, I introduced her to the group.

A year later, I found out why they cut me out from someone else. It was because of the break up and it was awkward talking to me. I told my best friend &amp; she said ""yeah, I know."" I was a bit angry because when I went through depression, I wanted to know what I did wrong &amp; confided her with everything. She knew all along and didn't say a word to me. 

Even after that, I've tried to ask her when should we see each other again she said she's busy. One time, I asked her to hang out and she told me she's going a family thing. I went on Snapchat and saw her at a friend's party a minute after she told me she's going to a family thing.

Last year, I got her a sweater she really wanted for her birthday (it was expensive). I constantly asked her when to hang out, so I can give her the gift. I came over to dropped off the sweater and she told me she has plans and we should hang out another time. She also forgot my birthday and told me ""your gift is lost in the mail"" and she never mentioned about it again.

I'm starting to feel used, but I don't know if I'm overreacting. Let me know what you think.

258,"I have(had) a friend where a fall out occurred and I want to know if I should try rectify the situation or not. 
We grew up in the same small town and got rather close a few years ago but we got even closer when we both moved to different places. Even though our friendship was mainly over text as we lived in different cities, I considered her one of my best friends and vice versa as we shared so many things in common and talked over text pretty much all day, everyday over the past 5 years with visits about once or twice a year.
My friend had last came to visit me in July 2016 - I flew her to the city I live in and brought her to see a couple concerts. Fast forward to June of this year, almost a year after our last visit I was supposed to go visit her, but this is where the problem occurs.. I live in one province (British Columbia, Canada) but work in another (Alberta, Canada) so I'm at work in Alberta for 18 days at a time and then I get 1 week off and go home to BC and during this week off I had in June, it was planned to go visit her. So that Friday I was flying home rolls around, I was to go see her and there ended up being flight delays due to stormy weather and I had to spend the night in a city until the storm cleared and I could fly out the next day. So I had to cancel our plans that night for things out of my control. The next day I fly home but then encounter another problem... the bridge to get to where I live downtown is closed due to a big accident and I'm stuck in traffic for 3 hours, therefore causing me to miss my transportation (boat) to go see her. So that's 2 days now where I've had to reschedule our plans due to a series of unfortunate events. I could tell she was pissed off and annoyed as she had made plans for us and I would be too but it was what it was - things out of my control. Keeping in mind, she is a housewife and doesn't work, I was finally able to make it that Sunday. So I tell her that Sunday I'm leaving and her response is kind of neutral in the sense of ""I'll believe it when I see it""  understandably after not being able to make it for 2 days, but our plans are still standing and off I go to the city she lives in. After a 3 hour drive and 2 hour ferry boat ride to where she lives, I get to her city and text her that I'm here. Her response is that she's with other friends right now and she'll let me know when she's free. I'm a bit annoyed at that point like, I finally made it and now you're telling me to wait while you finish what you're doing almost as if to get even for waiting on me for 2 days. Another 2 hours goes by and still nothing from her... I'm pretty much doing circles in my car waiting for her so I text her again ""hey, just checking if you're almost ready as I've been driving around aimlessly for a few hours now or should I just turn around and go home (I was being sarcastic about that part)"" but she literally says to me ""yeah, you can turn around and go home. I've been waiting for you for 2 days now and you didn't show up so I wasn't expecting you to show up today"". 
This is where I get pissed right off and end the friendship. 
1) The reason for not being able to make it Friday and Saturday were out of my control and power
2) I understand you've been waiting, but you have been waiting in your own home and haven't had to move a finger. I've been stuck in airports, sleeping in a hotel, stuck in traffic and now just travelled 5 hours to be here and YOU'RE annoyed?! and now I have to travel 5 hours back because of it????
3) I talked to her multiple times that morning, she knew I was coming. If she didn't want to, or she was fed up she should've just said so not have me travel to see her and then change her tune 
4) I have been so generous to her, not because I have to but out of kindness - I've flown her places, I've brought her to expensive concerts, I've let her and her friends that I don't know stay at my condo while I was at work. I've let her and her man drive my brand new BMW for weeks at a time while I was at work and their car was broken. One time my place was flooded due to my upstairs neighbour and I bought her and her friends a nice hotel since my place couldn't be accommodated and they were going to a show that night. 

I told her to delete my number and I never want to hear from her again... along with some not so nice words in between. 

We did have a strong friendship (or so I thought) and I think about her often but do you think I overreacted and should try and reach out or do you think she was a mean friend and me ending the friendship is justified?????",06Sep2017,1

I am taking 5 college classes online (full time plus 1 class). And I am trying to grow a YouTube and twitch gaming channel, I post daily videos and stream every day for a little. All this totals up so much time where I really don't have much time to relax. Yesterday, my family wanted to watch a movie that we had just gotten. So I said yes, I tried to multitask and did a little college homework while watching it, but I still got behind on 4 assignments that are due tonight and then I need a video up for tomorrow. Plus, on mondays and Wednesday's I have karate for 2 hours.


I barely get things done and I only get 6 maybe 7 hours of sleep per night. I'm exhausted and last week I quit working out because that on top of all this would be insane. I'm not complaining that I'm tired, rather the fact that I'm just so stressed. It's making everything stressful. I get stressed when I'm watching a movie trying to relax. It really sucks.

Seriously, I've never felt so out of my element and depressed with a job situation.  I don't connect with the clientele demographic (I'm a salesman for a plumbing supply company), I don't have a basic understanding or interest in the products, and it exhausts me to the point where I just go home and lay down miserable.

Here's the problems.  My brother is my boss.  He has a five year plan for me that I've said I'm all in for in the past.  I live with him.  And if I leave this job, I lose the company healthcare and can't afford a new plan (as far as I've seen anyway).

I don't want to spend another day in this place.  The living situation is so uncomfortable, but if I find my own place and sign a lease I'm doomed in this unfamiliar town for a while.

I tried communicating with everybody about who's going to post what and when, which theme we want, but only two people ever responded. They only responded with what was essentially a 'good idea!' and never got back with other details. Someone also posted a week before the assignment started and I had to take it down. 

Now the assignment has started and the people who have posted made posts that were messes, no other way to describe it. A giant block of text, and something completely off topic. And somebody is using the shared account (that runs the site) to complement them in the comments. I also don't know if other people wanted to post about the same topics, as there was no communication. 

I have the urge to email everybody again and tell them what not to post, what you shouldn't use the shared account for, but I don't want to be a dick. I don't want everybody turning against me because I told them what to do.

This leads to irritation on my part due to confusion and an inability to understand what is expected of me in some interactions.


And, like, there's one coworker in particular with that this keeps happening with. I just can't figure out what this woman wants/expects of me when she interacts with me, and it's irritating as all get out - she's irritating as all get out - and I just. Don't even know anymore.

*

Some example interactions from the past week:

Her: -huge dramatic gasp while checking the newspaper- Oh my gosh!
Me: What?

Her: So-and-so did [something illegal]. 

Me: ... -has no idea who that is or why that is a big deal- Okay? 

Her: That's my cousin!

Me: Okay?

Her: -goes on about this person I've never met who did something I really don't care about, but keeps looking at me to contribute something to the conversation; I can't figure out what the woman wants me to say!-

*

Background: We work in community mental health care. She takes in referrals. I schedule them in after we get authorization.

Her: -tells me about a new referral she took. Like, literally, the whole backstory of the person-

Me: -can't figure out why she is telling me this because the information is not at all relevant to my existence until I put the person on my schedule-

Her: And they really, really need services. -she says this about everyone. Like, every case is an emergency even when it's very much not an emergency-

Me: Okay. 

Her: -continues to emphasize their need for services-

Me: ??? -continues to be confused because their need does not expedite the authorization process- I'll schedule them as soon as I get the approval?? -not sure what else to say to her but we go through this several times a week-

*

Her: -ends up telling me about how a coworker is in Florida (which I didn't know; they now work remotely and I didn't realize they had moved). Obviously, this sucks given the weather situation, but what can you do? Still, she has a mini freak-out-

Me: That sucks. 

Her: -repeats herself with this expectant look at me-

Me: ????

*

Like. 

Each time we interact, I get the sense that she's expecting me to do or say something - and because I don't, she keeps giving me these looks and repeating herself. And it feels like everything to her is an emergency. 

But, guys, this is fucking exhausting. And I can't figure out what to do or say to make her happy enough to end these conversations.

As a bit of background I currently live at home to save money, my parents are wonderful people for allowing me to stay. I currently work a seasonal job and have no background in IT (though I do have an unrelated bachelors).

I currently work at a job where I was recently promoted to one of the few IT personnel in the company and also have retained my old position and am expanding in this role as well. I have come to realize that I am unqualified completely for this IT job and before things start to pick up at work I feel I should step down so someone more competent can be trained and take my place. In doing so I will lose my benefits and receive a pay decrease, but the alternative is feeling so stressed I can't eat and hopelessly attempting to finish jobs I'm not sure how to start. To add to this there isn't really anyone I can turn to talk to or ask as the others in my area have their own tasks and deadlines which need to be met.

I'm honestly not sure what to do as losing the job will strip me of benefits and possibly get me into another ""what are you even doing with your life?"" argument, but staying will give me unending amounts of stress and likely to be fired down the road anyways from this position for incompetence. I'm not sure where to turn to or what to do but I'm mere days into this job and already feeling massively overwhelmed.

She's currently a Lab Assistant working in a lab that specializes in scar tissue and wounds, and her degree is in Biology,a  bachelor's (Also in Japanese, if that matters); she works with cells and things like that, in Baylor in Houston, TX. Unfortunately, her commute is such that she gets up at 6, drives to a bus stop, buses to a train, and then gets home at 7. On top of this, she suffers from chronic fatigue; she's had blood work done but we've yet to find the cause. She thinks she sleeps okay but she's an extremely light sleeper and I wonder if she gets REM, so we're trying a sleep clinic next. Her allergy panel was also clear.

So the two questions are:

What can can she do with my career from here, and how would she do it/what prerequisites does she need? She'd love a shorter commute and wants to advance in her career. She was thinking about veterinarian work. She'd prefer not to have to go back to school, in part because her job leaves her no time for it; she needs to make money as it is, and doesn't want to lose income and simultaneously do something expensive.

And, what are the possible causes for her fatigue and where should we go to narrow down and wipe out the cause? Just being awake would make everything so much easier on her.

For context, we live together under my parents. My father also works, in telecommunications. Both parents were former Air Force comm. Since I'm a college student and have free time, I cook for her, and regularly handle appointments and care for her plants since she's not here or is exhausted, and generally do everything I can to make it easy on her when she's home.

 (I'll call them AC for Annoying Classmate) 

AC is very VERY bad at picking up social cues. They've invited themselves over to my house after school on one occasion simply because they just so happened to be talking to one of us as we were waiting outside the school for everyone to walk there. Once we'd assembled, she'd continued walking with us, even after we'd dropped hints about it being a gathering just for our friend group. We got to my house and she just walked in. And at that point, no one felt comfortable asking her to leave. We somewhat take pity on her because she doesn't have many friends. 

Recently AC has gotten into a fight with their only friend. This has resulted in them coming and eating lunch with my friend group instead of with their friend. My friend group is by no means an exclusive bunch of people, but we're all very close and it's starting to get on our nerves. We don't feel comfortable talking about personal things while AC is there. She'll interrupt our conversations with her irrelevant stories constantly. We've had enough.

The last guy I found out pretty much raped me when I passed out  while we were having sex 3 months ago, the first time we had ever hooked up. I have no recollection of the incident. He told me THEN that because I had passed out mid sex, he had stopped and just let me sleep it off. Then last week it comes out that he had asked me to fuck me anally, and because I was on the verge of passing out, I was mumbling and nodding off and not saying no to anything, so he took that to mean he could do just that. So he had fucked me in the ass, without condoms, with me having no idea that happened.

Before we were hooking up, we were friends! When he told me nothing had happened, I believed him, because I had no reason to believe he'd lie to me. THEN I find out he'd slept with two other girls unprotected, after telling me he hadn't, in between the time me and him were together, putting me at so much risk.

The worst thing is that all these guys all come off as being trustworthy, good and honest people. Two weeks ago I would have described this douchebag as being one of the people I'd ever felt the most comfortable and accepted around. I used to tell him EVERYTHING. This all turns out to be bullshit. But every single time, I fall for the facade they put forward, only to be disappointed once again.

I feel like there's something broken inside me, and that is why I keep attracting all these emotionally unavailable men. After this last incident, I've lost all faith in myself. I'm questioning every single one of my friendships, wondering where else have I made mistakes in judgement? 

I want to disappear off the radar for a while, as I no longer know what to do. I'm scrutinizing all of my friendships, and wondering where did I go so wrong?! What in me is missing that I keep allowing this to happen?

I don't want to turn into a bitter and jaded woman, but I'm losing fast hope that I can ever have healthy relationships. I keep getting into toxic ones.

I have 2 badly impacted wisdom teeth. It should be a nbd surgery according to him. But he left me with the risks. Apparently there's a (less than 1%) chance of getting permanent nerve damage in my face (it'd look akin to stroke victims). From the X-ray I saw that the nerve in the bottom half of my face was close to the bottom of the roots of the wisdom teeth. Not on top or intersecting. Just close. He said this could happen if the nerve got bruised. 

Everything in me is telling me to high tail it and avoid the surgery now. I already have a big phobia of doctors/dentists and this is the first surgery I've had. I know it's illogical to base this decision off of a &lt;1% chance.. but it's still a chance. Is he downplaying the risk to pump me for 2000$? Is he just downplaying the risk to cover his ass? 

I know only good will come from this surgery. I'll quit smoking. I'll fix my teeth. I'll avoid terrible wisdom teeth pain in the future. And my dentist will FINALLY be able to get at the cavity beside my wisdom tooth (they never could before because the wisdom tooth was covering it). 

Help me! I know what the right decision is but I can't bring myself to make it. I guess I need someone to just push me off the fence.   Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.

My husband's company pays for him to further his education at a slower pace and he has two more years until he will have his masters in business and hopefully climb the workplace ladder.  

I've always had an interest in accounting and even wanted to switch my major during college but was unable to do so.  I would need to go back to school as my only education is healthcare related.  

**Would it be worth it to change careers at this point in my life and if so what would be the best way to go about it?  Would switching over to accounting even be worth the cost or should I just suck it up and hate every work day?  

Sorry for the throwaway but the husband loves to look at reddit.",06Sep2017,1
308,"My father is trying to identify a water main leak in his front yard the cheapest way possible. He has researched the nitrogen leak check contracted at $600 and would like to know any other methods. In NJ this water main is approximately 4 feet bgs, copper pipe. 

Not sure if there's any methods you could do yourself to identify where the leak is without digging too much. Could be under the slab, front yard or driveway. Thanks for any help, also wasn't sure where to post his request 😐",06Sep2017,1
309,"I got really jealous and upset at her Saturday night, the reason it's a problem is because i got mad at a situation i knew nothing about, and i didnt find out until later that i was totally in the wrong. She said she wants to take a break, i agreed and told her i too need a little time to think about if we have a future together, she replied but ive yet to reply back. I haven't spoken to her since Monday. Anyway, i just recently came to grips with the fact that im in the wrong and want to make things right. I want to get her flowers and write her a letter and leave it on her doorstep. Im gonna end the letter by asking her if she wants to get food and talk it out, so if i get no response within a day or two ill at least have an answer, although not the one im looking for. If i text her an apology it wont be sincere enough to her. Ive asked probably ten girls so far and they all think my idea would be really cute and every girl wishes someone would do that for them. I think im gonna do it on friday, so she'd have had about a week of space which she asked for. How does this sound to you guys?",06Sep2017,1
