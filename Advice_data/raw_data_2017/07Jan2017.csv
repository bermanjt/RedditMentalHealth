1," I feel so lowly, I just want to crumble. I've ruined my reputation among the people closest to me, mainly through being a stoic, lazy, hot head. I think I've just about push everyone away. It's to the point that people avoid me or consider me last on the totem pole, if at all. I feel that's I've disappointed everyone and now they want nothing to do with me. I think it's too late to fix things with them, and now I think I am alone. 

There have been some things that took place in my social circle that have pissed me off on more than one occasion. Because of that people are different toward me and hide things from me, which makes it worse. I feel hurt and wronged (rightfully so) by these things but I'm trying to let it go and move past them, but I'm having a hard time of it. Because of my actions the damage has been done. 

I don't know what to do and I feel miserable, I made an ass of myself. Unfortunately this has happened before and I've apologized too many times, now the people I loved have seemingly turned away from me and probably won't believe another apology...

I think I've ruined things for myself here, but in the future how do I keep from getting angry so easily and keep it from eating at me? ",07Jan2017,2

Things have been great, she got me into a couple of shows (mainly game of thrones and arrow) and we talk about stuff like that each day, she laughs at my jokes and we get along really well. Halfway through the year I developed a huge crush on her, but I'm kind of awkward and don't know how to approach her, I don't really know if she feels the same way, but I think she's beautiful and funny and smart.

I asked if 'mommy freaked out' and he said that she did, and I guess she was saying something, and that *dad's name* (Not *dad*, but his name) said ""*shut up bitch*!"" and made a smacking motion.

16,"Hi there. Thanks for replying! This isn't legal advice per se but it's a long story so please bear with me.
So for the first time in my life about a month ago, I made the mistake of hiring the services of an escort from backpage. I was just going through some things and I made a poor decision but that's that.
Anyway, I arrive at the hotel and she tells me that her ""friend"" (also female) is going to receive me at the elevator and bring me up to the room. First red flag, but against my better judgment, I go up with her. As soon as I set foot in the room, the friend that brought me up, blocks me off and says I need to pay first before I can see the escort. Second red flag. I should have left at this point but I didn't because apparently I'm not a smart guy. So I pay up and go in and the escort was definitely not the person in the photos. Anyway, she tells me take my pants off and starts jerking me off (I am no way aroused at this point) and says anything other than a quick handjob is going to cost more because they are ""tip girls"" working for an agency. The friend was still in the room, mind you. And then a thrid girl walks out of the bathroom and sits on the adjascent bed. At this point, I'm far too uncomfortable and I pull up my pants, grab my jacket and walk right out and go home. This whole interaction from me entering the room to me leaving lasted all of about 3-4 minutes if memory serves me right.
About half an hour after arriving home, I get a phonecall from the escort claiming that the girl that brought me up was 16 years-old and that they had me on hotel surveillance following her into the elevator and entering her room. She then hung up and called me again about 5 minutes and claimed that she had gotten hold of the surveillance footage and that she'd call the cops if I didn't pay her $2000 (she never showed me the footage so I don't even know if it exists). After a lot of pleading and begging she brought it down to $1000 and then $500 and not until I sent her the balance in my account (which at that time was $9 - I'm a pretty broke grad student) did she agree to not call the cops. And that was the last interaction I had with said person. I left for vacation a week later and I'm not back till later this week. I've not gotten any calls from the cops or from the escort.
But I'm still worried though. I can't seem to shake off the feeling that I'm going to get apprehended when I arrive back in Vancouver or something like that. I mean the escort said she wouldn't call the cops but I am having a hard time believing her. I just had a couple of questions:

1. What are my options here? Can I save myself or am I screwed?
2. Can anyone claiming a crime just obtain hotel surveillance footage without a police warrant?
3. Should I contact a lawyer or am I just being paranoid?

I just feel shitty for attempting to engage in such an activity and now I fear everything I've worked for most of my adult life (I've been in university for 8 years now (undergrad and doing my PhD now)) is going to go down the drain and I am absolutely terrified. Any advice would be really helpful and appreciated.

17,"A year or so ago I became good friends with this one girl. We are friends right now, but she considers me one of her ""best friends."" She talks to me everyday. The problem is we are completely different people. I am social enough but am generally more reserved and calm than her. She is pretty social, and depressed. She has a lot of problems and I tell her to get help but she doesn't want to. (probably family pressure) My dilemma is that she's been close and is getting ever closer. I don't want to date her because when we eventually break up her mental state could get even worse. Btw I didn't run into this knowing she was depressed. I just don't know where to begin with my questions. Should I tell her I need space or do I slowly stray away? Do I make her get professional help?

22,"On September 16th, while I was laying on my bed, the wind blew my window blinds into a cup of ginger ale, which then maliciously attacked my MSi Apache GE72 Laptop. On September 19th, without the ability to fix my computer myself, I took it to a local repair shop. He said he'd work on fixing the computer and stick to my college student budget. I called to check in two weeks later, and I did so every two weeks or so to see how it was coming along.


Fast forward to today.


Today is January 7th and he STILL has my laptop. In November, and again in December, I actually went into the shop to talk to him about it. He claims that he is rebuilding the motherboard, rather than replacing it, since it's basically a one-off specifically for that line of computers, and it would be ridiculously expensive to replace. He has ordered a few components for the motherboard and replaced them, but he told me that he cannot find the schematics for the board which would tell him how it operates. Since the motherboard is so unique, he has to learn as he goes to figure it out; it's not like somebody brought in a Dell Latitude that he could turn around in a day or two. So he tells me that he is working on the computer at a slow and steady pace (I presume this is because it's tough to find motivation to work on something that isn't currently rewarding him financially, I haven't given him a dime since it isn't complete, as he told me was customary). It's been nearly four months without my baby, which holds far more sentimental value than monetary (my now deceased grandfather bought it for me).


What should I do? Should I go in guns-ablazing and tell him to hurry it up? He claims that it'll only cost $120 when it's finished, but at this point I'm worried if that is a ""when"" at this point. I just want my computer back.

TL;DR: Repair is taking 4 months for seemingly no reason and I don't know what to do.",07Jan2017,3

24,"I'll try to make this concise as possible: husband transferred to Miami, I took the first job I could, hated the company but only worked 3 12's a week so I figured I would stick it out, got approached about a promotion after 4 months (because I have the required degree), didn't want it but was talked into at least giving it a try...

My job literally sucks out my will to live at this point. It's so bad that my husband told me one of his friends has cancer and is getting his arm removed and said ""see, things could be a lot worse"" but I actually felt kind of jealous of the guy because at least then I would get out of work (I know , I know, it's absolutely awful. please don't hate me). 

The stress (and being on call 24/7) is unbearable for me (especially considering I have no friends/family down here, they're all 1800 miles away, and I'm still adjusting to a new city/culture.)

Like really, it's absolutely imperative for my well-being to get out.

My current plan is to last for my year mark , at which point I'll be paid back all my unused vacation time upon resignation. I have two ideas I'm pursuing: I got my temporary teaching certification but no place will hire me because I have no formal teaching experience, so I would have to substitute to gain experience. 

My second option is to enroll in an EKG technician course that begins around that time and is only $600 and to work some minor retail position for income until I complete it at the beginning of May.


Either way, my job isn't for me and my well-being isn't worth the money...but everytime I even mention to my husband that I'm quitting he freaks out on me. Right now collectively we make around 97K (no kids) and he seems to think anything below that we will be ""poor"" and unable to afford life. 

I mentioned teaching and he said that would be stupid to get in another field (I'm only 29) and take a 8,000 pay cut...EKG tech would be about a 17,000 pay cut. 

His argument steems primarly from a money standpoint AND the fact that I have a degree and I need to use it and blah blah blah....

I guess I need career advice and advice on how to get my husband to understand for me, happiness is more important than money. (I know he almost has a point because I'm 29 and have no concrete career ""goals...My primary goal is just to get out of my current job at this point, and that ""everyone hates their job but you just have to do it""...uggghhh...that's depressing).

26,"I am confused about social life after college in the USA, in fact after reading reddit, I hear that it is not even supposed to exist. You live a lonely miserable hell as you go to work, come home, and do it all over again.

Now back in college, I missed out on the hookup culture, partying, experimenting with different things, and being a part of that more ""less than moral"" crowd. A lot of that revolved around fraternity life and since I wasn't in a fraternity, I didn't get it, it was that simple at my university.

After college, I kinda wonder if some of things I want are just things that people no longer do or what the deal is with them.

29,"Sorry if this wall of text bothers you. I just cant tl;dr it because i need to go in-depth.

I'm currently a freshman in college (18F, studying in Dubai, been here all my life, Indian). I'm a total tomboy who hates skirts and love video games and programming. I have been bullied a lot till I reached the 7th grade when it stopped due to the intervention of my parents. I'm a good student who used to get straight As till 10th grade. In 11th grade I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(Add Depression to the list). My grades dropped from As to Bs and Cs and I passed 12th grade with 75% (I was expected to get 90+ since I'm usually good at studying). I take Zoloft regularly and take Xanax on exam days since I'm traumatized by my poor performance in 12th grade and I get horrible flashbacks and tremors when I take tests. 

I cannot socialize with others. I try to talk to others but it seems they don't want me. I have a few good friends but even I can't keep a conservation going past 5 minutes. I have gotten so used to being lonely that speaking to others has become frightening. It has become worse in college and I found myself buried in textbooks instead of enjoying freshman year. My grades have improved dramatically and I'm expecting above 8.5 out of 10 Cumulative Grade Point Average. But I cannot feel happy. I feel empty. I don't understand. I have caring parents and I'm not financially burdened. I recently opened my facebook page and saw pictures of my peers having fun going to malls and eating out. I cannot feel anything but envy. I try to open up but I get overwhelmed by negative thoughts.

Even my classmates (high school) in the same college have found their mates except me. I will admit that I often behave odd, cracking weird jokes and having overt masculine interests. I get suicidal thoughts every night. I know suicide won't accomplish anything. I stutter when I try to express myself even when the other party is clearly interested in what I have to say. Before you ask, my asian parents do not force anything on me and they raised me liberally.

33,"**A bit of backstory:** I'm worried for myself. I used to have a distinct lack of ego, to the point where I was literally just satisfied in a mode of observation. I greatly preferred it, due to the ease of feeling that it brought. I didn't feel much of anything other than a mild sense of fulfillment. 

To be fair, said ""ego death"" was born out of extended stress. At the same time, this stress lead to me holing up in my house for a few years, upon which I discovered anime. It was through anime that I started feeling a desire again. The curious thing was, I discovered that despite my lack of ego, I would take on the personality of whatever character had a backstory most similar to mine. It lead to an interesting type of empathy to literally think with the personality of the character. I watched anything and everything, and it rapidly became how I spent every waking moment.

Backstory aside, about a year ago I suddenly ""woke up"". My personal emotions came back in a flood, and for about a month straight all I could feel was pain (it was emotional, but the only way I could describe it was as pure pain). It's since evened out into a mild, yet constant existential crisis. I guess can feel my own emotions again, at least. 

Unfortunately though, since then my ego keeps steadily growing more powerful, and my opinions keep gaining priority. It's to the point that I'm so opinionated that I'm starting to hate anime. Suddenly, it's embarrassing. It seems offensive. I'm not the type of person who would have ever originally watched anime if it weren't for my trauma, but *did* enjoy it. I don't want to lose my enjoyment of that simply because my arrogance and conservative morals have reestablished themselves.

36,"I am supposed to write a ""deep"" story for my English class, and I don't know what to. In this universe, when living creatures die, they are reincarnated as that same species, and when they go extinct, they are reincarnated as the most similar species. Anyway, in this universe, every species was able to telepathically communicate with each other after forming some sort of bond. Eventually, as these creatures evolved, telepathy in animals grew weaker. As their other senses heightened, telepathy was ruled as basically non existent. The only form of telepathy that remained in any species was the ability to sense emotions. So, my story starts with the first three humans ever born. They are of course in their earliest stages. First, two were born from the same mother, and eventually they had a child. The thing about these creatures was that they were different than any other species. They were able to communicate with each other telepathically. As the human population grew, and these three died off, they were all reincarnated near each other. By the time they were very old (About 15) they could remember everything about their past lives. They all formed a special bond. By their 13th life, vocal communication was developed. This led to them realizing that nobody else had their special traits. They each gave each other names By their 19th life. One was named Roh, the other was named Ave, and the other was Sul. By their 400th life, humans started spreading around the earth. Eventually Ave and Sul were split from Roh. They were separated so long that they lost their telepathic connection with them. Many thousands of years later, Sul and Ave had done so many good things go improve the world. Roh, on the other hand, had all horrible lives. He saw nothing but the darkness in the world. He had done only horrible thing to destroy the human race because of Sul and Aves betrayals. Roh, in his 9,087 life, was Napoleon. In His 11,867 life, He was Adolf Hitler. Basically the rest of the story is Sul and Ave trying to find Roh and change his way of living. How the hell should I start it off? ",07Jan2017,2

So I originally applied to all of the colleges I applied to to get an English degree (only subject I've ever been good at) + teaching certificate (I graduate hs this year). For a really long time, since middle school, I wanted to do something related to art. But for so long, I’ve constantly been discouraged by a lot of people in my life that its not a “good idea” or that I’ll have “no job” or “no money”.

Yet that doesn’t scare me (well it certainly does but…) as going into a major/profession I’ll end up hating. My “decisions” on my life career jumped from nurse, to teacher and lawyer or whatnot. Things I’m not passionate about at all but considered bc of the financial stability. I’m just worried that I’m not good enough as an artist to pursue illustration/animation or whatnot in college (I’ve had terrible artblock for several years and I have a really bad problem with perfectionism - so it really prevents me from growing as an artist). 

I’m so lost. 

As much as I hate high school, I don’t feel ready enough to graduate (and a leap yr is not an option for me, as my parents lectured me)

42,"Hi!

So a few months ago I graduated college (yay me!) and promptly couldn't find a job, so I had to move home (goddammit).  After four years, I am a houseguest at my parents' house and that isn't helping anything.  I need to follow their rules, I'm borrowing their car when my sister isn't using it, and I have to conform to their way of doing things.  Point is, out here in suburbia, I've lost a lot of my coping mechanisms for shitty emotional situations.

At the same time, I found out a friend from HS was bi.  Great, we had a couple dates, hooked up a couple times, but it was sporadic.  Still talked, but both of us were busy - me working nights in retail/tutoring and him at school.  Plus, bad communicators, both of us.  Considering my closest friend is an hour away and our schedules don't match up well, I could use more local friends than I have.  Since the guy I hooked up with is good to talk to and somebody I'd like to get to know better all else being equal, I figured that'd be a good thing to go for in the new year.

The issue - I just found out the kid I hooked up with a while ago just got a boyfriend and it hit me way harder than I thought it should have.  Which, if I'm being brutally honest with myself, I should have expected and I regret not going for.  But that aside, I'd like to stay friends with this guy - he's good to talk to and I need friends, as desperate as that sounds - so I was wondering if any of you had advice to help me with getting over myself a bit.

45,"Hi

I have a small company of software developers. 

There is this guy who irritates me. I've been working with him for 2 or 3 years and the more I work with him, the more I dislike him.

He's that sort of person who cannot read emotional clues to know when he's being boring and needs to shut up. At the same time the things he talks about deserve to be posted on /r/iamverysmart.

For example, he can stand up in the middle of the day and start with explaining something obvious he saw on 9gag, then proceed to tell something about his childhood and then teach us how to be street smart. No one would interact with him, it would be a monologue really. The he would sit down and work for an hour or two until next time.

The problem is that this person is actually doing a good job. I haven't heard complaints about his speeches, but by the lack of response I think other people are not really interested in what he has to say either.
It somewhat distracts me from work, but not that much time-wise, it's more of an emotional thing.

I don't feel like ""talking to him"" will help. It's not like he's going to become a different person. I think forcing him to stay silent will be too much of a hassle.

51,"A couple weeks ago I went to the hospital because something was very wrong. I didn't know it at the time, but a urine test detected pot in my system. I do not do drugs so it came as a surprise to me when the doctor said that. I thought something really serious was happening and it scared the shit out of me. The question of how it got in my system was driving me insane, It could have came from anywhere but I had a suspicion that it was my mom and her shitty boyfriend that spiked me. I asked her about this but she heavily denied it. Today I found pot butter in the freezer, physical evidence. I confronted her about this and she said she had no idea how it got in my food. I don't believe she didn't have a clue and the fact that she didn't tell me about the possibility of it being her butter is hurtful. She just left me in confusion and fear. She definitely hasn't been a good mom before this, but this is a new low. Can I do anything in this situation to get her to admit to being wrong? Should I do something more extreme?",07Jan2017,50
54,"Dear Redditors,

I need your input.

I am a full-time student and only works as a casual lifeguard at a pool. Other than this I also volunteer at a program teaching water classes for folks with disabilities at the same pool. Since I work at the pool, I am also in charge of booking the pool with my supervisor, let's call her S. Initially she was very supportive and even offered major discounts for the charitable cause. However, the first time I booked the pool we've had to cancel a week before because of funding issues from the non-profit.

The second time I asked (when funding came down) S offered us the time slot between 9-10am for the program on Saturdays. I checked the whiteboard at the pool where all the pool programs are written down. On Saturdays the earliest program starts at 10:30am. So I asked S if we could have the pool from 9:30am-10:30am, since for all other programs it is back to back. S said no. (By the way all of these happened via email as I'm only a casual staff so I don't see her regularly). I replied and asked again, this time mentioning that because people with disabilities usually need more time to get up, change, and get to the pool, it would be good if we could have the pool from 9:30am till 10:30, since there is nothing from 10am-10:30am. This was her response verbatim:

""wutsgoingonnnnn, it is irrelevant what our board says, I am telling you the pool is available from 09:00 until 10:00. Anything else requires changing residents and programs regardless what the board says. Our work cannot be reflected on the board thus you cannot assume that because the board says one thing we can accommodate your needs. I will ask that any further requests are honoured as presented and that you not push beyond what is offered. If you cannot accept what we offer, you will need to find another facility.""

Since this email, S has been upset with me. As part of my job, I have to attend all the in-services (4x/year). I didn't go to the last in-service because I actually caught the flu. This time she sent the in-service reminder, I asked if I could come for half of it because I have a meeting to go to, she replied and cc'd her boss, and said that I can't just come for half of the in-service (this is understandable, I just thought I would try asking first), that I already missed the last in-service, and that I have not picked up any shift for a long time. All of this is true. I didn't attend the last in-service because I had the flu. However, there's plenty of casual staff who miss in-services. I have not picked up shifts since she sent me that email because I am quite scared of having to deal with her. The in-service is coming up next week. Should I just quit? However, all the jobs that I've had, I left on good terms with the bosses. How can I leave (or keep) this job on good terms under the circumstance?

tl;dr: I learned the hard way that I should not be the point of contact for a non-profit to rent the pool as an employee of the pool. How can I leave (or keep) this job on good terms under the circumstance?",07Jan2017,1

Today I saw one sitting under a tree, looking all majestic, so I stopped to take a photo (stupid I know). It ran up to me in a friendly way and sniffed my shoes so I gave it a pat on the head. But then it started following me, jumping up on me, running behind me and growling if I didn't pet it.

57,"So long backstory. 

My mother got sent into inpatient in late September due to being drunk, and saying things to my family that worried them. I don't know exactly what but just things that sounded like she was trying to kill herself. So someone on my moms side who lives in a different state(most of her close family lives far away) called the local police and asked for them to check on her. They ended up having to bring her to the ER and then she got admitted to inpatient. 

I am 16 and have my own mental health issues and I was living with her at the time, this situation ended up triggering me into a really bad depressive episode  and I now live with my moms side of the family in that same different state. 

After the first time she got admitted, the same thing ended up happening again. I still lived with her the first 4 times it happened. This time though I was at her house when she was making the threats. I didnt even know it was happening until I woke up from a nap and I saw a bunch of texts and missed called. It was really terrifying, and she refused to let my boyfriend who was there to drive her to the ER, so my family called the police again, they came, and that was that. 

She got out again, and then the same thing happened again except my dad drove her. 

Got out again, one night I was staying at a friends but stopped at her house to grab something. The house was super weird and everything was out of place and she wasn't home, her purse and phone and everything was there. I was really freaked out but tried not to think about it because there was nothing I could do then. Next day I found out family had called the police again, they actually had to handcuff her that time and drag her out. 

She got out again. My family was getting really upset with the hospital because they would listen to her lies but wouldn't listen to my family when they expressed she needed actual help, they could not keep letting her go after a week. They got her set up with a counselor and psychiatrist because they are legally obligated to do that but they didn't do anything themselves to help her and most of the doctors there were absolute shit, she even said herself that they did not do anything to help. That time, they told us that if she gets admitted one more time she would have to go into a longterm rehab treatment thing. 

She is obviously an alcoholic and she knows that, and she was planning on quitting on January 1st but I mean obviously that wasnt going to happen. Its too big of a problem for her to just quit cold turkey. 

Sooo earlier this week I think the 2nd or 3rd her sister gets a call from her sister in law who got a call from her mom who heard from her brother that she does not have a close relationship with at all... that she was in the hospital again and this time along with being drunk she had taken a bunch of sleeping pills and had to get her stomach pump. I guess instead of calling family this time she called a friend of hers who drove her to the hospital. 

The hospital released her today. They said they didn't consider that a suicide attempt, and they couldn't actually put her in more intensive treatment without her consider, they just said that the last time because ????? 

because apparantly they think threatening a mentally ill alcoholic patient will make them better somehow???? 

We are all really angry with them and have been communicating that with the doctor and therapist and whoever else there. My aunt was talking to a worker there and when she was told that they told my mom that they would put her in longterm rehab care the last time but they couldnt really do it, my aunt said ""So it was just an empty threat then?"", and the lady got really defensive and mad. My aunt also told them that if my mom ends up sucessfully killing herself one of these times she is literally going to sue the hospital. 

I want to know.. in the hopeful event my mom does not fucking die, is there anything we can do about this situation in regards to the hospital? It is completely unprofessional and they do not treat her the way a hospital should, I cant imagine how other patients are being taken care of. They wont listen to us, they lied to us and to my mom, they dont do anything to make sure she doesnt go there again. She has been there 5 times. Since the end of September. That really doesnt seem right. 

She will probably end up going again because she just wont agree to rehab, and she just lies her way out of the hospital. Its fucking ridiculous. 

I shouldnt worry about this as much as I am because my therapist said so but it just infuriates me. I know I cant do anything directly but is there anything an adult in my family can do? The hospital is completely in the wrong here, right? ",07Jan2017,0

I got myself Pokemon Sun pre-owned. Gamestop didn't have any Preowned Moon. I don't seem to be liking it...I'm at the point just after beating the first Island totem pokemon  boss. 5hr in. For those of you  who have played a pokemon game, there are pokemon you could catch,  but so far, I've only been able to catch a few types of them. 

So far...there isn't much room to explore, not that many pokemon  to catch, and the game is spoon-feeding everything. 

But...I got it so that me and my brother could play it (would've played ORAS together, but my dad wouldn't let me buy my own 3ds and game (my brother got them, though). Until a year later (this Feb/March.) It was a really, really good game. Sooo much room to explore, many pokemon,  you had to explore and solve puzzles in order to beat the game. I wish...I would've bought them sooner. 

I'm not enjoying this game, and I'm not sure if my brother is either (he has stuff coming up, so he can't really play right now.). 

Should I  return the game and get my 40 dollars back, or should I keep it in order to play with my brother, who I'm not sure will like it either? I bought his Moon new.

60,So I am a new intern at a real estate company and recently had training with about 4 other interns at our office.  I am generally a quieter person until I warm up to people.  All of the other interns went to the same school but did know each other beforehand. They have common ground though since they all come from the same school.  It seems like they are closer to each other than they are with me. It's difficult to make them like me better. Does anyone have any advice?

Sexually we also have a great time but are both in a bit of role reversal. I've found that I only prefer oral sex (giving/receiving) and receiving anal sex. In this relationship i've found that I do not/cannot give anal sex. I do not know why but I cannot have anal sex with her. I've never had it before however i've had sex many times before with cis-gendered females. We spoke openly about this and she seemed disappointed that I did not want to/couldn't give her anal sex. I can understand that it may feel masculine to top a man which is not what she is looking for and I verbalized that. Should she decide to transition, (thinking way to far into the future), I think things would be different and we discussed this. I'm not sure what my mental block is about anal. I've never been a bottom before and never received anal prior to meeting her. However I enjoy it now and I think she doesn't mind her role as a top.

Money I'm getting from loans ($800) won't be enough to supply food and books for the whole semester. 2 of the classes have online components that require books and money on top of being the hardest classes to take in my field.

Patrick's day when most my friends were out of the city, one of my friends and I went to a night club called Space Club.

I went psycho afterwards kicking one of the bouncers in the balls and screaming that they had raped me but only have spotty flashbacks of all of this including the assault incident. I ended up going to a hospital the next night getting all of the blood/urine and rape kit tests and after waiting a month for the results I learned that they did indeed drug me with GHB and probably other things that had worn off before I was able to take the blood/urine tests...I consulted two criminal lawyers while in Italy and now come January 2017 am still waiting for any sort of information from the police report that they reported on my behalf after I left.

I don't want to ramble and vent and get off-course, but suffice to say I struggle to think of positive aspects of my current job. I don't like what I do, the commute and scheduling are both nightmares, my manager is in over their head and all of that stress and confusion ends up passed onto the rest of us, A full year's pay still has me under the poverty line - and that's before taxes and commuting costs - and I have no benefits. I've been working here over a year, it's not just a bad stretch, it's been this way from day one.

I had to go on leave from work for 4 months while my son recovered and he spent a month in ICU. I have two other children and I am a single parent. I filed an uninsured motorist bodily injury (UMBI) claim against my own insurance company, as the DUI driver did not have insurance and the suit against the police for illegally chasing in a residential neighborhood is still ongoing. My salary last year was cut by 40%. My insurance company offered $100k for my son's UMBI claim, which is required to be held in a trust. I was given $70k (after attorney's fees), for the mental anguish and lost income.

87,"This always happens after a while, ranging from a few weeks to a few months after I start hanging out with someone and talking to them. This happens both when I see someone as a friend or a romantic interest. At first I'll really want to get to know them and be friends, but then I start to feel weird hanging out with them and I find them annoying. I get this really weird feeling in my stomach (sort of a nauseous feeling?) whenever I think about them or see them. This feeling usually lasts for a few weeks once it starts and then mostly goes away but I still never like the person as much as I did when we first met and I still find them a bit annoying. In the case of a romantic interest, I no longer have any attraction to them whatsoever. Is this feeling normal?

I went online to try and contact them again but nothing. Then I noticed she hasn't posted on her own Facebook for a few *years*, so I scrolled through to find someone whose posted on her wall and seemed more active than herself and got a hit. Plus, that same person is mutual friends with others that I've invited. I sent her a PM and explained my situation, and as we were talking she said she knew my SO too. One thing led to another and I ended up inviting this person whom I've never heard my SO talk of before. To top it off she ended up calling me today while my SO was home, so I passed the phone so I wouldn't have to explain what was going on, just that ""a long lost friend wanted to get in contact with you."" Within a few minutes of small chat, my SO hung up saying ""yeah, I'll shoot you a text later, and we can hang out,"" gave me back my phone and said ""I've never liked that person. And I'd never want to hang out.""

I've never known my own father and my ex friends father kinda took me under his wing which was nice at the time as me and his son were really good friends.

I think he's lonely because he doesn't get out much, but are lines being crossed here? Is it disrespectful to my old friend that I still talk with his father so much?

let me explain: I wish to know what I am saying during my sleep. The ""Why"" is not really important I find. 
I basically don't know anything about audio processing and the related crafts. Googling yields some expensive programs which mainly focus on songs. That is not what I want. 
I have got recordings, 10-hour-ish chunks of audio which is mostly me moving in my bed and of course a lot of breathing and snoring. To put it bluntly, I can't really be arsed to hear through all that, even at 150% speed.
What I seek is a software solution, preferrably local to run on my Windows 10, which automatically finds the part were I am talking. If anybody else is talking, I need to find that, too. I'd expect to the tool to have algorithms to automatically differentiate speech from any other noise. Additional info: the language in question would be German.

107,"-In general, driving in the snow isn't all that different from regular driving but if you're not used to it, it can be somewhat dangerous. The biggest thing to remember when driving in snow is that the physics are different and every action you take (braking, accelerating, turning) will be amplfied so it is all about ""light touch"" and going slower, not just in speed but in terms of how quickly you hit the brakes or turn the wheel

-You need to be prepared for what's up the road such as turns, hills, lights, stop signs and other drivers. 

-If you have 4wd that's great but remember that 4wd does nothing to help you stop.

-When you are driving make sure you are planning ahead, if there is a bend in the road coming up, make sure you take your foot off the gas well before you get to the bend. If you hit the brakes to try and slow down for the bend your car will begin sliding and go off the side of the road. Letting off the gas ahead of time will allow the car to slow down enough so you won't lose grip

- If you're coming to an intersection make sure you take your foot off of the gas early and let the car slow itself down. You can always pull up if you stop too short but if you slam your brakes you're going to slide through the intersection

- When at an intersection, when your light turns green do not just immediately go like you normally would. People catching the red light may slide through the intersection as they're not stopping early enough, this causes many winter accidents 

 -Remember that due to inertia your car will want to continue forward in a straight line so at turns and bends it is important to be going slow to allow your car to turn, otherwise as I said before you will slide straight even though the wheels are turned. Many people will be going too quickly when trying to turn into a parking lot or another road and they will slide into the curb

-Hills are a bit tricky, going up them if you lose all of your speed you will stop on the hill and then not be able to go and you will be stuck on the hill. Make sure you are giving the car light gas the whole way to get over the crest and then as you come over the top of the hill begin letting off the gas and allow your momentum to carry you down the hill 

- There will be ruts in the snow from other people driving, while it is good to follow these as the snow is compacted be sure you do not catch the edge of the rut. What I mean by this is if you come out of the rut, the snow will be higher there and may cause you to lose control

-Braking is the biggest issue in snow. The whole thing is the difference of friction. The snow is a layer between your tires and the road that prevents you from getting full grip. When you brake in the snow it is very easy for you to lose grip and slide, especially if you slam on the brakes. This goes back to planning ahead, if you know you will need to stop make sure you slow down by letting off the gas, if you have an automatic where you can select your gear, downshifting will assist in slowing you down without losing traction. Basically, slow the car as much as you can without the brakes and then use the brakes early and lightly. 

-When going from a stop, put your automatic transmission into 1 to prevent slipping, or 2 if you still slip with 1. Below drive on the gear selector there is 1 and 2, this locks the transmission into a lower gear and will help you get traction. Once you get going put it back into drive

-If you get stuck (especially trying to get out of your parking spot), 2 things to remember. 1. Do not panic! 2. DO NOT SLAM THE GAS DOWN! Most people will slam the gas to try to get unstuck, while it sounds like it'd make sense since you're removing some of the snow and revealing some pavement at the bottom, all this will do is make you more stuck. The snow will build up around the tires and you won't be able to get out. Let's say you're backing out of a spot and now you're stuck, put the car in 1 or 2 (low drive) and give it light gas until you start moving forward. Then put it back in reverse and lightly hit the gas and go backwards then back to drive then back to reverse etc. The point is you're ""rocking"" the car back and forth to try and get some momentum to get out. If this doesn't work, try again but with turning your steering wheel too in opposite directions. So forward and to the left, backwards and to the right, to try and get out of the rut you're stuck in

This is the end of my rant, if you have never driven in snow before and find this helpful, great! If anyone has any other tips, feel free to post them! Drive safe out there everyone, most winter accidents are caused by other people hitting you.

So far I've only had one interview with one company that was looking for an apprentice, but they clearly had someone better for it. 

As for jobs, I have applied to over 50 both part time and full time but never heard back - these were all jobs that I thought I would be a good or okay fit for as so many of the jobs being advertised are way out of what I'm capable, or required some sort of former experience (through either work or education) such as engineers, clerks, personal trainers and sales executives. Also please bear in mind that I have been adjusting my CV accordingly to the job descriptions to the extent that I am capable of as I have never held any work before so there is not much that I can change. In addition to this, I have always created personalized cover letters that I thought could match the employers' needs.

I need some advice on what I can do to take matters into my own hands and not be at the mercy of employers who I will not hear back from for another 6 months. I just cannot be sitting here much longer because it is making me depressed and oh so incredibly bored... all the while I should have been making money already.

112,"Hi! Just to give some background, I am renting an apartment in NYC with one other person. The tenants across the hall from us have left out 5 large Amazon Go Fresh coolers in the hallway. The hallway is already small so you can imagine these coolers take up a lot of space. Anyway, my roommate and I have asked them nicely to move them. They brushed us off while vaguely explaining the coolers will get picked up by Amazon people at some point and then slammed the door on us. I went to the super to lodge a complaint and he said he would take care of it as it is a fire hazard and a breach to their lease meaning tenants can not leave any items in the halls, not even shoes or umbrellas. It has been almost two months and these coolers are still there. I talked to my super two weeks ago and nothing has been done. I am fed up and am growing increasingly angry when I get home and it's hard for me to get through because of these dumb, ugly coolers. Nonetheless they also look cheap when I have people over and have to explain why they are there.

113,"A few years ago I had an issue with a stalker that kept bothering me. Lately, this guy has shown up again, but he's now cozying up to my friends. They have no idea what he has done in the past, so to them, he's just another friendly guy.

So now he's hanging around my friends and finding excuses to try and tag along whenever they meet me, and basically finding every available opportunity to use my friends to meet me again. When he shows up, he acts like he's an old friend of mine and acts SUPER friendly. He says things full of hidden meanings like ""Hey, long time no see!"". To me, it's him bragging about how he's going to start stalking me again, to others, it's just a simple greeting. It's especially obvious when he talks about the ""times we used to share"" which was him making my life hell, but others don't get the reference.

My friends can't understand why I have no desire to go anywhere near this guy and he's not doing anything that is obviously illegal. To anyone who doesn't know that he's my stalker, he just looks like an old friend of mine, which is his plan because if he issues any obvious threats, I can just report him to the police. If all he does is hang around my friends and pretend to be friendly with me, I can't.

My friends don't understand why I have issues with this guy and just keeps saying things like ""but...he's such a nice guy!"". They don't seem to believe he was stalking me a couple of years ago. They are now spending a lot less time with me because the stalker is constantly asking them to hang out, and he knows that I won't hang out with them when he is present. Some of my friends have made a point of saying that if I want to hang out with them, they don't want me to say anything about the stalker when he is present because they don't want me starting a fight. Others have said that whatever happened, happened years ago and I should ""get over it"".

I would not be surprised if some of my friends have already asked him why I have issues with him, and he has told them a massively different version that makes him look like the victim. He is very charismatic, super friendly to my friends and not shy about using money for small favors like buying them drinks, so some of them might actually believe him instead.

Does anyone have any ideas how to handle this?

TL;DR: My partners family issues and drug use do not mix well with my mental illnesses. I put my problems on hold because I feel like everyone else has it worse than me. I'm tired, and I can't take any more lies. I don't blame anyone, just want some advice on what comes next, if there is a silver lining or if this is now our lives.


Let's start with a little background. I [F25] live with my partner [M35] of 6 years. I have severe mobility issues and I suffer from psychotic depression and  anxiety. 
My partner is dealing with multiple family problems. For a small context, his relationship with his mum consists of him lying to her for money and reasoning that she messed him up and then her lying to him reasoning that he promised her money which he never paid back. I'll go into more later, and is also a recovering heroin user.
My partners mum is mentally ill. She was taken into hospital to make sure she wasn't a danger to herself. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoia and depression around a year after I was.


So, this all starts 4 ish years ago when I first started having problems with my health. I was diagnosed with psychotic depression and severe anxiety, I was having panic attacks regularly and for a few years had been hearing voices and seeing things that weren't there, it must have been horrendous for my partner to live with me. I had no trust in anything he said to me, everything was an attack and my defences were so high I couldn't help what I did or said. This lead to me trying to take my own life on numerous occasions. Thankfully I was put on some medication that worked and was monitored regularly and, although I know I'll never be the same, I felt I could handle my illness better.

It was during this time that I was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I have chronic pain in every limb, joint, muscle, you name it, it hurts. I struggle so much daily and I have no idea how I would have gotten through this without my partner, he was so supportive and caring and couldn't do enough for me.

Now, as I'd been taking medication and trying to control my mind and body, I was feeling okay in myself when all this came to the surface. Three years ago, my partner was told by his mum that his dad (separated, lived in another country with his wife) had passed away from liver failure. He hadn't spoken to his dad for a few years, after an argument they had. I supported him the best I could but it was all too much for him and he ended up using again for two weeks. I couldn't blame him for that though, he didn't know how to deal with the grief and the guilt of not being able to say goodbye. He paid his mum £250 for the funeral, grieved, and started going back to normal. 

Last year in April, my partner got a call from his dad's brother. He was told that his dad (same one) had died from a heart attack. This broke him, knowing that he'd had all that time to be able to reconnect and couldn't because he'd been lied to by his mum for £250. His life spiralled and he got back into using. Again, I couldn't blame him, and I supported him through it. In November, on my birthday, his mum rang him again saying his grandma had died and that he wasn't allowed to go to the funeral because his aunt who had abused him as a 3 year old (his whole family knew, just let her get away with it) had more rights to go than him. How he dealt with that, I have no idea, I was dealing with my own problems at the time, but I still tried my best to be there for him.

This time, he nearly killed himself, he overdosed on heroin and took some of my tablets. I came home to find him not breathing, thankfully, as I pushed him up, he took a breath. My mind was all over the place I didn't know what to do, and I'm embarrassed to say that I had to get someone else to sort the ambulance out as didn't know what to do, my mind went blank. I couldn't get that image out of my head. I still dream about it.

He managed to pull through and decided that enough was enough, he was stronger than that. Christmas day, his mum rings, his grandma wasn't dead, but she is dying and he needs to go see her before its too late. He went to see her, she was dying,  couldn't even blink. She died that day. The funeral is this Wednesday. I paid £300 towards it as my partner hasn't got a job at the moment. Of course, I don't mind at all, I will support him no matter what.

So now the story has been done, here are a few bits that I missed out so I could bulk them together as my brain seems to think it'll be easier to read.

Obviously, none of this I blame on my partner, mostly I blame myself because I haven't supported him enough. Before anything is said about anyone, I need to state that I do know that addiction is a hideous thing and when not using, my partner is the most gentle, caring and loving man I have known and he was so patient when I was going through my diagnosis and medicine changes. I couldn't see my life without him.

During our relationship, I have witnessed my partner lie and I have witnessed his mum lie, all the lies seem to be solely based on money, they are both money oriented if they don't have money, they aren't happy, even if they don't need anything. I have had money go missing out my purse on numerous occasions when my partner or his mum or both have been in my house. They blame it on a ghost as I have had unexplained things happen in the house when they are both there ( that's a post for another sub though) 

I have had my partner and his mum both lie to me to borrow money from me.. I can't be angry at this as my partner pays me back for both of them.

They both seem to play on emotions. My partner always says he will pawn his XBOX or other expensive item in if I can't lend him money, which I have to borrow off my mum to stop him doing it. (have lost 3 XBOX 360s, 2 laptops, Base guitar, ps3, 2 ps4s and a Nintendo wii in 6 years so it's not a threat).

I have been burgled 17 times all spread around the homes my partner was using. (lost 4 XBOX ones, Nintendo wii, 3 all-in-one pcs, Christmas present for my family, 2 tablets and 4 smart phones).

If I ever say something out of anger or my illness, I'm not allowed to forget it, which by some of the things I have said when it's all become too much for me, can totally understand.

Now I love this man more than anything. Without the drugs, he is amazing. I do understand that drugs change a person, I hold no blame for anyone, the blame game gets us nowhere. I just need some advice on what to do because, although he's been through so much, and I am probably selfish for thinking this, but I would love fo my illnesses to be taken seriously. If I say anything about how it's not nice how his mum acts, it's always ""she has a mental illness"". I did tell him once that I had a mental disorder too, and I was ""being selfish and never caring about anyone but myself"".

I honestly do not care about the things he's done, it's in the past, I don't even know what I want, I feel so spent and drained and I have no clue what I can do next. Is there a light at the end of this tunnel or is this just how it's going to be now?",07Jan2017,2
118,"What good are people who claim to be friends, you've known longer than 13 years? I mean people who claim they have no time for you, not even to text back yet have time to hangout with each other and not communicate with you? You see their pics together on Facebook and updates but you are excluded, and when you try to speak up they say you are being dramatic. This has been going on for 4 years and everytime I unfriend these 8 or so people they send me a friend request request within a week or two and foolishly, I give them another chance.
I'm mostly ranting here but I want to know what good does it do anyone? I've tried asking if anyone has a problem with me and I get nothing as an answer, I know I'm not perfect and I can be an ass but these people seem to lack maturity to even confront issues. Maybe it's cuz I own a home and are raising a family and have a good career? Many of them live with parents still in their late 20's, going to college and wasting their lives working part time at dead end jobs like retail or the sort, unwilling to go after something more rewarding. Most of them I know dislike my anxiety filled antisocial wife. Maybe it's a combination of all these things? I just want to know why am I always excluded from these get togethers. maybe it's time I just cut the fat from my life and move on and not let them back?",07Jan2017,7

121,"I have a really good work ethic and have never been fired for my performance or even written up. I'm always on time and I'm really good at what I do. The thing is I struggle to work more than two weeks without taking a sick day and after about 3 months I get a mental block and quit my job. It's a really negative and unhealthy pattern and I want it to stop.

I'm 23 and just jump from call center to call center. I don't necessarily dislike the work and sometimes its pretty enjoyable. The pay can be very good too. Starting at $25 an hour or more. My last job was at 50k as a 9-5 customer service officer. I pay all my own rent and bills etc and am a very good saver so don't usually worry about being broke.

I've been shortlisted for a very good job that starts at 62k and has lots of opportunitys for careers growth and I'm so scared because I KNOW that with my unhealthy patterns I'm just going to fuck it up again.

I don't know how to explain what happens. I get this massive mental block in my head and can't even force myself to go into the office. Theres been many times where I have gotten ready for work like normal and as I'm about to walk out the door I just turn around and get back into bed. More than once I've even been on my way to work and still turn around. 

I do have depression and anxiety which I usually manage very well and I take medication that really helps. I'm also about to start full time counselling. When it gets to around the 3 month mark at a new job I start getting very depressed, but quitting my job and trying to start fresh makes me feel like even more of a failure.

122,"I am just getting back into the dating scene after my first serious relationship (lasted from high school through my third year of college). It was monogamous and I trusted them from the get go- fortunately, all my testing has consistently come back negative.
I'm interested in trying out casual dating/FWB relationships. Even though I plan on practicing safe sex, I also plan on asking potential partners to get tested. Is it easy to find clinics/doctors who give results online? I'm a college student and my campus clinic sends me my results through an online portal. If I find someone who goes to the same university, it'll be easy to verify whether they were tested.
However, I'm currently talking to someone who doesn't go to college. The first thing I Googled linked me to 'fake result' websites and now that has me really worried. How am I supposed to believe people if they can forge these documents?

I feel lost and like i dont belong anywhere I turn 20 this year and in my 20 years of life i struggle too think up good memories.

128,"I am able to talk to people and make friends easily. Today, I talk to my acquaintance, someone I met at a training course who happens to be going to the same annual dinner party as me. He kindly gave me a lift, we talked about our community work for over an hour and I made a new friend today. At dinner, I was surrounded by friends, and have a very close friend who accept me for who I am even though I swear and drop F bombs, and who makes me feel relaxed and happy. 

Yet, returning home tonight, I feel a deep seated uncontrollable sense of disconnection from society and hatred for society. I was never ""persecuted"" anything - generally, I was a good behaving member of society who had never been arrested (no bad/traumatic contact with police), enjoyed welfare when I was poor and never starved, had religious freedom...etc, all the things a person living in a First World Country could possibly enjoy. I never felt restricted in any way - I was free to pick which educational path I want to take, the jobs I want, who I want to date. 

You get the idea. Friends (and family) who I love and care, mutually, no bad contact with law enforcement and basically never been in any way, discriminated and persecuted before. 

Yet why do I feel disconnected from society? I spend one week alone during my holidays tidying up my room and doing reading. That was the most emotionally stable week I could have. Interacting with people makes me feel as though the distance is widening even further and it makes me feel angry and upset. I have no idea why do I feel those emotions.

Any advice? 

EDIT: I don't think it is depression. I don't feel hopeless, nor suicidal, I just don't like interacting with society despite being able to do fairly well in it, because it generates a lot of negative emotions after everything is completed. It is getting food poisoning from a gourmet cake - happy at first, after that, sick to the stomach. ",07Jan2017,11

131,"Last night, I was sitting in the car (my car, nonetheless) with two ""friends.""  One of them, Friend A, said that he was ""the smartest out of the whole crew.""  Now I really did not want to have this conversation because both of these people are extremely narcissistic and I knew that a shitshow could possibly go down if someone said something that would invalidate one of the friend's supposed intelligence.  The whole conversation would be pointless anyway because it really doesn't matter who's smarter than whom.

Friend B then went on to explain how Friend A was NOT in any way, shape, or form the smartest.  

Then Friend A said to me, ""At least I'm smarter than you; you're pretty stupid."" 

Friend B then agreed, presumably because it was an insult not aimed at her, and calling me stupid probably fueled both of their egos. 

I really wanted to defend myself, and I kind of tried, but they ended up getting in the last words. My grades are better than Friend A and, despite my better judgement, I used it as leverage.  I do not believe that grades readily determine a person's intellect. Yes, good grades can be reflective of an intelligent person, but another intelligent, lazy person could have bad grades and be just as smart.  It also depends on a variety of things that may interfere with school, whether it's family problems or something like depression. 

Friend B then said that the only thing I was good at was school and that in the ""real world"" I'm going to be lost. Then both of them went on to talk about all of the dumb things I do.  My lack of a sense of direction and coming to school late/missing too much school were really the main things they picked at. 

This is where I start to feel really shitty about the whole situation. In the past, I struggled with severe social anxiety and they were there to witness the social anxiety take over my life.  My anxiety is still present today, I just know how better manage situations so that the symptoms associated with my anxiety are less severe.  That said, there definitely still are times where my anxiety takes over and creates certain obstacles that makes easy tasks significantly harder for me to accomplish.  

Mornings are the toughest for me because I don't know what the day will bring and sitting in the comfort of my house is, well, comforting.  However, I tell myself that it'll be a good day and whatever will happen will happen.  Sometimes, though, I can't get out of my head and the anxiety takes over, literally immobilizing me.  This is why I am late to school so often and miss more school than usual.  I'm not late every day and I've probably missed about 8 days total, which isn't too bad considering I had the flu which made me miss about 4 days and my wisdom teeth removed, which took an additional day. That leaves only 3 days where I let the anxiety win, which is really a great accomplishment for me. 

I thought that since they knew about my anxiety and how much it impacted me that they would've more understanding and, you know, not call me stupid. They said I might become the next ""super senior,"" which, for those who don't know, is when a student doesn't graduate during their senior year of high school because of either lack of credits, absences, etc. and is forced to go to school for another year.  In Friend B's words, ""You can't just pick and chose when you're going to show up. When you get a job you can't just say, 'meh, I'm too tired to go to work.'""

This is when I really started to lose it (internally - I don't really show my anger externally).  I'm not going to be a super senior and I know that I can't just not show up to a job.  

I don't know what to do about this situation and any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",07Jan2017,2
133,"I'm halfway into 9th grade, couple of weeks till exams, but I'm not feeling it. I think its my subjects. 9th is the first year where we chose our subjects. Thing is, it was pretty much my parents who chose it for me.

I'll give you the choices to give a bigger picture.

- English Literature, Art, French, History or Psychology
- Accounts or Biology
- Chemistry or Economics
- Physics or Business

Now, my subjects are the first mentioned in every choice. I don't mind the science subjects, they're okay. I dont like Literature and Accounting. 

Career choice will better determine subject choices, i know. Problem is, I dont have a fixed career choice yet, but thats still years away. Although, I'm going to state what I'd go for.

- Film/Cinema (I've got a good idea already, I just need equipment. I know, it's not the equipment but the story, although that's hard if your camera doesnt even have video, smh.)
- Graphic Design/Illustration (Already dabbled in this and made some $$$)
- Industrial/Product Design
- Architecture
(The latter two, I have almost zero knowledge in, but seems interesting.)

And yes, I do see the recurring theme in this mini list, which is: they are in the creative area. Which is something my parents dont really support. They rather have me as an Aviation Engineer. I still yet have to pick up interest for that. Not happening anytime soon though.

(Now for the first choice.)

I'd want to be a polyglot too, but learning languages in school isn't my thing. I don't like it. Also, it's rather slow, boring and exhausting too. (You also get the pressure from making mistakes, which would be understandable to people of the real world that you'd converse with.)

I despise History. *period* (Pun not intended.)

I personally dont like reading. Why did I take literature? Well, I've heard that since I'm in a foreign country, I wouldn't need to undergo IELTS in the future since I'm learning GCSE Literature. (?) And, it seems like it's got higher credits that everything else (I still dont understand that.) My mom told me today before going to sleep: ""Okay sure you can chan

Art is embedded in my heart. Havent really done art for myself since I havent taken the subject. But I love art, no question. My parents say that I don't have to take it as a subject in school though. (But its the only subject i'd do work for ✌🏻️😂)

If I wouldnt be able to take up art, Psychology might be okay-ish, idrk. It seems interesting. People who took it arent complaining after all.

(Account v Bio)

I dont mind accounting, just the atmosphere im learning it in is really draining my energy. It bores the hell out of me. I'd love to see some convincing factors of Accounting too.

Also, my grandfather told me that I could take up Nursing since its a good 4 year course and would get you a job anywhere with good pay. Then, once I save up alot, I could pursue those other passions (music too &lt;3 (instruments arent cheap, fam)) If I choose to take this path, bio would help me with this medical field.

Now, i'm hired by Company A and Company A pays me, but I would feel like an absolute asshole if I were to call them and say this job you've given me sucks I want you to find me another place, hell I could probably get fired.

I don't really care about much money, but I do need a job, its just that this place is miserable

Before this I interned at a IT company for a year and absolutely loved it and didnt even get any pay

So i'm not sure what to do... Be miserable working at Company B or call up Company A and ask them for another place if they don't just straight up fire me because I want to quit after a week

141,"First off I just want to say that my family doesn't talk about our problems with each other to solve them. An open discussion is pretty much impossible with both of my parents.

Throughout my entire life my parents have never lived together for long periods of time. I, along with my three older siblings, lived with my mother. My father would only come to see us once a year around Christmas time for about a week, then he would be gone. Despite this somewhat odd familial practice, my parents were married and not divorced. When I turned 18 I moved in with my father, for financial reasons. He lives in a completely different country and that's where I've been ever since.

My father was apparently in a previous marriage before he met my mother. I don't know much of the specifics because they refuse to talk about it, but I always assumed that his previous marriage dissolved before he tied the knot with my mother. A couple years ago I was introduced to two of my half-brothers from a previous relationship my father had. No one in my family knew about them except my father and to make matters worse they were only a few months younger than my oldest sibling. To put it simply, he either cheated on my mother or she was his mistress at the time.

Now this caused quite a bit of distress in the family that was pretty much swept under the rug by force. My father continued on like it wasn't a big deal at all, while my siblings and I struggled to understand the truth. We couldn't ask our father about it because he wouldn't tell us anything. Our mother refused to speak about it as well.

Now earlier this week my father introduced me to two more half-siblings of mine but there is another problem: they're both younger than me. And I was supposed to be the youngest. Their mother is a third woman who has never been mentioned before. My mother was obviously disturbed by this revelation, as were my siblings, but before they could process it fully my father revealed another half-sibling from another woman later that day who's young enough to be my child.

Just to clarify that's four children with woman A (my mother), two children with woman B (barely younger than my oldest full sibling), two with woman C (both younger than me), and at least one with woman D (I'm old enough to be his father).

I don't really know how my mother is currently feeling, we're not really close and we don't talk to each other that much. My older siblings are worried. They think divorce may be on the horizon. My mother is an incredibly religious Christian so I could never imagine her getting a divorce, but I don't know anymore. I feel like I'm in uncharted territory. And now my mother has been contacting me more and more to try and get information about my half-siblings and it all feels very wrong. She keeps making an emphasis on how I should do it in a way so that my father isn't aware. Maybe I sound paranoid saying this, but I feel like she is trying to use me to gain leverage against my father for the future. She's always been manipulative and I really don't want to get caught between any kind of conflict my mother and father may have. My two oldest siblings (full-siblings) have already taken my mother's side in this but I really don't want to do that. I'm not excusing what my father did or saying it was okay in anyway whatsoever, but I really don't want to be reduced to a convenient asset for my mother's case against him. I know it sounds selfish and it probably is but that is where I currently stand.

Am I overreacting or interpreting this the wrong way? Is it wrong for me to not take my mother's side since she was repeatedly cheated on? Please help.",07Jan2017,5

One day after we went out for lunch he tried to kiss me, and when I pulled away he tried to force me to kiss him (I wear makeup and you could see it on his cheek after this happened, so like that's how hard he tried to force me). So he asked me why I didn't want to kiss him and after I explained that I had a boyfriend he went on a bit of a tangent about how girls and guys can't really be friends and other such nonsense, and he kept coming back to the fact that I had a boyfriend, and asking if my boyfriend was fine with us being ""friends"", and I was feeling massively on edge. So I was like ""Just because I have a boyfriend does not mean we can't be friends"" and I said I had to go catch my bus and ran off as fast as I could. He never apologized for trying to force me to kiss him, and the way the conversation went it sounded like he blamed me for it happening and that he would try something like that again.

151,"Hi there.

First of all, I am not a native English speaker sorry if I will make some mistakes.
In October I got my bachelor's degree and after that, I continued my study with a master. I've chosen it following various advises both from professors and students and it seemed a fine choice. This university is in another city so I had to move and it was very exciting at first. For the first weeks, I followed the classes and it was fine but I was struggling to find a room for rent and was staying in a B&amp;B. The situation was so bad that I found a room only after more than a month of searching and by then a lot of my excitement was gone. But, I kept going, thinking that once I would had a place to live things would be getting easier. Well, they didn't. I can't feel motivated anymore, I don't think I like this master and, even if this is one of the most important University in my country, I think that it is very poorly organized with a lot of courses that don't make sense with the type of master. Also, due to the difficulty of the first time I have a lot of work to do to try and catch up with the rest of the class and I haven't really connected with anyone, neither people of the University (who I mostly can't stand) nor the roommates.

In this Christmas Holidays, I was supposed to study and prepare for the exams but I couldn't and this is very new to me. I've always liked what I am studying and I was very passionate about it; studying has never been a problem and I've graduated with highest honors. Be good at it, in some way, was comforting and part of who I am. But now? Now I just can't. I don't like many of the courses and this situation is compromising my self-confidence regarding my capabilities; I feel slow, stupid and not engaged anymore. 

The last problem to this mess is the money. I don't have money. The only way for me to study and to sustain myself in another city is with a scholarship. But to obtain a scholarship I would need to be able to pass my exams and with good grades, two things that I don't think I can do it right know.

What should I do? I keep saying to myself that maybe it is just for now and that once I will had enough time to familiarize with the city and the University I will feel better and I will start to study as usual again. But the more time passes and the more I think that this won't ever happen and I will continue to feel miserable and to spend money for nothing. But what else can I do? In my old University, there isn't a master that I would like to do, they cover a field of studies in wich I am not really interested. I could quit and work and go to another university next year, maybe. I don't know. Right now I can't think of a solution, I feel trapped between various situations and none of them are good for me.

tl, dr: I may have chosen a wrong master for me. I don't like it, I don't like the city, I don't like my colleagues. I'm spending a lot of money and I feel trapped. What should i do?",07Jan2017,2

I become emotionless and distant in any sexual or relationship-strengthening matters. It left them feeling unwanted in even though I truly did care about them.  

Overall bonding or becoming intimate with people seems foreign to me. I currently have no friends in college and stay in my dorm 95% of the days. I tried meeting with the people on my floor the first few days but then for some reason retracted back into solitude and now I mostly ignore them. Writing this out has made me realize I should probably see the university counselor. I have had cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety in the past but the thing is I never could comfortably share my full situation with my therapist so I never really got treated. 

I guess I'm looking for advice to not feel so helpless.

153,"A little background. I (M/30) am from India. I am living with my family which is usual here. I have been paying my share of expenses for a few years now. I dropped out of a professional course last year which resulted in years of wasted study time. I earn low income working online, just enough to cover my household expenses, personal expenses and some amount towards investment. I am looking to start a business but I am scared to make the leap.

My father is asking me to shoulder all of the household expenses (which would be around the same amount I earn each month) or get out of the house. It is his house so he can do that. He has retired but is otherwise capable of working and is working on his personal projects.

My mother is trying to shield me from this. Firstly because I am her son and she wants to keep me in a cocoon, which I completely dislike.  She also hates my father due to his abusive nature towards her and me (a little). This is a reason I share with her and I don't like helping my father in any way.

If I go to live on my own it would be as an growing up / adventure type of thing for me. But my father is very likely to interpret it as if I have forsaken my family as I would be choosing to live alone instead of paying the expenses at home.

What should I do:

Pay the money at home? If yes, then how much (as % of total household expenses)?

Or

Go live on my own and risk alienating my family and still end up paying a similar amount (because of added rent and duplicate expenses)?

EDIT 1 : In our culture it is common for parents to support children for some time after they turn 18. My father did the bare minimum till I turned 18 and I have been earning and studying and taking care of my personal expenses since then. It is also expected for children to support their parents when they retire. So if I go to live alone when given a choice to pay and stay, it would be bad from the societal point of view.

It is important to note that my father spent considerable amount on my younger sister (F/24) for her education, mobiles, a 2 wheeler and all other expenses (which are considerably higher than mine) while he did only the minimum for me and I was expected to and did buy all these on my own. But now that she has completed her education and is earning considerably more than me, I am expected to full bear the household expenses while my father specifically said that he will not be taking money from my sister not now, not ever, never. This partiality pisses me off because I sacrificed a lot when we I was a child and we did not have money. But when we did have money it all went to my sister.",07Jan2017,1
154,"So i fucked up. Long story short, I restarted comunicating with my cousin, with whom I stopped last winter, because he ill treated me in time of deep drepression.

I said i grew up, I had to restart talking to the family I just trew away last year, because I felt I grew, I got past it and that it's best for me not to limit a part of myself by keeping a grudge. 

Now the problem is, I had to call him today cause something happens at his apartment, so we talked, a lot, and from the free me, during the talk I somehow I felt off the wagon, to the same kind of convos, same kind of me trying to impress him (he is older than me) and I only made it worse when I tried to fix it. I feel like I'm back go my bad habits regarding him, and it is killing me fastly from the inside.

Now I feel limited, subdued, angry again, he did not do or say anything ill, I think it's just the path I know I set myself onto once again.

156,"**Not important:** I have no friends, dating prospects, not much family, and no pets. Friends only came around for drama or to ask me for money, my ex of 3 years was controlling and abusive on several levels, and now that I'm single, men my age don't want anything serious, and men ten years older will never be an option for me. So here I am, alone. I was always more of a people person, constantly putting others before myself and my own happiness, but now, I have a pretty low tolerance for bullshit and I'm trying hard to get myself where I want to be. Physically, mentally, financially, etc.

**Important:** I have $10,000 in the bank. Not enough for anything really, but I feel like I should be doing something with it. Currently trying to decide between an apartment or townhome until my credit becomes established enough to start looking at detached homes and I can save more to afford furniture, moving costs, etc. I've lived in apartments and rented rooms before, off lease, but I always hated it. Even the luxury apartments had their fair share of issues and renting from strangers was never a good idea to begin with. Got taken advantage of in a short amount of time. Townhome seems better, similarly priced, and not like a complete waste of money.

158,"Here's a little bit of background. My parents had divorced back in 2008 or so, giving my father this insane idea to look elsewhere for women. He looked into Ukraine and had met a woman in 2010. Eventually the relationship got strong enough to where they had started a visa process and they married here in the US. The relationship didn't work out and she flew back. They got divorced. Don't want to get too much into the first relationship. 

Now this one seems quite a bit different. This lady my father is bringing to the US seems very nice and collected. She has a 19yo son (I'm 20, which is exciting in a sense. I've never had a brother before.). I have not spoken to either of them, I do know the son speaks decent English, and his mom not so much, but that's something that can be worked on. 

To be honest I have no idea how this is going to play out, seeing that the first time around it had been a huge red flag from day one. I'm not getting any bad signs from this go around. But still, if anyone has any thoughts or advice, that would be great.

my bestfriends birthday, held in 2 places, first one a fancy restaurant, second one a club/bar.
around 20 people went to the restaurant,
and around 16 people went to the bar/club
These 4 people who didnt go were either monitored by their parents or had religious beliefs that prevented them from drinking. However i do not fall into both these categories. My parents couldnt give two shits about whatever i do.

But on the spot, when i was confronted wether i wanted to go to the club or not, i started sweating profusely, crippling self consciousness and social anxiety and worrying about wether ADULTS would be staring at me, this short chinese KID with long hair who looks out of place and stands out ANYWHERE. I said no. but i really wanted to go, but i at the same time, did not want THEM to go.

I am amazingly comfortable around people, i bond with people really fast and get really easy to talk to. Hardly a hitch in conversation EVER. But howcome, whenever it comes to talking about alcohol,partying,dancing,music,smoking,etc i run out of words? i stutter and becomes extroadinarily cringey and awkward. Is it my refusal to grow up? or is it something deeper, like a mental illness?

That was two years ago, I've since managed to become content being on my own and have moved on. I've even started dating - a lot. The problem is that I've become afraid of commitment (big or small). I date multiple men and everytime one of them talks about being exclusive I completely withdraw. I like the idea of a serious relationship but I don't think anyone is worth the pain I went through the first time. The possibility of betrayl is just something I can't get over. I feel like the longer I remain single, the more I comply with the thought that I don't need anyone. I'm 26 now, and I'm afraid that I'll regret this decision in the long run.

The dog was what broke the camel's back so I left and did the whole ""finding yourself"" navel-gazing roadtrip bullshit so typical of someone's early twenties. The problem is that somehow, and I have no fucking idea how, they found me. I got a call from them and they just went _off_. 

They said they were going to the police, tell them I'm crazy, all that nonsense. The thing is that I _do_ have a history of being institutionalized. What they probably won't mention is that I attempted suicide _because_ of them. I just desperately needed to be away from them and at the time it felt like the only way. Tweens are stupid I don't know what to tell you.

174,"I posted on here about this before, but…I want this post to be a bit more definitive about this issue I’m having. I’ll try to keep it short, and clear. So…I have learning disabilities. I’m not stupid, but I am a bit slower with this whole High School thing than other kids. I’m a senior, but…My parents and all the higher ups at the school are saying, “Given Jack’s nature, the way he does school, maybe he should go at least an extra semester, or maybe an extra full year, at least one more.” And my dad sat me down and said, “Jack, no offense, but, I don’t think your ready to be an adult just yet. And you don’t really know what you want to do. You wanna be a big name Hollywood movie director that eventually directs a Star Wars movie, but that’s not easy. And given your learning disabilities, that decreases the chances of you ever directing, say, a Marvel movie, or a Godzilla movie, or a Star Wars movie, which is what you want to do. Given that, and I don’t think your ready for adulthood just yet, you probably should spend another year in high school to prepare for adulthood more.”

And, he’s right. I don’t think I’m ready to be an adult just yet, and, yeah, I could use at least another year to prepare, since, a lot of people say it starts as soon as you get out of high school, and that’s in five months. I don’t think I’m ready to be an adult in just five months. I haven’t even ever had a job yet. And I still don’t know how to drive. I can’t do this in five months! So yeah, maybe, go to my high school for at least another year, spend that year, September 2017-June 2018, or maybe until January 2018 if I do just another semester, spend the next year or so figuring out, saying to myself,

“Ok me, I know how badly you want the world to see your vision of ’The Perfect Star Wars Movie’, one that surpasses even ‘The Empire Strikes Back’, but that’s probably not gonna happen. Hey, maybe it will, but, probably not. And, face it, me, your not ready to be an adult yet. You know it, and so does everyone else. I know you feel like being a Super Senior would be embarrassing, I know your eager to go to college, but…You’re not ready yet. Take another year to figure out an alternative to being THE BEST STAR WARS DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME since that probably won’t happen, and preparing for adulthood. Even if you don’t do one year more of high school, maybe you do FIVE more years of high school…Who cares? You have a learning disability, you’re different, there’s nothing you can do about it. Just…Take another year, and then, hit adulthood and college hood in full stride.”

BUT…There are some thing about that, that I don’t want to do. One, this might sound silly, but, “Class of 2017” sounds a lot catchier than “Class of 2018”. And, I feel like, the Class of 2017 is, what I’m supposed to be. Like, that’s what I’m meant to be apart of. But then again…maybe not. And that is just my viewpoint. And hey, “17” and “18” are just numbers. I should just make sure to be apart of “Class Of” something, who cares about the number? Thing is…I’m sick of my school. The teachers, the building, the same rooms all looking the same, the hallways, the cafeteria…I’ve been there almost everyday since September 2013, and, I’m sick of it. Going there another year sounds horrendous. But…there is a possibility I could do all my extra stuff online. But not a guarantee. I don’t see why not, which is annoying. Like, why can’t I just transition to all online so I don’t have to go there yet another year? Like, really? They haven’t even said why “it’s not a guarantee”, that’s all they said! And thing is…I have not one, not two, but THREE Academic Support hours. Meaning…I only have four classes actually (my school is seven hours). I’m passing two of them, one of them is a full A+ actually, I know right, the other two are straight up E’s. So, that shows how mixed I am with this whole High School thing. Two of my classes are A’s, meaning, yeah, I can do this sometimes, but…other times, not so much. Thing is…I still could get out this year. I really could. I really could be “The Class of 2017”. How? By passing the finals. If I legit pass all the finals…I’ll be getting my diploma THIS JUNE, and in college THIS SEPTEMBER. It could happen. But, my dad actually said to me,

“This may sound crazy, but, you should intentionally fail your finals, because, like I said, coming from someone with experience, I don’t think your ready yet.” 

And…Maybe my dad is right? He is my dad. 

So…Given all of this, given my slow learning curves, and how I’m not really ready for adulthood or college just yet, but, since I am sick of my school, and just doing online “isn’t a guarantee” for some reason, but, I still could get out this June if I pass the finals, and, which sounds exciting…

Should I reach for the more catchy one “Class Of 2017”, since, it is a bit more catchy, as silly as that sounds, and, I am sick of that building, and the idea of getting out this year is exciting….Or should I reach for “Class of 2018”, since I’m not quite ready yet? Or…Maybe just see what happens? Maybe I will pass the finals and get out this year, but maybe I won’t and go back? Both could happen. Right now, it is looking more and more like “Class of 2018”, but….Being apart of the “Class of 2017” isn’t out of the realm of possibility just yet, but, it is getting pretty darn close. So…What should I do? Full on reach to get out this year, start hardcore studying for the finals, or just go back another year so I can have more time to prepare myself….Or just see what happens, and maybe getting out this year will happen, maybe it won’t?

To recap, my husband and I are new homeowners. We are both in the mortgage. 6 months ago, he was still in training and living away from home.

As we had just put a good chunk of our money into the house, we couldn't afford to buy a new furnace for this winter. We decided to chance it, and hope for the best.

Essentially making it so that my bill would be the same as I had been paying before. 

Since we weren't sure if the furnace we had would quit halfway through winter, I decided it wouldn't hurt to get it replaced, and I assumed like most leases, I would just pay more to purchase the unit when we had more money. 

6 months later, same guy comes in saying that he was just going to inspect the unit to ensure that it was running well and that it was installed properly. Not thinking much about it, I let him in and he goes to say that the unit we have is not the unit we signed on for. 

He's also surprised that we haven't been billed for the unit at all in 6 months, and that he wouldn't say anything about it and that we wouldn't have to retroactively pay for it. However, he does say that because the unit installed was not the one we signed up for, and that the install was done wrong, that we would have to sign a new installation agreement to upgrade our unit to a new one. 

And that because we are signing on in 2017 that we would be eligible for a rebate for the new carbon tax that Ontario is issuing. Which meant that we would essentially not pay this tax. 

This time around, my husband is home. This time, both our names are on this new contract. But the thing that really made me wake up to the scam was that he took the contact info on our unit, as well as the install tag. Our new contract also has a new company name on it. 

My husband thought nothing of it, as companies change names. Upon investigation, it turns out this salesman is no longer a part of the company that is leasing the unit we have, and what he led me to believe I was buying was actually not what I thought it was. 

I've already cancelled the new contract and have found out that it is not valid anyway. However, I'm worried about the old contract.

My original contract was filled out improperly and does not include how much I'm supposed to be paying total per month including taxes. It's not signed by my husband who is the other homeowner. 

They took my old furnace and AC, and I've basically been using their equipment without having paid for it since they've not been billing me. 

What do I do? I've thought of going to BBB about it but I'm not sure what they can do 6 months after the fact.",07Jan2017,2

193,"Okay so this all started last year. I switched into a different social studies teachers class because my other one hated me. But anyways around this time last year I was in a new class. I started talking to this kid, Sam. Sam, had a girlfriend at the time but we would still talk a lot. We would snapchat, text, meet up in the hallway, talk during class, all that kinda stuff. Our social studies teacher thought we were dating. Occasionally he wouldn't have a girlfriend anymore so we would flirt and do everything we already did only more. But then, he got another girlfriend (Jessica). He didn't think that I would like him, because not to be rude, but sam wasn't as popular as me. Which I didn't care, I didn't care if I was popular and he wasn't, I cared about Sam. He ended up really liking Jessica, even tho he would still talk to me all the time and flirt and snapchat. We also had a few times where our teacher caught us meeting up. But anyways, I had to tell myself to move on. So I went to his best friend. Gabe. He was hot, funny, a douche, and a little shy. But all the girls wanted him. I talked to Gabe for a while, like alllll the time. We ended up having a thing. But, let me remind u Sam and I still talked as much as we always had. Eventually Jessica and Sam broke up. But I was still fucking around with Gabe. I wasn't about to just jump on the Sam train. Me and Gabe would talk a ton tho even more then I did with Sam. Me and Gabe were at a point where we kinda fizzled out so Sam and I talked a lot. This kid in social studies that was friends with Sam and Gabe told me to kiss sam like as a dare. A month later odly, Sam brought up the kiss and we hung out and kissed in a fucking shrubbery. My friends were there too but Sam was an awful kisser. It felt like a fucking slug went down MY throat. Gabe found out and was kinda pissed. But for a long time Sam was telling Gabe not to like me because sam liked me and he didn't want his best friend in the way If u know what I mean. Gabe TAKES everything that sam says to heart. But all of us still talked a lot during the summer. We hung out a few times too. Then, randomly Gabe and sam block me on snapchat and we didn't talk much after that. Me and Gabe unblocked and blocked each other a few times during the start of the year, now we never talk. I miss Gabe, I miss sam. But I'm over sam. I want Gabe back but even when I text him he ignores the texts, or the long paragraphs I send. I don't know what to do. Can anyone guide me or help tell me what to do? I haven't had a thing like I did with Gabe in a long time now and idk what to do. Please help. ",07Jan2017,1
194,"Hi guys,
Looking for some advice here as whether or not to discontinue my PhD. My phD is in molecular microbiology. I started in September. From the start I never really thought I deserved to get the phD position. I felt I was just kind of lucky to get it as I was only called for one interview and at the end of that interview it was offered to me so I kinda felt I lucked out and I wouldnt be able for it. But because they choose me, I told myself they must have chose me for a reason and that maybe I would be able for it. When I started in September I was just getting to grips with things and doing a bit of lab work but mostly reading which was fine. It started getting more intense with lab work as the weeks went on and I was trying to get to grips with new protocols and techniques and to get them right. I now found myself completely overwhelmed with things. I am constantly anxious and worried about messing up protocols or things not working. My OCD also has a big factor in it. I constantly don't trust myself that I have done things right or spend too long at something because of my OCD tendencies. My OCD has definitely got a lot worse since starting. I feel constantly worried and sick that protocols won't work out or if I have sent samples for sequencing, that the results won't come back properly and that that will be money wasted. I also feel I haven't made a lot of progress so far. I no longer feel interested in the topic but just worried and anxious all the time.I feel completely lost at the minute and a bit trapped. I don't know if I should leave, if I even can leave or if that will look bad when going for job interviews? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",07Jan2017,2

206,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone one else has successfully recovered from a serious back injury weight lifting and mental stress and came back to the gym.  

For me, it's 30% physical, where the occasional minor workout like lifting tiny steel posts can cause very minor back pain, mostly muscle soreness.  The other 70% (or even 99%) is because the day I threw out my back (fucking three years ago...) was when I lost my job, the apartment I literally moved into the day prior, and even though I was in the best shape of my life, threw out my back squatting at the gym.    

I have found a few successful back exercises and stretches over this time that are effective, but I still can't bring myself to be serious with them.  I've had depression in the past as well, so that's also another negative factor currently.  I'm starting to think that I might want to work out with a rehab physician at the hospital just to get myself back into the groove where I can trust my body again.

207,"My wife who is a smoker fell pregnant just before I left for work overseas for a few months. She said that she was cutting down on smoking to the level of quitting. (I do realise that smoking isn't the worst thing for babies in utero, that isn't the issue) 

Upon my return home, I have noticed that she is still smoking, even though she doesn't do it at home (I am on Christmas leave so she at times insists to go to the shops without me) there is evidence that I have found and also that her older child mentioned it. She is smoking around 10 cigarettes a day which is far from quitting sort of levels in my mind.

My question is this: I would honestly like her to quit smoking as I am not a smoker myself. I do feel aggrieved that she is outright lying to my face about the quitting and am unsure how to bring up the issue and what to say without her flying off the handle.",07Jan2017,1

The citation specifies that it was under or near passenger seat I don t know where it was but do I have grounds for this to be dismissed?? I don t have cash for an attorney I m a broke college student. I also admitted to smoking to the officer but this was coerced, I did not smoke, but I was nervous and exposed to the effects and felt as if I d be lying if I said I hadn t smoked.

215,"I purchased a home last year. Here in Michigan the winters can get pretty nippy and it's been interesting watching how my energy bills (gas heat) fluctuate throughout the year.

One thing I've been curious about since I've lived here is, do things like furniture and blinds greatly affect overall heat distribution? I know that completely blocking a vent is harmful to the system, but in my case my living room is laid out in a way that kind of isolates the one floor vent in the room.

To elaborate, the floor vent is centered under the picture window. The couch is also centered in front of the window (about a foot and a half away from the wall and ~4 inches from the vent). This picture window also has thick blinds covering it. What I wonder is, do the blinds and couch ""absorb"" and waste heat? Or do they reach a certain temperature and they become irrelevant? 

This same situation is somewhat replicated in our bedroom. The bed is centered under the window as well as the floor vent. This one doesn't seem to be troublesome though as there is enough clearance that I can feel the heat flowing from the underside of the bed.

Now I know rearranging is an option in both rooms, and my house isn't very large to begin with so the energy bills aren't high. But the rooms are set up ideally (plus I have a rug that really ties the room together). This is more of a curiosity question on if large objects can noticeably affect the efficiency of a heating system.

Tl;Dr
Do furniture and other objects that are near, but not blocking, heat vents affect efficiency?",07Jan2017,1

218,"So growing up, I was the youngest in the family. My oldest brother left for college when I was young, and every year he and his wife would mail us amazing Christmas gifts. In 2016 they got us some amazing stuff as usual. I didn't know what they like, so I got them some toys and chocolate from Walmart, and the wife a gingerbread house. They thought they were crappy gifts, and felt betrayed about how little effort we put into the gifts for me. After they put so much effort into their gifts. I feel like shit for not giving them something amazing they deserve, but I didn't know what they like. I'm pretty sure their whole family hates me, and I don't know what to do.

219,"Im currently living in an apartment in nyc with my parents and our upstairs neighbor apparently keeps complaining about noise coming from our apartment.

Its been a couple of weeks and im still receiving letters from neighbors saying im playing the drums and that doing so violates the lease.

I've done a fair amount of web design but it wasn't super interesting and I don't think it's a good career choice with how competitive it is and how sites like SquareSpace are going to reduce demand for web developers (frontend at least).
