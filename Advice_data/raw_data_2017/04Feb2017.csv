10,"I'm ugly, short, have no social skills, no experiences, no confidence, or any prospects for success relating to any human connection at all.

I do however, have a parent who supports me financially in anything I want, and right now I'm doing just what I want along with trying to fix my setback when it comes to my flaws. 

But it's starting to feel like a pointless pursuit because I'm going to be 21 this year, and the part of your life when you're allowed to just muck around with your friends, just having fun-bicycling around, sleepovers, house-parties, hanging outside, playing sports, and meeting other young people, is over. I've been alone since a very early age and I can't remember the last time I had genuine fun. I even find myself fantasizing about hanging out with people where I'm appreciated and people enjoy my presence. I'm mentally stuck in pre-highschool waiting for all these experiences while most others have just moved on and even starting their adult lives. I know I will never experience any of this of course, and I'm also ashamed for feeling this since it's so trivial.

I'd wager though that people who got to experience all this don't really understand how important it is. It's not only about the experiences themselves and the fun, but also about a feeling of acceptance, belonging, and a sense of security with the world. I've not read into it but that is my intuitive assessment from my experience at least.

I could cope with having messed up my childhood if I was goodlooking and thus could get an acceptable set of experiences and human contact that substitutes for this, but since I'm in this situation in the first place chances are I'm not, and that is the case. If I was really goodlooking I would be respected and my lackluster social skills be halo'ed away, and this would give me a chance to develop them in the first place!

But, I live in a first world country, with clean water, food, a car, a computer, with 100% free-time to do what I want. I don't have to work, which I realize puts me in the absolute top in terms of luck. I grew up poor, so this freedom is a huge change and I think it alone should make me content, but it doesn't. I still feel like I'm missing out on crucial aspects of the human experience and this makes me want to end it.

What I find interesting is that I think that if I got to experience all of this growing up, I would still prefer to spend most of my time just as I do now, the only difference being the occasional social stuff!

I know that 3rd world people live in much worse conditions that I could ever imagine-even 1st world people, that monks in Asia grow up and live without ANY of what I fret about not having-yet they do fine (I'm assuming), etc. and I WANT to force myself to just indulge 100% with my hobbies and passions and ignore everything else until I die. 

How can I do this?

The ""stop whining people have it worse"", ""look at the bright side"", ""play the cards you're dealt"", philosophies seems to never have worked for me....

18,"So it's my friend's birthday this weekend, and she had said she might have plans with family. However, I didn't want there to be any possibility that she might spend her birthday alone, so I said if she doesn't have any other plans, we should hang, but no pressure! Then the next day she said her family called and made plans with her, and I was genuinely happy because I know she was really excited to see them. 

Then the day after that, she told me she said to one of them ""Can we invite Hayley along? She said she wanted to be part of the celebration"" and they said yes so she invited me. 

Immediately I was thinking ""Oh no, I think she misunderstood me and thinks that I'm super needy and/or that I invited myself over and inserted myself into her birthday plans."" I asked if it was really okay with her, and did her family for sure not mind, because I knew she never got to see them much and that she might like a visit with just them. She said no no not at all, and that I was just one of the family anyways. I thought that was really sweet and said I would love to go, and now I'm going.

Probably freaking out over nothihg but oh my god help!
u/panicandthrow150m
As the title says I am probably freaking out over nothing, but this stuff just makes me nervous. The short of it is I am roughly 24 hours late. I have been on the pill for a few years (I'm 22) and other than last week - which was a bit of a whirlwind where I missed 2 - I really don't miss any pills. Had sex with my boyfriend a couple times over the weekend and used condoms as per usual as well.

I realize this makes pregnancy very unlikely, however, this is very unusual for me to be late. The only other time I've been a little late was for a couple months a year ago when I switched pills. My body doesn't hesitate to let me know when my period is coming, so to not feel much of anything really worries me.

Again I know I must be overreacting but I just want it to come or to be able to definitively find out what is going on. If anyone has some insight, advice, or anything at this point I'd love to hear it. Help me, Reddit! :(

The thing I need advice on is that I'm not ""known"" for never getting offended, but to my closer friends it is definitely common knowledge that I dont get offended by things even if they bring up something embarassing from the past or something, I usually just embrace it and turn it into something funny while making fun of myself. The problem is that my really close friends have started to abuse this a little more and just taking little tiny jabs at me that I understand are in good fun. (for purposes of explaining lets say my name is Ricky) for instance I'll cough and immediatly  two of them will go ""shut up ricky!"" or if I make a bad pun I'll get a harsh (not malicious) middle finger. Just little things like that, and I know they dont intend for it to offend me, but its starting too, after literal months of these jabs, its really starting to wear me out emotionally because I know im not supposed to be thrown off by this because I havent in the past, but I feel like my friends have started to take this aspect of me for granted.

39,"So I'm in a tough spot...concerning my ex and my current boyfriend. I dated my ex for 4 years, he wasn't the best boyfriend..always looking for attention somewhere else, party type guy. When things were good, they were good. We moved in together and we overall had fun together. It ended up with him cheating on me, I kicked him out..only to give him a few chances, but when it was convenient for him. I was heart broken, I tried everything I possibly could for us...he just wasn't ready. However, our chemistry was never questionable, we loved each other. From his personality, I was the good thing for him, his family loved us, and he loved me the most that he could, and the most he will probably ever love someone...same way for me, except I was the committed one. I ended up moving 20 minutes away after that for a career I was ready to start. I was on my own, doing good. I was ready to leave him behind, because he wasn't ready to give up his lifestyle of being with many other people and focus on our relationship. It was then that I had met a guy in the town I moved to...and he kind of knew and understood my past. He was always willing to help out, since I was living alone...and he made it easy to focus my mind on someone else for once. We started dating and he is just totally opposite of my ex. I can trust him, I can be myself around him. And he understands me. We ended up moving in together this past year and things really connect well with us. My family loves him, and his family loves me. Except....I can't fit my heart around him the same way I did with my ex. It's just not there. It may have been ruined for me with everything I went through with my ex...but there are still sparks for both of us whenever we see each other. I don't think I can ever love someone, even this awesome new guy, the way I loved my ex. And it terrifies me...because I don't want to settle down with someone if I'm even remotely unsure of my feelings. And I don't know if I lost the love of my life already--because I know for sure how I felt for him...even to this day...even after everything. But I'm always told, don't ever run back to what breaks you, and I can't guarantee he will ever change for me. But I can't just settle for someone else and hope my feelings will one day change for the best for him....and I'm just scared it's not going to get better from here...we have been together for a year already and that first year for new couples should be all feelings and love and can't keep away from each other. It was never this way for me, sometimes I even find myself pushing him away. But I know my ex realizes now that this was never a game, never something to mess with because now he's looking at losing me to another guy, something he's never had to worry about because I always chased him. So I'm not sure if he will mature now and be a complete different guy for this....or if I need to stick with the guy who does everything right....that I don't connect with like I did my ex. :( ",04Feb2017,1
40,"I need some advice on how to help one of my good friends. She has been having a really rough time for a while now, but she's gotten hit really hard with a couple of things in the last 6 months that have really made life a lot harder for her. She asked me to call her a little while ago and when I did she was crying and just spiraling out of control. She said that she has been feeling really paranoid lately, like she's a burden on everyone around her. She's been struggling with what I suspect are some psychological issues for a while now, and hasn't really gotten the help she needs. Today was the first time that she mentioned being depressed. She says that she cries all the time now and ""it is a struggle everyday not to kill myself"", and ""if it weren't for my dogs I would have already done it, but I can't leave them"". I have advised her for quite a while now to go get mental health counseling, and have offered to talk to her anytime she needs. Some of the issues that have happened in the last 6 months that I think really contributed to this are:

1. She got kicked out of school for poor grades
2. She is on the verge of filing bankruptcy (due to unpaid medical bills, student loans, and credit card debt)
3. One of her dogs has been ill recently and she still doesn't know the cause
4. Her brother moved away to another state
5. Her relationship with her boyfriend ended

What really complicates this are that A: She can barely make ends meet to support her debt/cost of living B: She no longer gets free mental health services through the school as a student C: She is still working at the school that kicked her out, as a means to generate income until she figures out what she wants to do next which further reminds and reinforces that she is a ""failure"" D: She comes from a very unsupportive family (parents are divorced, narcissistic, and do not show a vested interest in helping and supporting their children.) 

I know right now she is feeling really hopeless. She is in major debt, making barely enough to get by, has no idea where to go in terms of her career, and all of her direct family members are selfish or dealing with their own matters and have no time/energy to help. She doesn't have a lot of friends, and she believes the ones that she does have pity her/want to get rid of her. 

Some of the things that I have tried to do to help:

1. Encouraged her to seek counseling/psychiatric help
2. Reassured her that I'm her friend and I understand how she feels
3. Encouraged her to seek career counseling
4. Offered to talk to her anytime she needs to vent or talk to someone

Right now I'm just feeling really scared because I don't know how I can help. Each time I suggest going to the psychiatrist she says that she can't afford it. And now with the added cost of vet bills for her sick dog her monthly income is stretched even thinner than before. She keeps putting off looking for another job and filing for bankruptcy despite admittedly needing to do both of these things. If this were anyone else I would contact their family to try to get them to help her get the support she needs, but since her family is so selfish and disinterested I don't see how that is a viable option. 

So I'm asking for advice on where is go from here. Are there free/discounted mental health counseling services that I can refer her to? Are there local support groups she should look into? Should I be doing anything else as her friend to support her? I just feel like if she doesn't get help soon there is a chance that she might actually kill herself and I can't bare the thought of that. But I'm unsure of what I can do to help her.

Please any advice public or private is greatly appreciated.  ",04Feb2017,1
41,"So, a little background:  I began working at a start-up on the west coast about a year after it got off the ground.  I was desperate for a job at the time and knew the owner (let's call him Todd), so he took me on.  Todd needed someone to replace another higher-up employee (who we'll call Sue) because she was supposedly leaving soon, and lets just say I was more than qualified enough to take over.  

I did odd-jobs for him for a while and just before the time came for Sue to leave, another co-worker quit.  Todd convinced Sue to stay for a few more months, and asked me to fill the void in the meantime.  He promised I would soon have the position.

So, Todd ended up hiring someone else months later to take my position while I train with Sue.  Fast forward a bit to last Monday, I'm completely trained, raring to go, and a couple weeks from taking over when Sue tells me the owner matched her salary bid that she got from another company.  The owner calls us a few minutes later and explains that my new position will be working with her, basically splitting the responsibilities of the job.  They both now assure me that she will be gone in a year and when she leaves I'll have her job.

Over the course of last week, I've discovered that ""splitting responsibilities"" has meant I'm basically going to be Sue's secretary, handling projects that she doesn't want to touch.  Bonus:  she's going to be making twice as much as me for doing the same work.

I'm going to give Todd the benefit of the doubt because he's a wonderful person who has always treated me with the utmost respect.  Also, not being in his position, I don't know the whole truth of what is happening, just what is happening from my perspective.  However, I'm not entirely sure how the next year will go and if I'll actually get the job. I want to confront him next week, I'm not well-versed in these matters, and was hoping for guidance.  I need to know if I'm being played here, and what i can do to get what is best for me.  

Thank you in advance for reading this wall of text.

TL;DR - Was passed up for a promised promotion twice.  Still being promised the same position in a year.  Speaking with the owner next week.  Lay some advice on me!

I'm 99% sure they don't know the truth behind the situation...and I'm hoping to meet with them to tell them the reality of what I have been dealing with the past few years related to this.  I'm also going to bring my parents along, because not only did they actually have to help me financially for awhile because of it, they have seen what it has done to me.  

I've put this off forever.  I know it will open an inevitable shitstorm from her that she will do everything in her power to make hell and blame me for.  Part of me is also very timid at being the person to pull the curtain back on all of this...to be the messenger of such bad news.  I'm not sure why that is, honestly.  I don't have any feelings for her anymore, and when I looked up signs of an abusive relationship, it basically qualified.

49,"About two weeks ago my son's second grade teacher called me in for a conference. She informed me he was having trouble focusing and that she had noticed it previously but it had recently gotten worse. She had taken several steps already to help him, such as giving him a quiet place to do his work and having him sit next to her desk, among other things.

Often he missed recess because he had not completed his work. She told me he doesn't have trouble with the material covered, he knows the answers but has trouble completing anything. When she goes to check his progress she realizes he has found a bead, a peice of foil anything small and is fiddling with it.

This isn't a one time thing, every teacher has mentioned focusing problems but I thought he would grow out of it. His father and I don't let him have sodas, sugary things like tea, candies and ice cream are treats not an all the time thing. I feel like it's not really an energy problem, he's not a hyper kid he just gets distracted or forgets.

I asked the teacher if I should be doing something differently at home, putting him in extra activities, special classes or taking him to the doctor. She didn't really offer any advice, I assume because of liability issues. She seemed like she wanted to help me but wasn't allowed to say anything. She told me that he is passing everything right now but things would only get harder in third grade. So how do I proceed? Is going to a doctor the answer? What will the doctor offer besides drugs? I don't want the answer to be drugs. I haven't actually talked to my husband about this because he has already said it's not a focusing problem it's a behavior problem.

Even though I'm not quite the life of every party I go to, I've been in a relationship before, I have a handful of good friends (mostly from my high school days) and we see one another as much as we can. I also have a few friends here and there who are not that close to me, but who can be trusted. But I have noticed it's getting harder and harder for me to develop good, lasting friendships with new people over the past few years (especially the last couple of years) and I think the problem might just be me.

I consider myself an open minded person - I try to be as less judgemental as possible with people, I'm always up for offering a shoulder to someone in need and will go out of my way to help people sometimes. I'm always up for a party, a cup of coffee, a conversation etc. 

I think my biggest problem could be the fact that I'm often... uninteresting. I'm quite shy and not very talkative, I'm not exactly Bill Cosby when it comes to telling a joke and making people laugh and I constantly worry about not bothering people too much and making an idiot of myself, so I'm not usually the one to organise a piss up, throw a party, ask people out etc. Moreover, someone told me once that I look angry most of the time, and while I recognise I don't usually go out of my way to put a smile on my face just for the sake of it, I'm not cranky at all and I couldn't even bring myself to treat someone badly for no reason. In fact, it actually takes a lot to make me angry.

So, have any of you been through a similar experience? Could it be that I'm just effortless and don't have a lot to offer to those around me? Could it be that I'm not very good at showing what I think to people? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I dropped out of that college because I couldn't handle the stress. I fear that if I get a part time job in addition to being a full-time student, it will once again be too stressful to me. Being an 18 year old college student, I just don't want to get too stressed out again and end up dropping out of my current college. Plus, having off of weekends is important to me for spending time with my family, so that just adds to why I don't think I could handle a part-time job. My tuition is paid for with financial aid, as were my books, but I need to figure out how I'll get money for food and gas and my car insurance. This has been something I've tried to figure out every day for weeks, but I just don't see a solution. I've tried doing sporadic online things like transcribing, but didn't get accepted to any of them. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. ",04Feb2017,2

60,"Hi guys, let me give a bit of a back story,

a few months back I started working for this brand new clinic in town, its 5 mins from my house, all brand new state of the art physically it has everything I want, I originally started working for a specialized practice straight out of school and this is my first time working in a  ""regular"" practice. Anyways the doctor I work with is phenomenal, she's one of the best (if not the best) doctors I've met/worked with, clients love her, she's pretty well the main source for clients. 

This issue is with the owners, the clinic is owned by two other doctors, both whom have their own practices and work at their own practices all week, I sometimes see one of them once a week if I have to book a really late appt. otherwise they're never there. I learnt pretty quickly they don't want to be at the new clinic but want control 24/7. They wont let us order our own inventory, answer our own emails, they go through every single email we get/send and letter we get, they constantly call and just in general are annoying unless you need something then poof they disappear or go ""yup, yup, yup, sure"" and never do what you asked.

The one owner is manageable though, the other is not, in reality I'm at this clinic solely because of the doctor I work with, now they pissed her off and she's quitting. Were a staff of two, without her I'm working alone. 

I'm torn, I don't know if I should quit and have it look bad on my resume that I've only been there 4 months or if I should hold it out until April (April is the clinics 1 year anniversary, it's also the month they're going to decide if they want to shut it down and sell it or not, the owners can't agree on what do with the clinic since the doc is leaving.) I do plan on going back to school this September if all goes well so realistically should I stay at this clinic I would be quitting at the end of the summer anyways, downfall is though they've been promising me a new doctor since she gave them notice and no one wants to work for them because of their reputation of being cheap and clingy so in reality I'll be working alone. 

tl;dr: do I quit my current job and have it look bad on my resume or stick it out until the owners sell even though i'll be unhappy. ",04Feb2017,1

76,"So my girlfriend has worked for a certain shoe company for a little over a year now. She got hired on as a MIT for the first year of her career there and she fucking loved it. She would always come home with a big smile on her face. The manager who ran the store treated her like gold and had the upmost respect for her. 

He liked her hard work and personality so much that he started training her for a management position that way she could be prepared to run her own location if she wanted too. After some time had passed, a store manager had quit at a different location, opening up the opportunity for her to take the spot and run her own store. 

For her to be able to get the position, she had to take an interview with the district manager. The interview goes well and the DM tells my girlfriend that he wants her to get her own store at some point but he wants her to get a little more experience training for the position. So instead of my girlfriend getting the position, some asshole (you'll see why) gets the job. The DM suggests that she move to the same location as an assistant manager with an added pay raise as a small step forward in the company. 

My girlfriend takes this position; and leaves her friends and the awesome manager that she looked up to for a small pay raise and the hope of getting her own store at some point. The awesome manager supports her 100% and wishes nothing but absolute success for her. My girlfriend cries leaving them behind...

Fast forward to her new position with the asshat manager. This manager is known for being an asshole and other employees have reached out to my girlfriend and warned her before hand that he's a nightmare. She's pretty worried that she's made a mistake by taking this promotion but it's too late now. 

Everyday she goes into work and dreads it. He belittles her constantly even though she excels and out performs everyone. He makes snappy comments at everyone but mostly her. She thinks he's extra aggressive towards her because he knows that she was wanting the store that he got. He plays mind games with her and tries to make her feel stupid whenever he can. 

The amazing manager has caught wind of her abuse and is FUCKING FURIOUS. Amazing manager plans to call the DM and explain in extreme detail the extent of her mistreatment. My girlfriend seems to think this won't help but in fact, will make things worse... she thinks that if amazing manager tells DM what's going on, then DM will have a conversation with asshole manager about it that will just create more tension at the work place for her..

I'm so fucking pissed right now because my girlfriend came home tonight and we started talking about her day and she burst into tears... crying about how stressed she is and how stupid he makes her feel. She says she's lost the passion she's had for this company and doesn't even want her own store anymore.. 

she plans to look for a new job

Is there anything I can do??? I told her I want to make a complaint on this guy but she told me that will only make things worse... I don't let anybody treat my girl this way so I'm fucking frustrated that I have to sit back and watch her take the abuse. I really want to do something but I have no clue what I can do..

82,"At the start of 2011, my dad found a sport that my family was interested in, table tennis/ping pong. Until then, I had never participated in a sport and never wanted to, up to now. Anyways, my dad bought balls and paddles and for about half of the rest of the year, we messed around with the new ping pong table having no idea what we were playing. A year later, my dad started to learn some ""strategies"" on YouTube. We would then attempt to copy those ""strategies"" as best as we could. Unfortunately, my dad kept telling me I was ""wrong"" even though I was still trying my best to imitate those ""strategies."" Then came the first ping pong tournament to compete in. At this point in time, I was still very inexperienced, but my dad kept forcing me to participate, despite me arguing that I was unprepared. So, naturally, I got smashed in that tournament, in front of hundreds of people. The moment I got off the playing court, my dad immediately screamed insults in my face, in front of the same hundreds of people, saying things like ""I taught you everything you needed to know!"" and ""You were in the easiest division!"" and more. The same things happened through 2012 to 2016. With my father's constant insulting and yelling, completely new mental issues started popping up in my head, and I started to procrastinate in schoolwork. I believe this all peaked in 2016, when my favorite video game came out, Overwatch. How this is significant, I'll say in a bit. I was in one of my dad's daily ping pong training sessions, and he was getting irritated from me occasionally messing up. My brain immediately forced me to do something I would've never done in normal circumstances; I said that he was so inconsiderate, I was trying my best, and that he should just be quiet and let me focus. He was silent for a moment, then instantly yelled for me to shut up, and made comments that are extremely offensive in our native language. I thought that was the most that could happen, but then Overwatch came out, and I was dying to buy it. I used my own money to get it for my PC, and I eventually discovered that playing several matches after bad ping pong sessions would calm me down slightly. My mom is okay with this, but unfortunately, my dad finds out about Overwatch, and then on a night while I was in a competitive match, (he also found out about how voice chat works in-game) he came into my room screaming for me to get to sleep. When I complained that I was in competitive and would take a few minutes, he yanked out the display cord from the monitor, but he didn't remove the power cord for the monitor, so the audio kept playing but the screen was completely off, which therefore meant that I heard my team insulting me for not doing anything. My dad walked off without missing a beat, while I raged in silence. Nothing could get worse than this, right? Of course not! Recently, not six months ago, I bought myself a gaming headset, since I was really getting into gaming in general. I'd learned not to play at night or I would get stormed, so I would play in the afternoon after finishing my homework. Unfortunately, finishing homework means ""not finished"" to my dad, and this time he did the extreme; he yanked my headphones out of the USB plug mid-match, and took them to the kitchen, with me screaming in tow, yet again. There, he submerged my headphones in the sink water, and cut them in half with a knife. Then he tossed them in the trash, and screamed at me that I knew better than ""not finishing my work,"" and that since I was ""wasting my time,"" he wasn't done with the punishments. The next morning, I come home from school, do homework, chores, exercise and all of that, and when I hit my room for more gaming, the desktop underneath is gone. Fast forward to that day's ping pong session, where I'm still unbelievably heated for losing my desktop. Due to that, my mental problems escalate, and I eventually find an insult my dad says, convert that into an ironic comeback and say that with as much steel as my dad includes in his insults. That heats him, but I've seen what I'd have to deal with, so I stand coolly. He then walks outside, and when he finally comes back in, I'm seated at the nearby living room table, facing away. Then, as I turn to face him, he brings down a bamboo stick he cut outside on my arm. The bamboo hitting my arm is practically a makeshift whip, and now, as I'm writing this, the spot where I got whipped is now swelling.
Yes, this is extremely long, but it is true. I desperately need advice, because I've been dealing with this and unwilling counselors, adults, and police who simply say ""Wait, and the problem will go away,"" or ""Treat them the way you want to be treated,"" or ""It's not a huge deal, it'll fade away,"" and more.

Now he is trying so hard to be our friend and be a part of our ""group"". At first he was just fine and normal, but now every time we play with him he is just trying so hard to be funny.

He is online every single night, and asking us can he play with us.

97,"So I am working a really great job right now. It has been my best job in all 7 jobs I have ever had in my life. (I am 19 just adding this because it might add relevance.) Its a basic fast food job, but the environment and people here are just awesome and I really like it. But today while I was working two guys came in from a tech company and said that they were looking for new hires, and that they were extremely desperate. This has a significant relevance to what I am currently studying right now at the university that I am attending. I have only been at my current job for about two weeks now. But I feel that if I get a job at the tech company I would be able to add it to my resume in the future and it could help significantly in the future. But I really don't want to burn a bridge with my current employer by leaving two weeks after getting hired. 

Also to add to everything my dad Is having open heart surgery in a month from now (My spring break) and my family wants me to come home to stay the ""night shift"" with him in the hospital, as I am the only one in the family that stays up super late and my Dad wants someone to be with him 24/7 to watch over him. I have no problems with this and am all for it. I have been trying to gather movies/ TV shows that we could watch together in the hospital, and maybe a few video games we can play (My dad has never really played any games and he will be really weak and on a lot of morphine but I'm just trying to come up with ideas of stuff to do with him to keep the moral of the situation as high as it can possibly be. My family whats me to hang out with friends and keep up appearances as well, because they don't want anyone to know that my Dad is in the hospital so it will go something like this: 

Mom shift: 6:00 A.M. to maybe 9:00 P.M.ish With my sister coming in during the day to give her a break and spend time with my Dad.

10:00 P.M. I come in and stay with my Dad until about 5 or 6 A.M. until my Mom or sister can come over, and then I sleep most of the day and then hang out with friends until I go back to the hospital to hang out with my Dad again. 

Basically the advice I am asking for is: Should I leave my current job now for the other one, or wait until after I get back from spring break with my family matters. Or should I leave afterwards, OR should I leave Way later and just stick with the job as long as possible?

And the second piece of advice I need: What movies/ games should I bring with me to hang out with my Dad? Board games are kinda out of the question. I feel like because it will be late at night and he won't be able to move his arms all that much for the first week or so. He is also LOVES to watch TV/Movies so I feel like it would be a better fit.

I've made some horrible mistakes and made some terrible choices but I'm really at a crux point in my life and I am just at a loss at what I can do.

I am about £30,000 in debt from a combination of loans, credit cards, overdrafts and owing money to some unscrupulous people. I am living in a bedsit alone, which is nice and well-equipped but at £1,000/month rent I was unable to pay rent for January and I have just missed February's rent a few days ago. 

I actually had a good life once, a career earning £40,000 as a Project Manager for a private education company, I have a law degree, a Masters in Art History and a Research Masters in Philosophy (none of this is debt, these were paid for by the company I worked for). 

I am facing homelessness soon, I know it won't be long before I am evicted and this scares me so much that honestly, I am contemplating suicide and have an Amitriptyline cocktail prepared in case.

103,"Hi,  I really need help and advices because I decided to study medicine and be a doctor. I live in Turkey, Antalya and I'm a high school student. I'm 17 years old. My family doesn't want me to go to a different country but I really want to study in Europe or America, even Balkans would be okay. Next year I will take an exam which is applied to all highschool students in Turkey to go to university. In Turkey if a student wants to study  medicine he has to be a ""perfect""  student, being good is not enough.
 In first exam there are 160 questions which includes turkish(40), math(32 math, 8 geometry =40), social(history+ geography+ philosophy =40), and science  (physics+chemistry +biology=40) and you have 160 minutes to answer all the questions. Then there is a second exam which is more important, you choose your section(science or social) and take your exam.
 For medicine of course you have to choose science. In science exam there are two sessions which are applied in different days( there are one week between every session) first session you have 50 math and 30 geometry questions and you have 135 minutes to answer them. In second session  you have 90 questions (30 physics, 30 biology and 30 chemistry ) and 135 minutes.By the way I should also point out that all questions are multiple-choices.
 So you see guys, it's pretty hard and I wonder if I can go to a foreign university to study medicine, I mean America, Europe, England or Balkans.. I will study to take this exam cuz I can't leave it to chance, I have to get ready for the worst case but if there's something to do to go another country to study I really would like to know what it is. Especially I wonder the scholarship possibilities, jobs to work while studying,  accommodation and of course in which conditions do universities accept foreign students. I mean what do they want me to have or do, I guess they'll ask me ""what's your difference? "" ""why would we accept you? "" etc.. 
Maybe you know what  'MUN'  is, I participated in MUN summits, I have participation certificate  and I have an international biology exam  certificate.When I graduate from high school I'll get my Edexcell certificate too. Also I'm a good student and I speak English of course.. I don't know maybe they're useless or not enough, I have to know what to do to be a very acceptable and preferable student for universities. Maybe  you know Turkey's recent situation and I don't want to create  my future in here. I want to be  able to go and  live in a different country. Besides Turkey's economic situation  is really bad nowadays and doesn't seem to get better.  so I really need a supportive scholarship. Which students can get a scholarship, where should I consult?

115,"I have been trying for a few hours to figure out where I could post my thoughts; Each Subreddit that I could post it in has its own caveats. Shower Thoughts doesn't really have any questions, Ask Reddit doesn't allow text box, Musing has like six people in it. Maybe one of ya'll will know.


""I posted some of this in response to a Youtube comment (not similar in nature to my initial questions but my thoughts are the same) and it gave me pause:

I am of two opinions on this. On one hand, if you're going into a place where people admire a certain thing/idea just to be a contrarian or to NOT gain an understanding of it's reception​ then you're no better than a troll. 

However, everyone has an equal say to their opinion. For better or worse.

On the other hand, if you go to or happen upon a forum/website/post containing bias/ideas on something that doesn't appeal to you with a clear and innocent intent you shouldn't be berated for seeking appreciation. Asking and engaging with unfamiliar concepts helps you see where another is coming from. Which doesn't happen as much as I would like, especially for myself.

There is a third case as well. People online, from my experience, seem to be conditioned to shout their feels into the void then go on about their business. This third case seems the most prevalent. Not intended to be in ill will nor constructive feedback either.

 Ex. Coke puts out a new design promo. The comments are majority strong coke following. One comment: ""I prefer Sprite. Coke looks and tastes like tar."" A tangent of... negativity ensues. What was the goal OP trying to access with that comment? Should the fans not even engage in reply? Is this comment mean less and should they have never even posted it? 

These seem more like musings than anything in particular; Hearing people's reactions and thoughts on these notions would be great though!""",04Feb2017,1
116,"You know, all these positivity dictated people kept telling that I should call my parents. 

I proceeded to call my dad, well I'm not doing it again. 

Here's the deal, my internet at my apt is crap, since he's paying most of the rent I'm asking him if I could use his monthly money to get a better internet, which is primordial for me because I study music and I need to constantly download VST and other sort of files that can have the size of 100gb.

He starts sounding negative already, he's telling to do whatever the fuck I want with the money, and that setting up internet is a complicated process etc...

I knew this was gonna get into a useless argument already so I just moved onto the next subject.

I informed him that my teacher like me ( as a student-professor, nothing weird alright? ) because I was top of the class in his subjects, and that he told me what I was studying was way to easy for me. The teacher eventually told me that if I work hard enough, he can get me into a much better program, and he recommanded me to go to Paris to visit the program and see if it suits me.

I told my father all that and he answered me "" sure whatever, how are your grades? "" I answered I'll only get the rest of them in mid february, I could hear him sigh, he then asks me "" did you get a job yet ? "", I said "" they offered me a job as a pizza delivery ""

And this is where it gets messy : he started raising his voice "" restauration again? why don't you find something else? go ask your friends, get off your fucking computer and go ask "" at that point I knew it was gonna get into a shitty argument so I hung up because I didn't feel like talking to him anymore. ( he had no way to check I was on my computer, and to add to this I wasn't ) 

So yeah, my friends always wondered why I was so distant with my father, well this is why. He always find someway to start an argument when there is no need to. It started when I could think for myself, at a relatively young age. I used to tell him what happened in school and for some reason ( or not at all ) he scolded me. As I grew older I got tired of getting into argument so I stopped telling him how my life at school was going. When my friend came over, he would feel uncomfortable with the silence during dinner, so he started asking a lot of question, to which I respond either yes, no or I don't know. I would sometimes talk about scientific stuff, but he always bitched about getting my sources and shit, while scolding me for using the phone on the table. 

And don't give me the "" be grateful to your parents because they give me moniiiii "" BS please, I never asked to be alive, they forced me here, so if I wanna go through with it they should be supporting me until I can support myself. As a matter of fact, in my country it's illegal not to support your children until they are 25, so whether my way of thinking is unethical or not, I'm right by the law. Moreover, I am grateful enough by spending more time studying than working like a slave for some digit on my bank account. I am only truly grateful to my mom because she did support me when I needed it, she always listened to my stories without starting an argument and I just prefer my mom over my dad. 

Sorry if I sound like a spoiled child, but there is no way for me, or any other child to survive out there without the financial support of my parents, which means that it's the parent duty and obligation to support their child until they can do it for themselves, and whether or not children choose to be grateful is up to them. I know some kids already got a job and such. But as a parent, would you prefer your kids to be succesfull and eventually grateful at some point, or get a bonus income of 500€ per month and have your child never mention you in their success? If you were to choose the second option, who's unethical now? 

And sorry if this sounds more like a rant than a call of advice. I just wanted to let that out, what would you do in my situation? I don't feel like calling my father ever again now. ",04Feb2017,0
121,"I started online school in the middle of 8th grade due to severe anxiety and ridiculous school rules. When I left I had two friends and a lot of acquaintances, now I have one friend. (Everyone else in our group had a fight and now they've all split.) I haven't seen her since mid-2016 and she's starting to pull away from me, and I'm quite lonely.. 

I spoke to two girls from online school for a few weeks, but they stopped talking to me. I have no idea why :( first one seemed really happy to talk and the second one went on about how we were ""sisters"". People are weird. 

I put together a resume and asked my parents if I could try to get a job, but they said no. Well, my dad told me to ask my mom and she laughed at me for thinking anyone would hire a painfully shy girl like me. So that's out.

126,"I've lived in the same building in NYC for 10+ years and have become friendly with a lady my age with two young children. The father is absolutely in the picture with them. She works as an actress, but is not in the union yet so pay is very low. She came to my apt crying the other day, admitting to me that she is in the SNAP/Medicaid program, and asked if I could write a letter stating that I paid her for errands and things. From what I gather, she needs to prove to these programs that she is working when the low times happen and her actress jobs aren't coming in. She said that I wouldn't be audited, and wouldn't need to supply her with 1099's or anything, and its unlikely they would even call me to confirm the information on the letter. She was crying, and a friend, so I told her of course I would write the letter.  She used to have someone else write the letter, but they had a falling out. She said a new letter is needed every 6 months. 

My first instinct whenever someone is crying in front of me is to say ""yes"". I just wanted to stop the crying from a friend, and if a simple letter could do it, then of course I would help! But then... I of course realized there were moral implications - but even then I feel like this is a sort of ""stealing a loaf of bread to feed your family"" situation. 

When I told my husband about it, he used a word that made me cringe - ""fraud"". I really am uncomfortable with doing this if there is any possible way I could be held accountable legally or financially. 

Any advice on what to do? How to handle this with my neighbor?  I do very much want to help her.",04Feb2017,3
127,"Please read this because the details are important. I live in the UK, in social housing, but we own our particular apartment in the block and have lived here for 25 years. Above us is a family of 5 in a small 2 bedroom flat and they decided getting a giant dog was a fantastic idea in 2015. They barely walk it and it has way too much energy because of this. A dog of that size needs a good 2 hours exercise (I think it's a Pointer judging on what it looks like) and they take it out to poop and then go back inside. Sadly, I have tried reporting them for animal neglect and the RSPCA can't do anything as long as the dog isn't being abused.

Every time they leave the house, and sometimes as early as 6AM when the husband leaves for work, the dog starts crying and howling. It wakes everybody up, you can hear it on the stairwell and even down the street if they have the windows open. It is a high pitched screaming kind of cry, as if it is in intense pain. Every morning, without fail, it does this. Any other times are sporadic. It is so loud and the dog sounds so distressed, I can't even comprehend how stressed it is. I can hear it smashing things because it is so distraught. Last year, in May, after dealing with it for 6 months we mentioned it to them a few times in a nice way. Nothing changed. Eventually I took action in August and made a formal complaint to the housing officer, and for a couple of months we had investigation/recording equipment etc. It was established it was a major problem and very loud/disruptive and the next steps were to keep an ear out for further evidence. Neighbours buy a collar for the dog, and it is seemingly solved the issue for the most part. November/December are quiet and I barely hear it. Until Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day when they have clearly gone away visiting family and left the dog alone. Our Christmas was ruined because of this.

Lately, the sound has been creeping back up again and it is back to how it was. The complaint has closed now as it was quiet for over a month and it drops off after 35 days. We also recently discovered from a tip off from a neighbour that our noisy neighbours have pissed off most people in this block and have been saying nasty things about us on social media. I investigated this, and true enough, they are telling a big circle of shady people from the bad part of town that we are ''fucking wankers that hate their kids'', making it all about the kids and making us sound like horrible people to rally people on their side. Their kids are lovely and we have no issue with them. People were then threatening to come around, knock on our door, throw a massive party, calling us every name under the sun, etc. I am sure they would feel differently if they had to live under them and be woken up every single day by it. 

A lady from an outside mediation type service got in touch with me a few weeks ago and we talked about the problems, but nothing came of it and she did not get back in touch within a week like she said she would.

I really don't know what to do at this point, as the sound is driving me insane and disrupting the household's sleep, but I am also concerned for the dog being cooped up by these selfish people. They expect everybody to just tolerate their noise and point the finger at other small dogs in the block that bark sometimes when the mail comes instead of addressing that they have an issue. I don't want to stick a note on their door because it seems cowardly, but at the same time I do not think they realise or give a crap how much it impacts other people.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.",04Feb2017,1

131,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating since the beginning of freshman year, and now we are both seniors in highschool. We were attracted to each other for many reasons, but an important thing was that we are both pretty mature for our age. However, I'm pretty poor. I'm 17 and have been self supporting since about 14-15. I do have a job, and I feed myself ECT. However, my house is recently located pretty far away from my boyfriend's, and his is close to the school, so we hang out at his place a lot. His parents have now come up with the philosophy that I eat all of their food, and I use all of my boyfriend's money. I'm sure it's because I'm poor, and so they judge me based on this, even though I am a fairly humble person and I wouldn't even go in someone's refrigerator that I knew very well, or ask my boyfriend to borrow anything unless completely necessary. They went from wanting us both to live with them, to saying this. They have always been an issue in our relationship. When I first met my boyfriend, he had extremely low self worth. They had been putting him down, telling him he would be nothing in life, ECT. Though they wouldn't punish him. Now they punish him by saying that he can't see me. It's his step father mostly, I honestly think he hates him. He says he loves him like his own son, who by the way is 17 and living on SSI, not working and a pot head but gets a standing ovation from his father when he wipes his own ass, and has no reason to be on SSI. But he gives my boyfriend a cigarette. If he passes the samesrer but fails a class, theres no you passed the samesrer, there's you failed this one class you are a failure. There's a put down every chance he gets, and his mom joins in and they look at me to support their stupidity and I say nothing at all. This is just stressing me out so much, because every time there's an issue in his household it's taken out on him invertently, and he is the cause of all of the problems, but he isn't. Then it effects our relationship. What should I do? 
; TLDR
Boyfriend's step dad has resentment twords him, punishes him by not letting him see me, blames all of their issues on him 

I needed to add that my boyfriends step father's Ex girlfriend, the mother of the one on SSI, was a serious drug head. She claimed her son had seziures, which he clearly does not and he has told us this. He admitted that he wants to keep the SSI because his mother buys him things like the newer game systems, and he wants to get himself a car so he will continue to not work and live with her so that he can get the money, only until he gets a car. This mother is setting him up for failure. If he has this kind of parent, can you not see how his father, my boyfriend's step father might not be a so good person????",04Feb2017,0

137,"Ok so recently one of my best friends developed a crush on someone. Let's call my friend Amy and her crush Alex.  So basically Amy has been there for me for the last year a whole bunch. She has been there through my poor mental health/times where I have been suicidal and she's seen and done a lot for me. No one has even done as much for me as she has. But recently, she started to like Alex, someone in my grade, and because of this I'm worried that she's starting to choose Alex over me without noticing it. For example, Amy was tutoring me for a few hours before a midterm exam and she wanted to move to the library just because Alex was there. It put me at an inconvenience but I did it anyway. So then we went to the library (mind you the exam was in like an hour) and she had a question about something so she went and asked Alex and she purposely talked slow and wasted time there and she was there for like ten minutes just so she could spend time for Alex even though she knew that I struggle with math a lot and will be in very big trouble if I don't do well on the exam (she knows that my family is verbally abusive and because of that doing bad on the exam means a whole lot worse than just being yelled at like a normal person is). Then she is tutoring me a little bit more and Alex comes over to us and starts to ask Amy questions too. She starts spending way more time answering Alex's questions and when she does answer mine she does it very briefly and goes right to Alex almost before I could ask her anything else. It was frustrating me. Amy knows I have severe anxiety and I was on the verge of tears at this point but she only seemed to notice Alex. Another time was yesterday during the intermission of a school show. I wanted Amy to come with me to the bathroom but she said she wanted to hang out with Alex who was selling concessions. I really wanted to spend some time with her so I begged her to hang out with me but once she saw that the bathroom line was long she said she was going to hang out with Alex and left me there.  I mean she said she loved me and said sorry as she did it but it kinda irked me a bunch. And we recently made plans to go thrift shopping with my friend (this is a fake name) named Gemma for today and Amy said she wanted to invite a bunch of people but I'm pretty sure she only invited Alex. I think it's frustrating me because this was a thing between the three of us and then Amy goes and adds Alex to a group chat that the three of us have been using specifically for thrift shopping. I know over text it sounds minor but that means that Alex will have to come with us every time we go right? And Amy said she wanted to invite a bunch of people but maybe it was an excuse to just bring Alex. That group chat is kind of a special thing between us. It just kinda hurts because every time a friend has ever gotten a boyfriend or girlfriend they have chosen them over me and this time I want it to be different. Btw, Alex seems to be oblivious to this. I actually don't even think Alex ""plays for the same team"" as Amy if you catch my drift. Alex is a sweetheart and would ever purposely try to steal a friend from anyone. I would've been lost without Amy in my life and I don't have any other people who are there for me like her and won't for a while most likely so I'm getting worried now. Is Amy cutting me short?

143,"Hi everyone. I just made an account because I feel that I have nowhere else to go to ask for advice. (This is really long.)

One of my friends/coworkers is dealing with really severe depression. We've been talking about it and getting him help for a little while about it.

Recently, he posted a really cryptic message on Facebook and attempted to commit suicide. A couple friends and I stopped him.

I offered to be emotional support after the ordeal, because that's what friends do. Gave him the number to the crisis clinic line if he needs it. I try to talk to him every so often.

Anyways, to where I need help. He's been freaking out whenever I don't check in on him. He demands my attention frequently. He throws fits whenever I don't or when I have to cancel on plans.

I told him to stop posting messages on Facebook that are passively aggressively blasting the people who are helping him. I told him that I need some space because I have to go to work, school and take care of my child and that's why I don't call or text very often. 

He just threatened to kill himself because I had to cancel on plans to take him to see a mutual friend because something important came up. I called the cops because I took his suicide threat seriously. He's pissed and blasting me on Facebook now.

I don't know what to do. He's pissed at me in a really irrational way and keeps threatening to kill himself whenever things don't go his way. 

I keep telling him that he needs to stop and calm down because he's getting mad at people for having their own lives and their own things to do. 

Because my boyfriend is worried that this friend of mine might physically assault me because of how irrational he's being, I'm trying to separate myself from him. 

I'm frustrated and feel really stressed out from it. I'm almost to the point of tears. I really don't know what to do at this point and really, really need advice on how to move forward because I don't want to a lose a friend.",04Feb2017,2
144,"I used to think I was depressed for different reasons, but I've come to realize the truth:

I'm just not capable of being happy.

It doesn't matter what my situation is, I am completely incapable of being happy. For some reason, I can't seem to connect with people. I have people I considered friends, but apparently, nobody really considers me *their* friend.

I've only had one *real* friend in my life, who made a huge sacrifice in allowing me to move in with him and his wife's new house, and he helped get me a good, career-type job.

Yet, I'm still not happy. I finally have some sense of stability in my life -- well, besides a generally shitty week (wallet was stolen, then got in a car accident) -- and I still feel like I'm just ""going through the motions"" of life.

I'm not ""passionate"" about anything, there are no romantic prospects, and I can't even get people to message me back on facebook. I am, by all accounts, a loser.

I've never been able to figure it out. I've always been able to make people laugh, I've been told I'm a ""people person"", yet that's never been able to translate into any sort of valid friendship.

I'm 28, and I'm still a virgin. Never kissed a girl/woman, never held hands, or even been on a *real* date (went on a blind date once a few years ago, it didn't go well).

I just feel like life just won't ""work"" for me. I work my ass off, I always put on a smile even when I have a bad day, and I really try my best to be a good person, but it just never seems to amount to shit. And I'm *tired*.

I've been laying in bed all morning, and I can't even see a reason to get out of my bed today, let alone leave the house. I don't have any other friends -- even when I try to reach out, or put together some sort of get-together -- and now, I can't even summon the enthusiasm to mindlessly play a video-game.

It's so frustrating, particularly living with my roommates, seeing how effortless their lives are. They're ""cool"" people, they're successful, people *want* to be around them. Not to knock the hard work they've done to get where they are financially, but it's apparent that they're just ""built differently"" than I am. *Better*. Nothing is ever difficult for them, and even though I knew him back when he was broke, his family has always been incredible successful, and now he's pulling in a 6-figure income.

Life doesn't just seem unfair; it seems like I'm just predestined to lose at everything I do. I've tried staying positive, I've tried being more social, I've tried busting my ass at work -- it just seems like everything I try to do is a complete waste of effort, because it never amounts to anything.

And now, with that new job my friend helped me get, I feel like I've pretty much ""peaked"". It's a political job, and because I don't *really* care that much about politics, I worry that there's no room for me to grow, unless I simply say ""I now work 24/7, forever, and commit my every waking moment to paying attention to politics"". Because, for most of the people in my office, they actually *enjoy* paying attention to politics, it's basically their *life*. For me... well, it *used* to be video-games, but now, I don't even get excited about that.

Like I said, I am no longer blaming the situation or the environment. It's pretty clear, there is just something wrong with *me*. And whatever it is, there doesn't seem to be any way to fix it. If there is no enjoyment in your life, then what's the point of living? Because I really do feel like a zombie now.",04Feb2017,15

I made a massive mistake though, I wanted to leave to try and study a trade I needed cash to do to this.
I did not steal from anyone but in order to save the money I either had to stop buying people stuff or try and get them to pay money that they owed me.
This pissed off allot of people as a result I lost my job and any chance of going back.
Going back to college also made my parents and all of my close family disown because, they believe that I am mentally challenged and my biological mother used to scam the government by abusing the student loan system 10 years in a row.

I have two valid choices at the moment, I could move to another part of the country and start working full time at a job I like that pay's minimum wage for two years until I can get my commercial drivers license.
Or, I can use the money I have to stay and learn more about the stock market, I love learning about economics and math.
I am 26 right now, were I live until about 2014 most highshcool drop out's made over 100k a year, so being in crappy job's is a statement that there is something seriously wrong with me
Same goes for university at 26 to though, 
I am very insecure around average people now, I feel like I am never going to be as good as them no matter how hard I work. I have no friends at this time and in this part of the country I do not see that changing until I am making over 100k a year.

If I did go back to work I would save money for a few years then move somewhere were in the world everyone is poor so I can have a social life, like eastern Europe, then forget all of this stupid crap happened.",04Feb2017,3

159,"I have this online friend who I've known for many years, but have never met in person. He lives on the other side of the country from me. We play online games together, most of which I bought for him.

A few weeks ago he started telling me about how he needs to get out of the place he's living at, and asks if he can stay with me for a bit. I ask if he has any family he can stay with, and he tells me no, that they don't talk to him anymore. I really didn't want to get involved, but he kept insisting this was a truly dire situation and he needed to leave immediately. He wouldn't go into details about where he was living, just that it was ""unsafe"" and that he was broke.

I finally caved in and paid around $1k to get him here last minute, between shipping some items, a flight, taxis, and some traveling cash.

I met him for the first time at the bus station, and he looks, acts, and smells homeless. He's been at my house for a week now and the situation has not improved. It's clear he's been a vagrant for some time and has never worked a job before. He's constantly hounding me to buy him cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, or fast food. I've taken him out to tour the area and he has no manners or courtesy towards people. He does a lot of bizarre things, including snooping around my house and through my things. I've offered to help him get a job, but he's declined saying that he can make money on Youtube videos once he builds up an audience...

I realize that I was duped by him, as that's what homeless drug users are good at. I am an early-30s working professional and can not deal with babysitting and supporting him indefinitely.

How do I get rid of him now? It's clear he doesn't want to voluntarily leave. I've indirectly approached the topic telling him I can ""help him get where he's going"", and he just responds with ""you said I could come here"".",04Feb2017,1

He came across as a pretty normal and fun guy. Fast forward about 6 months and me and another friend noticed he has a lot of serious mental health issues. For example one time he just drove off into the middle of nowhere and my other friend had to drive out and find him. And he supposably took a bunch of muscle relaxers and went into my other friends work till she drove him to the hospital. Last night he texted saying he was drunk, and so I was a little worried so I called him. He told me he ""took two pills to make the nightmares go away"", and I freaked out. We didn't end up calling the cops, and I probably should have, but he's alright now. He's gotten professional help but it doesn't seem to be working.

I only want to hang out with her one-on-one because she's very, very strange and socially awkward and says and does things that embarrass me. For instance, at a New Years Eve party, my sister was cracking jokes and everyone was laughing, but she just kind of stared at my sister with her head cocked to the side as if she was some kind of alien trying to figure out what humor was. I explained to her that this comes across as rude when you don't at least smile when someone is trying to be funny and she seemed to understand, but then her laughter was way too loud and her eyes were all wide and it was super cringey. Then I had her over for my birthday party and my other friend nudged me at one point and goes, ""umm...what's with your friend?"" and I looked over and she was staring at the table, lost in some horrible thought and not engaging with anyone at the table, just completely ignoring everyone. When I kicked her under the table, she looked up and smiled at me and I had to text her and say she had this horrified look on her face and was not listening or talking to anyone. She said nothing was wrong. She gets lost in thoughts that have nothing to do with the conversation. She never asks people questions or tries to engage with them when we're all together and just comes across as extremely rude. Like she'll get on her phone in the middle of a game we're all playing or straight up say, ""huh? sorry, I wasn't listening"" when someone asks her a question. When I talk to her about it, she truly doesn't notice when she's doing it. It's like her brain is so distracted or she's having some kind of seizure or hallucination. It's bizarre. When she left after the New Year's Eve party that one year, everyone was like, ""whooooaaaa...she's...really weird"". I feel bad because I want to be able to invite her to things, but I don't want her to offend all of my friends by being so obvious when she's bored or lost in thought.

Sorry for formatting issues, first time posting here and I'm on mobile 

So I live with 2 friends from high school, K and A, a few months ago K got a cat and she's never home, when she is the cat isn't allowed in her room with her if he's playful. 

So time goes on and the kitten stays in my room, gets fed by me every morning, I play with him every night after school/before work, he sleeps in my room while K is out and won't be home for days on end. 

Biggest problem is K is thinks she spends all this time with the kitten, but she won't get up when he needs to be fed (just kicks him out of her room if he is sleeping in hers that night) she gets mad at him when he's playful because she wants a cat just for cuddling. 

A on the other hand just doesn't pay attention to the cat and it's not her responsibility to as it's not her cat and she is at school a lot but it's not A's fault, it's K's and I know that, and I just don't want this poor cat to go neglected because he's sweet and so loving after you get the energy out of him, he's just a young kitten and wants to play.

I'm moving out in April and subletting out my room and I'm afraid that the cat won't get properly taken care of, what should I do ? Should I let a local organization know ? Should I try to talk her into letting me take the cat with me ?

I feel embarrassed when people see stuff like that because I don't want to seem like a know-it-all, so I brushed it off saying that Spanish, French, Italian, etc. were mostly the same language. But he seemed shocked, too, that I had such a thing on my resume before I brushed it off.

My acting, too, people are shocked by because I have been doing it for such a short amount of time and don't have any real major experience, yet that is complimented, too?

So, my question is, I guess, why are people so shocked by my ability to do things? I don't know if it's strange to me because I spent most of my life around artists and they're really awkward and depressed and they usually just reply to that stuff with that's cool and don't look at me like I have five heads when I do this stuff. But actors on the other hand, look at me weirdly when this stuff comes up! Please, someone, enlighten me on this stuff. I'm just very confused. It's not a problem, but I would like to understand why.",04Feb2017,0
216,I feel like I always want to help other people and my personal wants get neglected. I want to know how I can make that known with my friends and family without looking like a crappy person. Any advice is appreciated!,04Feb2017,3
217,Ive been lurking for a while and don't really feel like I have anything to contribute to most threads. But i designed a programme and wanted some critique on it so decided to make an account and get some advice from r/fitness. But I don't have enough karma points to post. So is there any way around this? Or how do i get good karma when I never really have much to say? (although I love reading other peoples views),04Feb2017,23
218,"Hello everyone! 

I'm currently a senior boy in high school. I'm the president of my school's ski club, and recently we went on a ski trip. During this trip, I found out that a girl who was on the trip with us has a dad who was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer about a week and a half ago. I thought she seemed a little stressed while we were on the trip, but I had no idea what the cause was until I found out about her dad. I

She's a freshmen, and she is literally like 13 or 14 years old. I really haven't talked to her, other than about ski club matters such as fees etc. 

I want to approach her, and give her someone to connect to, because my mom was also diagnosed with cancer while I was in high school.

I know that when my mom was first diagnosed, I felt super helpless and alone. I think I would have been really happy to talk to someone who went through the same things, just to know that I wasn't alone.

Should I approach her about it? Is it too personal for me to approach her about? Is there too much of an age difference for her to feel comfortable? It's a matter that's really important to me, so I want to help. But I also don't want to do anything that will make her feel worse than she already does. 

Thank you.",04Feb2017,6
221,"Hi all, I want to know if there is anyone out there also ""unlucky"" in the love department. I was in a long term relationship that left me sour and jaded after it ended for many years... In that time, I realise I needed to worked on myself, and am now happy with the person that I've worked out I am. However, coming back into the dating scene has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth! So quickly I am to be disappointed, which makes me not want to pursue anyone further. I just want to find someone who will treat me like a king, and I them, but truely want it to be genuine and unforced. Am I asking for too much?!",04Feb2017,6
222,"Everyone,

I'm 23 and just graduated from university and landed a job right out of school. I was making over $900/week and wasn't happy. So much so it greatly affected my career leading me to get fired because my heart wasn't in it and I couldn't pass a drug test at the time. I have lots of other hobbies and interests and enough savings to pay my car, insurance and phone bill for 8 months (live at home, only expenses). I've been applying for similar positions but don't know if construction is the right industry for me. I love fitness and cannabis. I also am really good at math and reading charts. I would love to be a stock trader but I don't see the opportunity being present. What should I do now that I have no job and all this time on my hands? I haven't been using any cannabis for over 3 weeks now in hopes of finding another job. I am searching for another job only because I feel like thats what I should do. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",04Feb2017,3
224,"Hi!! 
Firstly, I love my friend. We've been friends for 9 years and I don't think this will change. She's very sweet and will give you the shirt off her back. She went to a therapist when she was younger and was told that they suspected she might have Aspergers but it was never confirmed. It does feel like this may be the case but I really don't know. 

She very easily gets fixated on things she likes and its all she talks about. she's not very good in social situations especially when its someone she doesn't know. She only just recently got a job which I think has helped her come out a bit but she still doesn't seem very interested in other making friends. 

There are a few issues in our friendship that I don't know how to go about fixing. 
She has a few of them but she has a huge obsession with writing and the characters she writes. I write and draw as well so I have a few characters and its fun to talk about them sometimes. When we talk, it is almost always all she talks about. Sometimes she'll get a little obsession with something else and that will be all she talks about. When I try to change the subject to something else, no matter what, she finds a way to incorporate something about her characters. Like if we go somewhere she'll say something like ""What would X character think of this?"" or something similar. Everything is characters for her and its nonstop. 

This gets pretty annoying sometimes and talking to her can be straining. We don't really talk about personal feelings or any real subjects because she seems disinterested in anything that isn't what she's obsessed with. 

To make matters worse, myself and one other friend are her only friends. The other friend lives far away and only visits every once in a while. Understandably my friend is lonely because of this and kind relies solely on me for most of her social interaction. This is also straining because she texts a lot, calls a lot, and wants to hang out a lot. And I dread them because I already know what she wants to talk about.

I'm pretty introverted so I'm not really one for phone calls and she calls almost everyday on her break at work. I feel bad, but a good bit of the time I just don't answer. When I answer and tell her I'm busy she sounds kind of hurt or disappointed which is painful. Phones make me anxious a lot. I also tend not to answer texts sometimes which prompts her to send more and I feel even worse. 

 I just don't know how to tell her I don't want to talk about her characters because shes sensitive and gets a certain sad tone of voice that makes you feel bad if you don't want to. I want to be a better friend but its difficult when she doesn't want to talk about anything else.
 
How can I help this? I've thought about talking to her about it but she seems so happy talking about her interests. How can I put it more gently? 

I'm sorry this is long I'm just at a loss. I want to be a better friend. Thank you!!!! ",04Feb2017,5
225,"I guess I need help. My whole life I've been very touchy, very sensitive. This comes with a good side, sometimes, like when I see something unjust happening I will fight it with every ounce of strength, but I also have many flaws. 

For one thing, I can't stand criticism--even if it's very gentle. I'm a self-destructive perfectionist: i remember when a class of 12 people read one of my essays, and 11 people said they loved it and one person thought it was hard to follow-- i went home sad that day, feeling like a failure. I know it sounds absurd but i couldnt talk myself out of it. That was just how i felt.

I dont want to be this person. I hate who i am. But i need the praise of others--like to a ridiculous degree. Any sort of criticism cuts very deep.

Another problem is that I'm very quick to ""go to war"" with someone. I was hanging out with a friend and a few strangers, and one of them said something that I took to mean he thought I was stupid. I immediately attacked him, criticizing things he had said and done before I realized that he hadn't meant to insult me at all. I apologized, and I did genuinely feel remorse, but that's not good enough. How do I stop that from happening?

I feel increasingly tightly wound. Every week I feel more and more ready to fight the entire world. 

It's too easy to get under my skin and I want to stop lashing out at people that I love. How do I do that?",04Feb2017,2

228,"I saw the first messages about three months ago. Me, my mam, dad and little sister were walking home from the pub. I was using his phone as a torch when messages started to come through on Skype asking if he was horny, asking for cam, ect. I tried to block it out and write it off as spam. Tonight I picked up his phone to turn the WiFi on. More messages. I read them, I couldn't help it.

It's sickened me to my stomach. Dozens of anonymous men around the world. My parents marriage is obviously a sham, and me and my sister are just a cover for him. He disgusts me.... I don't know what to do. I'm too young to be dealing with this shit. Someone please just tell me what to do...",04Feb2017,0
