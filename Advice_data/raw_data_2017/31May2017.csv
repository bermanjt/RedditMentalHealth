Here's the problem:

 19 almost 20 student athlete college soccer player. Played club soccer last year at a big school(where I currently live and work), transferring to a smaller one to play NCAA this fall 5 hours away. Its not feasible to have a job during the year with school and 7 days a week soccer, so I didn't work and my parents and loans help support me. My dad is very married to the notion you work as much as possible in the summer.(he's pretty liberal and free thinking  as far as personality goes but with a couple things like that he's a little old school)I have a couple jobs this summer, but the main one is at a pizza place working the store. I've done 3 days, always 7 hour shifts, and I'm losing my mind. That being said I could soldier through all summer and hate my life but come out with some (not ridiculously more than working the other more regular jobs) spending money for the fall semester, IF I didn't have this training program for school. Every day of my summer is mapped out with cardio, lifting, and ball work, on top of a semi-pro team I'm playing for 3 late nights an hour away per week. It is a part/full time job in itself and I CANNOT afford to not do it(transferring to play soccer I fucking refuse to not be the most fit, sharp, 90 minute player there), but it's impossible to with a job that starts early goes late and has no breaks or sitting time. Theoretically I could be either working or exercising almost straight through from 6 am until about 8pm rinse and repeat, but recovery is the most important part of such an intense training schedule, and I'm literally on my feet all day if I work this job. I can put hours on hours of hard work into the soccer and still save up money regularly over the summer, but if I work the job I'm not making much, hours are not fun work is easy but soul numbing, and I have no time or most importantly energy to do the training program.(cardio is particularly brutal and can't be done to the necessary standard if you aren't at least 80% energy. I also have a dog who gets all his exercise training with me(a lot) and the job limits the time I have to exercise him and myself so therefore him. Financially I am fine for the summer and next year, the only thing this job will give me is a decent amount of extra spending money off my own hard work. It's certainly valuable, but I know how to work really hard and do for soccer, it's not a question of work ethic, and my resume is extremely impressive (4 internships with state dept.+1 year admin assistant freshman year)particularly for someone my age, I can more than afford a summer off in that sense. I also asked my friends on the team and coach and the vast majority of the team doesn't work in the summer past camps for the coach and  semipro/pro team to train with.(let alone both and more)

Based on all the above,  it seems totally reasonable and prudent to me to focus this summer on making sure I'm starting in my position and not wasting my time moving from a great school, city, and living situation to a better team in a much smaller town. I'm asking you guys what you think. Am I being a lazy spoiled kid? My parents know I work crazy hard at soccer they've seen it and talk about it all the time proudly) but Ive never had to work around a lack of time/energy like this before. I'm the biggest workhorse and most dedicated person I know to the point of insanity, but I just can't do all this it's not sustainable or healthy. Can I morally tell my dad all this and say my piece without just being a lazy kid? Please help.",31May2017,2
3,I got drunk and did something stupid on Snapchat and kept it hidden for about a week. I didn't want to tell them because I knew it would cause potential break up. Right now they don't know what to think because they hate me right now but also love me. We decided to take a break but I don't know how to leave it. We are both also very distressed and wildly upset. Thoughts?,31May2017,1

7,"Hi Reddit! First post here.

I get the feeling that this is something most people have dealt with so I was wondering what choice you made and how it turned out for you.

I have an SO who is a great guy. We're both developers, he's smart, good looking, etc. But when he drinks his personality completely changes. He isn't abusive or anything, but he embarrasses me every single time we're out. He doesn't know when to stop, becomes belligerent, stuff like that. I've talked to him many times. When he's sober he agrees to stop, but one single beer and all of it goes out the window.

I have social anxiety and I can't deal with taking him out and constantly worrying that he will do/say something totally inappropriate. But it feels like since everything else is so great that I should stay with him.",31May2017,3
10,"I moved to a new state with my mother just after I graduated high school. The only chance I have had to meet people is through some of the community college classes I take. Other than that, I haven't had any other opportunities and I'm becoming pretty depressed by not having any good friends.

I enjoy doing that stuff a couple times a week but it's really draining... so the rest of the week I enjoy being by my self just playing around with a hobby or watching a movie etc... Not sure why hanging out or even talking/texting is so draining to do everyday. I'm not depressed or anything but people seem to think so. I'd like to know how you dealt with this? Or atleast made it so you didn't give off the impression that you don't enjoy the person you're talking to? ",31May2017,1
14,"This will be long, so thanks to whoever reads all of it

I'm currently 17 and I'm going to turn 18 in October. My Dad is a part owner in a 2-3 billion dollar company. It's a manufacturing company in the Oil industry, they make the tools that drill Oil. I started working in the company when I turned 14. I worked every summer fulltime freshman, sophomore, and junior year. 2 of those summers all I did was clean. It was extremely exhausting and I would be sore 24/7. My 3rd summer I worked in quality control/cleaned. I really didn't like my job and for all those 3 years I was paid $8/hr and the minimum starting wage is $10/hr haha.. I didn't care about the money. 

My Dad's philosophy is to work from the bottom up. So that when I go to run these Men (300 people) I can tell them I was in their position once and I will have the right to call them out on their laziness and bullshit. I agree with this philosophy but it's so painful to do it. I've also been studying business/real estate/accounting/economic philosophy/marketing since I was 14. No joke.. I've read 21 books since the past 4 years of highschool (200-400 pages ea). Needless to say I also believe in the philosophy to work smart not hard. Meaning, make your money work for you, don't work for your money. Also, the name of the game is who is indebted to whom. I am not going to get way off track here but I have a lot to get off my mind, MAINLY because I have no friends to talk to about this. The past 4 years of highschool I've had friends but no one I would hang out with outside of school or any best friends. I've just had class friends. Because I've been so caught up with my future and studying, I just never related. 

But I graduated 2 weeks ago and I'm currently doing 68 hours a week, 12 hour days Monday-Friday 8 hours on Saturday. And I have to do this for 4 years my Dad says, so I can ""prove to everyone I mean business."" In the grand picture I'm mainly asking for motivation, I hate what I'm doing right now because I'm doing labor work and for the next year I need to slave 68 hours a week so I can make 60-70k to do my first real estate investment at the age of 18 in multi family apartments. That is my Dad's dream and I's. **I just feel hopeless because I know why I need to work this much I just don't want to, I'm not defying any of his philosophy's I just don't know if I have it in me. I am not the grunt type, I hate working with my hands! I would prefer to be an engineer or something and use my brains... So what should I do?** Should I just be a grunt and work 60-70 hours a week for the next 4 years so I can be extremely wealthy? Or do you think their is someway I can tell my Dad I'm not cut out for working that long with my hands. And if I did that he would probably drop me from his and I's plan, and I'd be screwed. I just need help.. Someone enlighten me please, and I will answer all questions...",31May2017,1
15,"Sorry for the long rant / explanation to follow.

I (17) have spent most of my teen years with anxiety and depression. I have seen therapists and psychiatrists(?) on and off during this time. About this time last year, I ""graduated"" from the DBT program I joined after a suicide attempt. 

The problem is, I was better but have gotten worse over the year. I am not currently suicidal, but I have been for, I would say, most of the time since. In August I started having regular auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoia. These eventually subsided, but not after affecting my sleep, school, social life, etc. I didn't want to tell my mom because I know she doesn't take well to my mental health issues.

Over spring break I finally confessed it to her. She blamed it on... ghosts or some shit. I don't even know. Instead of a doctor, she scheduled me a visit with her psychic. For some reason she either doesn't want me to or won't take me to seek mental help. 

What can I do about this? Would I be able to go somewhere without her present?

TL;DR: Minor with major mental health problems, mom won't take me to get help. ",31May2017,0

21,"I have a dilemma. I had myself convinced for a while that I didn't need to talk to anyone, or get help from anyone, or rely anyone. Everyone, after all, seemed out for themselves, and no one is going to have time to listen to my bullshit, so best to just stow it and not be annoying. 

In general, I think I'm okay with not talking to most people in my life and staying a certain level of closed off. However, I feel like I want to open up to someone. I don't like psychologists -- I think I just want someone who will listen, because I'm tired of listening to bullshit, I want someone to listen to me for once, even if its just to listen to my tale.

So I'm caught somewhere between trust issues and a burning desire to open up. Thoughts?",31May2017,8
26,"Tl;dr: How to get rid of a lot of cobwebs really quickly?

Recently moved into a new place with a sort-of garage attached to it. It's not very well sealed and there are cobwebs everywhere: 

* In the rafters

* In between the wall studs because most of it isn't finished over on the inside

* Inside the cinder blocks that I assume are the foundation for the shed but are partially uncovered on the inside, etc.

I tried a vacuum cleaner but they're pretty sticky so they just kind of gunk up the end of the wand, and they're full of shit like leaves and pine needles somehow so it basically just clogs the end of the vacuum. Took me about half and hour to 1/4 of one wall and I'm not so interested in spending that much time on this shit. So any ideas for a better way to do this would be greatly appreciated.

35,"Hi, I’m making this post because I’m in a serious need for help right now. My friend was raped recently and came to me about it. They made me promise not to tell anyone so I will not give a name for their sake. Therefore, I can’t give too many details on the matter. Needless to say, I’m pissed. Not only are they too afraid to go to their parents or authorities about it, but the attacker is still in contact with them and can get to them at any point. This is dangerous and I have to stay away from the guy so I don’t get harassment charges against me. Believe me, I want to beat him until he’s bloody, but I can’t. I’m assuming the attacker threatened them not to tell anyone about it or else he’ll kill them.

I tried getting them to go to the authorities but they won’t out of fear.

I tried getting them to tell me more information about the attacker but they won’t out of fear. 

I tried getting them to tell me everything that happened but they won’t out of fear and shame.

This piece of trash has installed fear into my friend, so now I’m taking matters into my own hands. I want him taken down. I am coming to you guys for help.

Please. I need someone to help me get information on this scumbag. He needs to be exposed for what he did.

Here’s what I need from you guys.

1) I’d like advice from people who have experienced similar situations. Were you successful in tracking someone down? And are there signs I should watch out for that the attacker may be planning to do something again?

2) What resources could I use to help me find a person when I have limited information on them? I have tried social media. Are there other public databases or methods I could try?

3) What are other ways, aside from continuing to support my friend and urging them to report this, that I can help them?

And lastly… After I find his social media accounts I’m going to need someone who is somewhat experienced with tracking someone so I can get more information and evidence. Either that, or I’ll need tips on how to do it myself. Either way works.

Thank you very much for your time and patience in reading this.",31May2017,2

39,"I feel both scared and ashamed of my actions yesterday. I was tired and I took a seat on the bus, ready to pass out once I got home. A lady sat herself beside me and was struggling to open her bag.

She turned to me and asked if I could help her. Feeling bad for her, I struggled getting it open and finally got it halfway unzipped. When I turned to her, I saw that she had a lot of bluish/dark reddish/purplish looking bumps carpeting the back of her hands and dotting all over her face (she was wearing a long sleeved polo so I couldn't see the extent of it all). After she thanked me and took the bag, I visibly inched away from her as much as I could. During the remainder of the bus trip, she kept on rubbing her face and scratching her hands, bothered by the heat despite it raining with bus air-conditioning. 

It's been eating me inside how rude I've been, but since I'm a hypochondriac, my brains snaps to being more concerned that she might have leprosy and getting anxious thinking I might get it myself. I'm sorry if I offend anybody with the disease. I don't know much about it at all save for the ostracizing scenes on TV and movies.

41,"In February 2016 I had 3 items (keys, a bag of personal toiletries and high end sunglasses) suddenly go missing out of my bag which was in a common area at work.  My friend helped me look for my stuff (especially my keys for my truck and to get in my house), but we couldn't find the items.  No one else had anything taken. I had a spare key hidden in my truck, so I could get home. I reported the missing items to management.  They sent out an email to staff to 'keep a look out', but that was the extent of the involvement.  Security/Protection Services was never notified. 

Flash forward 15 months, I have left that department and I'm working across town (same company).  I receive a message while out of town across the country, with a good number of my colleagues, from a former colleague, who says she thinks she found my stuff.  Sends me a picture, asking, ""are these yours?"".  Shocked, I say yes!  I totally recognized my unique key chain, and my bag. 

My question:  why would someone deliberately take items from someone else, and keep them for 15 months, only to return them?

EDIT: I think it may be bothering me an particular amount because there is a person who works there who has a history of harassing and stalking me.  They were told to stop or they would be fired and the police would become involved. I didn't want to throw that in, because I didn't know if it was relevant. I'm still not sure if it is.

57,"For about a week straight a new customer has been coming into the cafe/bookstore I work at. I'm a barista in the cafe and we aren't a *huge* place so most of our customers are everyday-regulars.

When we first met this person he wasn't overly in-your-face, and my manager spoke with him in a chatty, conversational way when he spoke and was British (we're in the U.S.). Everything seemed fine, he made a few humorous comments that made us laugh and seemed charming. Then near the end of the conversation it felt like he couldn't quite stop himself from talking and apologized saying, ""that's just me"" without either of us prompting the apology. It seemed odd, but he took his drink and left.

I forgot about him until I see him near the doors of the store chatting with a girl. I still think nothing of it, continue working, but then he's still standing there - in the doorway - just talking and talking for about 20 minutes to this girl who had just walked in. I got the oddly desperate vibe from him, but again, it didn't really affect me.

Next day, I come into work and there he is sitting at a table, leaning on a customer's table chatting. She seems to be politely listening. I head behind the counter and my co-worker tells me that the *weirdest* British guy was flirting with her all morning.

She tells me that throughout the conversation he seemed charming, but then started saying odd things. Like her biggest red flag was that he wanted to play a ""guessing game"" to guess her age. She ended up telling him she was 21 and he said he was ""old enough to be her father"" and continued flirting, never telling her his age. He showed her his large forearm tattoo and said that he was called ""The Dragon"". He told her he was rich, that he had no family, and no credit card, but that all he'd ever wanted was a wife and children, so he wasn't *really* rich.

So the next day he comes in again. The only customers at the time were a group of high school girls with their mothers on the far side, and two lady customers waiting on drinks. He walked up and said ""Oh good, I'm the only guy."" My female manager and male manager were both in the kitchen where he couldn't see them, then both walked out and he saw my (male) manager and said, ""Oh, one other. Still good odds.""

So I let my managers know that the man was odd and made me a little uncomfortable, so the m. manager came over a few times doing his ""rounds"" and checking up on everything. The customer came up to the counter and said ""if he comes over here one more time, I'm going to..."" and he didn't finish his sentence, but went on to say that this happened everywhere he went. Managers or cops were called on him. He didn't elaborate, and ended up leaving sooner than he had the previous days.

So this morning he came in while I was alone, with two other elderly customers at the tables. He started chatting and I was trying to cut conversation short, asking him what i could get for him, trying not to engage. Somehow the man said, ""If you ever see a man that looks and sounds like me shoot him.""

I looked up at him and said, ""That was a very threatening thing to say to someone."" 

Customer: ""I didn't say *me*.""

Me: ""You said someone who looks and sounds like you. How should I take that?""

Customer: ""I just need someone to put me out of my misery. I just won't say what i'm thinking anymore. I will do the opposite of what I would normally do.""

I apologized - maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't have - if I offended him, but told him what he'd said made me uncomfortable. He went on to tell me that he had done ""horrible things in the British military"" and that he wasn't supposed to talk about it. He said in a past life he was called ""El Diablo"" or ""Lucifier"" that he goes by ____________ and listed a long spew of names. He said he was *the* Daniel in the lions' den. He told me God hated him. He said he'd been banned from two malls and had the cops called on him at a gym for talking about Jesus Christ. He said he was poor and laughed and showed me a *shit-ton* of cash in his wallet, then pulled out a credit card - that he'd informed my co-worker he didn't have - with his name on it. He told me I reminded him of his wife who had tried to kill him. A wife he said he'd never had to my co-worker. He told me I looked like his step-father's daughter and proceeded to tell me his step father's name. He told me he could lift over 400 pounds at the gym.

Customers on the second day I saw him - when he talked for a long time with my co-worker - said that he was a ""dangerous man"" looking for a ""mark""? That was their impression of him. They wanted me and our managers to be aware of him.

He told me he would be back tomorrow. He said a lot of other stuff I've forgotten. But he mentioned he's been staying in a hotel and that he can never stay anywhere long.

I spoke with another co-worker who said he had made her uncomfortable, too. She said he'd been telling her all about his wife and daughter (the ones he never had???) and then started flirting with her for a long time.

When I spoke with my manager it felt like he blew it off. He told me if he never said anything outright sexual or violent then there was nothing that could be done. He *also* mentioned that if this man were a cute guy we probably wouldn't have this problem with him?

I need advice. This man not only makes me uncomfortable but scares me. Is there truly nothing that can be done? Does anyone have any advice at all? ",31May2017,8

I finished the English earlier but I couldn't do anything for math , I studied so hard so much but everything was new for me because in high school I wasn't study .. so just today i knew that i fall so i will be fired . I want to disappear, everytime i met one of me friends of family he asks about the university, i don't know how to tell my parents whom every second asking me if the grades came or not, what should i do?

63,"Basically, the title. I'm an introvert but I want to have some friends -- thing is, I can't make any friends and I can't maintain relationships because of the title. I listen to what someone has to say, but when I talk, they don't listen. Since 6th grade to now (entering 3rd year of university) this has held true. It's like I'm filling in empty time for other people, and the moment someone else comes around, forget /u/skydance1 -- I'll hang out with the other person. I knew someone like this. Call him Tyler. He and I were ""having a conversation"" about university (we go to the same university). Someone comes along and just glances at Tyler. Tyler says hi and he comes in to shake hands, after which those two were in conversation leaving me out of it. I didn't know the third person, but there wasn't even an introduction -- I just didn't exist anymore, I was forgotten.

Another example: I was at a Bible study years back and the leader made a point. I asked him to add a point of my own and he agreed, to which I started speaking. At the other end of the table, 3 or 4 attendees decided to have their own conversation. Everyone else didn't really care and visibly had their attention on other things. After I ended and the leader started speaking again they were at attention. 
Even my closest friend is guilty of this. The only ones that listen to me are my parents and brother.

It really makes me hate myself sometimes. This is why I can't have friends. But I don't know whose fault it is. Is it theirs for not showing common courtesy? But I am the common factor, so isn't it my fault for being a worthless shitbag? What can I do?",31May2017,85

Secondly Im emotionally unstable and I need some motivation but everyone is trying to help me but it's not working at all and in feel like I'm getting more and more depressed everyday to the point where I have at least missed more than 50 days of school I used to be a b student when I was younger though and would always go to school no matter what.

Third I did have something that got me away from video games which was weight lifting and trying to lose weight but once i lifted so much going 6 times a week and mostly sitting on a curved angle made my back extremely bad so I stopped going to gym and losing weight and everything fell apart again

67,"Hey Reddit,

So I'm lost, no idea what I should do, here's the story.

I'm a 19 year old guy, met John around 2 months ago, let's say he ""joined our squad"", started hanging out with us daily etc.
John slept over at my place many times, and I really began to trust him.

- Last night a few friends came over to my place, we ordered pizza and John said he only had around $12 on him which he was supposed to give to his teacher the next day.

- He went out to buy a pack of cigarettes for $2 after we finished the pizza, leaving him with only $10.

- John slept over at my place, and I woke up to find $20 missing from my $400 laying on the computer desk.

- Mentioned it to John, he got nervous for a few seconds and tried to help me find the missing money.

- John's reaction was exactly the same as the reaction when the police pulled us over, and he had weed on him.

- Around 10am we headed out to his school for the party celebrating school's end.

- John stops by a burger shop and buys a burger for himself.

- By the end of the day, John spends a total of around $25 ($15 if he gave the $10 to his teacher).

John seems like a really good guy, although a bit manipulative and has delusions of grandeur.
I wouldn't like to lose him as a friend, but I suspect he stole the $20 from me.


Reddit, what do you think I should do?
Should I confront him about this?
If I should, why? If he did steal the money - I don't want his side of the story, he's gone. If he didn't - I would be falsely accusing a good friend, which wouldn't end well either.

77,"Alright, here is my story.

I've been with a girl for a year now and it was a rocky relationship from the gecko. There were really hard moments in the relationship as well. I have to deal with her constant break downs, tantrums and other stuff that, psychologically, is hard to handle. Nevertheless, I stuck with her, fought for her, been through thick and thin. Of course, it wasn't like I hadn't made mistakes either. I've shouted at her due to stress, I've lashed her multiple times. So yes, I wasn't holy either.

But recently, due to her mental state she was admitted to intense therapy (basically doing stuff with other people that have problems like her). And yesterday (what I forgot to mention that exams are on my nose and I'm extremely anxious about them) I broke due to the pressure. I called her and hearing her happy made me so mad because it sounded like she didn't even care about how was I fairing. And today I talked with her and I understood that she let a guy kiss her on the lips (although she did admit that she feels sick about it), and that she cuddled with her roommate (which is female, if that changes anything). 

I honestly do not know what to do. I love this girl and I've invested so much into the relationship, but when she feels really upset she sometimes does this kind of stuff. Should I continue being with her or not? 

If necessary, I will add even more information. ",31May2017,1

81,"I'm typing this out on my phone so please excuse any grammar or spelling errors. I'm not sure this is the right subreddit to post on but I am truly in need of some advice on how to get them to move..

My neighbors are possibly the worst kind of people you can ever meet. They moved in about a year ago now and my life has fucking sucked since. They brought a long a dog with them they don't look after. She was jumping my fence and would play with my dog which i really didnt mind - at first.

Soon enough, their dog is over my yard 90% of the time and eating my dogs food and shitting all through my yard and pulling my fucking clothes off the line and ripping holes in brand new $60+ clothing. I got angry so I call up the owner of the house (he lived there before they did) and he says they aren't supposed to have a dog. Are you sure it's theirs? I'm like the fuck? Of course I'm sure. He claimed to have told them to get rid of it. A week passes by low and behold their dog is in my yard again. I was downstairs when her dog runs at and tackles my little 1 yr old son at the time and is barking in his face. I am seeing red at this point, run over to the dog and kick it as hard as possible, grab her and throw her over the fence.

My neighbor comes running out screaming at me how I'm a bad person. At this point I am beyond angry and fly into a rant telling her she's lucky i didnt kill her dog, to keep her mongrol animal out of my yard and if i see it in there ill kill it because it just attacked my son. She raves on a bit i just walk away calling her a few choice words.

I call the owner again and he is about as useful as tits on a bull. So i get his permission and replace the fence with a 6ft one. Have a mate come out we replace it and no more issues for a few months.

I thought great its over. Boy was i wrong..
She moves in 2 guys - bogan as fuck. They just drink all day yell at each other all night. Shes not supposed to have these guys here so again, i call the owner after i see them burning shit in his backyard for the 5th time that week. Tell him and again no help. 

Its at this point theres rubbish everywhere. Throughout my front and fucking back yard. My partner theorized that the owner must know these people; relatives or friends hence the no help. I literally catch them one day throwing DOG SHIT over my yard. So instead of getting angry, i wait.. till after 3 when they are sleeping.

I gather as much dog shit as possible and put it behind all their car wheels and even some on their steps. As i am walking up the street i see them yelling and gettin angry cause the dog shit has smeared all through their tires and they had stood in it on the stairs. I'm feeling happy at this point. Sweet revenge. I still see them throwing dog shit over my yard so i keep doing it. Switching up the places where i put it so to catch then off guard. 

Hid it in the mailbox and saw them reach in and immediately jerk their arm out getting angry and swearing like crazy. They probably suspect its me but i had already gave up talking to them calmly. They left me alone after that, kept their shit to themselves (literally).

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. We had no issues and then they start. It starts off as a can in my front yard. She says sorry and i just threw it out. No biggie it had been a while. Every day after that theres fucking rubbish everywhere. A bag of fish heads here, cans of alcohol there.. i get pissed and say something. She apologizes and my yard is clean .. until today.

I just got home from picking up my kid and there is rubbish EVERYWHERE. Woodstock cans, dare 1l containers, old food. 

Reddit and fellow Australians - I'm at my wits end. I'm not an asshole. I just want to keep to myself and not pick up after grubs. Is that so hard to ask? 

Is there anything I can do to get rid of this trash? (Neighbors)
I don't want to worry the cops as they have other shit to deal with. I just want to know my options. I'm over hearing the woman talk with her mates about getting spit roasted by the 2 fellas that live with her or about how she tongues their ass holes.

Sorry for my colorful language I'm just over it.

I started a new job two months ago. Since then, I’ve been working incredibly hard to prove my worth, but it soon came to light that I have an issue when it comes to following instructions and carrying out tasks that I should have already known how to do. I have a tendency to forget certain key instructions whenever I panic/ things go wrong, or miss out on information that I should’ve remembered otherwise. There have been times where I’d finish a task, only for the senior coworker in charge of teaching me the ropes to step in and discover that I either did something wrong or forgot a step, even if I was absolutely sure that I double checked beforehand. It doesn’t help either that another coworker that started at the same time and with the same title as me has since moved quickly up the ranks to the point where I’ve begun taking many assignments directly from her.

Today I had my first “bad day” at work; my machine didn’t cooperate, I nearly missed an important deadline, and discovered that I left out an important step for a time urgent assignment that my coworker pinged me about after I returned home. I know that tomorrow is another day, and all I can really do is to pick myself off the ground, dust myself off, and face forward.

Being the delusional idiot that I am, took her word for being on the pill and used no pre-caution. We cut ties and I started dating my now ex-girlfriend (broke up last Thursday when I found out). 

 Come February she says she's pregnant and we both agreed on an abortion due to both of our situations. I gave her the money because she was just let go, checked up on her after the abortion, she said it's done (red flag due to gambling problems, took her parents credit card and spent 20k). I cut ties with my her again due to me being with my ex-girlfriend (I told her everything).

Last Thursday she texts me that she never went through with the abortion and is 22 weeks pregnant. We meet and she tells me she kept it from me, has a newly divorced boyfriend with 2 kids that she started dating around March, and she's still smoking. She kept repeating I don't have to be in the picture, over and over again and from word of mouth, she doesn't even want me in the picture.

The boyfriend and his ex wife started the divorce around December-January, got together with my FWB around March when the abortion was suppose to happen, and tells me she never went through with it when the boyfriends divorce is suppose to be finalized in a few weeks.

A shame, considering I moved here to focus solely on my music for the first time in my life with the pride of an early twentysomething finally in recovery after five years of near-consistent psychiatric care.

The boy and I have exchanged pleasantries, and he's twice invited me to smoke a bowl with him. We discussed his spiritual beliefs, and our shared affinity toward the world of runes and gems. Where I had interest, he made a lifestyle.

I didn't want to mess with anything, so I went inside and looked up my mental image. I identified the crystal as [Lapis Lazuli](https://www.crystalvaults.com/crystal-encyclopedia/lapis)

When we arrived it soon became obvious that wasn't the case. We checked all over, even screwed boards into the siding but she still hasn't slept and has us check the door every twenty minutes or so. She starts screaming at them mid conversation with us and is really upset we can't hear them.

I recently disappeared from a Skype group of mine due to feeling depressed, unwanted, etc. and a few moments of almost deciding to end my life. Recently just came back to it. First thing that happens the my best friend (M) pretty much a brother, is hitting on the girl i brought in and developed feeling for (and he know about said feelings i have for her). When i came back they don't even tell me much of what i missed (nobody in the group would tell me what i missed). When I'm in a video chat with them, they just ignore me, and don't ask me where I've been. A day an a half pass after i went to ""teach"" this guy trying to get into my house and threatening the lives of people in my house, I get injured from this and left to stay in bed. When i got back from this, i lay down to rest, The 2 are talking in the Skype group's video chat (they stayed in it ever sense I left, I see that the girl has been saying stuff like, ""did you really mean what you said"" and when and how they lost their V-Card, in the text chat, they only asked each other once about what might have happened, after that, they flirted the entire time i was gone ""teaching"" the person. My friend was about to type something (it showed the ""person is now typing..."") and they girl says to stop him from finishing typing, by saying ""shhhh don't tell him he doesn't know ; its ok &lt;friend's name&gt;."" It hurts me that they really didn't ask much about the incident when we talked last night, and acting like they didn't flirt and shit. Sense she was being loud and still lives with family, one of her male family members come and takes her laptop. He stops asking me about my injury and what i did to the guy. and goes quiet, then saying ""I'm worried, about what might have happen to her"". We don't talk for a full 15 min, then says ""im gonna go to sleep... good night"", I say night and hang up. I adding this in cause I think I forgot to add it before. When I first came back they didn't ask where I was and why I was gone. They rarely talk to me now, and just talk with each other in private and the group chat. When I they just ignore me and talk over me. When I'm in the call, they do those Instagram reposts where they have a set of colors that mean stuff (like red means we should date, blue means I love you, etc.) to flirt while I'm in the call. The friend is just trying to get video sex most likely, the girl too nice to say no, and might be falling for him.
I feel like I don't mean anything to them, just a side hoe of some sorts, where I'm just in the way of ""them"". I don't want to be a ""cock block"" for my friend, but, I feel as if what I tell him just goes to deaf ears. I need advice on what to tell them, what to do. I'm too nice to do anything mean.

Hospital treatment!  But what I have isn't life threatening and I'm not suicidal so I'm safe.  If that takes a different turn then I'll rethink it.   I can't get him to understand I just don't want meds for what I have.  Any advice to end the never ending argument??

113,"Writing this on mobile before school, will come back and add when I can.

I constantly have this paranoia in the back of my mind that people are only nice to me out of pity. I likely started way back in middle school when a girl I ""dated"" told people that she only said yes when I asked because she felt bad for me. 

I understand that it's just simple middle school bullshit, but the feeling stuck with me. 

Now, at this time, I'm much better looking and much better in social situations than I was during middle school: I cut my hair, grew into my big ass ears, and go to some parties. 

But I still can't shake that feeling.

I have some extremely close friends who I know are true to me, but others, I just don't know. 

For example, I met this group of kids my age at an event over the weekend. They were all super nice and this one girl showed particular interest in me. We talked and laughed and had a great time. 
But I just couldn't shake the feeling that they are only nice because they felt bad. 
Note that these people don't know where I come from, what I'm like in school, what my family's like, etc. so I have no reason to feel this way. 

But it's almost embedded in me. 

tl:dr A feeling that everyone takes pity on me in my relationships is stuck in my mind, constantly thinking about it when people are kind to me.

115,"Hi there. Yeah, pretty much the title.

So a bit of background, I am a senior in my school (Grade 12), and those younger kids (Grade 10-11) are the MOST DISRESPECTFUL asses in the universe. Whenever they said hurtful things or being stupid, no one (not even the Head of House) tried to rein them in, and when I had to, they laughed it off &amp; said ""it's a free country, I do what I want"" or ""free speech""-type excuses, and I can't really argue with them.

117,"I was talking to a nice guy for about 2 months, constantly texting, talking over the phone. We had a couple dates, and we planned for more. 

There was a bit of discrepancy a couple weeks ago, where I said I'd love to be in a relationship but I have to think hard about it because I come from a ethnic background where being in a relationship with someone from a different background may be frowned upon. To which he affirmed, and reassuringly said it was too early for decisions to be took and he'd love to keep talking/dating regardless. However, although I had not told him, I was going to propose we be in a serious relationship prior to the unfolding of the next set of events.

So we keep talking/dating for so another 3 weeks and things are going great, sparks are flying, etc. Then around a week ago, I messaged and he didn't reply, so I thought he was busy and give him time.

*nothing*

I message again, and he replies but suddenly the messages are shorter, less affectionate and cold. I keep talking until he leaves. The next day we talk again, and the same thing happens. I message the next day and no response.

This was last week and I sent a final message a couple days and again I've not heard a response. This really hurts, because I don't know what happened. I've been in tears the whole day because I actually did envision a possible future with this guy, and suddenly gravity has brought me back down and slammed me against the ground.

Anyway that's not the point; I've made a lot of progress in the past 3 years and am about to get a really good job in September.
Along with a good salary I will also get a car and a lot of extra free time, which I will use to hit the gym and become pretty lean. 1 Thing I also want to change is my hair.. I've had a receding hairline sine I was 16, and at this point there's not a lot of hair left at the front of my head. But hair implants are very expensive, so I am considering a wig. A quality wig offcourse, not one of those cheap generic wigs.

124,"So earlier this year a friend of mine went on a trip overseas. I asked him to buy some clothes for me and he did. He said he's going to bring them back after the trip which is pretty nice because he's busy working and have little time to spare for shopping. I did pay for the cost but I still appreciate that a lot.

Fast forward today, some unexpected things happened. My friend returned from the overseas trip but didn't give me the clothes...but I need them desperately this Sunday because it is my last chance to shoot a photo in it with my precious, precious girlfriend who's going to leave me forever for her career. I love her so much but long distance is just not possible for us and I don't think we will ever meet. So this photo shooting session is like the last rites for me.

So I messaged my friend, asking if I can get the clothes early. To which I was told he gave them to another visiting friend to bring back to town ahead of time!

For now let's call the first person Alan and his friend Jack.

Well I needed those clothes so I messaged his friend (who I also know) if he can hand them to me...but he's already out of town. Luckily he left them at home where he have people who can help me. He told me where the stuff is and I turned up and looked at (and only at) the place he specified.

Bad luck, somehow my clothes aren't there but that's not the main problem here. Alan messaged me, saying he is pissed because he also gave Jack other stuff to carry back and I am going through his stuff. I didn't see his stuff nor do I know there are other things he gave Jack to carry back. He says I am going behind his back and scammed Jack to get into his house.

I just...I don't know. I want to resolve this situation. Alan is the executive of the local community (and there's only one here) and I don't want to just tell him to off himself. He's been a good friend and I don't want to be kicked out.

I just got a message saying that he doesn't want to talk, and I ""have no concept of personal boundaries, basic decency, privacy or consent and consent.""

Things look pretty grim. Please, any advice?",31May2017,1

I've had depression since I was a teenager, and though I'm in recovery, every time I start a job I find myself desperately unhappy again. No matter if I'm good at it, if the money is okay, if the people I work with are nice. I always find an excuse to leave, and do it. 
The thing is, I don't enjoy customer service or admin. Don't get me wrong I'm grateful to have work. I know it's rough for people to get work and I've been very blessed, but when I'm working it consumes everything. I can't enjoy life, I get depressed and anxious, and seek out every opportunity to self sabotage. I want to work, I want to have good work ethic, but every job I've had is soul sucking. It makes me miserable.  
I'm going to university this year to finally study something I enjoy. I've always wanted a degree and finally am in a position to get one. I hope that with that degree, I'll be able to get a job in the industry I want to work in. I'm not qualified as of yet, and have only been able to get customer service/admin roles etc. But I just worry that when I finally get a job I think I'll love, I'll hate it and want to quit again. 
Do you think that when you get a job you love it's easier to get up and go, and stick at it? Do you think it's less depressing? I worry that it'll always be like this. Is it even worth going to university? Do you think it'll be better for me then, or is there something else I can do?",31May2017,1
134,"I am currently 26 yo. 
After graduating college, I tried for 2 years to get into graduate school, without any success. However, the time spent studying for the admissions got me into a very nice and prestigious bachelor's program on the finest university for the field in the field. 

At the same time, my parents got in a very though divorce where no one handled it as a mature person. Lots of emotional fights and blackmailing. Both of my parents are not fond of the idea of my advancing academically, and are/were successful professionally (my mom is 15 years older then my father, so she is retired now). 

So, during the first year of the said bachelors I got a (badly) paid internship at a nice small company, a start up, (it is normal to work and studying my country, if you are an intern), where I was doing pretty much everything I wanted. I was quite happy with the nature of my work, worked side by side with incredibly smart people, learning a bunch, and had my work appreciated by everyone, but the pay was quite low.

Keep in mind that during this period, I moved out of my mom's house and started living with my girlfriend, (reason: emotional spillover of the divorce + me getting older). The rent consumed pretty much half of my salary. Also company help with groceries, which I spend it all with ourselves.

This all happened in the beginning-mid 2016. The second semester of my bachelors degree was awesome, but quite challenging.  Now this new field I am at now is awesome, and I still have an idea of getting into graduate school (different field from the previous 2 years). The admission process happens in February together with a summer course (I am on the southern hemisphere) and a hard test. I studied through the summer course, got a two week break from my internship where I studied some more, but did not got in the graduate school (again...).

So, right before my third semester started (this is March of this year). I got an offer for a job, in a different city. A smaller, much smaller city. The pay is great, like 700% more then at the startup, but the field is much less prestigious, and the people are much more simple minded. The company is Scandinavian, in the agricultural sector with 1500 + employees. I accepted a 3 month experience period, with a reduced pay.

During these 3 months they provided me with a hotel, and I am still within the experience period of my contract. I literally work alone, don't have anyone to talk to about my work (this is useful, for different ideas + fresh perspectives), and I work directly with upper management. Not studying has had a great impact on me. It is the first time in my life that I don't go to school, and it literally drives me crazy, specially when the my 2nd bachelors degree was just awesome. 

Now, everyone I asked thought this was a great opportunity, and that I should give a try. But now, with the end of my experience contract, I am tempted to go back to my previous life, because I was that much happier.

There are many other options I could follow, and I am considering them. There is an University that offers the same bachelor's degree, and at some point my company said that working remotely could be an option, but it is present in the companies culture, but life would be crazy. 
One more caveat, my girlfriend just got accepted to a master's degree in Europe, so she wont be getting into the equation now.  
But keep in mind that my bachelor's degree and field I am getting into is in the STEM area, whilst before I was in economics...

__TL,DR__: I was happy with studying + working in a low paying internship, and now am not, but have a nice paying job. Studying is important to me, and I want to keep doing it. There is too much going on and I cant seem to think straight. ",31May2017,7

My fiancée recently got the results for a big project she completed in college. Turns out she failed and she is beating herself up about it. This same thing happened in the course she took last year but she was able to move on with the course this year. She is saying things like ""why would it be any different this year if I couldn't do it last year"", ""I can't do anything right"", and ""I'm a failure everyone thinks I'm a failure"". 


I keep telling her things like ""it's just a setback"", ""everyone has a couple of failures before they succeed"", and ""I know you'll get through it"". Overall she's very down about failing the project again and because she failed it she won't be able to move on to next year's course. 


On top of this all she doesn't have a good relationship with her mom at home and they argue a lot. We plan on moving to the states in early 2019 so moving out isn't an option for her right now.

Due to medical complications (pulmonary edema augmented by her Cystic Fibrosis), she had an emergency C-section too early and they passed away.  I'm relaying this to provide context.

We've had many conversations about what we like and don't like during our intimate moments.  We communicate very well, actually.

I really liked my job and the people I worked with so it was a great situation. About 2 years into the job the company decided to relocate to the east coast (near NYC) and I decided to not move with the company. We were offered great relocation packages which in the first year I would make about double my salary and over a course of three years drop down to only about 10K more than my current salary. I decided to not move to the east coast because my family and life are in my hometown and I was confident I would get another job.

People are working 12+ hours a day and there is a mutiny feeling when it comes to the techs and management. The experience I'm gaining is in the line of work that I really don't see my self continuing considering it's not exactly what I signed up for. 

Now I'm in total regret mode considering I turned down a lot of money to stay and now I'm in a situation I don't enjoy. Now I'm trying to get out of this place ASAP but make a more educated decision so I don't end up in the same work environment with a new company.  

I've thought about asking my previous company if they would take me back for the same relocation package (I left on really good terms and was a top performer there) but still uneasy about how they would think of me and if I would even like the move once I got there.

My fiancée had a very abusive childhood, and upon getting away from her family, cut all contact with them. She is very happy with her circle of friends, and self-sufficient, and in therapy for the trauma of her childhood. We've been dating seven years, and once I finished my masters, I proposed, and she said yes.

Great, wonderful, except now my mom is on my ass about her family. My fiancée is VERY private about it, and when my mother asked about her family in the past, my fiancée has just said ""We're estranged,"" without further comment. Since we've been engaged my mom calls me nearly every day (we've only been engaged about a month) to push about her family. 

We went to an engagement party my parents hosted, and in the middle of the party, my mom brought out the cordless phone, and insisted that my fiancee call her parents so they could chat! She flatly refused, and repeated that they were estranged but this time she added, ""and no, they will not be attending the wedding, either.""

My mom has been railing about how it ""ruined her party"" and she ""has a right to know"" about my fiancée's family relationships. I told her that what mattered was that I knew, and I felt her reasons were valid, and that it is none of my mother's business. I mentioned in passing that my fiancée's childhood was traumatic, as part of trying to explain to my mother why her continually bringing it up was counterproductive to her desire to get close to my fiancée. 

Two days ago, my mother was still on about it, and called my fiancée telling her she ""wasn't allowed"" to marry me until she ""confessed the truth"" to my mother. I'm an independent adult, my parents don't pay any of our bills, so I am going to marry this girl regardless of what she wants. I've directly told my mom to cut it out, but she hasn't. I told her last night that if she ever brings this topic up again, I'm cutting her out of my life. 

I just want to know if there's anything else I should do or say? Am I being unfair to my mother? My fiancée has always been very hands off with my family, telling me that she will follow my lead on how to deal with them, so I know she'll support whatever I choose.

156,"I'm not sure if there's even much hope left in trying but ok here goes.
I'm a first year university student and the group I'm supposed to be living with next year can no longer afford to pay for the house that we have signed a contract for and agreed to rent. The tenancy officially starts in September 2017 and both the agency and the landlord are aware that we want to leave before it begins.
The housing agency assured us that they would be able to find replacements and that they've ""never seen someone had to pay for the whole year before"". The issue is that we're loosing time and no one has shown interest in the house.
After speaking to the landlord he refuses to let us leave unless we pay him the entire year's worth of rent.
On top of that our contract doesn't have a break clause so we can't just leave.
I'm scared that I'm gonna be broke next year as a result of getting this house and I don't know what to do. If there's anyone out there who can help please just know that this was a hasty decision that we made because we were scared we weren't going to find a place to live. We never wanted to ""mess around"" with the landlord or break promises we couldn't keep.

here's a little backstory (i'll try to keep it short but no promises haha) - i'm 19. i go to community college but i'm transferring next semester, so technically i still live at home but i won't be for long. ever since i was like, 12, it's been a fucking BATTLE to convince my parents to let me do ANYTHING. my mom wouldn't even let me get my eyebrows waxed until i was like, 15. just the other day, i asked her if i could go get my hair cut (with my own money, of course) and she flipped the fuck out. i want to get more piercings (i have a few) &amp; some tattoos, but they would literally disown me if i did (not joking, my dad has told me this before). they're okay with ear piercings and stuff, just not facial, which are the ones i want. i have 2 already, a septum (which i hide from them) and a nostril piercing but i want a few more, like my other nostril &amp; a vertical labret. i also really wanna start getting tattoos. most of my friends already have tattoos already &amp; their parents are cool with it, but of course, mine aren't. i also wanna change up my hair color (my natural hair color is dark brown) &amp; it's been that way for all my life and i'm just ready to see myself with colorful hair for a change. of fucking course, my mom said no and freaked out again. i just don't know why they're so fucking adamant on controlling the way i look? like, it's MY face, MY hair, MY body... not theirs. i know i will probably have to have natural colored hair &amp; no piercings for a professional job, but i'm nowhere near that point in my life, so why can't i just have it while i'm not working? i just..... i don't fucking get it. all my friends' parents are so chill when it comes to this stuff, and here's my mom, not even letting me fucking get highlights in my hair. AND I'M 19. AND I HAVE MY OWN FUCKING MONEY. 
i'll be going off to a university soon, so should i just do everything i wanna do while i'm away? maybe it's because i'm still ""living in their house"", but... 

any advice?? sorry if this is literally the stupidest fucking thing asked on here, i just needed to vent for a while haha. ",31May2017,2

163,"I am 35 and it seems as if my father can't get past that and see me as an adult.

I have to give some back story for it all to make sense. Several years ago my father wrote on a 16 year old cousins Facebook page 'why mar a beautiful body' when the girl mentioned wanting a tattoo. He had only met said cousin 2-3 times before that and it made her uncomfortable as well as friends of the girl. Turned into a huge drama filled thing where my father was accused of being a pervert and child molester. 

He asked my advice and I told him saying that to her wasn't appropriate since he doesn't really know the girl. 

Flash forward a few years and I'm dating a man who has teenage children. Before we even married I made it clear to my father he was not to friend the kids on Facebook.  I said 'do not friend the kids on Facebook' so a few months later he friends my now stepdaughter on Facebook. 

When I found out I went ape shit on my father and told him to delete her immediately. Instead of doing what I said he called my husband and spoke to him and because my husband doesn't like confrontation he told my dad it was ok to friend her and comment on her posts. 

Needless to say I was pissed at both and told my father never to go against what I said and told him and my husband both that if any drama happens because of something my father says on Facebook to my stepdaughter it's on them and I will not become involved no matter how bad it gets. 

Now onto last night. 

My parents divorced in 2000 after 20 years of marriage. My mother's family wanted nothing to do with my father after the divorce because apparently that's what you do. But the thing is instead of them telling him they don't want to continue a relationship they play nice when he texts or messages them on Facebook but then bitch to me about my dad contacting them. 

My grandfather passed away Monday and one of my aunts posted the info for the funeral and viewing on Facebook, since she's Facebook friends with my father he saw and then called me. I told him I didn't think it would be a good idea to come because my grandmother is taking it really hard. At that point I was trying to spare his feelings. Instead of listening to me he sends my grandmother a message on Facebook and said he really wanted to see my grandfather one last time but that I didn't think it was a good idea. 

She told him it was fine for him to come.....but I can promise you I'll hear about it for the rest of my life that my dad showed up. 

So short of writing him out of my life how do I make it crystal clear to my father that he is not to go against my wishes any longer? I understand a funeral is very different than friending someone on Facebook but it still goes against what I said and that is what I'm pissed about. I need to fix this now before it becomes worse. My husband and I do not have children right now but we are trying and I'm dreading the crap my father will pull while I'm pregnant or after we have a kid. This needs to be stopped now but I just don't know how to broach the subject and make sure EVERYONE including my husband is on the same page. ",31May2017,1
164,"I am currently dealing with a very persistent and quite pestering issue at my job. I have been working this temp job since late January this year. Everything went well for the first few months I'd say, during this time, I realized I had a lot of free time...like, literally, I would have hours free with no meaningful work to do. Some may say that's because I was new/still in training/etc. But honestly, my boss has personally told me that the woman who previously held my position FELL ASLEEP at her desk,..I fucking wonder why that is. So anyways, I really dig this new gig, I've got my own office, my own desk, computer, laptop, etc. It's nice, besides the massive downtime it gives me. Recently, I would say for the past month or so maybe, I have been given little talking-tos by my boss. I've made a few minor mistakes, nothing that costed the company or hurt the company in any way. Some mistakes were not even my fault, really. But every single time, my boss will call me into her office like I am the bad kid in the school, and she's the principal who's about to punish me. I feel like I'm never rewarded for anything I do, except for when she calls me into her office to tell me what I did wrong, example: ""This is your mistake, blah blah you did this wrong and this, this is alarming that you did this wrong, but I do see that you're doing well in this department, or you're improving in doing this thing correctly"". But I never get a ""good job"" really, it only happens very minimally. I honestly don't know how to fix this, and I can't lose this job or I'll just about fucking die probably. A lot of my errors are just me assuming/bending instructions for things/tasks or not asking the right questions I guess. I've really, supremely been trying to fix shit and be on my best behavior/doing things right always, but she (my boss) ALWAYS seems to find something to fault me on. Even if its minute as fuck. I don't know how I'm going to never make mistakes, that's just inhuman and I'm not OCD so I don't see how that's going to happen ever. I'm scared she's just going to have enough of my small mistakes and be like ""see ya bitch"". They have already cut my hours a few months ago because they didn't have enough work to give me, not because of my performance, (this was before errors popped up I guess) and now I'm not making hardly enough to pay for anything or save sufficiently. But my boss says she cannot justify giving me more hours (putting me fulltime which I had agreed to when I was fucking hired) unless she stops seeing mistakes. She says I have lack of detail. Please let me know if you've ever experienced a boss like this or what your solution is when you keep making small errors and don't know how to be perfect. ",31May2017,1

Last monday I was called by the Director of my department. He told me that he got another offer that he cannot refuse salary-wise and he wants to make me a new Director of our department.

I failed my first exam, but succeeded on the second try. i ended up driving an Opel Meriva of my mother, which i grew pretty comfortable with.

That Opel was a diesel and i drove another car for a few days which was benzine, that was totally different from me, i suddenly felt like i didn't know how to change gears etc, not to mention judging the car, control over it etc.. Just now, i drove another benzine car, and i felt insanely uncomfortable, shifting gears, also was scared to park, so i found a secluded place to try it out, even though i ended up being parked, it still doesn't go smooth (or as smooth as it should).

Some guys i hang out with (when i drove the Opel, which im more comfortable with) tell me i cant drive. Honestly, im ashamed of myself and feel like i dont deserve my license, always scared of making a fool out of myself, making an accident/hitting a pillar when parking due to lack of vision in the back etc...

Pros of Going: My employer would let me go on sabbatical for this so I could keep my job. My fiance is incredibly supportive and we even have our wedding planned for early next summer, before I'd leave. He has actually lived abroad twice; it would be cool to have stories of my own.

I've never even lived in another state, it would be good for me to challenge myself in this new way.

Cons of Going: I am perfectly settled - I love my fiance, I adore my house, I feel challenged and appreciated at my work; it's hard to disrupt all that. I'm getting older and delaying the start of our family until I'm in my 30's has me terrified I will be the cause of our babies to have health issues.

188,"So about 6 months ago, I got very drunk. Like around 18 shots of vodka in 2 hours drunk, the most I have ever had. While still drunk, my friend came over: Person A. 

For context, A has been into me for a long time. Even when I was with my girlfriend of 3 years, she tried to suck my dick very persistently, even suggesting she let me do it and just say she raped me. Eventually, a while after I broke up with my girlfriend we did eventually hook up, but another one of my friends, Person B, found out and was not happy with that. So I gave my word to B that I wouldn't ever be with A like that again.

While A was over at my house, she started making moves on me. Normally, I would have definitely stayed true to my word but being drunk, I think I remember being okay and trying to move forward with it. We ended up having sex while I was nearly black out drunk. Now, I am just coming to the realization that this is kinda pretty sketchy. Would this be considered rape?

I'm a pretty stoic guy, and I very rarely talk about my feelings... I'd much rather suppress them or whatever. But is this something I should talk about with my current girlfriend? I mean we are very busy people and rarely get any time alone together, is this something worth dragging us both down for?

191,"I moved in with a good friend of mine about a month ago, and I knew she was close with her parents but I didn't realize just how close. For reference, I'm 22 and she's 21, she's in college and has a job so she doesn't rely on them for financial stuff or anything. Her parents live about 4+ hours away.

When she first moved in, her father helped her move from her old place into our new place. He stayed for three nights in our new place, sleeping on a cot in her room. After he left, her mom came down and stayed for two nights with us, again on a cot in her room. During the day, her parents were often just ~there~ without her, hanging out in the common rooms.

It's been two weeks, and now my roommate just informed me that her mother is coming to stay with us AGAIN from Sunday through Wednesday. 

At her old house, her parents usually came to stay with her and her old roommates about once a month-- anywhere from 3-7 nights. Before we agreed to move in together, I explicitly told her I am not okay with her parents coming over that frequently.

I didn't have a good upbringing and do not have a functional relationship with my family, so parents make me really uncomfortable. I have social anxiety, and it's made really bad when I'm around families/parents/people I don't know well. She knows this because I've clearly told her.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Or have any advice on how to handle it? I've already told her that I don't want her parents over all the time because it makes me anxious, but she didn't even consult me or ask if it was okay for them to stay these times, she just informed me that they were coming. 

I feel like she needs to cut ties a little with her parents because she's 21 years old and living on her own. I don't see any reason why an adult woman needs her parents to drive 4+ hours once a month to spend a week just hanging out.

It makes me anxious enough that I've considered getting a hotel room, but I can't afford to do that and I also don't think I should be the one to do that-- all my other friends have their families get hotels when they visit, so I think it's kind of weird that her family sleeps with us, especially for that long of a time.

About a year and a half ago I was woken up to about 5 missed calls from unknown numbers. I started answering and everyone of them asked for ""Robert Dean"". I got about 30 calls that day. All from spam type companies, weird ""job offers"" with little info, and even ""college"" info related calls.
I asked for an email associated with this person, and it was just a bunch of random letters and numbers on a yahoo email. Tried emailing but it wasn't a real email account.

One search says the person is 60 something and lives in OK(this is new info I found today) the other says that they're 95 and live in TX. The TX address was a dead end as the house was vacant at the time

It's disappointing because these coworkers are everything you want in an employee: skilled, smart, friendly, honest, etc. Some of them tell me that they are actively looking for another job. The turnover isn't too horrible but almost everyone, even employees who left before I was hired, leaves because of the owner's personality. It's a pattern.

Hello Reddit, 
I've about given up all hope on resolving this issue on my own. So before I change my phone number, I wanted to reach out to the community for some advice.

I've had the same cell phone number for around 16 years. The first call I ever received for ""Robert"" (not my name) was 2-3 years ago. I remember because the voice on the other end of the line seemed very surprised that she had the wrong number. She called back again, apologized, and I never heard from her again. However, since that day I've slowly received an increasing amount of calls for this person.

About a year ago, the solicitations started. At first it was like 1 call a month. Nothing too annoying. The transaction went something like:

Recording: ""Hi, am I speaking with Robert?""

Me: ""No, I believe you have the wrong number""

Recording: ""Oh, well maybe you can help me. I'm blah blah with blah blah blah...""

And then I would hang up.

Then I started receiving calls once a week, then every day. Just recently I've started to receive text messages with links to fraudulent websites as well.

Currently, I'm receiving 5-6 calls a day and around the same amount of text messages. The advertisements never have an option to remove from list and the text messages never give me an option to ""STOP"" or unsubscribe.

I started digging around on my own and it seems like my phone number and this Robert guy have been popping up on some people/family finder searches. I've contacted these sites about removing this info and have not received responses from any of them.

I want to do something that helps people, however I don't think I could be a counsellor because I believe it would be quite difficult to see suffering everyday and the longing to fix people's problems would become very exhausting for me. 

I've always fantasized about things like owning a coffee shop or a store (there is a lot of fear of failure there). I've also fantasized about making furniture but that does not seem to have a large demand at the moment. 

I suppose my main question would be: at this point, is it still ok to start a bachelor's degree? Is it necessary? After many hours of research, it appears that many jobs or even many programs that interest me require at least a bachelors degree. I am afraid that since I have many interests I will change my mind. Is an online degree at a reputable university an ok way to go? Or should I stick to getting a couple college diplomas in something that I can see myself doing. 

I understand this is a very broad ask and that none of you actually know me. I just feel like I have done all the google searches that I can and soul searching. Just need some opinions. All are welcome. 
Thank you!

My dads work friend offered myself and my SO a job in October, an apartment at a cheaper rate and a company car. We both jumped at the offer

Fast forward 6 months into this ""dream"". I feel like everything's gone to shit. My SO and I are miserable. We hate the job, the boss (my dads work friend) is a terror at work. I actually flinch every time I see a White Car drive down the street because I'm worried he's coming into work. He treats people like crap when he's angry and expects people to put up with his shit. But we do. We have been. He's threatened to fire both myself and my SO on 2 separate occasions each! 

In any other circumstances we would be out the door already. But there are so many things tying us in. 
  1.  He's my fathers work friend and I don't want to disappoint my father and seem like a quitter
2. He's given us an apartment at a subsidised rate and I feel selfish if I leave considering that
3. He gave us a chance when no one else would
4. When he's in a good mood everything is fine! Work is good and when we see him out of work he is always so wonderful to us
5. We have ZERO experience. We both just finished university and getting a job is the hardest thing ever
6. He would be completely fucked at work if we left. We're 2 of 3 people in the office and leaving would cause a massive problem for him.

Right now, Starbucks seems like the best option, but as you should, I applied everywhere. I've only got an interview one place, at the drive-in theater in town. It's a job, yeah, but it's just that. Also, the hours aren't​ the best since I want to spend some nights with my friends before I have to go back to school. I've ""accepted"" the job there and I start Friday, however there's a 2 hour trial period where you shadow a current employee and then decide whether you actually want to work there after the 2 hours. 

I finally got something promising on Starbucks though, they're calling tomorrow to offer interviews around, and the manager was confident I'll be getting a call. 

I feel like I'd be a much better fit at Starbucks, and probably would like the work much more. I'm just at a loss of what to do. The manager that offered me a job at the drive-in said that she's had people quit after a day of work saying it's not what they expected, and she's not tolerating that anymore which led to the shadow period. If the Starbucks thing works out, that would be fantastic, but I'd probably get an interview from them this weekend, meaning I'd work at the drive-in for only a weekend or so.

259,"Malpractice lawyer(s) advice would be nice.

About a month ago I felt a numb, dull pain in my tooth. Knowing this familiar feeling I called my dentist and set up an appointment. Sure enough I needed a root canal on my lower left cuspid. While I was there during the first visit, the initial diagnoses I asked my dentist if smoking put me at risk for this. He told me no. Later that night I looked it up and sure enough it does. People who smoke are twice more likely than those that don't to need root canals. I didn't know this and of course upon hearing that it ""Didn't"" bought another pack, which I immediately threw away.

I still live at home and am currently on disabilities for PTSD - specifically medical trauma. And being lied to about that (as silly as it may sound) did trigger me. I've been seeing this dentist for nineteen years. You expect someone who's been working as long as he has to know whether smoking puts someone at risk for this shit. Then I began to get paranoid: ""Is he scamming me? Is he just stupid or does he tell everyone this in the hopes of getting his clientele to come back again and again."" This dentist doesn't take medicaid but the pain was so immense that I couldn't look for an alternative, on top of this I had finally saved up for a trip to meet someone for the first time and this was the last thing I needed, regardless I scheduled an appointment and figured okay, I'll just have to stretch my money a lot for the next several months.

I got my temporary filling and thankfully visited my friend with no pain. I got back a few days ago, ready to get this nightmare over with. A few hours ago, I went in and was supposed to have it finished. I went through the whole spiel again, getting numbed, poked and worked on for over an hour and a half. Because of my disability, I don't do well in these kinds of situations, I struggle immensely with something as simple as a root canal. I took a Valium and brought in my earbuds and let him go to work.

Something didn't feel right during the whole deal. He kept having to use the filer (the tool used to clear the root out.) Upon 'finishing' I pulled out my hear earbuds and was met with. ""Sorry, I just couldn't manage to get that root cleared out. I tried and tried but nope. So, I'm going to send you to a specialist who will do it fast and do it right."" I thought he was joking, I really did... No, he wasn't. 

I looked him up when I got home, he specializes in dentistry. Why didn't he send me to an endodontist? I still have no idea but my paranoid mind is running with all sorts of reasons why. Oh, and the cherry on top of the proverbial shit cake this is turning into: He's wanting to send me/refer me to someone who doesn't take medicaid. So not only do I most likely have to pay for his shitty craftsmanship, now I have the dreaded weight of another payment on my shoulders. I was planning another trip down to visit my friend. That is now out the window. I have been triggered yet again by an incompetent oaf. This sets me back more than you'll ever know.

Are there resources/advisors that guide you through the process of preparing and applying? I'm finding that I'm craving some structure for this process. 

I really, really want to get my Ph.D. in English. For a long time I wanted to be a doctor, but sort of gave up on it and lost interest in the content. I truly enjoy writing papers. This past semester it even got to the point that writing felt like a drug to me (may have been the caffeine).

TL;DR: Very strong in English, but weak in other courses which damages my GPA. No idea who to talk to for planning/prep/application. Please, please help. 

This is my dream and I'm afraid that my GPA has damaged my chances of getting into a good grad school, which means that my earning potential will diminish.",31May2017,1
271,"I'm 24 year old male i work as a security guard and have been for the past 2 years after i dropped out of university, its not a bad job but its so inconsistent i am on a 0 hour contract which basically meaning having to work 12 hour shifts whenever i can to make enough money until the next job (paycheck to paycheck). I've also gained something upwards of 30 kg of weight because doing this job has made me lead a sedentary lifestyle.

I have been thinking allot about what i wanted when i dropped out. I'm a half decent artist (I'm still refining my skills) I've never not had a pencil or pen and a sketchbook within arms reach.

I love comic books (what i mostly draw) i know that i could become a inking artist as a way to get into the industry, but id still be in the same position, id have to work project to project and since i basically have no experience i wouldn't be getting allot of work to start off, on the off hand that would free up like 50% of my day to self study and refine my penciling and sketching skills. As a hobby i have been slowly drawing/writing a story which has compiled allot of pages, i am constantly writing and adding to this, i would love for it to someday be a real comic book someday.

OR

I could start a tattoo apprenticeship and use my current ability to start tattooing at least that way id be working a 9 to 5 almost, and earning more although id have to do an apprenticeship and i most likely will not be being paid allot at first. Id be drawing constantly though, which would help me refine my art skills. i have to point out that I currently don't have a single tattoo, and i think that also makes things difficult (am i wrong? would love to know) i will have to apply for an apprenticeship and show them a portfolio which would mean id have to spend some time drawing tattoo art style portfolio. I've already selected the tattoo parlor/shop ? i want to do at if this is the path i'm going down.  

this is my Instagram, these are all really just a random assortment of drawings/designs and exercises i have posted about so judge how you will.

272,"My girlfriend feels like she would be indebted to my mom for helping her with her bills.  She has a huge ER bill that needs paying off, student loan debt, and dental bills, and a monthly car payment she can barely afford.  My mom even gave her the loan for her car because she just wanted to help when her own father wouldn't help her.  My mom is a generous lady, not rich by any means, but feels compelled to help.  My mother gets great joy out of helping others and has done so for me many times when I didn't ask for it.  I understand that there is a pride issue here on my girlfriend's side where she doesn't want to feel like a charity case.  No one wants to feel like they can't get out of the hole, but I told her that any little bit helps to increase the ability to get out of debt.  I have to pay our rent because all of her wages basically go to paying her bills and pitching in for food etc.  So by her not wanting to accept money it really prolongs the situation of me having to pay for a considerable amount of things.  She comes from a family where she isn't used to being helped, and her father is an ass and hasn't done shit for her, which I believe has led her to feel like she can't accept help.  How do I explain to her that it's ok to receive help sometimes without making it seem like she's just being prideful? Or maybe I'm not seeing something I should? Any advice would be great!  Thanks!",31May2017,1
273,"I sent the following message to my local police department's Facebook DM's just now, and I figured I'd try this as well. Please excuse the possibly off topic post, there isn't a subreddit for this situation. 

(I reworded it so as to not give away any personal information.)

""This isn't an emergency, but I'm looking for advice. Bare with me, it's kind of weird. 

I live in an apartment complex, and it sounds like my upstairs neighbors are following me as I'm walking through my apartment. I'm not a paranoid person, but it has me creeped out. It's been happening for about a year now, and I believe I'm not going crazy. At first I thought it might just be the building making noises, as buildings do sometimes. I've heard them walking while I'm not walking, I've heard them hurry up to catch up to me while I walk to the bathroom, the kitchen, my son's room, and my own room. Sometimes I stop mid-walk to see what will happen and they take one or two steps after I do, and then stop. Admittedly, sometimes I get creeped out enough to stop, bang on the wall once or twice and they either stop for an hour or two, or slowly walk into the other room trying to be quiet.

At this point, there's no way this could be a coincidence. Is it a kid? A pet? A grown man or woman who literally follows me throughout my home? Is it out of curiosity, boredom, or am I being stalked? I'm basically a stay-at-home dad right now, and they do it all hours of the day. Every once in awhile (I think when they've left their apartment) I don't hear anything. 

I haven't approached them or the main office about it, as to not seem crazy, have them deny it, or be completely wrong, but I can't take it anymore. I want to know why they're doing it. What do you recommend I do about my situation?""

Please help, I can't stop thinking about it. I briefly mentioned it to my wife awhile back, but I don't want to creep her out either, so I try to not mention it.",31May2017,1
275,"After being lonely for a long time, I've finally started to make mom friends in my area. The issue is that they have started inviting me to lots of MLM sales parties. Is there a way to politely refuse all of these invites without alienating these other women? I have a chip on my shoulder about MLMs and won't give any money to that type of company. ",31May2017,2
277,"Hi there! This is my first ever Reddit post so thanks for taking a look.

Here's the rundown of my situation: I graduated high school as one of the best in my class and went to school at an expensive private University on the east coast because I had good grades, and really awesome extracurricular experiences, etc. so I was basically going for free.

My first semester I did well and got a 3.5 GPA, but after winter break and the start of my second semester things went downhill very quickly (I've since realized this was my first bout with bipolar disorder) and I was forced to withdraw, gave up my scholarship, and moved back home to Nebraska to start again and attend school at a local university​ in Omaha (paying out of pocket now). In the middle of my first semester in Omaha some pretty horrific family problems came to light (sexual abuse of one of my siblings by an older family member when we were young) and I got a 2.3 GPA and got put on academic probation. My second semester went much better (I made the Dean's list) but unfortunately, literally the weekend after the spring semester ended there was a suicide in my family (related to the incident of sexual abuse).

Subsequently​, I ended up withdrawing from the next TWO semesters I attempted, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (which is the reason I did so damn bad those two semesters), and have since struggled with even being able to hold down a job.

I'm now 15k in debt for student loans, and I owe like 5k in mental health bills from being in and out of the hospital due to my bipolar/suicidal issues.

It's now summer, I've got a job at a call center making $11/hr plus I get paid to go to to drill once per month as a member of the Army Reserve (been in since high school).

Basically, I need advice about whether I should try going back to school yet again even though I'm already so deep in debt and I'm not really sure what I want to do.

I'm open to going to a community college or to do some sort of apprenticeship program to get into the trades. It's a far cry from the private school I was at so long ago, but my life experiences have humbled me immensely and really all I want is to be able to support myself.

The good news is in the last few weeks my mental health has improved drastically. It's been just over a year since the suicide and it finally feels like I've decided I want to live and be happy and move on from everything to start a new life.

I just need any ideas or advice or feedback people might have for ways I can try to dig myself out of this mess.

If I could find a way to go back to school either here in Omaha or back east again I would but I can barely cover rent at this point, not to mention I've lost most of my confidence in my academic ability and I'm still very unsure of what I want to do career wise. Plus I feel like no school will admit me if I've got 3 withdrawn semesters and a weak GPA on my transcript.

Again, any ideas would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to ask me questions if you need more details. Thanks Reddit.

TLDR: Used to go to a prestigious private school, bad shit happened, transferred, went crazy, withdrew from all classes in 3 separate semesters, now have 15k in student loans and 5k in medical debt.

How can I get back in college, or at least what are viable career paths I could take that I could at least be able to support myself with?",31May2017,2
278,"I’m a female student at a major US university, majoring in computer science. My first week at my software development internship was going great, until Thursday. When I walked into my cubicle that morning, there was a note left under my keyboard in a place that only someone sitting down could see it. The note was written in capital letters in pen, and said “JUST IN CASE YOU’RE CURIOUS” followed by a hyperlink to a fetish website. It also said to join a group that is the same as the (relatively unusual) name of a kink group on my university’s campus. 

When I found this note I was afraid and shocked. Not only that someone would have the audacity to invite me to a sexual fetish group at work, but also that they would be creepy enough to do it by anonymously sneaking into my cubicle. For the rest of the day I tried to put it out of my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I decided that I would figure out whoever did this so I can stop it in the future.

However, there are some problems: a lot of people in my office have gone to my university. In addition, I had just been introduced to the whole office along with the other interns at a big meeting, so everyone in the workplace knows who I am and where I go to school. I’m the only female intern and the office overall is about 80 to 90% male, so I’m an easy target with many possible suspects. I’ve tried researching the fetish group but they (for obvious reasons) have no membership roster or publicity information except for trying to get people to come to meetings. My internet research did not yield much, and thinking about this situation was making me anxious. On Friday afternoon, I resorted to an old family tradition to ward off bad luck (ayin hara/evil eye) and drew a round eye on some notebook paper and stuck it where the note had been. (I am not usually superstitious but I was kind of freaked out bc I still didn’t know what was going on.)

When I came back to work on Tuesday, there was a question mark drawn on the backside of the little eye. So someone (presumably the same person?) snuck into my cubicle again…At this point, I don’t know what to do. I want to figure out who is doing this so I can avoid being around them. Though I do feel harassed, I don’t want to take it to management and become a problem my second week on the job. I haven’t told anyone about this, I have saved both the first note and the eye drawing, I have not visited the hyperlink yet and I still haven’t talked to many people around the office so that’s where I’m at. 

If you have any tips on how to figure out what’s going on/who’s responsible, if this is harassment or I’m overreacting, what course of action I should follow, or if you have been in a similar situation, please give some advice because this is a really weird way to start my internship.",31May2017,3
