0,"Hello everyone!

So I've been thinking over about the past 6 months of getting a cockatiel as soon as I am able (current rental home has a no pet policy). I've done my research fairly intensively and understand the basics of them, but one thing I never like about all these articles I read about ""Consider this before buying one"" is they don't feel genuine. As in, actual owners of animals usually have advice to offer that these articles do not. I believe I have decided on getting a young, male Cockatiel, as I want him to be around for the long haul. I've also decided to keep him outside of a cage as much as I can or he wants (I've also heard they like to keep to their cages as it's their safe spot). Finally, I think what I am most conflicted, and confused on, is ""clipping"". I assume it refers to the feathers on their wings and messes with their ability to fly. Is there a reason to do this if I'm going to keep him inside and plan on letting him have free roam? Any other advice you guys can offer up not pertaining to anything I've mentioned?

Thanks to everyone in advanced!",22Mar2017,2
2,"I'm 18, finishing my first year of college and hoping to move off campus. I put myself through school and don't currently have a job, but I have $2000 saved. Is it a terrible idea for me to rent a place where my rent would be 300-400 with 3 roommates? 
Edit: I'm going into my second year of college and have already lived on campus a year. If I stay on campus I will owe the university $1000 out of pocket a semester.

3,"My fiance is a medium to low functioning alcoholic. She has a 5 y/o daughter whom I've helped raise for 3 years. She calls me dad and is very much my daughter (bio-dad is 100% out of the picture).

I just got off work and she is passed out on the couch. Our daughter has been watching cartoons by herself for 2 hours. We are posed to move to FL in a few months (close to her family but away from mine) this may be a great time to break it off. She is a very aggressive and hurtful drunk. She has thrown my engagement ring back at me multiple times (when wasted). She refuses to help me clean or do any house chores. I'm just spent.

Here's the thing: I can't lose my daughter. 

Whenever I confront her about her drinking she gets super defensive and deflects to what I'm doing wrong.

If we break up, I may never see my daughter again. 

All insights are appreciated.",22Mar2017,2
4,"Not sure if this is the right sub to post to, but I didn't really know anything else.

So, there are some things that I should clear out of the way first to make this easier to understand. The first is that I am a minor. Just to clear things that I can't use a credit card, drive etc. The second is that the school I attend offers a 1:1 iPad program. The insurance policy works like this: the first offense (breakage) if covered for free. The second is $50 and the third is $100 and anything beyond that is covered by a third party charging upwards of $350. 

I was on my third iPad, due to shattering the screen (I'm irresponsible; I'm sorry). That would mean that if it broke, it would cost $100. However, during PARCC testing, I reached audio test to find that the headphone jack is not working. It physically rejects all headphones because of the size of the port. No big deal, I use a computer. I go home and plug in my own headphones and the same thing happens. It is sprung out. Hmm. Something weird is up. The next day (yesterday), I go and check it out with the tech department. They confirm the jack is broken. Today, I was sent to pick up the replacement and they said that they would send the bill to my parents. 

Now, this is the part where I am confused. The **school** was the one who gave me the broken iPad. I did not break it. Is it okay for them to charge me even though I didn't break it? I don't want to sound whiny, but this doesn't sound right. **THEY** provided me with the bad iPad. Why should we pay for that? 

This was ranty, and I apologize, but I would like a straight answer: Can they do this?",22Mar2017,1
6,"Hello all,

I am 18, and in my second semester of college. So far, my experience has been pretty poor. Not in grades and such, I have a little over a 3.5 right now. But I am just not sure if this is the route I should take. College was automatically my choice when I graduated, and everyone told me I should go, but now I am not sure. I have changed my major four times already (yes, I know) and none of the degrees have been anything I have been truly interested in. Between each major change, I have always considered dropping, and taking up a trade (specifically welding. It has interested me, but I don't know if I would be any good). 

My biggest concern is job security, salary, etc., and whether or not I truly want this, or if I am trying to find an escape. If this is really vague, just ask for details you may need. I tried to keep it as compact as possible while keeping all the information I think might be needed.

Thank you so much for your advice.",22Mar2017,1

14,"My fianc√© and I spent quite a few dollars(4 figures) on a dining room table and chairs from a local mom and pop retailer. When we received the large mahogany table and chairs i found a few issues and immediately contacted the business to request a replacement. I was promised, via phone and text that they would order a replacement and have it to me within a few weeks. It has now been over 4 months and every week i reach out to the owner and every week he has an excuse. 

This week, i finally had it and called him out on his BS and told him I wanted a replacement or i wanted a refund for the entire set which i would return. He responded with ""Its not an excuse"" and proceeded to give another excuse.

I spend the day waiting to go home and make my 30min commute in horrible traffic. Once I get home I'll eat, if I feel like it, and then wait until I can go to bed and start the whole process over again. I hate it.

* She likes musicals (and film-making in general) and would listen to songs from The Wicked on Spotify everyday.
* She's also into photography, though I think getting her camera lenses would be waaayyyyy expensive.
* She is a dog person and love pugs, and it is her favorite dog breed. * She also likes dark chocolate but I already gave her that for Valentines.
* Though, she's not the type of person who reads. There's one book that she reads and that is on film-making, but that's it.
* She's trying out to be a scriptwriter for our university's annual musical next year.

23,"so this may be long winded and grammatically incorrect but it's emotionally very complex for me. I'll start out by saying since I work in a restaurant and hide most of my life from my parents. Well... big portions of my life. I am a college student who wants to leave home due to a very conservative and constrictive home. I cannot tell them I'm dating someone much older than me (even though my parents are a decade apart and around my age when the younger married) because they would not approve of us not being of the same religious background (I am a christian and he is not but personally it hasn't been an issue between the two of us)
Today is our 6th month anniversary
We want to move out together
First of all I wanted to move out before meeting him due a extreme mother. For example on Sunday as I was getting ready for work she got mad at me for shoes I wore out a few days before and they had collected dirt so she was ""over this family"". She doesn't let me dye or do anything with my hair due to some of it falling out around 3/4 years ago (has since regrown. it's how my body deals with extreme stress and not uncommon in people). Whenever I hang out I do so when she's gone. Last time she discovered I was out without her knowing (she was at work) she went off for about an hour and when I began to cry (I'm sensitive to people yelling at me) she angrily asked ""why are you crying!?""
Now I've been reading signs of emotional abuse and am tempted to qualify her as such since I believe she does the whole gas-lighting thing and she never acknowledges her mistakes and when I try to tell her how she effects me she ignores me, cries, and turns it all around and makes herself a victim. My entire family (bro, dad, me) always bend to her will because she's impossible. I don't believe she will accept my career or life choices probably saying I'm liking myself more to the devil than God because i would date someone outside my religion and move in with them (though we do honestly plan to marry within the year hopefully)
A very common instance of my mom's behavior: in the car, let's say we forgot milk, she'll freak out and blame us for not reminding her even if she's the only one who knew we were out and say how no one helps her, she's the only one who does anything, and is sick of us. She texted my dad nasty hurtful things because he didn't agree with her
I know my family would freak out that I dont share all their points of view in life but I'm also getting over sacrificing my happiness for her and them (if they knew i was on birth control they'd freak and tell me I'm evil p sure)
she has anxiety and uses it against us often which i empathize with but am also getting over her not wanting to help herself and using it as a shield against everything else
there's proabbly more but i've lived this way so long im not sure whats normal... (lol like spportive parents what? that let u make choices?)
I'm scared they'll find this somehow.
I guess this was a venting post but I'm trying to work up the strength and courage to leave
soon i should have a car (which I'm scared I'll need a cosigner for because they'll use it against me)...
but i also dont want to hurt them... but i want to be happy too
and my partner makes me happy. it hurts they'll never approve. i dont even know why im posting this anymore

24,"I replied to a few personal ads on CL.

These messages all said 'sent from my iphone' at the end. They were all sent within ten minutes of each other (hours after my initial email). They all had practically the same wording. The ads I replied to were all very different, differently worded and seemed legit. But it seems like the replies were all sent by the same person. What's going on here? I know 'send a pic' is a common request but the similarities went beyond that (sent within minutes of each other, all from iPhones, and one sentence long with 'how are you doing'.) Its a red flag.

It is not always like this, but I feel if I confronted him on this he would laugh and say something along the lines of ""I am just joking around, no need to be a pussy about it."" And even if I do say something, some (certainly not all) people even go with it in attempt to look cool around each other or just make fun of me for the laughs. I can't just avoid him because the town I live in is super small and we enjoy a lot of the same things that require going to places where we would see each other. Any advice helps.",22Mar2017,2

I'm a senior Communciation Studies major in a small school in the Midwest, and it's time for me to start looking for a real job and contributing to society. My issue: I resent my major. I don't enjoy public speaking, but I'm good at writing. I don't enjoy writing though, it always feels forced to me, probably because I have a perfectionist mindset and feel my writing will never be good enough. I did a summer internship working at an advertising agency, and I told everyone that it was a great experience and I learned a lot, but in reality I would sit at a desk for 5 hours and try not to fall asleep. I had limited social interaction day-to-day; sure there was people in the office, but they had actual work to do and didn't have time to entertain the intern.

I am currently in a long distance relationship with a girl from England. Due to the timezone difference (I'm in New Zealand) She is about 13 hours behind me. 

I had to go to sleep one night and she wanted someone to talk to during her lunch break as her friend was not with her that day. So she looks on Facebook and sees my best friend is online, so she messages him for a talk (this is at 2am for me and him). 

They start talking normally for a wee while and then he mentions something sexual, so naturally the conversation turns to that. I have no problem with that. As it keeps going he starts making 'jokes' about having a threesome. She laughs and says no. It continues along this path for a wee while until he says something along the lines of ""its probably good that we dont, cause id just end up hogging you"".

Girlfriend (being the good person she is) starts taking screenshots at this point to show me when I wake up. She stops responding in a way that could continue the conversation. He continues this for a few minutes and then says that he needs to sleep. The conversation ends with him saying ""this stays just between us, ok? ;)"".

Its pissed me off unbelievably. I want to bring it up to him and see what he says. I just dont know how to...

48,"Recently turned 18, senior in high school. High school is wrapping up okay, but I'm a massive procrastinator and I KNOW if I don't change my habits I'll suffer in college. Just doing homework is a chore. A lot of my work is online, but if I turn on my computer I immediately get distracted and wast  hours talking to friends, getting a few problems or sentences done in between. Even when it's not online, if I ever need to look something up on my phone I lose track of what I'm doing. I only get work done in school during lunch or a study hall. When night comes, the painful realization that I'd never done anything sets in and I tell myself ""I promise I'll change tomorrow"" or ""I'll put in some effort tomorrow, this'll be where things change"". Come tomorrow and the cycle repeats itself. This doesn't just apply to homework - there are many things I need to do (some things I WANT to do) that I'm too lazy to do. I know I need to them however, but I find myself occupied with simple in-the-moment pleasures, like browsing this web and messaging my friends. I've been struggling with this so long now and I'd prefer not to be forced to change. I want to change things now before I crash and burn and am forced to change my mindset through consequence.

49,"So about three months ago I was out for my midnight smoke when a man in his early 20s comes up and asks me to borrow my cell to make a call. He gave me bad vibes but I decided to let him because I was in a rather public place (in front of a restaurant) and felt a could outrun him. Anyways, after he returns the phone I start receiving really pissed off texts in response to the call and I try to explain that I'm just some random guy, but I'm polite and ask what's the matter.

Turns out it was is his [ex]wife and we started talking and I found out that he has been beating her and stealing her things for years now. They have 3 kids together but he doesn't let her see them ever. We actually had some things in common that we spoke about and I gave her a ride to work a few times. We're certainly not besties by any means, but I don't really like the situation regardless.

Apparently it got worse since I started talking to her because he assumed that we were having sex. He took her phone and tried texting me (posing as her) to figure out where I work and live before breaking it. He blackened both her eyes, strangled her, covered her in bruises and welts, probably some cracked ribs if I had to guess. He has also come up and threatened me on the street (I think he's mostly a punk kid, but I think it unwise to press my luck), and claimed to have ""beat the shit out of me"". 

Thing is in a big way she is the one letting him stay in her life at this point, and when asking her about that matter she claims that he has gotten a lot better in the last couple years. I don't know that there is anything I could actually do to help her if it is not something she would be welcoming to or interested in. He has cut of her communication with anybody else, made her unable to work (from injuries), and yet she still doesn't remove him from her life. It feels like in a way she has been hopelessly gas lighted.

additional info: According to her, he has outstanding arrest warrants. She also apparently has a restraining order against him, although she seems to not be utilizing it. The guy seems to be a couch surfer and has no job, so there is no way to know where he is at a given moment

54,"A little background first - I'm a high school senior who lives at home. About a week ago I was grounded, and consequently am not allowed to go to a concert with friends this Friday as planned. However, I'd already bought my $50 tickets weeks beforehand and am very much inclined to go anyways. This is where it gets tricky.

I've snuck out of my house before, but always on school nights and never for more than an hour. In each case it has occurred when I am working on homework downstairs at a late enough hour that my parents are fast asleep and wouldn't hear the door open. This time, however, this will not be an option as the concert is on a Friday and it would seem rather odd to my parents that I am working late instead of simply finishing my work on Saturday. 

My current plan is this: In the few days preceding the concert I am going to drop hints of illness i.e. ""my throat hurts"" or ""I don't feel so well"". I will go to bed early on Friday and then, once my parents are asleep, hopefully early, I will exit through my window, walk down the roof, and jump to the porch. My only concern is the potential noise when landing on the porch, but that can be rectified by removing my shoes. 

REENTERING is my absolute main concern. I cannot simply go through the front door, as it would set off the house alarm and my parents would hear me moving and be up in a flash. The ""I wanted a glass of water"" excuse would NOT fly with my parents. My only options at this point seem to be a ladder or somesuch device. The space between the roof and the porch is about 6 feet, and I don't have the upper body strength to pull myself up alone. 

Please help!! Just trying to rage :)",22Mar2017,1
56,"I originally told earlier parts of this story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5jlm06/how_can_i_help_my_neighbor_with_his_alcoholism/)

Ben, my retired veteran neighbor, has not improved... He feeds my medium sized dog large dog treats CONSTANTLY when I put him in my backyard. It has gotten to the point that when I put him out he runs to the corner of the yard and barks and barks and barks because he knows Ben will feed him... It's Pavlovian at this point... He limps over to the fence and gives him one, then goes back to the house and gets another. Until he has had five or more, or until I call my dog inside.
I've asked Ben not to feed him but he never remembers because he is always so drunk. Red faced, slurring his words, always saying the same thing. 

""Well he always eats them because he is hungry!""

I've tried to explain why this logic is flawed but he never seems to remember. 
I know he means well, but it is driving me NUTS! My dog used to go out and run around, hang out on the patio, do backyard dog things... now he just goes straight to the fence and barks. 

Besides that he is getting weirder. Every time I slide open my glass door he comes outside. The way our porches are, when he stands on his porch he is at chest level with my privacy fence. 

I told him once if he had been drinking I didn't want to talk to him because I don't condone him doing that to himself or his elderly wife. Ever since then he always says ""I quit drinking for you,"" but that obviously isn't true. 

Two weeks ago his wife found him outside my locked backyard fence, whether his back gave out or he was too drunk I don't know... probably both. Ambulance was called, after he got home nothing changed.

Tonight I walked out to get my mail around 7 and when I turned around he was leaning on my house. I must have walked right past him! He said 
""Hey how ya doing?"" 
I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw him. I asked him what's up and he said ""I was just thinking about you... how you need somebody looking after you.""

WTFUCK DOES THAT MEAN? I didn't say anything, I just walked inside and locked my door.

I used to be conversational with him. But he always leads the conversation to getting inside my house with me. Always when I'm home alone. He always tries to touch me too. Please read my previous post about past antics and my interactions with his wife.

How can I get him to stop feeding my dog?
How can I get him help?
How can I discourage his creepy behavior?

She can be very sweet and cares a lot about me, but she's also loud, immature, irrational, and just not the kind of person I can spend time with without dreading it. It feels like I never have the room to say anything about my personal life when she and I talk, unless I'm in a crisis. 
I feel terrible thinking about ending our friendship, because she's never done anything WRONG to me, and she's been there for me in the past. However, I think a big part of maturely maintaining friendships is realizing that compatibility matters. Would you walk away from this if you were me?

60,"I'm gonna make this as short as possible, I tend to overwrite sometimes.

I've been graduated from high school for 7 years now. The first two and a half years after HS I was in college and (essentially) got my associates degree (I have enough credits, just never applied for it). I then dropped out for 4 years because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I floated around ideas of medical school, psychology major, but nothing really felt super right, and most of the people going into those programs seemed way more enthusiastic about it than I did, so I didn't do it.

I had the grades for it, graduated with a good GPA, high-ish ACT score, etc. Anyway, my point is is that I'm smart enough to do (within certain boundaries of course), but I just can't decide what to do.

I went back to school in Fall of 2016 taking 3 online classes, and again this semester taking 2 classes. I can't even handle doing these two. Not because they're super hard, but because I hate it. I went back to school to get a business degree. I told myself I didn't want to end up like some of my older friends that don't seem to have any long term jobs, I was sick of working in call centers, etc. I figured a business degree is the most broad degree I can get that will basically open up the doors for jobs that just require a bachelors.

But I hate it, I hate business. The only things I'm really into are things that I either don't think would be useful degrees, or I don't want to do as a career.  I argue about politics a lot. It's a bad habit, I'm really just saying that I'm interested in politics. I love movies/TV shows. I really liked a class I took that was about life in the universe, basically just space+biology. I like philosophy, and history too.  I'm not passionate about anything really useful, tho.

The advice I'm looking for is basically....what should I do? I'm not passionate about anything, so i at the very least, want to get a job that will provide me with a decent lifestyle moneywise, that I won't hate.

Any ideas?",22Mar2017,2

I took less than 10 minutes from the second I parked there to when I got back to my car. 
When I got back, I noticed a person taking pictures of my vehicle. When I confronted the man, he asked me if it was my car, and told me I needed a sticker(?) to park there.

67,"I joined a college program on a fast track (9 months to complete a two year course) and one of the requirements to write the federal exams is to have 90% attendance each semester.

I have bad luck with illness. I suffer from terrible migraines which ruin me for 24-48 hours. They don't happen that often but I get a one or two a month. Caught a stomach bug and most recently got food poisoning. 

These combined events have totalled 9 missed days of school this semester. There are school 64 days in a semester giving me 86% attendance pending I don't miss any more class.

I have doctors notes excusing me for these instances; however, here's where things get stressful. How much impact these notes will have on my taking of the government exam depends on how lenient the proctor is. I could have all these doctors notes and he can say ""nah fuck you"" and I'm screwed.

I'm really stressed and I'm not sure what I can do in this situation. I'm sure I could have roughed it out with a stomach bug and maybe even the food poisoning but the five days due to migraines was unavoidable.

69,"To give a little bit of back story about this post, growing up, I loved art. Everywhere I went, I drew drawings of anime characters or mythical beings I thought were cool. I loved going to art galleries and being entranced in other people's works. I didn't like to read however I loved poetry, and with being drawn to made-up things, of course, I was naturally drawn to video games (as many kids are) but to games such as Fable, World of Warcraft, The Witcher series, and not to FPS type games. I was a creative bundle of joy and wanted to share that with the world.

Fast forward to high school in a military town, art was laughed at. My high-school only offered a cinematography (whatever it's called where you study movies and learn about their time frame and stuff) class and an art class, that was done by an art teacher that never came to school sober and hated his job (he made it blatantly obvious). I took this class (easy credit, plus I liked art) and didn't mind it; however, I didn't particularly care for it. My life took an interesting turn (and I still wish to this damn day he didn't say anything) when I turned in my final exam for his class (had to write a plot for a movie we would create) my cinematography teacher leaned over and put his hand on my left shoulder, and asked me to talk to him. When I agreed to do so (I was scared because I thought I did something wrong) he asked me if I legitimately came up with the plot I turned in. To my astonishment, I quickly said yes, I completed it last night (I was a BAD procrastinator) and didn't have time to fully come up with something great. He said that, that was the best plot paper that was turned into him, and that it was truly great; however, he could only give me a 99 and not a 100 because of a spelling error (which I couldn't care less for, I just wanted a grade). Like I stated earlier for some strange reason, that interaction had a strange impact on me.

 Sinking into my depression era (girl troubles, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, didn't want to do the military thing) I found comfort in video games. This was when I started to realize I had a deep interest in video games (having built my own gaming desktop, owning multiple consoles, etc) and pursued computer science as a possible career path. 

Fast forward to the local community college era, I hate school still. Dad pushes me to pursue college education which I have no drive to do, thousands of dollars wasted on me (failed the classes) so I'm feeling like a failure. I realize I don't like to code after having my heart set on it, so now I'm lost. Going from petty job to petty job, I get my girlfriend pregnant.

Faced with a life-changing decision to make, I either give into the military or pursue law enforcement (which I kinda had an interest in because I wanted to be a detective) so I pursue law enforcement. A year going through the local police academy and struggling to find a place of hire that'll accept my prior drug use (I indulged in marijuana in high school with friends here and there) I found a place to hire me.

Everybody there is friendly towards me, it's like a brotherhood. I found a place that'll accept me, a job that'll give myself and my family a future, and benefits for when I fall ill. Everything is great until my days off hit me.

At night I feel lost like I don't want to go back and work my five day work week, 12 hours night shifts. Everything I worked so hard for I feel out of grip with. When I'm in my uniform and working I'm happy, but when it comes to alone time, I often ponder other possibilities.

Where would I be if I pursued a career in cinema, became an actor or movie producer and showed my true artistic colors and feel free? Would I feel free from the chains that bind me, how would I pursue something like that without going 50 grand in debt, without a local accredited school that offers classes that teach something like that, without friends that would accompany me that I could turn to for comfort, with a father who's happy his son is a police officer and has a bright future for his family?

I often find myself drifting towards creativity, where I feel like I could create special things but I'm lost. I got what I wanted, but for some reason, I feel like it wasn't what I truly wanted and now I don't know what to do.

Please, Redditors, give me advice and help me, I desperately need it!

-TLDR- Growing up I loved art. I found myself in video games, movies, poetry. A teacher said something to me that changed my life. I became a police officer after many failed attempts at college because of pressure, both from my father and from my inner self, wanting to give my girlfriend and daughter a future. Now that I'm a police officer I feel that I didn't get what I truly wanted, and now I'm lost.",22Mar2017,1
70,"Even though I got a deep voice, I'm not so confident with it. It seems it's the first thing people talk about. I'm 20 but for the past 5 years my voice has been extremely deep and everyone just goes ""Wow your voice is so deep, you should work for the radio."" or ""I love how deep your voice is. You should become a voice actor!"" To be honest it weirds me out and frustrates me since that's all people only say. It probably doesn't help that I'm not the most social as well besides with who I'm super comfortable with; and that only applies half of the time. Another reason I'm not the most confident with my voice is that it is unintentionally monotone. It's unusual to force emotion into my voice so half of the time I don't try. I move around but doesn't amplify that emotion to a significant degree. It's tough for me to force that into my speech even when I try to act surprised or enthused it sounds fake even though in trying so hard to sound the least monotone and boring as possible. I don't sound like a robot though but I want to get a bit more tone into it so I don't sound so boring, have people continuing to repeat myself or being asked if I'm not feeling well.

76,"My best friend for pretty much half my life got in a fight. And as hard it is to admit pretty much everything is my fault. He was mad but apparently ready to forgive me.

quick context: Were in high school, and he had dated this girl but it was short and not great. They were friends afterwords tho. He later encouraged me to have sex with her as i was going through a dry spell. He even tried to convince her. Eventually she texted me  because she wanted to. i told him and made sure he didn't have a problem with it. We did the next day, and afterwords we find out he hadn't really been okay with it, he didn't say because he wanted me to hook up. He wasn't mad about that, but he was in a bad place and that caused it to turn into fight.

Anyway, it got bad and and was feeling terrible as everything was pretty much me being shitty in the past. He didn't want me to talk to her for now tho he didn't straight up say that i knew he didn't want that. But the thought of losing him as a friend put me into a terrible place. I needed someone to talk to and she texted me later that night to see if i was okay. i knew i shouldn't but i ended up talking to her for a bit anyway. 

He found out and was not happy. i wasn't hiding it he asked and i told him. Just now i don't know whats going to happen. He says he feels like he cant trust me and a bunch of other shit. I have no idea how to fix this.

I don't know what to do, I cant lose him, i fucked up because most of the stuff wasn't to big a deal anymore and he was ready to forgive me. But talking to her just ruined everything. I don't know what to do anymore. neither of us want the friendship to end but its not just gonna go back to normal. I don't know how to deal with this, and i'm freaking out. I skipped school and practice today. i cant skip again tomorrow. But i don't have the energy or mental state to keep up with life. 

He is such a big part of my life i legit don't know what life would be like without him. He's been my best friend for years and everyone who knows us knows us as those two guys who are always together. He gets me like no one else does. If i lost him, i might actually kill myself. I mean i cant actually imagine myself doing that but i just have no idea of anything in my life without him. And i know how ridiculous that must sound, all of this. I'm in such a dark place rn.

Unfortunately out of all days I had forgotten my phone today! We had a time limit set of when he'd come looking for me if I didn't text him upon returning home. I pull up to the one station that stays open all night with a worker inside just to feel a bit more secure- I was already extremely uncomfortable because not only was it late, but I had pj shorts on, a t-shirt, messy hair and makeup, NO phone, etc- already at a low confidence,vulnerable state of mind. Get out to pump gas and a man starts walking slowly up to me wearing baggy pants,oversized hoodie, and beanie calling out ""hey baby"" in a slow manor. He said he had something to ask me and I guess he saw how nervous I looked (because I sure felt it) because he then reached in his pockets and said ""I ain't got no weapon"" (well thanks for that while you KEEP your hands hidden in your pockets). When his slow words finally came to a stop I processed that apparently all he wanted was cigarettes, and I quickly said just let me pump my gas first. He had hastily begged and kept saying ""come on baby just a couple dollars before he even stopped talking"", then that's when I had responded with let me just pump my gas first. He said thank you and walked towards the store and stared at me until i finished and walked over. I told him to go in and ask for them and I swiped my card. I walked off in a rush and was overcome with anger and regret towards myself as a drove off- I literally cried. I felt taken advantage off and pressured; I felt so cowardly. When I got home I called my boyfriend and he was upset with me for not bluntly saying no. He called me easy and weak. I guess I was just quick to give in because I just wanted to be left alone and make it home okay- and I felt that simply saying yeah okay was easier then saying no and fearing the mans response.I understand the man was harmless NOW, but I do not trust people in this world to that degree to simply feel safe.

80,"I've kept this bottled, but I have no where else to turn. 

I feel utterly trapped. I'm in my late 20s living in LA. I'm working a job I don't like, on a career path I don't want, making bum pay and living in an apartment with a roommate who doesn't particularly like me. Not fun at all. Been this way for 2 years now. 

I'm jealous of my friends who are happy and doing well in their careers. One is an entrepreneur, a guy who gets whatever he wants in life with apparent ease. The other works for a private equity firm making bank, the other is a freelance video editor, who, despite being a drug-using moron, is making 6 figures. The other is in med school, another is in harvard law the other is an engineer doing exciting work. (ya, I understand these are the stand outs and that others aren't doing as well, but it still PISSES ME OFF because I want success.)

Meanwhile I've got my thumb up my ass, endlessly navel gazing. I don't have any goal or anything to work toward. I currently work for a movie studio which I thought would be awesome, but I do horrendously boring data analysis all day. Obviously I want to be involved with the creative teams, but I don't have the talent agency experience and I don't have the personality to be an assistant (the starting point) making dog shit money and getting bitched out all day. 

I don't know what the hell I want to be when I grow up. I want to make money, but I don't have the number skills to be a finance wiz and I don't have the grades to be a doctor. I want independence, but I don't have any ideas or skills needed to become an entrepreneur. I want to be creative, and I am indeed making animated videos in my free time which I love, but it certainly ain't gonna pay any bills any time soon. I like working with a team on a project toward a tangible, clear goal (unlike my current job where everything is opaque and unclear, like, what the hell difference am I making with all these numbers????)

I need a job to chase. Data analytics ain't for me, I don't want my bosses job. I need to change my career path. I was thinking of UX/UI design, becoming a dentist or getting an MBA. Fuck if I know what I'm doing. 

Truth be told, my ""dream life"" would be me directing animated movies in LA making tons of money. Obviously this is a ""lottery"" dream, and I'm actively working toward it after hours, but my data analytics day job is killing me. 

I am desperately unhappy. I want to look back on a career I can be proud of. I want to build things, work with great teams toward a common CLEAR goal. I want to make money so I can live the life I want. It's utterly embarrassing that a passionate person like me hasn't found a way to channel my passion. There is no question that I am currently doing work that goes against my natural an innate talents and desires. 

I'm dying inside. No goal, no hope. No happiness. Boring.

My question is, what should I do?

She said that's sweet but I'd like to get to know you first. I got her number and we started texting for a while. I want to get to know her face to face but its very hard when shes in only two of my classes and she spends that time with her friends. I know it will be embarrassing if I try to talk with her with her friends around but if I don't I'll lose her to someone with more confidence (as the people I've talked to about her says she's the top of line girl in class). I'm not too worried as I'm pretty good looking myself and I'm sure people see me as a nice, respectful person. I'd just like some help with what and how to say things. I've talked to my parents but it seems too casual, I feel like I need to talk to her about something relatable at this point not just asking stupid questions about her. Thanks!",22Mar2017,1
91,"Okay Reddit Im kinda of an idiot and need advice.
I want to figure out how to go to Finland this summer. I've estimated it'll cost around $2000. I'll defintly be working a summer job and have money saved, but still even with this idk if it'll be enough, and even if it is should I really go? 

Let's start with why I want to go to Finland. It's not cause I have a genuine interest in Finland, it's culture it's language it's food. It's cuz of my ~~heart~~ ~~dick~~ heart. I've been talking to and flirting with this girl from Finland for over a year. There's a mutual romantic attraction and interest for sure. 

I'm about to graduate from highschool so that's a lot of money to blow on a crush and for prolly two weeks or so. I mean that money could go towards college or appartment rent or whatever the fuck I decide I wanna do with my life. Should I blow it on this girl I like and maybe find out it's nothing? No soul mate shit that I want it to be.

And also of course I have reservations about her. Ya she fucking cute but like maybe I'm building her up. Maybe she doesn't actually like me and just likes the attention. Is she just a sad lonely person like me? What happens when she realizes I'm ugly af irl? What if I go all this way and we don't even smash?

I'm just confused and idk what to do or think man. Reddit give me some advice! If u have any question or need clarification Just ask.",22Mar2017,1
92,"My manager has given me a goal for this year that is not possible to meet. My supervisor has told me that my job duties running my area trump everything else. When we have free time, I, with my crew, focus on this goal that was given to me. Problem is, we hardly have free time. We cannot schedule time to work on this goal as we work in a warehouse and a concrete schedule is impossible to keep. I used to work in manufacturing, and yes, concrete schedules, for the most part, absolutely work in production. In a warehouse setting, we get late orders, rush orders, huge pick drops and everything else. This goal that was given to me has changed hands 4 times including me receiving it last. Everyone before had it taken from them because they did not have time. I accepted it with the caveat that I would focus my crew on it in free time. We haven't had much lately and the work for this goal keeps piling up. I'm now being chastised for it progressing slowly even though I have more responsibilities than every other coordinator in my building. Reasoning with my manager has not worked as she turns it on me and makes it my fault for not creating time out of thin air. My supervisor will not back me up, though he whole heartedly agrees that this goal is ridiculous, time consuming and a colossal waste of money. I have no support and no means to meet this goal. I get raked over the coals for not being able to complete it on top of me doing the work of two, while everyone else with a lesser workload has a hall pass from this nightmare. How can I convey this to management? I know it's hard without specifics, but it's so in depth I could write a novel. Thanks for any and all help. ",22Mar2017,9
94,"Where do I even start on this one? I am a 31 year old male that is really good at accomplishing THINGS but is terrible with PEOPLE. 


I own a house, car, have a long term steady job, plenty of money in the bank, and generally speaking I have accomplished a lot in my life that most people consider life goals.


People on the other hand, is trickier.


I am just a total mess. I second guess everything I say to anyone and I always assume the worst. I assume people don't want to associate with me, if contact slows down I assume they are tired of me, and so on. I've tried multiple therapists who always tell me to focus on my positives and try not to let my brain tell me that things are bad until i actually KNOW something is wrong. But its just never that easy.


Why am I asking for help? This is a long story that I will condense the best that I can. Last year I regained contact with an old friend of mine, and we hit it off right away. She had contacted me during a dark period of depression and it was an amazing thing that life plopped in my lap. She flew out to be with me for a few days and it was mostly fantastic, and I fell really hard for her really quickly. 


I asked if those were feelings I should pursue and she said no because she didn't want to do long distance (she was moving to new york around this time) and it's just not a viable relationship etc which i understand. I dropped it, and the depression found its way back tenfold as the rejection took hold and I ended up highly suicidal for quite a long time. Eventually over the year I kind of accepted the dark parts of life and while i never have regained that spark of happiness, for the most part I'm fine. 


Enter part 2 of this same girl. We have stayed constant online friends for the year, and routinely bond over basically everything under the sun, and lately things were clicking way more than usual, so once again I asked hey is this a friendship that could be a relationship? She said she too had considered it but ultimately didn't want to mess up our friendship. I accepted this...at first. I brought it back up a few days after and asked why what we have isnt ideal for a relationship, and she once again said she was considering that as well, and then...she switched subjects. Never got a resolution, but I can only assume it's still another rejection. I asked how she would feel about me flying out to hang out with her for a bit, and without hesitation or consideration she said yes that would be good. I asked a second time the next day to be sure and everything was still a go. 


And then everything halted. Again. Our contact magically and for no reason that I know of has slowed down, It had become a routine to wake up to messages from her or whatever, and that's gone. Our late night conversations feel very forced unlike the conversations that had been going on merely a few days ago, which flowed super easily and were constantly fun EVEN AFTER the failed relationship proposal.


This is not good for me. I have gone down this road before, I literally cannot stop wondering what happened. What did I do wrong? Is she already sick of me despite being so close mere days ago? Did I fuck things up by asking about a relationship potential? Is she only agreeing to have me visit her to not hurt my feelings or something?


It's endless I cannot stop thinking about it, and the darkness is creeping back in. 


There you have it. What in the fuck do I do? Is there anything TO be done? Am I just incredibly paranoid or what? Is there some trick to get out of my head that I don't know? Any advice is welcome.


tl;dr - i second guess everything ive ever done. i have fallen really hard for someone and contact has slowed way down, making me second guess things even more. ",22Mar2017,4

I'm okay with a little bit of mess, but things here are getting really out of hand. Normally, I would let them do them without commenting, but this situation is starting to personally affect me.

Trash lying around everywhere, and within days after I clean all the table/countertops they're covered in my roommates' messes.

My roommates also leave dishes in the sink for weeks..and almost all of the dishes, pots, pans and utensils are mine. Which wouldn't be THAT big of a deal, except for the fact that they'll just completely use up every single clean dish until there are no more left, leaving me to clean up their mess? Which I'm not going to do because I'm not their mother and honestly just don't have time to be cleaning up other peoples' stuff. When I ask them to do their dishes, they'll usually defer responsibility to another roommate--even when all of us are in the room.

What can I do to get them to start taking responsibility? And I refuse to clean up after them. I'm not a maid. I'm already the only one in the house who cleans the kitchen and bathroom.

It's been a week since we've had any kind of interaction, and I kind of feel like I might just be his secret. Like i'm just a fun thing he can go to whenever he wants. I'm not gonna lie, growing up trans has really killed my confidence, so I don't have any power when it comes to him. I don't like that I've been waiting for a call, text, snap, or even for him to hang out with me. This is starting to feel like an unrequited love, and I hate how bad I have it for this guy.

114,"Hi there,

Since February 1 I've lived in a woman's house who I met through Craigslist--she actually found MY ad looking for temporary housing. 

She's 26 and owns a $500k house, and rents it out to me for $500. The house looks like an Anthropologie catalog. (Her family is very wealthy.)

Anyway, its been going pretty well until this week. I need to preface this by saying this woman speaks very, very loudly, and that's tripled when she's inebriated or on the phone. 

(Backstory: my dog ripped apart a priceless woven blanket from Patagonia that my roommate/landlady left out. It happened once and was fixable, then she left it accessible to the dog again so of course my little corgi went nuts for something so fluffy that smells like sheep.)


On Saturday morning at 3am, she got home from some bars with 2 friends and they were so loud they were yelling to each other across the house. Then one of her drunk male friends walked into my room. I immediately went over to her room and asked her friends to use their 3am voices and told her about the guy walking in my room. She didn't respond much to that, but then proceeded to send me like 5 texts apologizing and giving various excuses (""I was in the bathroom for literally 30 seconds, Matt is such a nightmare!"")

Anyway fast forward to 10am that morning when I woke up and I was the only one home and ALL of the doors in the house were either unlocked or just plain open. I texted her asking what the deal was, as I already felt super unsafe last night with a guy walking into my room, and she texted ""Oh my friend is powerlifting so I left all the doors open for literally 10 minutes if she gets home before me! It's no big deal!"" --okay, but I just woke up and had no idea of that. She follows this up with ""Can you fix that blanket?"" (See backstory at top)-- this threw me SUPER off guard, that my request for safety/quiet was met with retaliation to fix her blanket. 

Anyway, I took the blanket to a specialty yarn shop (can't wait to see how much that costs) and told her how I felt really unsafe that evening/morning and how distraught it made me that when I tried to tell her what I needed to feel safe that she decided to retaliate. Her response was ""Literally of all the drunk guys to walk into your room, Carl is, like, the safest possible."" She also thought I was being passive aggressive when I expressed concern over waking up in a totally unlocked house. 

This morning at 5am she was on the phone (I'm truly not exaggerating, she speaks on the phone at the volume of someone yelling across a house to someone else) and it immediately woke me up. I texted asking her to be quieter and her response was -- ""Out of the house already. Apologies. Friend called with a huge emergency. ""

I know there's an apology in there, but please understand this woman is unable to accept any blame. She gets VERY agitated when she feels like something is her fault. When drunk guy walked in my room it obviously wasn't her fault that she left a guest unattended, when she left all the doors unlocked while I was sleeping it wasn't her fault that her friend had to go powerlifting and have entry back to the house, and when she was loudly on the phone at 5am it wasn't her fault because her friend needed her. 

If this was a roommate, I'd just deal with it. But I pay HER for a safe, quiet place to live but I feel like she is getting frustrated with my ""passive aggressiveness"" (aka asking for basic human decency). 

Any ideas on how to treat this? Obviously I'm trying to be really transparent and just tell her when things are issues, but she's not responding well. I'm definitely moving out April 14 (I bought a house! Yay) but I just need to be able to sleep and be safe for 3 more weeks. 

I was debating withholding a few days rent and seeing if she notices (doubtful, she has no sense of money/what a budget is)--it wouldn't be a big impact to her personally but would give me a sense of redress. 

For the record, we don't have a lease. I asked for one but she never wanted to deal with it. I know that was stupid of me to let that slide. 

TL;DR roommate is also landlady and is loud and has drunk guys over that walk into my room. Thinks when I explain problems I'm having that I'm ""passive aggressive""--looking for advice on how to deal with crazy 

And for the record, I know a lot of the situations I describe depend on my tone/demeanor... I'm a 24 yo woman and I am socially capable and tactful. My job involves dealing with lots of different personalities politely and discretely, and I haven't had a complaint yet about how I am perceived and communicate :) Edit: I also should mention I'm a very deep sleeper, so it's not like a wake up when people speak at normal volume!

133,"I think my main problem is that naturally keep my mouth clamped shut as I breathe through my nose.

Whilst clamped, it creates a zone for 'bad' smells to congregate, I guess. Difference being, that if I was to breath with my mouth open, consistantly, said smells won't congeal, but this is difficult as it requires conscious effort and likely to dry my mouth/lips. It also means that I'm actively breathing outwardly with a slightly smelly breath.. which, around others, is exactly what I want to avoid doing.

I feel that it has altered my confidence to speak directly towards someone's face. It doesn't seem to matter that I've brushed my teeth, because anything that enters my mouth will then congeal as I keep it closed. Usually over the tongue/back of the throat.

Also, I don't feel that my diet is a major problem. I drink plenty of water, and have removed fizzy drinks from my life for more than 2 years. Though, of course, my diet causes it to some degree (most noticeable when I drink pomegranate) but, overall I don't feel that my bad breath is the caused by my diet.

I'm not entirely sure how to work around this. I had a period where I used Listerine, but then I hear all this stuff about it (maybe) giving you cancer. ",22Mar2017,1

We both send texts on the longer side, he often sends multiple, and we both ask the other questions.

I'm trying to decide if I should look at picking up a weekend job or start volunteering. If I picked up a weekend job, even at my state's minimum wage and working 8 hours on Saturdays and Sundays, I would be adding almost an extra $500/month to my income and basically cover the bulk of my student loans and car payment. This would take me a long way because I only make $20k yearly and could use that as I see fit.

On the other hand, I also want to start volunteering at Habitat for Humanity in order to give back to my community, expand my professional network and gain some experience that I could add to my resume. I went to school for political science in the hopes of one day working for a non-profit organization, but sadly thanks to my full-time job I've not been able to volunteer much and I'm looking to pick up the habit again.

I completed my undergraduate degree in last June and moved to Tokyo for work. I don't get paid much but I am happy with work and life here!

I applied for Masters in US and got into UC Irvine which is pretty much ok for the department I got into (Computer Science). I am unable to come to terms with quitting my work here and continuing my education. My parents are insisting on going for Masters in US as the pay scale for CS jobs is high in USA compared to Japan. I keep thinking about deferring the offer and staying back in Tokyo for another year. I just am not ready to leave yet!

Am I being foolish (as my dad keeps pointing out)? How about, I decline the offer now and apply for better Universities next year? I will have more experience and hopefully one published paper by then. I have time till 15th April to accept the offer.

153,"TL;DR: I need advice on how to improve my relationship with my family as I plan to take an action which is against the religion they follow.


Hi, this is my first time posting to Reddit so I apologise if I make any mistakes and thank you in advance if you're taking the time to read this. Also English is not my first language so do forgive me for any error.

**I'm a 20 year old male from a Sikh family.** For anyone who isn't aware, Sikhism is a religion where the males can be easily identified as they wear a turban, keep their beards long and have the word ""Singh"" as their middle name (among other things). You can read more about Sikhism [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism) and [this](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/05/17/13/28C3EDDA00000578-3084923-Mr_Singh_said_he_has_been_overwhelmed_by_the_praise_and_support_-m-2_1431866703697.jpg) is what the average Sikh male looks like.

Since my family has been following this religion for many generations, I'm also required to abide by its rules, wherein **I'm not allowed to cut my hair at all and am required to grow a long beard.**

To cut it as short as I can, I've wanted to cut my hair for the past 3-4 years. There are various reasons to this: a turban can be painful and uncomfortable to wear all the time, keeping long hairs can be a very difficult task to manage and causes lot of hair problems, it is inconvenient many times and can be a difficulty socially as well. Plus, I don't care much for theism or the religion of Sikhism itself and the rituals/requirements that go along with it.

The main issue here among all my family members is with my father. I've been telling my family since forever about this wish of mine to cut my hair, and my mom has come to accept it, but my father has always been extremely put off with this.

A little small background: my father is one of the nicest guys I've ever come across. He is really fair, has always encouraged in me with positive reinforcement, is very loving and supportive and is liked by everyone who has ever met him. He has been what my relatives call 'the perfect nephew/perfect son/perfect husband/perfect father' and he is my role model as well. I've been studying in college far away from home, and he has given me immense positive emotional support and even helped me financially quite a bit even though we aren't really that well-off. I've never had any reason to complain about him at all, in fact if it weren't for him I'd be really sad as he is like my best friend and I couldn't ask for a better personality in a parent.

So as you can imagine, I'm terrified of disappointing my father and of letting him down despite everything he has done for me. However, he just can't come to grips with my desire for cutting my hair. He uses various arguments like: 

* if I cut my hair now, it will have a negative impact on my 15y/o brother who will follow my example and do it as well
* he wants me maintain my identity, which I was born with, and be proud of it (just as he is)
* it is highly possible that I might go bald during my mid 20s due to a genetic problem, so wearing a turban will be better for me
* my cutting hair will make him sad, my old grandfather sad and angry, and my other relatives who care deeply about me
* it is possible some parts of my extended family will dislike me henceforth
* he doesn't say this, but I think he's also a bit concerned about what other people in the immediate society will think about me or our family

Personally I don't care much for all these reasons, even though I've put off cutting my hair since I've felt guilty of it. But now it's too long and I absolutely can't postpone this any further, for the sake of the health of my hair. So I'm going back home from university in a month and I told my dad that when I come home finally I will be getting my hair cut, and I don't want to surprise him suddenly so I want to be straightforward and honest with him. We'd been having a nice conversation when I told him this, he was immediately put off and again went with it ending ""do whatever you want in the end, but if this personal desire of yours means more to you than seeing your father so upset then go ahead with it, bye.""

There are a lot of other dimensions to this entire thing, such as my grandfather recently forcing me to promise to him never to cut my hair or trim my beard as long as he's still alive, my father blaming my mother for 'encouraging' me to take this step etc. but I think I've already written way too long. :(

So anyway, I've thought about this a lot, but basically **I was hoping someone here could just give me anything on how to make this situation better even a little bit, or how to improve (or subsequently rebuild) the relationship I've had with my father over time, or how to proceed with this entire scenario.**

I'm sorry if I've written a very large block of text and if it has been boring, and thank you to everyone who has spent their time in reading all this. Thanks in advance for any advice as well. Have a good day take care.",22Mar2017,96
155,"1- Everytime he gets the chance, he would come up with me to annoy me for no reason. I tried to confront him in front of my parents, but they think that he's innocent because he's the ""oldest 17 years old"" or whatever. He would catwalk to my room, sing the songs that I listen to often, fart, burp, and do all of this stuff that drives me crazy. 24/7. Everytime I complain to my parents, they would end up blaming me, and I'M the one who gets into trouble. He would come up to me, jumping up and down saying stuff like ""Oh mah gawd u are my best friend foreverrr!! :D"" When my parents aren't around, he would walk ladies-style with his arms on his hips, catwalking, just to annoy me.


2- He doesn't care about his future. He wants to leave high-school next year. He haven't even applied for college yet. He brainwashed my mom into buying him a gaming PC thinking that he'll use it for studying. Last week when the report card came in, he got 4 F's and no A's. The rest were D's, C's, and B's. He hasn't planned on his future/college/job. So something tells me that he's spending the next few years unemployed, regardless of the fact that my parents are paying thousands for his tuitions. He's in 11th grade.


2- He haves no friends. Literally none. Every weekend, everyone in the house hangs out with a friend or someone, but him. He just lays in his bed with the PC on his bed for two days, no studying, no nothing. The last time he actually hanged out with a friend was 4 years ago, no kidding. When he was a kid, he left his best friend claiming that he had ""no friends."" and his best friend now is the most popular guy in school, while my brother's just there in the background.


3- He drives me nuts. Last summer, he annoyed the shit out of me with his gay moves/speech/dancing, that I literally grabbed his PS4 console and smashed it into the ground.


5- He ruins my room. We share rooms, sadly. Before he got in, I had my own, clean, independent room. And then my parents  made him sleep with me. And I can't even explain my room's environment. ICGSE books on the ground, smells of sweat, His clothes everywhere, glasses/plates that he deposits on the ground because he's too lazy to put it on the sink. It's a mess.

I think that the reason he's doing this is because he wants me to go down with him. He failed... basically everything in life, and he's jealous of my progress. It's really getting on my nerves. I'm already having fantasies of him dying/getting murdered. My dad is mad as fuck at me because of how many times I complain about him. I literally want this guy out of my life.",22Mar2017,0
156,"Hello! So it's just like the title says: I am about to finish my BS in biotech this coming fall semester (finishing a semester late due to a change in my major) and I am unsure what my best course of action is. If any career scientists here could please give me some insight as to my particular situation I would greatly appreciate it. 

Some background info: 

My gpa is roughly 3.2. - Not great I know, but I have worked hard to bring it up from what my grades were in my old major 

I have some research experience. 1 year at the end of this semester and I plan to continue next semester for a total of 1.5 years. 

I was first author on a poster session my research group made. 

I have experience in tissue culture techniques, phylogenetic analysis, and I am a pretty good writer. I even edited a DoD research grant for a professor at my school, though I don't think I was credited in it. I could probably get his recommendation though. 

I have no other in-the-field experience aside from what my lab courses provided unfortunately. Though, I do hold down a part time job currently as a barista (I realize this may not be worth much)

I have not yet taken the GREs, but I tend to score above average in standardized tests, 1890 combined score on the SATs for example. 

I am unsure exactly what I wish to specialize in. I currently think that synthetic biology might be really cool to work in but I don't have much experience to be able to tell for sure. I'm also thinking about neuroscience but I don't think I have the relevant prerequisites for that. I also think molecular evolution would be really cool. Basically I don't know exactly and I don't want to make a rash decision or waste money. I feel this is the most damning reason of why I may not wanna go to grad school just yet. 

If I do go to grad school I would want to get my PhD. 

I am looking at roughly $80k in student loans of varying interest rates. The government loans are the subsidized and unsubsidized ones. The private loans are mostly in the 9-10.5% interest ranges. Thankfully they only make up about a fourth of my student debt. All of the loans have been deferred up to this point and are fixed interest rate. 

Particularly I'm concerned with the following: 

Do you think I'd be able to pay off my debt if I enter the workforce with a BS in this field?
Do you think I have a chance at getting accepted into a PhD program with my current accolades? (Or lack thereof, I'm not really sure where I stand.)
Would the PhD be worth it for the increase in debt I may experience? Or should I go for a master's instead? 

And I think that's it. If there was any info I left out please let me know. Thank you for reading! Again, I greatly appreciate any help you all can offer, as I'm really at a loss for what I should do.

PS: I apologize if this isn't the right community to ask, if you could even just point me in the right direction I'll be on my way.

171,"Names changed. I'm ""John"" here. This will certainly be too long for some people and perhaps many will find the context irrelevant, but I feel the need to be totally transparent about any factors which may or may not effect your advice.

John has two friends, Reuven and Simon. Both John and Reuven used to be Orthodox Jews, and Simon still is religious. Reuven is an old friend from college. When John was depressed and had no job prospects, Reuven used to let him crash on his couch. When Reuven needed to raise donations for a nonprofit in order to obtain a job there, John took the hit to his wallet and hooked him up. But Reuven helped John in 2013 and John helped Reuven in 2014. Since then, John has moved to the city Reuven lives in and tried to reconnect. Reuven goes out on the town with his other friends a lot, but has largely ignored John; Reuven keeps begging off, and they have not seen each other in person since 2013. When John snarked about this recently after Reuven had to reschedule again (""You give a guy some money and then you never see him again :P ""), Reuven got really pissed off about John being passive-aggressive; Reuven says he's bad at logistics and he's sorry, but he's going through a rough time and he'd block anybody else for the abusive tone John used (John doesn't say so, but notes in his head that he'd usually unfriend somebody who is so flakey, but makes an exception for Reuven since Reuven was there for him when life was hell). They talk it out somewhat (albeit Reuven still seems pissed off). During this conversation, Reuven says John never asked how he's doing, and John reminds him this isn't true. John had been trying to find out what's going on with Reuven because he was worried about him as their mutual friend Simon had mentioned Reuven had blocked him without explanation. Reuven tells John that Simon was abusive to his ex-wife Leah and John will have to learn to accept this. Leah doesn't want to come out and say what happened to her publicly, but she confided it to Reuven and Reuven suspects she will come out with her charges in time. Reuven says he once saw Simon screaming in rage and Leah's fear with his own eyes.

John met Simon in real life exactly once, when invited to a meal at a different friend's house. John and Simon met on the Internet in facebook conversations of mutual interest. Although Simon and Leah were married when John first started corresponding with Simon, John has never met Leah and barely corresponded with her; Simon has only mentioned her in passing. When John had no resume to speak of, Simon helped him find a job that changed his life and gave him new purpose and meaning.  Simon and John don't live in the same city, but Simon still keeps in touch and gives helpful advice. One other fact, this one perhaps pertinent to Reuven's allegations: Simon, who had never before said anything about his sex life, mentioned after his divorce that he was interested in potentially visiting Nevada to check out a brothel.

Now, ever since Reuven told John that Simon allegedly is an abuser, John feels weirded out when he's corresponding with Simon...Like every time John writes something, he thinks to himself, ""Am I talking to a monster? Am I being too nice to somebody who may be a terrible person?"" Reuven is a liar insofar as he promises to hang out and then doesn't, but other than that, he's always been known in his friend circle as a good guy, not somebody to lie or slander. How should John think about Simon? I suppose some people will say, ""It's none of John's business"" and logically that might be true, but John can't help thinking about people when he corresponds with them; should John tell himself that Reuven's allegation is probably/maybe not true, and carry on as if Reuven had never told him anything?

173,"So a little back story before the actual situation. I just moved into a new apartment on the first of this month. My next door neighbor heard me moving in and got my attention to warn me about the people I live above. She said the last couple tenants actually moved because she would complain about the noise so frequently. She said she used to just call the cops but thinks she doesn't any more because the cops have told her that she's being ridiculous and if she wants to not hear people above her she should move to the second floor. But now the situation. On the SECOND day of living here is the first time I met her. She came upstairs and asked me to ""have my kids stop running around"". The noise she heard was my dog walking into the living room. (The hallway is hardwood floor). And since then she comes up stairs to tell us we are being to loud ANY time she hears a noise. The real kicker is they are the loudest neighbors we have. The only people we can hear in our own apartment are the ones who complain the most. Now I do have a pretty decent stereo set up that I use for music and movies. And I've taken steps already to talk to the other neighbors to make sure I'm not being too loud. Everyone else has said they don't have any issues with us. And if they can hear us it's very muffled and doesn't bother them. So I know I'm not being too loud. What's the best way of dealing with this? I'm not going to tip toe around my apartment because they can't stand hearing anything. I'm not going to change my lifestyle for them. What can I do to muffle some of the ambient noise going through the floor? Do I even worry about it? I'm at a loss. 

tl;dr the loudest tenants in our building who have a history of complaining say we are being too loud. (She has said our footsteps are too loud) and no other neighbors think we are loud. What do we do? ",22Mar2017,3
176,"So I donated blood for the first time about a year ago. Rather, I tried to donate blood. They got the pint out of me, and then had to take two or three vials to test for blood born pathogens. But for whatever reason, it wouldn't come out. They were able to barely fill one vial, but not the others. 


When this was happening, they poked me, painfully, several times. Three different individuals (are they all phlebotomists? I'm not sure the term) tried, on both arms, to get what they needed. It hurt, a lot, and I'm not a sensitive person. At no point did they offer to stop, even when I said ""Ow"" and grimaced, and only after several minutes of trying did they say ""Well, I guess we did what we could.""

At the time, I was too timid/self conscious to say anything, but now I wish I had. 


The Red Cross has been calling me several times a week ever since (they stopped for about two months when I asked them to stop, but they've resumed this past week). I want to give blood, to give the chance to help someone, but I have a hard time getting past that experience.

185,"Hello /r/Advice,

I have been under constant mental and physical abuse from my mother for about 5 years now. My mom hits me, she's kicked me out of the house and only accepted me back in when I was sent to the hospital. She didn't want to deal with legal problems I think.  I have scars because she stabbed me with a pen when she was mad.

I live in the Middle east, Jordan. I don't think the family help service will help us because she has connections with someone there. The system here is so messed up she can get away with it. I'm not sure about this, but I'm scared she will find out I reached out for help. Last time I did, well she kicked me out of the house.

I'm 17 years old and will be 18 this October. Will I be free of her control immediately or is there some paper work?

However, my sister is only 11 years old. I love my sister so much and I don't want her to go through what I did. I plan on finding some job while I go to University and find a place to stay. However, is there anyway I can do this legally? **Can I somehow file a report or a statement or a law suit or something to be her legal guardian?** I'm so sorry I don't know how any of this works but I don't want my sister to go through any of the things I did. How much will this cost, will I be able to complete this process with a small sum of money? **I will not leave my sister with her, no way. My sister said she can't handle her anymore**

There is a bank account in my name which has 1500 USD in it last time I checked. Will I be able to get a hold of it when I'm 18, how can I use that effectively to prepare to support my sister and I?

Are there any online resources I should go to? Is there somewhere I can understand how the law works for this kind of stuff, even if I don't have much knowledge when it comes to the laws of my country? Any where I should repost this to?

If you just read this, thank you. It's a very lengthy post and simply reading it is good. I talked to someone and they said they might house me, but I'm not sure I trust them. I'm trying to get as much information as possible. 

Thank you again.

I don't have any interest in the class and I just suck at it. I maintained a B in the first two nine weeks and now I have an F. That shit bums me out and my homework from other classes makes me stay up late and naturally I doze off in class and end up doing nothing. The nine weeks end in 2 days so there's no possible way to bring my grade back up. This sucks because it will affect my GPA, something my parents care about a lot.

195,"I am currently a junior getting my bachelors in compsci. I'm looking for internships/jobs that will help me gain experience. These jobs are rare and also 1-2hrs away from my hometown. The job I have now is in retail with max 16hours/wkly. And this is once in a while. I usually get between 4-8hours/wkly. I'm also at the moment considering a full time warehouse job that can pay tuition. I would also go to school online full time. That's one side of the issue. 

On the other side is home life. I currently live at home with parents and other siblings and my nephews/nieces. My mother is currently going through examinations for a diagnosis. They think it might be parkinsons. She is also having memory problems. She is also stubborn. But my father and I were able to get her to go to the doctor. She doesn't work so she stays at home with my dad who can't work because of an injury. 

One of my brothers is struggling financially going through a separation with an ex and both of them are juggling the kids. He is only getting 5hrs of sleep and working two jobs with a ton of debt. We have offered him help but he denies it. I don't want to see him go through a depression. He has cried and had some breakdowns. My other brother, he also lives with us but is not really in the know of everything that is going or even reacts to it sometimes/seems like he doesn't care? He has a major attitude sometimes along with anger. He's 22 and still expects our mom in her condition to make him lunch for work. Today he made my mother cry because the food wasn't ready for him. My sister doesn't live with us she told me she gave up try to get my mother help. She just visits us from time to time. And recently I found out my sister has a lump is undergoing diagnosis. My parents don't know about this. 

My father and I are the only ones that seem to be trying to keep it together. Almost everyday we have to talk about these issues. I have recently had a breakdown myself at work and before I went to sleep. This makes it difficult to focus on my work. I haven't seen my father cry since last year along with my sister.

197,"I live in an apartment complex, and the downstairs neighbors have always been a problem but things have been escalating. They had a new tenant move in, loud foul mouthed man wearing a wife beater, we'll call him Tom. 

Ever since he moved in, we noticed more people have been showing up ranging from homeless people to really tweaked out people. 

Every time I go downstairs to take the trash out, they freak out and wonder what I'm doing. At one point our bike was even stolen and Tom came running upstairs saying he might have known someone who stole it and he'll beat them to a pulp if he finds out who it is. He never got back to us.

But all his visitors have bikes and they're always strewn about in front of the apartment. They gather up to smoke, and they go riding off around sun down. Some of them stay and sleep on their porch or in the car. Before they go off with their bikes, I sometimes hear them arguing about getting caught. Other days they argue about money problems or getting paid on time with Tom or where their belongings went.

We have typical work schedules and don't want to come home finding our doors or windows smashed open. So we've been looking up security cameras and window alarms on Amazon.

207,"I started working on a BS in Physics in August of 2013. I was an above average student in high school (30 on the ACT, top 20% of my graduating class, Eagle Scout, etc.), but as soon as I went to college things fell apart.

During my freshman year, I failed even basic classes (I only passed Physics my first semester) and finished the year with a 1.5 GPA. I didn't want to give up at that point and decided to try another semester and did well, but I was emotionally abused and a therapist made me worse off. I ultimately called it quits in December of 2015 and moved back in with my parents, then switched to Community College.

I've been slowly doing better and better at community college, this semester there's a fairly high chance I could even get straight As (or at worst, a 3.7). 

However, I'm running out of classes to take at community college and have bad prospects of transferring out. Right now my CC GPA is 2.864 based on 22 credits (with 16 in progress now, it's only gonna get higher). However, my GPA from my old school was 1.494 based on 56 credits.

My first choice was a large R1 public university near me, which seemed like a good choice since they offer strong research opportunities (I plan to do a PhD after graduating), but they rejected me two semesters in a row. I called them and they said they calculated my transfer GPA to be 1.66, so it would take me years of community college classes just to meet their minimum of 2.5.

I've also considered some other public schools in the area, however I'm not sure how much they'll damage my already hurt chances of getting into a PhD program due to a lack of research opportunities. I'm considering private universities as well, which seem to have a higher chance of accepting me (one calculated my GPA to be 2.15) but are fairly expensive (my family has $90k-100k saved to spend on the remaining 2-3 years of my education but I'd feel extremely guilty about this).

Lastly, I'm looking at going abroad. I already speak Portuguese (I would rate myself B1, B2 is minimum to study at most unis in Portugal), so I've considered going there but I'm afraid studying abroad might burn future bridges in the US.

My old college offers a return process where I would get a fresh new GPA, but I seriously don't want to go there because I have a lot of bad memories there, bad relationships with my former professors, and consider that place to be an extremely toxic environment (I left for a reason).

Has anyone been in my situation? Is there something I haven't considered yet?

216,"I'm currently living in a house share in England with three other people. On Sunday I went out to the back garden to smoke when a cat runs over my feet. It was odd as none of our neighbours have cats but other than that I didn't think anything of it. About an hour later I'm in my room when I start hearing a woman shouting, can't really understand what she is saying so me being nosey I go downstairs to make a coffee and have a listen to find a Thai girl in the kitchen with one of my flat mates talking very quickly and hysterically in broken English, I still can't really get the jist of what she is saying so I just wait for the kettle to boil. When my flat mate asks me if I've seen a cat? 'No, why would I see a cat?...oh wait, yeah I saw a little cat in the garden a hour or so ago' this prompts the girl I've never seen before to go what can only be described as 'fucking ballistic' screaming at me in broken English (honestly couldn't understand a word it was pretty frustrating) but obviously I've used my Colombo skills to work out what's up. I felt like crap and apologised vehemently to my flat mate because she has run outside. 
Both of them were clearly angry and I went to walk the streets to look with them, I even asked our closest neighbours to let me look through the gardens. 
After over an hour looking we are clearly not going to find the cat so I go home. A bit later my flat mate comes up to my room to talk, the girl is his wife (we've been living together for 18 months and he has never mentioned a wife and I've never known him to go out outside of work) and the cat was hers. Again I said sorry but in my defence even if I knew the cat wasn't allowed out and I tried to stop it I doubt I could have, and you haven't told anyone your 'wife' is living here and you didn't ask anyone to bring a cat in to the house, allergies and all that. (She has been here a month, maybe shame on me for not knowing a new person and animal are living in my house)

After work on Monday I come home to both of them in the kitchen, I say hi with no response. My flat mate then presents me with his phone displaying a gumtree ad for a kitten. 'I don't want a cat thanks mate' no, they want me to buy the kitten. Plus ¬£120 for injections the kitten will need?! Again I apologise but also state I don't think I did anything wrong, I do feel bad because a pet has been lost but I honestly don't think this is anymore than an avoidable mistake. I go up to my room. I work Tuesday, come home and my flat mate again asks for me to buy a kitten. I didn't have a great day so I told him to make love to himself and to drop it or I will inform the landlord he has had another person and animal living in the house with no tenancy agreement (a no pet policy is actually on the contract).
I've worked today and just came home to both of them giving me the evils and I'm pretty much pissed off, I've drafted an email to the landlord but I've told myself to give it a hour and see what I think then before I send. What does Reddit think?

A lot of my self confidence came from them and their support. When I graduated, all that confidence I got from those teachers left.
Now, three years later I'm a mess. My self confidence is gone. I flunked out my first year of college. My first year of college I struggled with anxiety attacks. I've gained almost 40 pounds in three years. I struggle constantly in school. My parents treat me differently than they did three years ago - they call me a bum, a freeloader, they say I'm lazy. There is so much tension now in our relationship. When I flunked out my first year I moved back home expecting things to relatively be the same. I just feel like the respect my parents had for me is gone. They criticize me more than ever. In high school my parents just kind of let me do my thing. They never criticized me or had any problem with me. I ran my business and got good grades. Now, they are on my back more than ever. I am never good enough. My mom tells me to brush my teeth every morning and my dad tells me to eat my vegetables. They have animosity against me for not getting a ""real job"" (they do not like me being an entrepreneur, even though I have had businesses since I was 6 years old). They now even criticize the way I run my business.

For years my mom especially was my biggest cheerleader and supporter, now it seems like she has turned against me. One day she is telling me that she loves having me at home and the next (like today) she is talking about me moving out someday.

For the past year I have been battling chronic Nostalgia and some depression. Everything I talked about above makes my nostalgia ten times worse.

I rely on my mom for things that come easy to others. I was born with a learning disability and some health challenges and have overcome it mostly, but there is one thing I have never been able to learn - How to CUT MY NAILS. I'm a 21 year old guy and for the last 21 years my mom has cut my fingernails. I have hormone imbalances and have to be injected with testosterone - my mom does that too. Please don't make front of me.

221,"Hi, looking for advice on getting the girl I love. 
I'm sorry if this is long, first time posting, and I just want to make sure the whole story is out there.

The girl I(m27)love. Let's call her Dorthy(f30). So our relation ship started in March '15 and everything was great we were both in NYC at the time, however she is from Holland. She had to go back for the summer of that year because of work and her visa expiring. I told her I would marry her so she could get a visa and stay in the US. She was very enthralled with the idea and thought it was really romantic. But she went back to Holland anyway. We stayed in touch all summer and when she got back everything was even better than before. But I wasn't sure of my feelings it being my first true relationship. I would put her through a lot, because she wasn't sure if I wanted to be with her, and neither was I. So we had a lot of emotional talks, but every time I told her I wanted her. 

In November she lost her job and was going to move back to holland. She said she loved me and she would stay in NY if I asked. I said I wasn't comfortable with that. Something I deeply regret now. She left and we didnt talk for 3-4 months she came back to NY after that, to get the last of her stuff. We buried the hatchet and I stayed with her the whole time in her hotel and we had sex, and I told her that I had made a mistake and that I loved her. She went back to holland and we stayed in touch texting and talking every other day and she told me to visit her. I did a month back, and it was amazing, like we were in the beginning a great couple

When I came to visit she said she had met a girl on line (she's bi) let's call the girl Vicky(f32)and they had been hitting it off and actually met for a vacation in South Africa two weeks before I came. When I visited her I said I wouldn't get in the way of that relationship. But she said they weren't exclusive. Vicky lives in Australia too by the way. Anyway we were like we were in the beginning, so happy spending every moment of everyday together. Having sex being very intimate and saying we still both loved each other. The whole time Vicky kept texting and calling saying she didn't want Dorthy sleeping in the same bed as me, and asking her if we had been physical in the past. Sometimes I would have to leave the room while they had to have ""serious"" talks. Vicky did not like me being there. Dorthy had to lie to her about us hooking up. And tell Vicky that I'd always be in her life and if that was a problem, I would never work between them. 

I guess when they were both in South Africa too they had made plans for Vicky to come visit Dorthy in Holland. The whole time I was there Dorthy kept saying how she didn't think she wanted Vicky visiting because she was needy and codependent and she wasn't sure if it was good she visited, to maybe just be friends. But Dorthy said she would regret it if she didn't see it through. So Vicky booked the tickets. I left after 10 days and we left on such good terms saying we both loved each other. 

A few weeks later she booked a job in NY for a couple days and I spent the entire time with her. Staying in her hotel again the whole time. When she left for Holland I went to the airport with her and we kissed and both said I love you.

A week later Vicky came to visit her in Holland. I couldn't text or talk to Dorthy the whole time because Vicky was there. The last two days of their visit Dorthy got sick and had to go the the hospital, and Vicky was with her the whole time and I think it really brought them close together. 

After Vicky left to go back to Australia and me and Dorthy face timed, she said she was ok out of the hospital, and that her visit with Vicky had been confusing. That the first five days were bad and Vicky was just going to leave early. But then I guess they put the baggage aside and had a good time the rest of the time. But Vicky wanted Dorthy to take her to all the places she took me. Everyone. Which they did. Then Dorthy told me that she had feelings for me and for Vicky but that I was ""a day late and I dollar short."" She said that maybe we can be together at some point, but that she had to see where her relationship with Vicky was going. 

So my question is should I write Dorthy a letter  telling her that I love her and I'll do anything to fight for her. Or should I step aside and let them do there thing? 

And Vicky lives in Australia, I live in NY and Dorthy lives in Holland, but isn't opposed to a long distant relationship. I would also be willing to move to Holland. I just don't know what to do, and I am absolutely heartbroken, crying, depressed, can't sleep. I just need any advise!

I need to work to this tests and i am trying to do this.I have two cousins and 5 months ago i just couldn't working. So my cousin proposed to work and stay at our house and said "" i will guide you and i will be your coach in this path"" he is a teacher butaway. I am at my aunts house for 5 months and i passed the first test and my second test is 3 months later.


So thats the problem: Im good with my teacher cousin but other cousin is discomfort of my existence.She is not saying this to my face but i can understand from her behaviors.And im studying for all day paying all my attention to my lessons untill the test.But when i go home with my too tired head my aunt and my cousin overcome to me and waiting me to do complicated and mindworking things.My cousin is being mean sometimes like when i had to sleep early (my bed is in living room and tv is there) she says ""Normal people don't sleep at this hour"" when 24.00 and i be obligated to sleep late , or just yelling about random things like my internet using.

225,"I've seen that phrase printed ad nauseum on all manner of posters, plaques, and desk tchotchkes and wonder if it's even possible for me in my present situation.

I'm 27 years old and like so many of my age/generation, recently forced to move back in with family due to economic hardship.  I don't have tens of thousands in student loans (couldn't afford college), I don't do drugs, I'm very frugal and practical, but things just tend not to work out for me more often than not. For the past few years, I've been trying to make my living in your typical boring, safe administrative office jobs, but have only ever been able to find temporary assignments through agencies.  After the last one, I've come to the conclusion that I've been trying to stuff myself into a hole I simply don't fit in.

I do have a wide range of skills that I've developed and am passionate about that could be applied in technical/creative fields, but nobody seems to be willing to take a chance on me since I've seldom had the opportunity to use them in a professional capacity (an annoying self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turns out). My chances were better when I lived in Houston, TX for the past few years but due to the aforementioned move, now find myself in a tiny town with a population of less than a thousand out in the sticks of North Texas.  There is nothing for me here.  Cowgirl boutiques, Dairy Queen, Wal-Mart, dollar stores, and the odd HVAC or farming equipment distributor is pretty much all I have to look forward to.  On top of that, my tastes, hobbies, and overall persona couldn't be farther from ""country"" if they tried.  I want to be a residential architect and interior designer.  Or a travel writer.  Or an event planner.  Or a fashion or furniture designer.  I want to see the world. Even Fort Worth, which is the only ""big"" city that's relatively close, doesn't seem to offer much in the way of my career ambitions.  It's a town of cowboys, construction workers, and families which is fine for them, but doesn't work for me.

This is hell.  I feel like I've been cursed with such ambition, imagination, cultural sensitivities, creativity, and skill, and yet have found myself being dragged kicking and screaming back to places that offer the exact opposite against my will my whole adult life (short, though that time may be so far).  Like I'm a character that's been thrown into an entirely different movie. How do I deal with this? I want to move, I want to run away, I want to follow my dreams, but I feel like I've been thrown down a well with no rope to climb out with.  

I've tried to look for bigger and better things, I have- constantly- but nobody that's anywhere I want to be will give me the time of day.  I've even tried to settle temporarily for something just to say I *have* a job, but due to the handful of ""nice"" jobs on my resume, places like food and retail consider me too much of a flight risk.  I'm stuck in a gray area and don't know what to do.  It weighs on me heavily and keeps me up at night.",22Mar2017,1
226,"TL;DR - I'm a 27 year old guy living with my decently wealthy family in India who want me to get married soon but I feel I have had no accomplishments/profound experiences in life yet and hence, feel unfulfilled.

Full story:
Currently, I'm a 27 year old guy in India living with a family who have a decently-sized business of a mundane product.

Rewind to when I was 18 years old when I was timid as f*ck and was led to believe that doing a CA accounting/auditing certification (equivalent to CPA) would be the best thing for me to take up for the family business. However, I loved playing videogames all day (who doesn't) and thought I should be doing software programming in the United States as the next best step. But I was not allowed to and naively, I thought I would get to do what I want later after getting this done.

Then, as time went on, I realised I hated this life since it involved no college and just entailed me interning at an accountant's office and studying at home for 3 years. I grew despondent and slacked off. Watching my friends have a good time on social media in their experiences abroad made me kind of depressed. Those scheduled 3 years became 5 years as I kept on flunking.

By the time I became a CA (like a CPA in the US), I was 24.5 years old and the only thing I could think of was to get out of my home. So I took the first job that came to me in a Big 4 Accounting firm in India. I hated that too (though I liked the social life) and left it after a year to only land back in my home in my family business.

Now, I'm 27 wondering where life has passed me by. I have a long time girlfriend of about 10 years and we are not sure if it's going to work out for us and are thinking of breaking up. The fact is we haven't told our families about us and now we both aren't happy with this situation - me with my career and her watching me like this.

I am/was very ambitious. I read books constantly. I am financially savvy and work out everyday. But there is this empty hole in my life. I keep going back to my past, blaming me, my family for what I think is a wasted career. I had the resources and education to do something great, but all I ended up being was an accountant (no offense to accountants. I have met a lot of bright people who are passionate about it but I'm not). I have no new real friends since high school. It's like I am in the same circle going round and round with no novel experiences.

Now my family wants me to get married. I want to break free of this pattern and build something or do something that creates my own identity. I have watched my friends travel all over the world, get PHDs, work on startups etc. and I am still in the house I was born in. I dream of contributing a lot of wealth to society but I have not been able to convert these dreams into action.

How do I get out of this?",22Mar2017,3
227,"I've always been a horrible student, despite my intelligence.

229,"So, I'm in need of some advice.

I'm currently a 21y/o F in the US-- most of my life has been overshadowed with anxiety and depression. It's been so long that I don't consider it disabling, but it interferes with my daily life, so I suppose it is.

I had to drop out of high school due to anxiety and college due to depression. I have an urge to learn and a passion about philosophy.

However, with so many doctors bills (therapists, insurance, doctors, etc), doing something I love as a career seems out of reach. Not to mention the anxiety I still get day to day between working that I let control me sometimes to the point of nocall/noshowing.

I'm great with kids-- I love them, they're imaginations and personalities are such beautiful things-- but I never wanted to put myself in a position of authority towards them. I'm just not an authoritative person, I think.

Everyone says to go back to school (even though I'd have to take out loans for community college), but the only thing I'd want to go to school for has no job prospects.

Figuring out how to financially support myself while having such anxiety and depression is such a huge stressor to me.

I'm not sure what to do-- especially when one week I can be fine and the next I have crippling anxiety where I can't leave the house. I've talked to my therapist about it, but she seems to think I just need to force myself through it.

I'm not sure what to do, ahahaha. Any advice on anything would be great.

Thank you.",22Mar2017,3
231,"I had written a post that was way too long and detailed so I‚Äôll just get to the meat of it.

I am a 27-year-old dude living in Vancouver with my beautiful and wonderfully supportive fianc√©e. She has been supporting us by herself for almost 2 years now while I manage my depression and poor luck on the job front. I have basically wasted my 20‚Äôs so far. I have a few years of university but no degree or skills that are transferrable to employment from my education. Some things have gone down in the last few years that have awoken some pretty brutal anxiety for me; I now get mild panic attacks, heart flutters, I am afraid of getting behind the wheel of a car, and my ‚Äòfight or flight‚Äô is all ‚Äòflight‚Äô now. 

The depression runs deep. I know I could fix it with exercise and going outside more but I can‚Äôt seem to focus or get motivation lately. I know I need to get a job but I have a 2-year gap on my resume now and am not quite sure how to secure a job these days.

I have thought a lot about things that I want to do in the next few years; I have a list of things I‚Äôd like to accomplish based on what I am interested in:

-	Start a blog
-	Start a podcast
-	Write short stories and articles
-	Get into the film industry in Vancouver in some capacity
-	Get in shape
-	Start a website
-	Perform stand-up 

I know this post seems silly with me not giving a ton of detail about my personality, but I love to make people laugh and I love to tell stories and hear the stories of others. I want to be interesting, both to myself and others. I have considered seeking out some professional help and am now open to the idea of taking medication of some kind. 

If anyone could provide some insight on what steps they think I should take or could put themselves in my shoes I would love to hear what you would do.

235,"Background: I had a small group of friends back in highschool that weren't always the nicest to me, but I really didn't have any other options so I stuck with them. Summer after graduation, I noticed I was only included in stuff if I contacted them first, so I vowed not to reach out to see if I would hear from anyone. Two months of silence later I licked my wounds and tried to pick myself back up. The whole thing left me pretty cynical and paranoid, but after going to college, Im realizing that closing myself off has done far more damage than other people could have.

After almost a year, one of them started texting me again and despite me telling him to ""fuck off"" seemed really dead set on patching things up and reconnecting. We came back to ok terms, and he explained he never meant to cut me off but just thought we kinda drifted apart. Though I never really bought it, I was fine carefully reestablishing a friendship.

Currently:
Now im back from school and tried to make plans with him, but something came up. I tried again today but just got no response all day. Im heavily considering just deleting his number and moving on. While it feels a little extreme, I keep thinking ""fool me once"".

254,"Hi guys, I'm a 19 year old freshman in college in NY. My friends at college and fam always call me the most wonderful adjectives like sweet and kind etc, but I feel like I don't deserve to have this great reputation coz of things I've done. I want to get them off my chest in a safe space because I feel guilty af.

1. In high school, I had depression and used to lie a little sometimes to get attention. like making up a crisis eg. my parents were mad at me etc. The lie I regret most of all is one I told at 16 and 17 - a stupid dramatic story about a love triangle I was in and how a mean boyfriend was making me sad and making me self-harm (made up details just to get the attention of a boy I liked). Regretted it later because it was a complete epic lie, but could not undo it. I hate myself for lying just to get attention/sympathy. I should've just said I had depression and asked for support truthfully.

2. I knew my best friend's password to her facebook and I was worried she was getting it on with the boy I liked. so I used to check her facebook all the time to read their chats. I feel so bad for violating her trust.

3. I discovered porn really early on (accidentally) and over the years i have developed a kink i am truly ashamed of. i tend to enjoy videos/stories that have the girl taken advantage of, not in a sadistic way or a way that causes real pain but that has the girl being submissive. I hate that this is what turns me on. i would never endorse rape or any kind of nonconsent in real life. but i feel guilty af. noone would expect me to even know the word porn or ever expect that I know loads of sites for watching/reading it.

4. i had a boyfriend in middle school. things were fine until he started saying his friends thought i was weird. then i got really hurt and had an outburst and broke up with him. he was shocked because he thought i was too sweet to ever get mad at anything. i made up with him later but the guilt at getting angry lingers. even with a guy i dated last year, he was hugely surprised when i got annoyed or mad coz he thought i was too sweet and kind to ever do so. i feel really ashamed of how i can get argumentative and stubborn and unattractive or unlike my reputation when i'm mad. 

5. after a breakup last year, i met a guy who was super nice and in my desire to get over the breakup i thought he was the perfect one. i told him i loved him and he told me he loved me too. i thought i meant what i said. but once the postbreakup fog cleared i realised i had been kidding myself. i had to end things with this poor guy. i feel terrible that i led on someone as a 'rebound' just because of muddled thinking.

Right now, I care so much about living according to good values and principles and treating people with honesty, kindness, compassion and integrity. I am trying my best to live up to these principles but because of these secrets, i feel like an utter failure. idk what to do anymore. I keep trying to be the best person i can be but i feel like the past weighs me down. Idk if anyone has secrets as messed up as mine. i love my life in NY, it's great, but i hate myself.

To Start: My Mother in 2004 was Laid off from her Job in Ohio, and decided at 50 years old that it was time for a career change, and started going to school for Respiratory Care. During her Finals of her Graduating year, she was complaining of terrible headaches for over 2 weeks... It was shrugged off for a while because she thought they were stress headaches ( it was exam week )

We went to the ER finally, and turned out my mother had an Edema the size of my spread out palm in her head, this swelling was causing my mothers headaches.  After a week of trying to figure out what was causing the swelling, the CT did show a very small dot that everything was centered around, and the hospital decided to open up her skull and do a biopsy.  Well Turned out the Doctor Missed the spot, Mis Diagnosed her, Damaged her Speech Center, leaving her with a severe speech impediment, and later we find out from another doctor, that becaue of the small size, and location, that the previous doctor should never have even attempted that procedure... Later when we changed hospitals, she went through a procedure called Gama Knife, that removed the tumor in her head.  However before that, another doctor kept doing scans, because these types of things generally are a result of something else going on... and he found my mother had lung cancer, and that is what spread to her brain...

BTW side note... we couldn't sue for malpractice for 2 main reasons.  1. My mom since she was going to school and didn't have an income, couldn't file for loss wages etc. and 2. Ohio has some of the most strict malpractice laws, protecting the Doctor, and its capped at 200,000 dollars, the trial would have cost around 150,000 and because of her diagnoses ( given only 6 months to live ) no attorney would touch it.... we talked to 30 different attorneys...  Because of those limitations and because the defense could say "" well we tried our best, she is only gonna live 6 more months so we did what we could....."" So now the only income my mother has is her disablity, and doesn't qualify for medicaid.  But this post isn't about that...... 

So that doctor that found the lung cancer...My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer in Mid 2010 - She was a smoker, but turned out her house had an Unknown Radon Issue that was 24x the EPA's take action level. Which when combined with her smoking... all bad...

We started her on Chemothearpy, it worked great on the cancer, normally your body starts to reject the chemo and you switch to something else.  For 6 years that Chemo worked great, which is unusual, but a blessing! Well recently it stopped working, and we had to switch to another thearpy called "" Immunotherapy"" which jacks up your own Immune system so it can fight the cancer.  

Its doing that job great, her Lung Cancer has Shrunk Greatly..... but now, my mother developed a rare side effect where her Immune System is attacking Healthy Stuff, the condition after a liver biopsy confirmed she has Primary Biliary Cirrhosis which is treated at early stages with Ursodiol 300mg Capsules 3x a day... Problem is this drug can cost anywhere from $450 dollars to $700 dollars a month, and given that her only income is her Disablity which pays less than $1,000 a month... we cannot afford.

Thanks For Reading, and Any Tips on What we can do, to get some of her Meds Cheaper is very much needed!

264,"Yeah so I wanna get this off my chest, so I'm 16 living a pretty chill life in the UK. Throwback to xmas I broke up with my gf, it was pretty hard to deal with at the time because young love etc but the reason it ended was because she basically said some of the times we'd done sexual things, it was because she felt pressured because we were in a relationship that she did it, and she didn't want me to leave her. I was shocked, had basically been accused of rape at this point and then we stopped talking due to various reasons. On friday I had a girl walk up to me in the street, and right to my face just scream 'You're a rapist', 'You're disgusting', 'You should be in prison' in front of everyone. Then she talked about police involvement and my school was contacted saying I had been harassing my ex and her friends, the police could be called as I'd been accused of 'racial harassment' by a black girl and an asian girl. I had to tell my school all the intimate details of my relationship, it was like it died and I mourned, but they dug it back up and dissected it front of me, and criticised me for things that at the time seemed normal. I've been stressing for days, my parents found out everything and this is happening just before my exams and I'm so confused. My reputations been ruined, I'm known as 'That guy that raped that girl' and ngl I'm just worried about what my futures gonna be like with this to my name... It's not just something that's gonna fade away, it's a permanent mark on my character that won't leave me anytime soon, I just need some advice on what I can/should do thanks. 

TL:DR Accused of rape, unsure what to do, likely long lasting effects",22Mar2017,3

I was told by my parents to fire this guy (they don't speak English well enough to communicate with him because he doesn't speak English well enough either) - because he's been running late, breaking containers and such (we've had several containers break when he was working and never had that happen with other drivers.)

I know it's right to fire him, but I feel physically sick at the idea of firing someone. ",22Mar2017,1

268,"It's been about 3 years I've come out as an atheist, although it's more of a coming out to a close, trusty circle than a public declaration of my choice. One previous year of hovering around the limits of faith, asking questions and seeking answers, means I have spent about a sixth of my life as a nonbeliever. That's a lot, especially considering my family and country's strict religious state. My mother puts it squarely on the internet and my sudden obsession with psychology. However, I think there's another reason that might have contributed to the switch.

In the beginning of 2013 my country started a crackdown on the Islamic opposition party, and I, despite my non-participation, unfortunately got myself into a situation which I thought would get me killed. In reality it was probably nothing, but at one point I firmly thought that this would be it. I got free after a while but the anxiety would stick around. It got to a point where I felt like I completely confused a crackdown on a religious party with a crackdown on religion. I got frighteningly anxious and most of my dreams were about getting chased by the security people.

I struggled for a while, but then met a stranger over the internet who was quite well versed in the basics of psychology and literature. I fell in love, both with her wit and her ideas. I started talking to her about psychology and philosophical questions like ""who's really at fault for anything?"" This turned into some profound psychological breakthroughs and eventually had me entertaining ideas that questioned the religion. Gradually, this became the impetus for my eventual acceptance that God is a myth created by humans.

I've been much more intellectually active ever since, but then one day it hit me: the causes of my atheistic turn could be less rational than I thought it was. I tried to go back and find out whether it could've been the fear of sticking to my religion that eventually found an escape through the ""logical"" process of moving out of it. 

Has anyone ever gone through a similar issue where they changed one of their beliefs not entirely rationally, but out of fear? Has the thought of any kind of personal or social consequence influenced these changes? Is there any psychological, philosophical, or any other kind of academic definition for a bias (if that's what it is?) like this?",22Mar2017,1
269,"I'm a 22 year old man with schizotypal behavioral disorder.

I don't have any friends. Just aquantainces. No one who I can really talk to one on one. Except my cousin but he is family.

I am a virgin and never had a girlfriend.

I was bullied and outcasted through out all my school years. I never really had any true friends that cared about me or wanted to see me or call me up or anything. Never went to parties.

I'm in college now. Haven't made a single friend. I joined one club but I hate everyone. Everyone makes me nervous and scared. I feel like just not going anymore due to anxiety.

I feel worthless. I have horrible humiliation fetishes involving being raped by men even though I'm straight. This bothers me, big secret. Lot of shame.

I just sort of want to give up and become and alcoholic and die of alcohol poisoning or something. I'm just really tired.

I don't feel happy. I've never been happy.

I do go to therapy. But it is a very slow process.

271,"so, I'm an urban/street photographer, and I have some friends from high school (more like acquaintances) that constantly ask me to bring them to these rooftops/abandoned places. the reason I am hesitant in bringing them is because with more traffic = more unwanted attention = places being shut down = ruining good photo spots for people like me. how do I let them know that I can't simply just 'bring them with me'? thanks!

272,"Hello [F] 18 here, In my senior year of highschool. I need some advice. So the problem is, I hate school. I have had nothing lower than an 88 average in all four years of my highschool, and that's me not trying / on a bad day.  However, I don't like going to school anymore. I used to like school , a lot actually until I realized that the curriculum is complete bullshit and I took my exams half way through the year, without even finishing the courses and got all 90s. I don't feel like I'm learning anything new, I don't feel challenged and I don't feel the environment inspires me to live my life, I only feel forcefully indoctrinated and I would really like to go to college.

273,"Hello.
I'm not sure of the proper etiquette so I'll add a warning here that this post is about sexual abuse.

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Forgive me if I sound blunt, I find it easiest to discuss it this way.

So I'm 20 and I was sexually abused by a family friend from the age of 7 until I was 10. In general, it doesn't really affect my daily life anymore. But I'm nowhere near over it. It has been a large contributing factor to my poor mental health.

I'd like to ask for some advice/perspectives on my current situation. 
This family friend is my mum's best friend's son. My brother considers him to be like his own brother. I used to think of him as a brother too, when I was even younger.

Today, I spoke to him on the phone. It's the first time I've spoken to him since I last saw him when I was 10. My brother had come outside while I was smoking and put him on loud speaker. He told me to say hello. I felt that I had to, so as not to make my brother suspicious. If I had refused, he would have wondered why and I haven't got any good excuses. I definitely cannot ever tell my brother what happened. He would be heartbroken and truthfully, I'm not sure he would even believe me. Of course this guy couldn't leave it at 'hello' and we had a brief conversation to the tune of 'how are you' etc.

After this, I went indoors and puked. For me, I'd basically forgotten what his voice sounded like. It makes my memories feel more real. I can clearly hear the things he said, instead of just remembering the words. I called my best (and literally only) friend. She has experienced something similar and we've been there for each other before so I expected her to help me calm down. She's usually very good at calming me down. But this time her reaction was pretty much 'and?'. She didn't seem to understand why I was upset even as I tried to explain. 
I also mentioned my concerns of seeing him in person, a very real possibility considering his connection to my brother. My other brother is getting married later in the year and there is a chance that this guy will be there. I genuinely don't know if/how I will cope seeing him again. But that's another matter. Her response was simply that I just shouldn't go. I told her I didn't have a choice, it's my brother's wedding. But she said that I do have a choice, that I always had a choice. She said she never had a choice, as her abuser lived with her and she still sees him regularly. She said that I could have just hidden or left the house whenever my abuser came over.

I understand her point, but I can't get into blaming myself right now ontop of everything else. That can be dealt with later. It's more that her reactions made me feel that she was saying she had it worse than me, it was maybe my own fault and that I shouldn't be so upset about just hearing his voice.

Reddit, do you agree with her opinions? Am I being pathetic? I do feel that after all these years I should be over it, but every time I think I am something else brings it back. I wish I could be over it, but I don't really know how. If you guys think that I'm being stupid for being upset, do you have any suggestions about how I could change my views or something?

I've had/am having therapy for my psychiatric problems. I haven't ever really found it helpful though.

277,"I guess I should start by saying my cosmetology program is in California. We're required to finish 1600 hours before ""graduating"", and then taking our state board test after is what gets us our license.
My program is 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day. We work on clients 4 out of 5 days we are there, with the remaining day to be for studying. 

I know that we are required by law to take a 30 minute lunch that we have to clock out for, however, my school has made it so it's an hour. If, by chance, it comes up where they overbook us (it happens a LOT) and we are unable to clock out for a full hour, the admin goes in and adjusts our clock out times to be an hour, regardless if we are working on a client or not. 

My question is, since it only has to be 30 minutes, is it illegal that my school is going in (without telling us, we all just found this policy out) and adjusting the hours? Especially since most of the time we are with a client and can't just up and leave for a full hour. Sometimes the processing time (generally 35 minutes) is all we can afford to do. ",22Mar2017,1
278,"Alright, I know everybody asks themselves this, but my mind is on a constant loop of possibilities and logistics and I thought it might be nice to get some third-party advice. 

In May I will be graduating with two bachelors degrees in Anthropology and Humanities. I have fantastic grades, lots of extra-curriculars, study-abroad experience, etc. I had originally been planning on going to graduate school to get a PhD, but it's a huge commitment and I don't even know what subject I would go for. On top of this, I'm not interested in traveling right now and I've recently developed stress-induced health problems, so I'm trying to pursue a future that is not too stressful. So here are my questions: 

1. If I do go to graduate school, what the heck should I focus in? I don't want to live in a foreign country (I have a dog that I am very dedicated to) so going into Anthropology is a bit complicated for that reason and I am hesitant to join the ever-growing horde of unemployed PhD recipients looking for a teaching job. I've thought about library science, but I don't know what the job market is like for librarians. So more generally.. what kinds of masters degrees can actually land me with a job while simultaenously satisfying my love for knowledge?

2. If I don't go to graduate school, what kind of jobs could I do that I wouldn't hate? Right now I'm about to be placed in a desk job as an administrative assistant for a local company, but that's not exactly the dream.

279,"Hello, I'm an 18 y.o. student of electronics(computer electronics and programming to be precise).

Since my childhood video games have been my passion(that and planets, space!), I always wanted to make one myself, but as there's no career path which relies solely on programming, I had to choose this one where electronics of the computer(the hardware) is combined with the programming(from how to program the components to work to making software on a not so advanced level).
The problem is that the 2 major components of my career - electronics and programming are making me want to cry, as I understand neither of those - I try to write a simple code, doesn't work the way I wanted it to, I try to learn a circuit, analyze it, and think I understood it, then I show up in class and turns out I got it all wrong!

Consulting my professors won't help as they're not interested, they mostly come to the work so they can get paid, whilst the material we study is old, some stuff used over 20 years ago, and not just that, we're studying stuff we don't meet with in computers(be it hardware or software) - lots of subjects we ""learn"". So we're left on our own.
I am trying hard, but failing every time, now I do know the basics(at least I hope I've learnt them in the right way), but every time I apply a law(like Ohm's law) it turns out that I somehow apply it wrong. Or if I write a program which writes the text x times using a loop it either doesn't show it x times or it simply crashes...This gets me so hard, so nervous I get depressed a lot of times...I have even tried changing my perspective, my point of view, but I either can't achieve it or don't get it with that other one as well.
I really like building stuff, assembling PCs is one of my favourite things(that and astronomy as I said earlier), making video games seems a lot of fun(when you actually know how to do it, as I fail at programming), but I keep running into dead ends. I am seriously considering changing my career, but as my other love ""astronomy"" doesn't offer me any job in this country, plus the chance is higher I might fail at it as well as my math knowledge is not that great(analytical geometry doesn't agree with me).
