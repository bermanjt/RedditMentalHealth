0,"Like the title says. The other night I was walking to meet up with some friends in a pretty well off and safe neighborhood in (insert city name here). Within seconds of me getting out of my car I heard heavy footsteps and ""get on the ground n****"". I was pistolwhipped and laid on the ground with a gun to my head while the assailants rummaged through my pockets taking my phone, wallet, and keys. 

Two days later and I have barely left the house. I tried being in public today and had a panic attack. I couldn't even drink water I was shaking so bad. I don't want to leave my house. I don't want my doors to ever be unlocked. I am a rape survivor and have already struggled with PTSD from that and now I'm worried that those issues are going to resurface.

There has been an outpouring of support since this happened. I am very appreciative of that, to know that I have that many people who care about me. I'm afraid of asking anybody else about this or admitting my fears. I don't want to be the victim. I can't help but be a victim.",06Mar2017,2
6,"I started a class back in December. I was the only student who has never had this professor. He is buddies with everyone else. With it now being march, I don't think he likes me. Sure, I shouldn't care what someone thinks but it's hard because I'm a sensitive person and like to have connections with my professors. He is the only one that the connection just isn't there. Well here is what's happened that makes me feel disliked. I would present my work and he just says ""cool, good"" but someone else does and he gives a long speech about wow this is great! Another time the whole class were talking about let's just say traveling. And I chime in and the room goes silent. He just ignores me and says something to someone else that has nothing to do with what I said. Another time, we have this app on our phones where we all communicate about the class project. I chime in and get NO responses but everyone else gets a thumbs up and comment back on their thoughts. I've honestly given up. Everyone likes him but I don't see why. He isn't grading me unfairly. Not that I know of that is. So that's a plus, hopefully. I need advice on how to stop caring about trying to get a ""you're a cool student"" vibe from him. ",06Mar2017,1

16,"Yesterday I was having lunch at a local restaurant. The parking lot right outside the front door has two sections: an upper and lower section with nothing but a 4-foot-tall retaining wall between them (no protective fence.) I was parked in the lower lot right next to the retaining wall.

Another driver, 90 years old, was in the upper lot, trying to turn around. He backed over the wall, tumbled over the edge, flipped over and landed upside down on top of my car. The end result is [here](

I wasn't injured (wasn't even in the car.) The other driver was hospitalized, but did carry insurance so that part should work out. My car was still drivable and I got it safely to a body shop.

I've never talked with the girl, but i always thought she was very beautiful.

The years have passed, one day i take the bus like always and he was in the next seat.. he tries to start a conversation and i freak out because she is very beatiful.
I only answer yes and no i couldn't even smile, in that moment i remember me thinking ""im nervous if i smile maybe she is going to think that im a creepy guy"" .
So i only answer with a yes and i started reading my book.

And now i always find her in the same bus at he same hour... 

I know she likes harry potter books cause she always wear a slytherin hoodie.

19,"So I am doing my master's in ecology, and I hate it. It's not just that it's hard and I don't want to do homework and sit in class, my heart is just not in it. My adviser hired me to find out why this lake suddenly had no fish, and I found out that it totally does have fish, then I found out that the reason they thought it didn't was someone made a mistake when counting the fish by looking in the wrong area. So there's nothing really to be concerned about, and I have no idea how to go about it. Also my adviser has no time for me and I have no resources to do the things I want to do. 

I don't really feel that working fisheries ecology is what I want to do anymore. It's just so much of confirming what we already know, being ignored by the industry, and being blamed when things go wrong. Science for the sake of science doesn't interest me anymore, it's too masturbatory. I wanted to make the world a better place, but screaming into the void or/and chasing after funding for the rest of my life doesn't feel like that will be helping the world at all.

I wish to god I had had the confidence to just go for it and try for medical school instead of telling myself I'd never make it and to set my sights lower onto just doing these mostly meaningless wildlife assessments in Canada. Like right now the biggest legacy I can hope for is a slight alteration to the number of salmon your neighbour who goes fishing on weekends can keep in a day.

All my courses are exactly opposite to where my strengths are and I am worried they will destroy my GPA, and preclude me entirely from getting into medical school. At the moment I'm just barely in the running, but under the right conditions I can still make it in and then I know I'd be great at it.

I don't really know what the right thing to do is here, I just know that every fiber of my being is screaming that I do not belong where I am. The best option as far as medical school is to drop out now before my grades come in and ruin everything. Then I could just focus on building up my non-academics (like volunteering), studying for the MCAT, working, and pursuing hobbies I have no time for now. If I did that, I could be ready to apply in September, and I'd be starting the following September. I would be 31. Alternatively I stay in my master's, graduate when I'm 32, then either apply for med school and start at 33, being totally worn out and ready for death, likely with a destroyed GPA. Either that or I get the master's and look for work using my master's.

I keep feeling like I'm just looking for permission to leave my master's when I know it's what I want to to do. Everyone is telling me to stick it out, and I know that it would be the responsible thing to do, but the last time I was in this situation I said ""fuck off"" to the nay-sayers and it worked out great; here's the story:

I was studying Tourism because I had chronically low self esteem in my early 20s, and I hated it. I wanted to study science, and my friends, teachers, parents, guidance counselors all said ""look, you're a year out from graduating, then you'll have a degree. Then you can decide what you want to do."" and I said ""I don't belong here, I don't see myself using this degree, fuck this, I'm going after what I want!"" So I started teaching myself math (never took it past grade 10 so wasn't eligible for a science degree), got in, worked hard, and got good grades, won awards and scholarships, got into a better school, and graduated with an offer for a master's. It wasn't easy, but I made it happen because I believed in myself. Why can't I do that again?

Here's the thing though, in Tourism I was fucking *mailing* it in and getting straight A's. I was not being challenged. Right now, I am being challenged too much. It's not that I'm not smart - I know I am - it's just that statistical models and these abstract mathematical concepts are where my weaknesses all lie. Lab work, people skills, memorization, and critical thinking are where my strengths are, and my strengths are very strong in those areas. I would make an exemplary doctor, I know this. Every time I floated the idea throughout my undergrad I was encouraged by people that I should go for it, but low self esteem kept following me around saying ""you wanted to be a fisheries scientist, stay on that path. You'll never make it into med school, don't even try."" I didn't want to fully accept it, so I took all the pre-med courses I could in addition to ecology courses. If I had focused on one over the other, I would have probably had a higher GPA and been better off, but here we are.

So my gut says I need to quit, follow my heart, make it happen. I know there's a HUGE possibility I won't be able to make it happen, and it would be nice to have a MSc to fall back on, but trying to get my MSc might result in making it totally impossible to get into medical school. I mean I could try to get in for the next 2 years, and say if I don't get in in 2 years I go back to grad school (no reason to suspect I wouldn't be able to, being that the 2 years I'd spend trying to get into med would still involve lots of scientific work and volunteering, so I should be able to get into any program I apply to, or get a decent job). I just really hate where I'm at right now and would be happier doing almost anything else. I feel like I shouldn't have to justify my choices to anyone, or have anyone's permission or blessing or agreement to do what I feel is right, and I shouldn't have to justify it to myself. I hate quitting, but this isn't like ""I want to quit cause it's too hard"", it's ""I want to quite because I feel like I'm wasting my time and I know my talents are being wasted and would be put to better use elsewhere."" I could do well here with enough effort, but if my heart isn't in it, why should I force it? Getting through undergrad was hard 99% of the time, but I persevered and worked hard and made it because I was motivated. I never felt like it was a mistake or like I was on the wrong path, even in moments of doubt I knew I was doing the right thing. I don't feel that way now. I feel like I did in the tourism school, my talents are being wasted, I have no future here, my heart is pulling me in a different direction.

**So that's my story. (TL;DR)** I want to be a big fat quitter, disappoint dozens of people, then wrench my whole being into the highest high of high gears to chase an almost impossible dream. I don't know if my heart will let me do anything else.",06Mar2017,1

32,"I've known my friend that we'll call ""A"" since my freshman year of highschool, so thats about 6 years now. And over the years we've all had our fun with drugs and alcohol and all that shit, in moderation and as much as any highschooler does. But I've noticed that since this car accident that we both almost died in, he has changed and become heavily addicted to drugs (xanax, painkillers), as well as becoming a compulsive liar and losing his awareness of how to act in social situations.

He used to be a pretty smart kid and still somewhat is, he had good grades in school and everyone always thought he was funny and knowledgeable. He attended a 4 year school right after high school but dropped out during the first semester because he was failing, but lied about it and said it was due to financial problems, but his roommate said it was because of drugs and how he was failing. I know that after the car accident (which was summer of 2014) he went through his pain medication prescription within a week. Since then, it has slowly become apparent to me that he has a problem. I started really noticing about march/april of last year (2016). He started popping xanax very heavily throughout the day, most I have witnessed being about 16 bars. Yes, 16. He continuously has used them taking multiple bars per day. 

Needless to say, his habits have taken a toll on our friendship. The xanax has made him forget conversations we've had, as well as things we have done or things he's said to me. I constantly have to repeat things to him throughout the day, often leading to the same conversations we have had in the past. His driving is reckless, and he has gotten into at least 2 car accidents in the past year. 

I cant hangout with him in public without him making an ass out of his self. He's completely unaware of his surroundings when he's out and about. whenever he's speaking hes almost screaming and slurring his words and doing so really slow. He crashed his car a few times and showed up to my parents' house drooling and slurring his words and making up 2 or 3 stories to them before sticking to one. 

His lying has also gotten out of control. I won't list every lie he's ever told, but it's to the point where he lies about the drugs he takes when it's clearly obvious he is severely fucked up.

My mom helped get him a job but he fucked that up because he was unable to perform. Mind you, the job was incredibly simple and he got fired within a week because of the obvious drug use. His coworkers all thought he was mildly retarded, which was the only reason he stayed even a week.

I don't know what to do. In the past I have told him that he needs to get help and that he has a problem, and each time he has denied it or has said he doesn't even do drugs ""that much anymore"". My mom has told him that he can come to us anytime if he ever needs help, but he refuses. Once, my mom checked him into rehab and he checked himself out the same day. Some of my friends say to cut him off, some say to still be a friend. But at this point I don't know how to help my friend. Any advice is appreciated.

38,"I have a friend who I have known for a long time now, maybe 6 years, and she recently confessed her feelings to me saying she loves me. I don't know for how long she's felt that way, I didn't ask, but now she keeps saying things that are confusing the heck out of me and I don't know how to feel about her OR my own feelings.

First, I was *convinced* she was straight as a ruler this whole time because she would only talk about guys. I never thought of her like that until the past couple of months (she started getting flirtatious around January) because of it. But now she's started saying things such as ""why does my family always think I'm gay"" - I dunno, I mean you apparently love me, me who is a girl? That's pretty gay, even if you aren't 100% that. Maybe just for me, who knows, but it's kind of gay on its own. That keeps confusing me. She confessed her love for me, but she's never expressed any want to date me either, other than saying she almost called me her girlfriend out loud once.. maybe she's ashamed? In denial? Embarrassed? Heck, too shy despite feeling more comfy with me now she's told me? I mean I understand, you can love someone without wanting to date them if life is busy or something, but all it's done is wrack my mind because I don't know if she even cares how I feel about her, she actually didn't even ask, or if it even matters at all if she doesn't even want to be with me like that.

Second, she's always being very affectionate and kind towards me, always wanting to talk to me, always demanding selfies from me, and I'm the same back, but as mentioned above she's said things like ""[some context] is why I don't date"" and after some guy tried to get her to be his valentines date she showed me she crossed out a goal in a notebook which was ""get a relationship"" and that's been on my mind ever since too. But in the same damn sentence she'll call me babe or be flirtatious and I just don't know what to think.

I think I feel the same way about her, I catch my mind subconsciously wanting to say ""I love you"" to her at times or feeling like cuddling her and it surprises me when it happens, I've stayed up deadass until 10am talking to her for weeks on end, all after a full days of talking to her anyway because she's my favourite. But because of her.. I dunno, weird way of treating this my feelings are foggy, kind of muddled. Can't quite understand them yet.  I recently talked about this to someone taking a psychology course I think and he suggested that she might be trying to make me interested in her by ""taking herself off the market"" so to speak, which sounded.. like it made sense. He said it was immature of her and that I shouldn't go for her until she matures a bit and decides what she wants. She's been mentioning stuff out of nowhere about others sending her nudes or a friend being touchy feely with her, almost as if she's trying to make me jealous because she knows I'm a jealous person (it's freaking working but I don't let that show since it's damn immature of her.) I'm paranoid she's going to lose interest in me by the time I figure my feelings out, which I think are leaning towards feeling the same way. 

Any opinions here, on her or how she's acting, anything? Am I putting too much thought into it like I usually do? Am I wrong to be kinda pissed at her for it? I'd talk to her about it but as soon as you bring up anything serious with her she clams up and I can't get anything out of her and it's fuckin' annoying, so I'm taking it to reddit. This is seriously messing with my depression. Sorry for such a looooong post, my brain just has so many thoughts going on rn.",06Mar2017,2
42,"For the last few years I've distanced myself from a lot of my friends. I deal with a lot of social anxiety and it's really hard for me to keep in touch with people. I guess I feel like I'm not worthy of their friendship. Anyways, I've realized this and decided to try and rekindle some friendships that I've let go that once meant a lot to me.
One in particular meant something significant. We didn't know each other for long but I really felt like we clicked and I felt more and more comfortable with her. I genuinely valued her opinion and when we had a fight and subsequent falling out, it really took a toll on me. I knew I hurt her, and i never knew how to apologize. 
I've recently added her back on facebook in hopes to explain how sorry I am etc. Maybe it's been so long she doesn't even care anymore. I don't really know.

44,"This is gonna be a long and very confusing rant but I'll try my best to keep it simple. 

Ok, so my ""best"" friend (24 F) and I (24 F) have been friends since secondary school (high school equivalent) and although we drifted as we left and went to college and then her onto university 4 years ago we got our closeness back. We went on a girly holiday and reconnected after many nights of one on one time. Since then we have been inseparable, being a solid shoulder for each other whenever we needed it and just your typical best friend relationship. 

Well also 4 years ago I got with my now Fiancé (Let's call him D) who I've known for 14 years and was my teenage love/crush and she was so happy for me. Fast forward 3 and a half years and she's now in a year long relationship with her teen crush who happens to be my D's best friend. All well and good right? Sure it is! We go on double dates, this is her first relationship and shes over the moon! 
So on my birthday last year while away in Greece D proposed, obviously I said yes and now 8 months later I'm pregnant! Now, I thought my best friend was ecstatic for me when I got engaged, and I expected her to be the same when she found out I'm gonna be a mom. This doesn't seem to be the case. 

Since finding out she's become so distant, she's barely speaking to me and when she has she has made some very abrasive unwanted comments about my pregnancy one of which was at 8-9 weeks I shouldn't be too excited about being pregnant and shouldn't buy anything cause I might lose it. Bare in mind when I was 19 I had a miscarriage and it destroyed me so it's not something you expect to hear coming from your best friend. It seriously upset me and my fiancè was piiiiissed. Neither of us said anything to her about it other than I made it quite clear that she had no idea what she was speaking about. There has been other comments too but that was the main one, since she's been distant though and not answering a lot of my messages D has opened up about when he told her he was gonna propose and she didn't seem all that enthused about it at all. The only thing she seemed to care about was 'being a bridesmaid' and likewise with the pregnancy she wants to be called auntie and be in charge of a baby shower. His theory is she is only ever interested in any news anyone has when she or her bf benefits from it. For example being a bridesmaid and having an auntie title. 

Also she seems to look down on our relationship and sees hers as superior to ours and others in our friendship group which I think is abit shitty. I mean they've been together a year it's still relatively new, be proud by all means but don't act like you're better than other people. 

I dunno I can't tell if I'm over reacting with my hormones and being upset for nothing or if she is actually being a shit friend to me? Like I've got friends I've not seen or spoken to in years texting me and asking how my pregnancy is going and when my midwife appointments and scans are when's he knows about them in advance and doesn't ask how they have gone? I'm getting prepared to not have her around very much at all once the baby is here which is a shame when I thought she would be happy for me like I would be for her if the roles were reversed. 

Any input on this would be great or if you want more info feel free to ask. I THINK I'M GOING CRAZY.",06Mar2017,1
46,"I'm not sure if there's a more accurate subreddit for my question than r/advice, but I figured I'd try this one. I'm a female and I'm 20 years old. I currently work a job that pays 18 an hour, however I'm fairly miserable. I work for a small business owner and it's just her and me all day, and she's just extremely narcissistic and degrading to the point of me dreading going to work on monday (such as I am tonight.) There aren't any benefits. I don't get any paid time off for vacation or sick days (meaning if I need a doctors appointment I can't shift my hours or take a sick day, I just lose money.) No insurance of any kind, and I rarely get 40 hours a week. She used to have a rule where if she chose to leave early for a day that I would get paid the 9-5 hours, but she took that back so I usually wind up with around 35 hours a week now. I also drive 35 minutes to work one way, something I didn't take into consideration before switching jobs last year. 

I left my job at a bank that I loved where I was making 13.50 an hour to work for her, because she seemed like she valued my intellect and offered me so much money. But slowly over time it went from a job as a personal assistant to more of a cleaning lady. I'd say my job is about 80% cleaning her store and 20% deskwork/paperwork/business work now. 

I've commited to the idea of starting college in august, and had been planning to quit shortly before school started and get a part time job while in college, but I've been wondering if I should quit sooner. All of my friends currently work for a division of american airlines, and honestly they've been having the time of their lives for the last year. Their major benefit to their (low paying) job is that they get free travel (maui/cancun/puerto rico/new zealand/st martin) , and I've honestly never seen any of them happier. 

I know it's not something that can be sustained forever, no one can goof off and have fun for their whole lives...but as a 20 year old who can count how many parties she's been to in her whole life on one hand, is this worth doing? Would it be a terrible decision for me to get a job at the airline my friends work at and just go enjoy my life? even if it means making less money?

(it's worth noting I still live at home with family right now so bills aren't a huge issue really, I just have phone/car/insurance/food/gas/clothing/gym membership...Even my normally sensible father has suggested I try to get a job at the airline with my friends, seeing how much I dread going back to work every day.)",06Mar2017,2
48,"I'm hitting a low and have no one to talk to or anyone I feel I can trust with out feeling as if they are going to judge me. By the title, I can see why you would be quick to judge. But I'm desperate for help and anonymous. Here's the story:

So, 3 years ago my (first) boyfriend and I broke up. We were together for 3 years. I broke up with him and realized too late that it was a mistake. He dated a girl and a few months ago they broke up. Now, two years into a different relationship and I'm engaged. WHAT!? Let's talk about that for a minute, I do not want to get married for a while and he knows that. We've talked about it. It happened way too fast. At the time of proposal, we haven't been together for 2 years. It was across the country and I had never been on a plane before and I struggle from bad anxiety. I was struggling with going or not going on this trip. I was talking to my, now fiance, about not going and he was MAD. He then angrily told me he was going to propose and I told him I was unsure about that. He then proceeded to tell me that I WAS going and I would say yes so, he didn't embarrass himself in front of people. So after that discussion, I was felt very pressured into the whole thing. I mean, who wouldn't? 
Anyways, now we have been engaged for almost 4 months now and I am 4 months deep in a depression. For the past 3 years, I don't think there has been a day pass by that I haven't thought about my ex. I was truly happy for him when he was dating the previous girl and I thought he hated me. But 3 days ago he started following me on instagram, which made me think he doesn't hate me anymore. This has sent me into a frenzy of feelings. 
I don't know if my feelings of being unsure about being engaged has made me think about my ex more and I'm remembering the good times we had or if I'm actually still in love with him. 
Help. I need a friend.

50,"Some context: I've known her for a long time, but we just recently got close. She's 17, her brother is 14. She was adopted at age 13.

There's been issues for a while, but I'm just starting to hear about them. I'm just going to list them, because I never really get stories, just snippets.

Her mom found a fifth in her room (which was her brothers), and she got thrown under the bus for it, mom wouldn't believe her. So she took her phone away. 

I'm not sure what lead up to it, but her brother out of context told her that their mom was going to send her to an adoption facility (whatever it's called) hundreds of miles away. 

She got in an accident (icy roads, wasn't bad at all but she got a ticket), so her mom took her license from her. This was like a month ago, hasn't gotten it back yet.

On wednesday her mom tried to get her to leave. It was like 10pm. Not for good, just leave the house. She told her to get a friend to pick her up and just get out. She couldn't get a ride, but the next day I took her to my house and she was here until saturday. She heard (from her brother) that her mom didn't want to see her at all this weekend. 

She went home on sunday to try to make amends with her mom. Didn't go well, her brother took her journal(/diary, very personal things she doesn't tell anyone) and read it with his friends (which includes her ex). Her parents read it as well. She tried to get it back, he called her a dumb cunt. Parents wouldn't help, she still doesn't have it.


Basically, nobody in her family respects her and from what I hear, she's emotionally mistreated on a daily basis. I'm usually the guy that always has good advice &amp; knows what to do, but I'm blank. I was the one that suggested she tried to patch things up with her mom, but even that just made things worse.

She's seeing a counselor, that coupled with talking things out with me has helped her a lot with the confidence and security issues that come with constantly being with people that have no respect for you (these are not assumptions, these are things she's told me), but I really want to help her home life improve, she shouldn't have to live like that.",06Mar2017,1

52,"I had just been to the Mohammad Ali memorial where I witnessed the power of one character operating for the greater good. I went down to lay my dad's Viet Nam service medal on Ali's memorial as he had asked me to along with a note saying the Champ was right. I didn't know I would wind up meeting Ali's brother, Rahman, and that my dad's medal would go next to a story about Ali returning from the Rome Olympics a gold medal champion. About how when he came home he went to the local restaurant and was refused service. Ali broke into tears and told his brother they don't respect us. The two supposedly went to the bridge spanning across the Ohio River and threw the medal in. It felt like a big trip, a transformative one. I was looking forward to getting home to my partner of seven years and be beside him and tell him the details of all the people and faiths. I had a weird dark feeling come over me as I got close to home. I couldn't describe it other than a dark feeling moved in over me. I walked through the door and Robert was standing there showered and sheepish. We were supposed to go to my family's reunion. I told him maybe we should stay home it was a long trip. That night I laid next to him, the dark feeling still hurting inside when his phone pinged. We had been dealing with his ex-wife, she was seeking full custody of their daughter. Months earlier I was nearly given a heart attack with a sheriff at the door looking for Robert to serve him papers. I couldn't understand where her feelings were coming from or why this was happening. I could think of nothing more intrusive or insulting as I have aimed to give all I have to home and hearth. I could only think that I had recently discovered that Robert was stealing from my bank account. That those tough times got back to her and she was looking for any reason to get her daughter away from him.  He made a practice of kissing me  on the forehead in the morning and telling me to have a good day. I was always groggy but thankful he was there. I learned later he was checking my pulse, sneaking my card out of my wallet and helping himself. He would tiptoe back in to return all in place. I was angry about this, as we are not married and I carried all of the financial responsibility of the home along with the care of my three children and his daughter when she was with us. I chalked this up to garden variety relationship issues that we could get over. Returning from the trip I felt maybe we would become one of those strong relationships that weathers the storm. After the arrival of the sheriff I let Robert know I would be checking his emails. Bad I know....but I didn't want their trouble to escalate and hoped to navigate any poor communication between the two of them. Basically, I was hoping to keep Robert in check as he had a way of enraging Julie. He told me fine, go ahead. When the phone pinged it was no big news but I looked to see if she had written. Instead I found ten different solicitations going out to sex workers specifically black women and white men. (not to specify by race but latter I would learn about his objectification of black women when one night while watching a movie Robert leaned into a friend and in front of the his said - hey John wouldn't you like to screw a young black chic?). I was in disbelief. I turned on the bedroom light and asked him to leave my home. I pulled the covers off of him and said he needed to go - that he was a threat to my home and my health. I grabbed two trash bags and in silence threw all of his things in bags and put them in the back of his car. Women's exposed breasts with fuck me now, a man's penis hanging out of his jeans with a MFM. Months earlier on Easter he shot someone. He had a job to do for his new boss. It was a re-do on an art installation and required going in at midnight on the holiday. I had just returned form NYC where I had taken my kids on spring break. I was also just hoping to give Robert and I some space as his behavior was becoming more diabolic. I had the flu and was quarantining myself in a side room. He told me I needed to get the fuck over myself and go help him. I said I would if I weren't so sick. He left for my studio to grab supplies of mine. Within the hour he was back. He burst into the house and threw a small antique 22 parlor pistol on the bench saying he just shot a 88888 don't tell anyone! He kept running in and out of the front door saying don't fucking tell anyone. I was afraid to utter a word. I was afraid of him. He is tall and skinny and at times effeminate. I had never feared him before. I called my former husband and told him with a lost voice what Robert just came in with. He told me obviously you call the police. I put my phone on speaker out of concern if I spoke he might do something or go more manic. After some time he called the police and asked if they could work out the details another time he had stuff to do. I was shocked...he could have potentially mortally wounded someone and he is telling the police to make a rain check. The police told him too bad your gun wasn't bigger and held more bullets. Only three weeks earlier he told me he beat up two men outside of my studio. His sentences were not making total sense...I couldn't organize his words in my mind other than he beat two thugs portion. That time I raced down at 1:30am to get to him not sure what I would find. When I arrived it had been snowing. The ground was pristine no sign of a scuffle and Robert was inside his car listening to Creep on repeat.  He had been drinking. I told him I would be at home. Most of our years together were relatively good but peppered with lies and small deceptions. I always got over those. He kept telling me he wanted to be together - bring our families together - put a ring on my finger. I liked working with him as an artist so always put the behavior on the side and chalked it up to immaturity. We had many successful ventures out with the art. We work well in the studio. I'm seven years down the line now and realize I have been bilked out of 90K like a slow leak, he is now a direct competitor to what I do for a living, he was never going to come through and make good on meeting me half way. I helped restyle his image with a haircut, suggested a beard and a new suit. Taught him about the international art fairs. Now he has a 70k job and a 1200/mo loft downtown. He tells me too bad you aren't better looking - you would get away with more stuff - like a model. He still tells me he is doing all of this work to bring it back around to keeping us together then by nightfall he is sending me pictures of his penis with my name written in red across the image and posting it to his Instagram Page - then telling me he has met someone - better with you but I met someone. With Craigslist he told me he was hacked. With my bank account he told me I was hacked, then later that they were undiscussed loans and finally that it was my fault for not paying attention. Somewhere in there was the women's march. It was important to me to go - my daughter was marching in Seattle and my best friend in LA plus the entire country and international citizenry ...I wanted to experience the harmonics....but Robert came to my house that night around 2am drunk telling me about a party he had been to and the women he wanted to F... He told me I was a stupid b.... that I do everything wrong. I was curled up under my pillows begging him to leave that I needed to sleep. I got him out the door but then he broke back in acting like the mad hatter. I did not make it to the march. I have felt lost in the infinite lately, down on myself and my age of 46, down on my stupidity for wanting to believe in this person and guilty for letting a man like that into my children's lives. I feel guilty for that money going to a con man, a grifter vs my children. I feel tired as I have worked pretty hard already and wonder how many times do I have to rally and reinvent optimism. I feel very alone. My children will all be gone in a few months and my home will be empty. Nothing built with a partner. No partner to know what memories were built in this house. The love of these children and the magic that they have been over these years. No witness to what I believe to be the most important stuff in life - home, hearth, children wearing out the woodwork. The first time I had Robert to my house I sat him on the front porch first. I explained these values and hopes and said if this isn't also what you are about then please don't cross through my door. Those close to him tell me to forget the past that people make mistakes. I feel like I am in a nightmare....what ever happened to holding people accountable? What happened to character and respect for a mother and for children? I carried him for seven years he is far better off as a result....me I'm afraid...afraid I have no bounce left. ",06Mar2017,1

My boyfriend and I currently live in the same town as my parents.  It is a reasonably nice small to medium sized midwestern city.   I have a good job by most standards, though there are many aspects of it I don't like - inherent things that are highly unlikely to change anytime soon.   My parents both have chronic medical problems, nothing acute or fatal in the immediate future, but visiting us in another state is out of the question for them.  

Both my boyfriend and I greatly miss living in the southwest (we lived there previously for a couple of years).  We both miss the weather, sunshine, and outdoor activities - things we simply cannot have in the midwest.  I could probably get a job there that would be more palatable and pay well, though not as much as my current one.  There are direct flights between here and there (about two hours).  Also, I have three siblings who live here and are unlikely to relocate anytime soon.

59,I have been in a very strong relationship with my SO for over 4 years. I absolutely love him and I know he absolutely loves me. We have been through thick and thin together and are still very much in love. But I have recently befriended a guy my age and I've realized I am very much attracted to him. The problem with being in a long term relationship is you know your partners faults in and out. This guy I have befriended seems to be very strong in the places my SO falls short. This is probably why I find him attractive. I'm sure this guy has plenty of faults of his own but I feel guilty for being attracted to him. I would never cheat on my boyfriend but I have also allowed this new friend to fill a lot of the time my boyfriend is not around. Just as friends chatting though.

64,"I've really liked areas such as programming and hobby electronics, especially when I've taken courses on them. As soon as I get past the basics, though, and am expected to start taking on smaller projects, or expanding my knowledge outside of guided instruction, I fall flat.

I get anxious and overwhelmed with how much there is out there, and I have trouble just picking something, especially when a lot of skills build off of other skills. I have trouble finding projects that interest me creatively, and have only really flourished when information is given to me in a structured, cumulative way. For example, I took programming courses in high school and university, and absolutely loved them, but outside of class, I found it hard to pursue them in the same way.

I'm a reddit lurker by nature, and I guess that's why I have and likely always will come here for answers before any degree-toting ""professional."" I like this more, because strangers have nothing to lose, so they aren't prone to bullshitting you know? 
Alright, here we go. I'm an eighteen year old girl and I've got an exam in the morning. That seems irrelevant, but stress triggers anxiety and I've only just started taking Saint John's so it hits me pretty hard. Anyway, this weekend I basically isolated myself from everyone due to my stress levels. I really like to be alone, to take walks, to think. I love my friends of course but I value my space and my privacy immensely. 
Um, so that's just some background information I guess. What I'd really like to ask is why I feel this innate desire to shove everyone away. I do it all the time, and it makes me feel really bad and even more anxious. For example, I think it's at its worse when it comes to guys showing interest in me. I get nervous, like really nervous, and everything makes me uncomfortable. I hate people asking about my relationships, I hate being involved in PDA, and I hate all of the physical affection that's expected. 
I don't know. I'm fine being friends with people, but as soon as they start getting closer, or hinting at something more, I panic and retreat, and it destroys everything. 
Please, if anyone has experienced something similar, or hasn't and just feels like commenting, I'd really appreciate it. I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to relationships, mostly because I self-sabotage everything, so any advice would be awesome.

I should probably mention that my dad has told me that he intends to fully pay for my college 100%, many of you out there will probably hate me and call me stupid and greedy for wanting money when my father is committed to paying me through college. 


The thing is, I want to have some pride and personal spending money and simply have the experience of work under my belt, my dad has told me that he doesn't want me working young because the work world can be tough and he wants me to focus on school but I already get good grades and I just really want a job.

74,"How's it going, r/advice?


For the past couple of weeks, I've been considering dropping out of college. I have plenty of good reasons to leave, and plenty of good reasons to stay. I'm just having trouble making up my mind and maybe one of you could help me.


First of all, I'm in my fourth semester. Right before this semester, I changed my major from finance to electrical engineering. I just decided that I did not like business whatsoever and EE best fit my interests. I love to learn, especially about physics and the other sciences.


Here's why I've considered leaving:

* I already have approximately $40,000 worth of student loans
* I go to a very expensive school, and I'll be there for at least 1 extra year since I switched majors
* I won't get anymore of my $15,000/yr scholarship past 4 years
* I'm doing pretty trash in most of my classes (50s-70s on exams)
* I don't feel happy when I'm at school
* I'd like to be able to have hobbies and be able to relax instead of doing schoolwork 24/7
* I hate having to follow a rigid learning schedule and I like learning at my own pace
* I've been feeling very depressed at school
* I'm still not sure if this is what I want to do for the rest of my life



Here's my reasoning for staying:

* College degree in a prestigious field
* I'd like to work for an aerospace company
* I'd likely earn a lot more money
* Society would look down on me if I dropped out
* I'd feel like a failure for a while
* I love learning and college kind of forces me to
* I have a lot of great friends at school


Here's my rough plan for if I were to drop out:

* Immediately begin working for &gt;$10/hr while living at home
* Saving 10% of every paycheck and using the rest to pay off loans
* Refinance loans to a lower rate
* Work and live at home for however long it would take to repay my loans
* Use the saved money to buy a motorcycle (a dream of mine) and get an apartment somewhere warm (I live in the US, maybe FL or AZ)
* Once I live somewhere warm, I could decide what to do about further education (trade school or affordable school)


I appreciate any advice. It's just so difficult trying to make such a huge life decision on my own. I've already discussed it with my mother and she told me she supports my decision, but would prefer if I finished this semester.

I'm 21, F, and a senior in college. Because of my injury, I had to take a health leave during my last semester of college so I'll be graduating in December instead of in May
My parents moved back to their motherland after I started college, so for winter break I went to live with them. They live in a 250 sq. ft. studio on the fourth floor with insufficient heating and no elevator. There's heavy internet censorship, so it's been difficult to use social media. I know no one in this unfamiliar country, and this isolation is compounded by my mom's bipolar disorder which has frightened my relatives so much that I haven't seen them yet.
I'm terrified that I won't get better. I went from an active, happy, and motivated young woman who was on the verge of graduating and working at a top consulting firm to someone who cries everyday and feels hopeless. My mom constantly yells at me for having been stupid enough to get injured. I'm always in tears because I'm still in a lot of pain and I feel hopeless.

78,"Hello all my genius reddit members I have a current problem. First off I am a college student with two roommates dealing with a fishy land lord. Over the summer we made a deal and signed a very basic contract for the current apartment floor we are living in. He made a verbal agreement that he will reimburse us for any improvements on the home since it was in crappy position. I feel as if this is where we first messed up for not making him sign such a deal. He did reinburst us 350 which is not close to amount of work we have done. We had to take out all the furniture because of cat piss and gross nasty unknown liquids. We replaced 2 walls , sanded the walls, and painted all the walls. We also made more parking room by clearing the backyard of thorns which he promised to create more parking. Then he also is fishy about utilities. Aka he doesn't pay them(I will explain more later) now he aparantly has moved out of state and sold his house and that is where we send our checks. So he has no way of receiving them. He also didn't do any snow removal and we share a driveway with a neighbor who has 2 young kids and work night shifts. To add on to this he randomly wants all the checks from the last 4 months all together with utilities. We have asked him how to give him the money no real response or place to do. He has now made one of the tenants collect money from all floors to deposit the money in the bank to his account this is a random event that just happened. Currently we have a leak from above the shower and the ceiling tile?!?! Is rusting and collapsing. Also we still have no idea where he is and currently I feel as if I should start asking him to reimburse us for the shoveling. Also for labor for working on the house and to add on the damage in the bathroom to be fixed. Also we have a very old heater. One of those that you have to light from inside and we had to have it running over the winter since everything would freeze. He questioned us about the amount of money utilities rose because of this action when he requested. My question is what should I do in my position.

I didn't make friends, forcibly change myself, and be there for everyone just so they could abandon me later. I didn't work my ass of stressing and worrying to not get the happy ending I deserve. Every choice, struggle, personal feeling we all went through was pointless in the grand scheme of life. These 4 years were the most important years of my life, and I EARNED things that I thought were only possible through a God. I'm not willing to let them go. But one day, they'll have a family, a life. And before you know it, they'll forget me. I'll forget them. And just the thought of losing everything like that so fast, it's horrifying. You can't promise that we'll be friends for life, that's not how it works. They'll have their own life, and they'll move on. I will too, but I don't want to let go of the things I have now.

Being alone again is inevitable, and nothing I've done, doing now, or can do will ever change that. And then it hit me. It was all pointless. I could literally have been a self dedicated asshole, and it wouldn't have made a difference. It doesn't matter how I treat my friends. Whether it be with respect and dignity and love or with disrespct and hate, I'm alone either way, right? And people like fuckboys, who always f*** people over, get their happy ending. They are the ones in relationships and with friends. I've done my best to do the right thing all the time, and it's gotten me nowhere. People don't respect me, hell the majority of the school hates me, people don't care about me, I've never been in a relationship, I sometimes question if my friends are even my friends, in the only friends I do have her going to abandon me one way or another. There isn't a happy ending. Has everything I've done been pointless? And now what do? I've done everything for them, and it all equates to nothing. I'm going to move on to college ALONE, back to where I started. And the cycle is just going to repeat over and over and over again. I just want a reason to give a damn. People have been noticing at my school that I've been different. Why shouldn't I be? It doesn't really matter right? Everytime I try to talk to someone all they tell me is ""I don't know what to say"" or "" it gets better"". That doesn't help, it doesn't help at all. I don't want empathy. I want my friends. I want someone to give a damn. I just don't want to be alone.",06Mar2017,1
80,"So I am a college Freshman right now, and it is a huge thing to go out and find yourself. And I thought that was silly, but sitting here now, I realize...I don't know who I am.

And it's taken a huge toll on me and my outlook on life.

I don't have a passion nor do I have a passion for a purpose. And the stress of ""I have to find a passion that I love otherwise I will fail in life"" thing takes it toll.

But, at the same time, I am too afraid to try new things. I feel like I don't have the right credentials to do anything I never tried. And I always feel like it's too late, and it's dumb, but that's what I always think.

And I always was sensitive to other people. So, I felt the need to conform, but I didn't want to at the same time. This conflict took on such a toll, that, at this point, I feel like a robot. I feel nothing, just automatic, and I don't have a drive for anything.

And it makes me so sad.

I put myself out there, and then I get scared and pull myself back in. But I don't know how to put myself back out because I'm scared of what others would think of me and how awkward it would be to come back after disappearing for a bit. It's so dumb, I know, but it's how I feel.

Fear is so strong, and it has made me this way.

I am trying to get out more but nothing I do seems to work, and it's sad and I'm always a sad, boring person and it makes me sad. I don't feel alive, I feel like...nothing. 

My internal conflict is like I'm at war with myself. My mind is so tough and rigid and my heart is so soft and warm wants to be open and friendly to the world. But my mind is so much stronger than my heart and it discourages me so much. Its so sad it makes me really sad.

88,"   Around the age of 11-12 my sister started continnually getting raped by my uncle (on my mothers side). He used to live in our backyard in a shed for a few years. My parents would send him to do daily tasks like go pick her up and drop her off at school. During those times she would be raped. She would be raped at home. She would be raped anytime he had the opportunity to rape her. The worst part is that my mother knew about this and would physically abuse my sister every time she tried to speak up and even walked in on the rape one time and let it happen. (I knew she was abusive to my sister before but I never knew that this was one of the reasons for her abuse towards my sister.) At family events on my mothers side she would be taken into another room and be raped and everyone on my mothers side knew and said nothing about it. I do not know when the rapes stopped. But our Uncle moved out into his own place when my sister was about 14-15. 

Until Now, I had not known about it until she recently told me and our Father. She doesn't want to press charges because she doesn't want to ruin his life. Our Uncle lives with his wife and now has a child.
My sister is now 24 and is engaged to her wonderful husband and has one beautiful child. Our parents are currently divorced.
What should I do?
She doesn't want to go to the police and press charges. This disgusting man could be raping other girls. I was never close to this uncle so I hold no attachment to this man. I want him to face the consequences of his actions. I also want to confront my mother and ask why she had been covering up for her brother.",06Mar2017,21

So as the title says, my mom died just 2 short weeks ago. I am currently a senior in high school and I have applied to many state colleges (NY) and I've gotten acceptances to a few of them. I currently am living with my dad, but it's been tough as I spend a majority of my time alone. Although I'm with my dad, he doesn't provide the same maternal feeling I used to have. However, a majority of my family lives in Texas. My aunt recently suggested that I should go to a university down there as opposed to here to be closer to her and my other family, and to be honest I'm really considering it. I'm quite torn as I have a good opportunity here (cheaper schooling) but at the same time I see this as an opportunity to start fresh in my life.

Currently I attend university in the English Program. 
Originally I came for accounting, but I quickly realized that I made that choice because it made my parents feel secure and it was easy to just choose a soulless business job.

I changed to English after a teacher told me I should, and now I am realizing that I don't want to write. No matter what I do I can't get excited about writing. Once again I was merely excited about the idea of ""having it figured out"" and not about the actual path I was on. 

About a month ago, I downloaded some art software on a whim, after I started to doodle in photoshop and found the layout not to my liking. (After everything I've learned I realize this is pretty ironic, PS being the industry standard, and I may want to revisit it.) 

Ever since I started, there hasn't been a single day in which I haven't opened it and spend hours drawing. It dominates my free time. I also bought a Wacom tablet, which has greatly improved my experience. 

Now I think this is what I want to do. But I am terrified of the idea. What if I am not good enough, or lose my enthusiasm? What if I am just lazy, and no job will make me happy?

I am also afraid of my parent's reactions, and of not having a plan. I don't know what career I would aim for. 

I am also somewhat interested in Computer Science, and I think I would be happy with it. Software development and IT would be perfectly doable and interesting to me. 

I feel trapped by expectations and a lack of confidence in my own potential. Can anybody tell me about their own experiences? I really don't know what to do.

109,"First off, sorry if there are any grammar errors, I'm not an native English speaker. And it's a long read, too, (It had to be long to settle up the context) but it's also a summed up story. Sorry.
I'm a 17 year old male (going 18 this June) and my relationship with a girl ended this Wednesday (03/01). She has been my girlfriend for almost 2 years and I loved her very much.
I've always been a reserved and shy person, I never had many friends in my childhood and even suffered some bullying back in the day. This happily changed and I've got myself more friends, but up to this day I'm still kinda awkward and weird. Girls never liked me very much, and every ""crush"" I had led up to nothing.
But then I started liking THIS girl, and it was the very first time that the feeling was mutual since the very beginning. She became my girlfriend, and we really matched. No, we didn't ""like the same things"" and shit; but we WANTED the same things. At the same time we had different and even opposite tastes in some cases; and that was fun. The intimate life was healthy back then, too. We really had chemistry.
It couldn't be so easy, of course. She was very much like me in some points; she was shy; and also suffered bullying and rejection in her childhood, even more than me. Her self esteem was not good and she had tendencies to depression and anxiety. And then there was me. An inexperienced boy, who never had much contact with girls. And I neglected her, in small things, but I did. I said some stuff that you shouldn't say to an anxious and quite jealous person, too. I just didn't know at the time her real psyche, we were at the start of the relationship, still knowing each other. And some months after we started dating, her grandfather died. It was not sudden and fast, it was a very slow, stressful death in the hospital. This really messed up with her head, because everyone in her family was sad for quite some time. 
Now you add these two factors to the fact we were studying full time in school and it also was second half of the year. She ended up entering in a depression that lasted for months, and it was really tough. I never had to deal with this before, so I did the best I could. I stayed at her side, gave her support and tried to get on with our relationship normally. But I blamed myself so much, because I knew I took part in making her depressed like that. So, my self confidence wasn't that great. She constantly said it was not my fault, but up to this day I still think it is.
And then 2016 came, the last year in college. We stayed half our time in school and it was really tiresome. Things started getting in our nerves too, like asshole school staff; cock sucking teacher pets and hypocritical students, the incompetent school principal, family issues, etc. We were constantly wanting to punch someone in the face. In this phase we were really close, but no matter what I tried, it did not seem to get better, because the ambient and people around us were not helping at all. Sometime around May she finally said to her family and friends how she really felt, something she didn't do up until then because she thought they wouldn't understand, and then I wasn't alone in this fight anymore. My psyche wasn't good too, which is important to say. We were trying to help each other, even though we both were fucked up. Time passed and we slowly got better. 
The problem is this whole clusterfuck marked our relationship, badly. We had some fights, she had anxiety attacks, we cried, etc. It may seem like hell, but we got really good moments together too. If we weren't in each other's lives, it would have been a lot worse. I would be imprisoning my feelings and let them fuck me up instead of sharing and getting them off my chest. The love I had for her, her presence, her existence, were really important to me. And I knew I was for her too, despite the fact I questioned myself a lot. She may have did some pretty bad stuff to herself if I wasn't here. Due to this, recently, she slowly started to get more distant from me. The intimate life started to fade, she got uncomfortable with too much body contact. I started to get frustrated and upset, because I didn't knew what to think. Maybe she just didn't like me anymore, maybe it was just another phase, or this would be her for now on. We talked online a lot, but recently not so much. In real life, although, we still had some pretty good moments. At certain point, she lost her libido, but I did not. REALLY frustrating.
She said she was feeling lazy and inactive in general, not just to me. She is REALLY much better now than how she was last year. There was a time when she did absolutely nothing the whole day because she didn't had the will to do so. Now she was doing her stuff again and I was really happy for it. But it's true, after school has ended for good, it seemed like she was JUST doing her stuff. We said that it may be just a phase, because I've also got a little weird after school has ended. But anyway, I wanted to try and fight this monotony, because it would end up ruining everything. She also wanted to fight at times, but not always. There were moments she said that it was not worth it, since it was possible that she just had lost her desire.
We considered break up more than once, but it was just too hard and we couldn't do it. We just got the guts to do so this Wednesday, and being honest, we both cried like little bitches. It was just so goddamn sad, a real punch to the guts. No, multiple punches to the guts. With brass knuckles. Thursday was a terrible day, I felt empty and alone, a gut wrenching feeling throughout the whole day. I decided to go out and watch Logan on Friday (terrific movie, by the way, fucking loved it), and it made me feel a little better, but I was still feeling really weird. Saturday I was invited to a friend's birthday, it was really fun, but seeing other couples didn't help. Today I stayed at home and that gut wrenching feeling still returns. I feel like I'm just a little better now because I'm ""covering my wounds with clothes"" and I'm avoiding to think about it. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. I hate giving up. And I just gave up at something so important... I'm just not dealing too well with it. She says it was the right call because it was hurting, but I say to myself that we could have fixed it and stayed together. And it's really bugging me. If it was the right call I should be feeling better by now, but I'm still weird. I just don't know what to do. I haven't told anyone yet because I don't like people pitying me, asking questions or making judgments. I'm ashamed to say I gave up, too. And no, I don't have suicidal tendencies, so no worries about that. But my head is a fucking mess now.

114,"It's a bit of a long post, but please bear with me. It's not a bad read either I say.

I am caught between two hard places. I am not sure what to do. Let’s start with some background: my parents, hard-working Asian immigrants who worked their entire adult life support me their only child. They went through hardships, both financially and emotionally to support. For this, I am grateful and I am indebted to them. Recently, we have been through some financial hardships. We are a middle class family, with their combined income of around $80-$90k. My dad recently has his salary cut as the place he works at has suffered a loss of business due to the economy and just the times. My mom developed breast cancer, that for the moment has been treated and dealt with and she looks to be fine on that front. But the surgery has left her not in the best health. She had to quit her job and hasn’t worked for almost a year now. The increased expenses of the drugs for her post-surgery treatment has cost a lot, combined with just increased costs of living, and my dad’s cut salary has left us in a bit of a financial hardship. We almost barely make ends meet and I’m sure my dad has to use credit to pay off the bills and keep living on that revolving debt.       


The struggle I refer to involves my dad’s side of the family. One family in particular, his sister and her husband, do well for themselves opening a successful Asian cuisine restaurant in another state. As we come from a fairly collectivist culture, they do not have any qualms in providing money to help out family members. When my mom’s cancer struck, they offered to give us some money, as they knew my dad also had a salary cut. This occurred in the past year. My parents did not ask but accepted as they needed the help. In the last couple of months, I learned they had also continued to give some help monthly for perhaps the last two, or three months (maybe slightly more). 
    

My dad and his family, mainly his sisters, have a cold relationship. They do not talk. Either side do not care to communicate. They don’t openly hate each other, they’ll say hi at family gatherings, but not a single phone call to him, or barely an invitation out to family gatherings. It is as if he is excommunicated. Recently, I learned and believe this to be the fact that they have a long standing judgement of my father and consequently my mom because they “gamble”.    


My parents, from time to time, do go to the casino to “relax”. I’ve almost no doubt in my mind that that is what they go there to do, however you may view going to the casino. They are not gamblers; they are not addicted. They don’t struggle to resist going to the casino, and shirk responsibilities to do so. I believe they are truthful in what they say. I’m foggy on the details, but there might have been a period of time in my dad’s life where he did have a slight problem, but I do not think that is still the case now.    


The reason of my struggle is because recently this aunt of mine called my mine to ask if they still go to the casino, to which my mom truthfully replied “yes” but seldom. She reacted viciously, attacking my mom, chastising her for using all her money just to go to waste it at the casino. Stopped giving the money. My dad did not know of this, and called another aunt (who acts as a proxy) to ask why the money stopped. She told him this aunt did not want anything to do with us anymore and to the effect, said don’t call them or anything.
YET, this aunt later called me and offered me the money through me. She said I’ll give you money to YOU, but nothing to THEM (my parents). Effectively saying that they are dead to us. She was saying that she doesn’t want me to suffer, and for me to accept my money. I was furious, and conflicted. Yes, we needed the money but I’d hate the way they acted towards my parents. Denouncing them, judging them like that, using me as a gateway to still help out the family while excommunicating them.     



Almost done, thanks for reading all this way. Today, she offered money once again, and I begrudgingly accepted it. I couldn’t stomach the feeling that they were treating my parents this way. What she said here you take the money, I’m giving it to YOU, but not to THEM. So a little bit later, I called her up asking why are you treating my parents this way and what do you mean by it. She went into a long explanation of how my parents are vicious gamblers, that there is no such thing as going to “relax”, and that all gambling is the same and addictive. I replied with saying, they take care of me, work hard, and I trust them, they are not addicted. To which she insists that they are even if they were only doing it a little bit. The effect of message was to say that your parents have a problem, can’t be trusted, this is my perspective and why I am doing this. I still want to help you and your family but I don’t want to talk to them directly so here is your money to help them if needed. 
She tried to reason with me in that if your parents aren’t such vicious gamblers, then how come you are in such financial difficulties, why are you barely making ends meets, and said your parents have all this history of using credit to gamble, etc. That I am still your friend and want to help out your family. If you can get them to swear off gambling by signing a voluntary ban that the casino’s will honor, and track down exactly how much they “owe”, I will pay it all off for you guys.    




My dilemma is this: we are in a financial hard place and do need their money, but I’m conflicted as to whether I should keep on taking it from people who clearly vehemently judge and excommunicate my parents like this, who disrespect them because they have this belief of them being irresponsible gamblers. I consider myself decently rational, when I heard all this explanation of how I was naïve for trusting my parents, and to ask them exactly how much they owe and to produce evidence, I did consider her viewpoint. I asked my parents firmly how much truth there was to her claim. They said that there is very little truth. Yes, they do go to the casino from time to time, but this aunt is making shit up cause of that one time my dad had a slight problem, so she holds the belief to this day. She doesn’t know where my dad spends his money (most if not all is in paying the bills), and even if they do have a gambling problem, it’s never been evident to me (as in they’ve never like struggled to not go, or forgone responsibilities just to go), and I don’t think they’re the demons they portray them to be.


Last paragraph I swear. There is a reason my dad doesn’t talk to this aunt as well. Historically, she has been one to gossip wildly, cause drama, has accusatorily attacked both my parents in various manners. The viewpoint she brings up about my naivety and parent’s gambling issues are fair and I consider it. However, even were it to be true, I DON’T think this type of HELP is right at all. It’s very judgemental and conditional. Instead of helping her brother recover from so called gambling addiction, there’s nothing but judgement and anger. It seems very narcissistic. I am on their good side because I am an innocent caught up in this, but it seems very conditional. I feel the second I directly go against her and her claim, I’ll be violently cut off from help.
So the purpose of this long post was to ask you guys for advice, and comments. Am I in the wrong for siding with my parents? Should I continue accepting money? Is this or is this not how a family should act (as in be very conditional and judgemental)?    


Tldr, but please read: Family in financial trouble, aunt helps out by giving money but indirectly through me because she judges and excommunicated my parents because they occasionally go to the casino which she beliefs to be a full-on addiction and I don’t. I can’t stand accepting her money when they disrespect and treat my parents like this but we do need the money. What do I do?

Is it just me being a bad bf for being mad about this? We've talked about it a few times but I don't think my self esteem will recover, and I don't really know if I can trust her anymore... She says she wouldn't ever act on these, but where would I draw a line? She's the kind of person who will meet up with total strangers she just started talking to at 2 am in the morning, at what point do I just shrug off typical jealousy and at what point do I need to take action?

122,"Before you start reading, I just wanted to give a brief background of who I am, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time to click on this. I'm completely new to the Reddit community, and I made this account a while back but I never used it until now. I honestly don't know how long this post will be but thank you for giving the time of the day to read this. Also, thank you to the ones who spend the time writing to respond to this. One more thing, I'll be getting a little personal of my life, because I just want you as the reader to get a better understanding of me.

Background: I'm Alexis, I'm 19 yrs old female, I'm a 1st year college student, and my major is psychology. The reason why I chose to pursue psychology is because I genuinely want to help people. Throughout my life I have struggled through a lot, I've been a sexually assaulted by a couple of my family members on different events throughout my late elementary school years till my early middle school years, I ended up opening up to my mom one day &amp; told her what happened to me but she didn't do anything or say anything to anyone because she thought I was lying, during the beginning of my sophomore year in high school I was placed into foster care because my mom placed me into behavioral therapy because I was becoming very rebellious, and I ended up telling the guy who asked me a bunch of questions that stuff happened to me- we ended up, during the session, called DFS to report what happened. Nothing happened until a couple of month later, I told my therapist at the time one of the family members who did things to me when I was younger was coming back to live in the house with my family. Anyway, I was in foster care for 6 months, I was grateful I had an amazing foster family. After foster care, everything settled down for a few months, high school was just years of annoying people, and a struggle for me. Until now, I've been in abusive relationships in high school, been bullied, and a lot of other stuff, I'm was a very unstable person emotionally and mentally. I didn't like who I was. I ended up trying to find help- 2/3years ago, I've been diagnosed with depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar and ADHD. 

Now: Recently, I feel like I'm falling apart. I left a toxic 2 year relationship, we lived together (under the same roof as my parents) for about a year we met each other on a online game, face timed throughout the whole time until he moved out from the east coast to be with me in person, and he had no family here on the west coast) the rest of the time we just lived together, and basically ""pretended"" to be okay. I basically supported him while he pursued music, which I didn't mind at all. Originally, we planned for him to leave after this spring semester ended, but I ended up leaving because I had enough of it. Now, I live with my old boyfriend who I dated through the beginning of high school, I think we dated for about a year and a half? Honestly it feels really different now because we matured I guess you can say. I have no complaints, we both changed a lot from the time we dated back in high school. I've been trying to do what I haven't done in old relationships, which was communicate with each other, basically not be a controlling/stupid girlfriend, oh and not doing stupid reckless things. My ex who I was in a toxic relationship with lives with my parents, my mom doesn't mind, but he has been trying to contact me and all that, which I've been ignoring. With all that I feel like I'm very unstable now though. I haven't been going to my classes, homework, I feel like I have no motivation, I feel helpless, I haven't been giving my all at work &amp; just been a complete mess. I've been taking medication &amp; I did get my dosages raised up (I told my doctor what's been going on and how I've been feeling), I'm gonna go back into therapy because my college offers it, I don't want my mom paying for my therapy because the copay (from what I remember was 10 or 20 dollars). So I'll be taking advantage of that.. I feel like my life has been going downhill even though my relationships with my parents are better, my relationship with my boyfriend is great, but I have problems getting up from bed, I haven't been focused, and it's just stressing me out. I'm doing little things to try to get back to how I am but it's just really hard to know how to tackle this problem.. Sometimes it feels like I'm okay one day, but the next day I feel completely drained. I honestly do not know what to do.. If anyone has advice to share if they've ever been through this- I'm completely grateful, and thank you for reading all of what I wrote. I know it's a lot and kinda extra but oh well. ",06Mar2017,1
124,"My ex boyfriend and I have been separated for the past three months. We dated for a year. 
Before that, we were friends for about three months. So we have a pretty solid foundation. 
At this point in my life, I needed to move on real quick. Our relationship was so fucking crazy and messy that I was emotionally over it before it was even over. 
I still care about him a shit ton but in a totally platonic way. Theres absolutely no way I flirt with him in the sense of me caring. He is fully aware of my caring and he is completely caring or me as well. 
We've been back in contact for about a week now, and things have been getting awkward. 
He accuses me of getting jealous and over protective when I literally don't even mean it/mention it in that way. 
For instance: this one girl that fucked him over moved back to the city he lives in and I said ""I had such an easy feeling about her living out of state"" 
This bitch and I had our issues WAY OUTSIDE OF HIM and he immediately thought I meant I was worried of them being in the same city. He's so stubborn that even after I explained, he just smirked and said ""oh okay"" (facetime) we said goodbye, kind of angrily and then I called him soon after. 
He declined my call and texted me ""I can't do this right now"" 
I literally was calling to tell him a connection I made in a video he showed me and he quickly assumed I wanted to argue about the fucking girl. 

I have no desire to care for him in this sense. I don't see him as a boyfriend or get upset about girls with him. 

How should I handle this situation?

I want to go to uni, and the only courses I can think of is either something to do with film making, music making, writing, or possibly philosophy. All of those are terrible choices.

133,"I'm in the US, and I have my beard trimmer from England here with me. It died a few weeks back and I thought I would charge it so I plugged the cable into the wall using an adaptor hoping it would work. The light didn't come on so I assumed the light was just broken. I left it there to charge for about a day and when i went to use it it worked for a good 30 seconds before quitting on me. I even managed to trim down half of my face before it did.   

I grabbed my Lenovo charger and stuck it in, and to my surprise the charger fit too. The orange light now comes on but if I turn on the beard trimmer while it's charging with the laptop charger, it pulses weirdly, like the motor in the beard trimmer is going on, then off, then on, then off, in 1 second intervals.

When we got back home from our trip, I ended up staying at his place and things progressed from there.

Now I often enjoy spending time at his house, watching movies, sharing ideas, drinking glasses of wine, chatting, cooking dinner, etc. He is extremely fit, extremely good-looking, extremely well-travelled and very entertaining. 

I want to buy a house, get married and have children and he's well aware of this so there's no disillusion that we are in a relationship but he says that he'd prefer if we didn't sleep around with other partners while we slept together. 

He said if I decide I like someone else, that I need to tell him and break it off first. I told him I'd think about how I feel and discuss it with him when I've gathered my thoughts.

139,"Hello guys

I'm 18 years old and I'm currently all about finding my passion and purpose in life, but now I face a pretty important decision.

I started dipping my toes of course in many professions that interest me and now I'm on psychology - writing an academic paper about Graves Model. I'm already in a middle of it - slowly getting into an end but suddenly I have a problem.

You know, not only I do the real life practice but also I hugely supplement that with all the (psychological) theory about this topic.
That means value, strength assessments and tests, concepts about following this road and pursuit and just in general - self-discovery through theory.

Further I go I'm starting to think that I should probably stop and pause real life experiments, go full bore, in theory, get to know myself better and after finishing being a student go again into the world with better idea and focus about where to go and what I'm really after + what I should avoid and be aware of on this road...

Because maybe now I'm just wasting time - shooting straight into the void, which I will maybe realise while tackling theory. Or not - that with psychology I was on a right track, that I should come back to my project and finish it.

The only thing that I'm the little bit concerned about (what is really keeping me still on this strategy).
Is that I could be not experienced enough to reflect back on my life and all that I did in terms of work while taking all the tests, assessments and doing exercises - therefore, getting bad results or none at all, meaning that I would end up where I was, lost.
Lost and being necessary to get all the experience and data from the world and come back to theory to help me guide myself and reveal my authentic personality.

What do you think guys?
Practice first, then theory?
Theory, then practice? (this is option I'm considering)
Practice and theory at the same time?

Please, I need your help on this decision because I'm afraid I'm just avoiding lasting work in front of me OR I'm having a great authentic and strategic insight from my mind and intuition.

The last (and only) time I was in a relationship, it was a comstant thing. Instead of looking forward to being with my boyfriend, I was terrified and nervous. We dated for 3 months and it never went away or died down, and it made me physically ill. I lost 20 pounds those 3 months because I could hardly eat - it made me nauseous, too.


Now, four years later, I have a new crush on a new guy and we have recently been flirting a lot. I think it has potential, but as soon as I realised that he might like me and I might want to try dating, the stupid stomach thing came back full force.


It's been there all weekend and I could hardly eat. I really want to persue this relationship, but this stomach thing is a serious negative for my health. It is also what ended up wrecking my last relationship, and I don't want to repeat that.


Any help or advice is appreciated. I've found that excersize helps, but I can't excersize every moment of every day. Taking a moment to ""step back"" from myself and kinda meditate helps too, but again, it only helps in the moment and I can't do it as constantly as the thing is present.


And, as a final note, I've tried mentioning it to a few doctors now. Each time I've been told that ""we all get a little anxious sometimes"" and moved on. I mean, I would prefer a solution that doesn't involve medicine, but at this point, I might just take whatever will work.

169,"I'm a 38 year old guy who is living below the poverty line, and I have done for many years. Around 4-5 years ago I got pretty sick, and fell into a hole, and have never really crawled out of it. I'm at the healthiest I've been since then and I'd really like to get my life back on track.

Around 14 years ago I became estranged from my father. He's a good man who made a lot of parenting mistakes, and in my early 20's I made mistakes of my own. I wound up arrested on some trumped up charges that were eventually dropped, but during this incident my father posted bail and I basically skipped town. We pretty much wrote each other off.

4 months ago my sister mentioned that she had been talking to my dad and he wanted to reconnect and the two of them wanted to come visit me. I was super uncomfortable and suggested I'd like to email with my dad for awhile and get the ball rolling, but needed to start slow.

That has resulted in maybe 10 emails back and forth, lots of apologies and forgiveness, but it's also become evident that he's a busy man and that maybe I'll never really have the father I'd hoped to have - emotionally available, present, all that stuff.

That being said, he's sent me two gifts - a $200 at Christmas, and another one in February for my birthday. This is super generous of him and those amounts really help with the basic expenses I have a very hard time getting together on my own, and of course I've been thankful.

But here's the reality of my situation: my dad is very, very well off. Like ""owns multiple homes and goes to Europe for pleasure"" well off. And I am suffering and struggling. But I don't know *how* to ask him for the help that I need.

I feel guilty for even wanting to ask, because I feel like I've just dropped back into his life and now I need help from him. At the same time I know just on an emotionally detached, practical level, if I were to ask him for a loan of several thousand dollars to help me get my act together, it wouldn't compromise him financially in the slightest.

So I just don't know how to come at this. It seems he responds better to shorter to-the-point emails than to lengthier ones. He also seems to respond better to matter of factness than emotionally heavy things, which is hard on me because I was hoping we could relate to each other on an emotional level, but I have to concede he is 76 years old and probably not that kind of guy.

So how do I come at this? I just don't know how to ask for help.",06Mar2017,1

We work together in class. Met Fall of 2015 but haven't seen each other since. We now see each other 3x a week on average either in class or doing homework. We always hold eye contact when talking. We can't seem to break it or avoid smiling. At least I can't stop smiling or laughing at even the simplest shit he says. But then he laughs too.
He remembers things I say, jokes I tell in person or over text. He tells me about himself too....He always texts me about the homework...then again he *always* texts me about the homework. I'll try starting a conversation and he interrupts it by bringing up due assignments.

He lives alone, single, doesn't hang with anyone really except at his family's house on weekends.

180,"This is really long rant, sorry! I started a new job this week at a really beautiful and fancy restaurant. Hoping to work my way up to a bartender or cocktail waitress so for now I'm okay with bussing and being bar back. I have plenty of experience as a waitress. 

So the other night I was called in to fill in as a barback, a job I've never done. When the bartender came in she was immediately rude to me (seemingly because no one gave her a heads up that her usual barback had quit) and asked if I'd ever done it. I truthfully told her no to which she loudly sighed and told me that she didn't need me (as if the job is rocket science). So I found a manager and explained, they talked to her and sent me back up. Well the rest of the night I was treated like absolute garbage and told not to do anything because it's easier for her to do it herself. She spent most of the night being rude to customers and alternating between sitting on her phone and panicking during rush times, when she could have taken ten minutes to explain where things are and what she needs to me. I figured out by watching her where things are and little things I could do but was really unsure of how much to step in since she had made it obvious I was in her way. Finally another waitress needed help so I offered to take her glasses, to which the bartender snapped at me since ""that's not our job"". She even treated me this way when the owners came in, so I looked horrible standing there when she could have simply said ""fill this up"", etc. At one point I told her I'd like to go clean a table that I noticed was messy and she refused to give me a towel and said she hides them. We ended up getting in a verbal argument when she snapped at me for doing something ""wrong"" even though I asked her several times for an explanation of how to do it and she gave me vague two word replies every time. At this point I went to find a manager to ask to leave but there was none to be found, so I stuck it out til the end of the night. Meanwhile I made her tips from helping customers out and using this thing called a smile which seems a foreign concept to her. She tipped me decently I suppose considering that I wasn't given much of an opportunity to be that industrious but definitely not well.

Now the advice part: how do I address this to management, especially being new? I'm never one to throw people under the bus and I don't want to be making enemies my first week, but this woman's behavior was so childish and horrible I'm not sure how it can be avoided. I do not want to work with her again until someone properly trains me or at least gives me a breakdown of what my responsibilities are. But, truthfully I really need this job. I have a mouth to feed and bills to pay. Some words to say and topics to avoid would be appreciated. 

Tl;dr ::: Startes a new job, bartender treated me horribly and prevented me from learning how to do my job and I do not want to work with her until someone trains me or talks to her. How do I address the problem to management without losing my position or making enemies?",06Mar2017,2

Why Spain? well Spanish is our native language so it will be easier for her at least since i know English, i have a Italian passport but that’s about it i don’t know anyone there and it seems that economic state of the country is not very well. 

Useful info: I’m 25 male I got a degree in business administration, Italian passport I would say my English is advance at least I terms of speaking and reading and intermediate in writing since I lived in the US for 2 years when I was young.

183,"Hey reddit, about 6 weeks ago I was diagnosed with a serious intestinal infection. I have not been able to attend school since I got it, but I am graduating in may. I have a good job making $15 an hour that I started at the beginning of this year. However, the work sucks. I live in a very hot and humid climate (even in winter) and I work outside as a valet trash porter. I understand that I make a pretty good amount of money for a first job as an unskilled worker and do not want to lose that. The work is exhausting and starts at 8pm 5 nights a week. I have a set 2 hours a night. I am relatively fit though overweight, and this job has helped me become more active. More importantly, it taught me the importance of going to college, which I have been accepted to on a full ride to a state school.  I have gone to work even while sick, though having to take frequent breaks. It got so bad that I had to take a week off, and my boss was extremely understanding and is a great guy, he filled in for me personally. I just went back a couple of days ago because I did not want to risk losing my job. My dad had to come and help me, and ended up doing all the work while I shat my guts out in the bathroom. He is an extremely successful engineer, yet he is sacrificing his nights and sleep to help me keep my job. I have $1000 in the bank that I have personally saved, plus another $1000 that my parents have compiled for me through birthday and Christmas gifts over the years. I plan on going WWOOFing and travelling over the summer with a few friends, and I believe I have sufficient money to do so.  My parents and grandparents are well off and I live a good middle class life, they very generous and we're willing to pay for my college before I got a full ride, and they are willing to sponsor my travels. I do not want to put this burden on them, and I want to be financially independent. Having a little bit more money would help me with this, but I seriously hate my job. It is starting to impact my family, and even though they are willing to sacrifice to help me achieve my goals and keep my job, I'm not even sure I want it anymore. It is too exhausting. I plan on living at home and staying in the same room I grew up in and eating with my family, so it is not like I am going to be needy. I just do not want to be broke during college and have to borrow their money because I went travelling this summer. Should I keep my job and start back when I am totally figured out (I have procedures scheduled in the near future) and suck it up, or should I call it quits? This work was a good learning experience. I want to take a gap year after college to work for Americorps and hike the Appalachian Trail, basically to fulfill my dream before I start real work. I will need money for this. I would feel bad relying on my parents for money, especially after I graduate college.  Should I quit my job and find another one that is not so exhausting in the fall, after I travel? My dream is agricultural engineering or something along those lines. My interests lie in farming and agriculture, not waste collection. I would love to know of any part time Jobs that involve this for when I get better and after I travel. I also need to time to catch up in school to get my grades up before i graduate so that i can keep my scholarships. Sorry for the long note and thank you for the advice.  ",06Mar2017,1
184,"  So I threw a birthday party with my best friend and a few of his friends from his childhood showed up including his very sexy best friend. We hang out all day and into the night. We have some drinks, smoke some bud. He and I hit it off pretty well, we have good conversation and he seems chill so we sleep together. He's from out of town and I thought that was that. Nope.

  In walks my other friend and she pulls me aside and starts talking about how hot he is and she couldn't believe I slept with him because she wanted him. My reaction ??!!. The next day, after he and I make out some more, they are talking to each other. They are still talking to each other. 

  None of this would really matter if they both weren't coming on Spring Break with the rest of my crew. Now she asked me if I was ok with her talking to him, but southern social etiquette dictates that I can't say shit about it so I tell her I don't care even though I don't even like him anymore and I no longer trust her. The entire group knows what happened and they are expecting me to get over it as usual and just deal with it.

Except I have no idea how to deal with it. I have 5 days to get over this because I have to spend 7 days together with them in a small condo. Please help me? Or at least tell me my feelings are validated, maybe just someone agreeing with me will help.

196,"So I'm planning on moving in with my boyfriend and his nearly 30 year old brother. My main problem is with the brother, he acts more like a teenager than a grown ass man.

 My major problem with him is that he doesn't put food back in the fridge after he's done. He'll just make his food and go right back to watching videos or playing games. This morning a pot of chili was left out for at least five or six hours and that's why I'm making this post now. He's going to give someone fucking food poisoning one day and it doesn't even seem like he cares. His top priority is getting his ass back in his chair. He does this with everything. Tubs of margarine, milk, bottles of sauces all left on the counter for god knows how long. I shouldn't have to constantly be listening for when he goes to eat so I can put stuff back before it's left out too long and tell him yet again to cut that shit out. 

I'm trying to figure out how to articulate myself. I'm not going to sugar coat anything because I'm so sick and tired of this. There's absolutely no reason he should be doing this, and his excuses are pathetic. This is what I have so far ""If I'm going to be living here I will not tolerate you leaving food out on the counter anymore. It sits there for hours on end because you'd rather rush back to your game grumps and then I never know if I can trust it again. You're going to give someone food poisoning one day because your videos and games are more important than something that takes two seconds. You're almost thirty, where's your sense of responsibility?"".

I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall because I've said basically this to him over and over. Just never as harshly. And I know he'll probably react by getting pissy and say shit like ""well if you don't like it you don't have to live here"". That's not the point! It's his inability to do this basic task that poses a health risk to everyone is! He just refuses to take blame for anything.

201,"So I didn't intend on sharing this story with anyone, but it's festered up for too long. I need to do something about this problem that doesn't ruin my life, or my family's life. Frankly, I'm afraid.

I'll cut to it: I've been seeing a counselor about some trauma I had as a kid. My father molested me when I was 15 and there was/is verbal abuse and manipulation from him. I've only told 2 people that I trust and they couldn't believe it. It might come across as even more shocking when you know that my father is a minister. He worked with youth before and seemed to always have a fixation on young girls, as he spent the majority of his time talking with them. He is still a minister, and I even work at the same church as him as a tech guy. 

I've had some distorted thinking and lack of confidence ever since then. I have a hard time talking to people without feeling very insecure and insignificant. I have a very difficult time making good friends as well.

I have no idea what to do. I've been getting help, and I've been able to talk things out with people, but I see him every day and that's all I ever think of. When he tries to hug me I just want to push away and expose him for who he really is, but I can't do that. I love my mother who was always there for me growing up. If this got out and action was taken a few things would happen: 1. Our church would completely crumble due to the trust of everyone towards my father. 2. My family wouldn't ever be the same. 3. He would deny all of it.

I can't hold my own arguments most of the time. I don't know if it's because I'm stupid, or just afraid. Trying to fight someone like him just feels wrong and dangerous. But it is the truth, and it's killing me on the inside. I've been very suicidal this last year, and there's nothing I want more than to change the way I think and feel. But I've been trapped in this world for a while now... I need out, and I need a way to not ruin my entire family. 

I feel like I'm trying to rewrite the narrative of what happened. I denied that what happened when I was 15 even happened at all for years. But now it's all bubbled to the surface and it's do or die now. I won't handle this much mental stress much longer. I can't focus. I can't sleep. I can't enjoy anything. I've been trying to do good for me, but nothing is helping. I just want to move on, but it's hard. Especially given the circumstances.

I need to get away. I need to find my own place and rest and be alone for a minute. I need vibrance and happiness. I feel chained to this job - stuck, emotionless, and cold. 

Father, when will this end? I am weary and call on You to give me aid. 

Life feels disjunct and yet monotonous. Why don't things fit anymore? I need to fight back, but I've put so much effort to caring for Catherine that I haven't taken care of myself.

depression got worse because of her. Forward 2 years and I try getting in contact with her again but she somewhat ignores me.

215,"I'm living in northern Indiana and I'm currently working on a Bachelor's degree in psychology, although I'm more interested in writing. I live with my family and I've really never moved. Every day is the same and my current job isn't doing anything for me financially or mentally.

I've tried researching different jobs that I could actually work my way up in (as far as writing, but I don't know what there really is), and I'm not confident that I'd be good at much else. I don't have any experience. From what I've seen, there's nothing in this area that looks promising or even attractive. I'm more comfortable staying at my shitty retail job since I'm established there, but it's draining my soul. I want to travel to see what areas I'd like to move to someday, like Portland or Seattle or somewhere in Michigan. No money to do that. 

I don't want to get repetitive so I'll keep this kinda short. I'm basically just going through motions right now, on track to graduate 2-3 semesters later than I should, absolutely at a loss with how I should be setting myself up for a future I would enjoy. How do I avoid falling into a loop of repetition like I've been in? How do I get out of this one? 

If you've moved for a job or for something new/adventure, how is that going? 

I'd likely wait to graduate to move, but I should find a job (although there seems to be nothing) to prepare me for the bigger opportunity once I graduate and get out of this area.

Thank you!",06Mar2017,1
216,"Today I think I had enough from them. As time passed they've acted more and more shitty with me. I've been friends with these 2 guys for more than a decade, but besides them I don't have many close friends.


One of them, A, is a very narcissistic guy and thinks and acts as if he's superior to everyone, and B has been acting (I'm saying this with the danger of sounding like an asshole) like an autistic kid for a while now.

We've been separating from each other for a while now, A is getting a lot of friends at his school, and B is doing a lot more ""personal progression?"" stuff, his time is very limited for other people, or at least me.

An old problem is that almost every time, in any problem that we had, they got together against me, or separated themselves from me for no good reason.

As I said, B kind of acts like an autistic kid for a while. A few months back B got really excited about a concert, told me about the band, and for a week straight we only talked about their music and B said he was gonna go to the concert. We talked about going together and he said he wanted tickets in the gold circle, otherwise its not worth it. I said ok let's go, I also told a friend who was into this kind of music, and I ordered tickets for me and the other friend (he paid ofc, I ordered them cause he didn't have a card). I also offered to order tickets for B and he can pay me when he had the money but he said he was gonna get them by himself. Fast forward to a few days ago and the concert is in about a week. I was at A's house with B and I tell him:


-Dude, I can't wait for &lt;band&gt;! We're gonna have so much fun!

-What? Well have fun I guess, I'm not going.

-WTF???


Aaaand you can guess how the discussion went from there, I got golden circle tickets to not be separated in the crowd from him(cause i wanted standard tickets) and a week before the concert only after I tell him about it I find out he is not coming.

He's been doing this for a while now. We organize something, and he doesn't announce he is not coming anymore, I only find out after I ask him. I don't know about you, but this drives me mad. If it's going somewhere in town or just him walking 1 min to my house, this happens more than 50% of the time we want to (or at least I want to) get together.

This is just one of the things he does that makes you feel you don't exist to him.


Now to A. I don't even know where to start, almost everyone I know that knows him hates his whole ""Mr. Big Personality"" thing. But most of them seem to lick his ass whenever they're around him because he's the ""cool guy"", I dunno. And when he has an opinion they all follow him, be it common friends or his class mates.


A last example is a few years ago when I was in hospital after a night drinking with them. The next morning I had a very bad allergic reaction, I had to go the hospital. There I was asked what I consumed, an alcoholic drink. We've all had it, but I only was the only one to get this reaction and I told the doctors and my mom that they also had it.

Mom tells B's mom, ofc, because their parents were worried A and B may have something from the drink. B's mom punishes B for drinking. A and B, while I was in hospital, started messaging me about how it's not cool to say that and I should mind my own business...take that as you will.

Fast forward to now, I told something to A, A tells it to their parents for some reason (they were just casually talking about stuff, at least that's what A told me) and their parents talk to my dad who goes crazy: ""I'm getting taught how to raise my kids by my friends, how could you do that to me!"".

I tell A about this, and remind him of the alcohol thing, but he says it's not the same thing, I tell him about his double standards, then B comes in and says ""What was done is done"".


These stories are just a drop in the ocean. When we're alone they're acting like friends, when we're in a group they don't give a shit about me for the most part, and I'm sick of it. Problem is other than them I don't have many friends, maybe a handful, and we're not that close.


Sorry if some things did not make sense or my spelling, my first language is not english. I'm at my breaking point and I don't know what to do.


I don't think I can sum this up in a TL;DR and I'm sorry, I feel the details are important. If you read so far, thank you, and sorry if I wasted your time.


EDIT: Important to mention, we also have a lot of common friends.

218,"I rented and moved in a new apartment this weekend. I was not shown the apartment because it had occupants. They had shown me a sample which was great. When I moved in I noticed the apartment  does not have any cabinets under the kitchen sink; nor under the bathroom sink. The sample apartment that we saw had those. All pictures shown online have those and cabinets is a basic requirement, right?
 And when I toured the sample, the only differences told to me were 
a. Carpet instead of wood floor;
b. White appliances instead of steel ones and 
c. no desk in the dining area. 

I have no qualms about those at all. In fact I am glad I have extra room in the dining area. And the carpet is clean; and the color of the appliances do not matter to me as long as they're functional.

The Maintenance guy was also there yesterday and he asked me what my concerns were thinking he could help. When I told him about the missing cabinets, he said that is because the apartment is an ADA apartment (American Disability Association or something similar) and that is why for wheelchair access there are no cabinets under the sinks. I would really have liked to know this prior so that I had all knowledge before deciding. How and what should I ask for now? Is it okay to ask for a new apartment after the lease has been signed ? Or can i ask for instllation of cabinets? Or perhaps ask them to reimburse me for portable cabinets that I can buy from home depot etc? Or ask them for a dicsounted rent?

226,"Over the past few years I've dealt with depression, the loss of a close friend, and family matters and I've tried to find hobbies to turn to so I can occupy my time doing something other than thinking, but my problem is that I don't handle activities well when I'm not good at them. Everyone obviously doesn't start off with anything perfectly, but it aggravates me knowing that there is something I can't do and it discourages from trying it again.

I've tried physical activities, strategic games, drawing, writing, making music, photography and other things that people do for fun or to pass time. But I don't have fun unless I'm excelling at it. I can't stand being looked at as a beginner and being talked to like I have no knowledge over what I'm doing, regardless if it's true, you know?

Recently, I've just given up trying to find things to do. I occupy my time listening to music and playing video games, which also isn't a strong suit of mine. 

I'm aware that I do give up easily on things if they don't go well at first, but I can't help it. I know it's completely my fault that this is happening too, but I'm the youngest out of all my family that I have around, and every time I get an interest in something, they can always do it better. And I then set my standards to how well they've done, even though they're far more experienced than I am.

232,"Okay I know this might sound wierd at first. I've been thinking a lot and I came to a conclusion that all that negativity in my life comes from being influenced by my classmates. Pretty stupid and simple. To explain step by step what's going on (Oh and this is quite important for me and for my self-being):

I think I'm a loner type of guy, so I think isolation from my class will do me very good. I'm feeling like I lost my style, when being around my class. And my style included paying attention to school responsibilities. When being on lessions and sitting next to someone, I'm becoming quickly distracted. So I want any advice to help me isolate from those bad influences, other than sitting in the front. And I'm not saying that I want to isolate from litteraly everyone - just my whole class and some friends. I just keep having this feeling that when I will be alone, I will be able to wrap my head around more important things. I want to be able to control my free time and still be able to study. I'm currently in the middle of a Cartoon TV-Series from my childhood and one character made me think about that. I remember that I always loved that guy's style and it somehow influences me. He reminded me of my style that I wanted to have and now I want to regain that. I just need to fight off those people that are making me forget. I think I was supposed to say all of that in a different way, but what the hell... you get the idea and damn... when I read that myself I can't believe that all of this is becouse some humans are saying words to me and are being.

237,"I have a lot of issues. I need a plan to get happy again. I'm struggling with depression and I think that it is stemming from these issues.

My life is not going as planned. I stopped going to college because of a few reasons. I tried online college because I had to work to take care of my disabled mother. It fell through and made my gpa crap. I took more college in the past couple years but couldn't get enough aid so I had to stop again. I should be one semester away from my degree, but instead I am years away. I have to work at this point, having a place to live, a car loan, a girlfriend, etc.

I have a lot of debt. When it comes to credit cards when I didn't have enough money to live, to my collections from an expensive medical accident, to my student loans. It's draining and I feel like I have no control. I'm being charged every month most of what I can pay back.

My girlfriend and I are having a lot of issues lately. This is the issue affecting me the most immediately. I suspect cheating, but I have trust issues and stuff. I don't know who is doing the wrong or how to fix it.

My family is still relying on me for money. I'm buying my mother groceries later today in fact. On my credit card because she has nothing to eat and can't pull anything from anywhere else.

I'm gaining weight because I eat like crap to make myself feel happy for a moment. I have zero motivation to work out. It's hard to even get out of bed some days because I feel so down. Ive even been failing to wash my clothes, because I just can't find the motivation to do it. My house is a mess.

I've been thinking about running away. I want to crawl in a hole and wish everything away. It's getting to be over the top. I don't want it to get to the point of suicide because I'm not happy and see no happiness for years in the future.

238,"Okay, the short story: I am in my 30s, three not-so-little children, divorced. I don't have any revolving debt, and I have a secure job. However, I want more than just this small town life (cliche, I know). Should I stay here where I've been stuck most of my life, and feel suffocated by it, or go to another, larger city 7 hours away?


The details: My parents were/are blessed enough to provide and have a financially comfortable life for myself, my sister, and all the grandkids. I have taken part in some of these luxuries, but I have my own career outside of my father's business. This is a small town, so the pay isn't substantial, but it's not a bad job. My parents bought and have paid off the generous home my children and I live in. My mom bought the land next door and moved in. She helps with the kids. I live on a large area of land, way out in the country. It's quiet. The kids can go outside without stranger danger. There's a pond my boy likes to fish in. I'll never have to want for anything, as long as the family business holds.

The problem: I've always felt so suffocated and confined here. Very few people ""make it,"" or ever even leave the state (my family being an exception in a niche field). They just stay and and make barely above poverty line salaries and get married as soon as they're legal. If they're happy, great, small town life isn't bad. But I crave more for myself and my kids, more opportunities, more experiences. Additionally, my parents are incredibly overbearing. If you don't behave properly, they threaten to take away things, like my home. It's like I'm a perpetual teenager. They come inside my home, pilfer through bedrooms and closets, open doors, read my mail. They feel like they can do this because they let me live here and help out since I divorced. The latest ordeal was when i went to buy a car, and my dad happened to know the salesman, and he got a copy of my credit report and started inquiring about this note, or that account. I didn't even find out about that one until another friend got wind of him calling around checking on MY credit report and called me. I've battled against it for as long as I can remember and trust me, I have and it has caused no small amount of grief. My mother is one of those that, if you mess up in the slightest way, you're evil incarnate and just want to make her miserable. 

They love me. I know they do. But I feel so chained, so confined, so suffocated, so controlled. I just want out. My daughter is driving now, and they're doing the same things to her, with the ownership and the guilt trips. It's like Stockholm Syndrome, I swear. It's so much emotional stress, sometimes. My elder sister, who lives 5 minutes away in another family-owned home, plays by their rules and gets rewarded with more stuff. And hasn't spoken to me in over a year, because ""I just won't support the family."" I didn't really desire my own life until my mid-20s, and by then a lot of financial chaining had already happened.

My mom divorced and lives next to me. Her and my dad can't get along, and haven't done so in the 15 years they've been divorced. Dad has a really crazy drug addicted girlfriend that mistreats all the grandkids....Really, this family is just whacked. I want my kids away from this. 

Except, I think I've been trained to think I can't leave, and shouldn't leave, and just stay and work for the family and feed the beast, and my kids, too.

I have removed myself from most social aspects; it's all drama around here. And marriage scandals. So I don't have friends that I'm staying for that I couldn't FaceTime and visit once in a while. 

However, I'm terrified of leaving my mother behind. I have no real reasoning for that. I'm terrified I can't do it. I'm terrified I'm going to go and fail, and what about my kids if I fail? 

My current partner and I are in it for the long haul. We have a dream (he has his own reasons, and I have mine, both from before we knew each other) to leave, take our kids, and start fresh in a growing city. I want to. I want to go. I have an easily transferable set of career skills, and I've checked the payscale. I can easily double what I'm making here. So can he. My kids would have museums and parks and music to go to. I want to be with my partner and our children in OUR place and make OUR choices and I want to further OUR careers. Not my family's agenda.

Edited to add: I personally have no problem moving put, living in a tiny apartment, and telling them to shove off. But I have children and want what's best for them.

TL;DR: Wow, OMG, okay, I guess I really needed to get that off my chest. Family sucks but pays for everything. I want to leave and pay for my own things. Should I stay where I know I'll be financially taken care of, or is it selfish to go and hopefully get some emotional peace and development?",06Mar2017,1

242,"Hey there,

So a little back story (26/F if it matters to anyone) and I'm sorry if I ramble I guess I just need to vent and sort it out. I got offered a GREAT job in the neighboring city from my home town and of course accepted the offer right away. At the time I was living with my parents but was on a strict timeline to be out of the house by late spring because my parents are retired and looking to relocate, which they deserve. I sat down with both dear old mom and dad (yes I am still hopelessly attached to my wonderful parents) and we all agreed it would be best for me to move to the area to avoid 1.) the horrible traffic and headache commuting in and out of the city can cause and 2.) holding back my parents from beginning their relocation anymore than I already had been. 


I had wanted to move to this city for quite some time and had done a lot of online research into different housing situations and areas for months before even having an interview for this job as well as physically viewed about 5 or 6 units in different parts of town along with my parents before starting the job. We found what I thought was the perfect unit rent was a little out of my price range but not terrible, relatively safe neighborhood and one that I was already familiar with at that, great access to public transportation which I use to get to work, the management team seemed super customer service oriented, decent sized space and dishwasher/washer/dryer in unit which is pretty unheard of in this city for a relatively reasonable price, and the unit was available immediately, all around good things. 

Rather than keep looking around and risk missing out on this place my parents and I decided to jump the gun and sign the lease 1 year lease so that I was able move in before beginning my job. 

Now that I'm here and ""settled"" I'm of course having some small regrets and remorse and noticing things I didn't notice when I viewed the unit. The main things right now being that the unit wasn't completely cleaned/turned over when I moved in (walls weren't painted, some bathroom surfaces DEFINITELY weren't clean, lots of dust on widows/blinds, etc.) and the beautiful floor to ceiling windows that made me fall in love with the place are really drafty and on the chilly side causing me to crank up my heat which in turn causes the apartment to be dry and will probably sky rocket my electric bill. Also there are parts of the apartment where the floor is uneven which I didn't notice until I moved my furniture in. Also due to the placement of the oven I can't open the oven door all the way as it hits the adjacent wall which is actually now starting to become a small annoyance, there were also a few of marks on the walls that I'm 90% sure were not from me and were from the previous tenant which makes it pretty clear they did not paint or did not feel the need to before I took over. The apartments are in a pretty old building which is relatively common for the city I'm living in so I think some of what I'm experiencing is due to that and I am also completely aware that living in a large urban area like this you often are dealt a mixed hand. 

Most of these things are things that I can learn to live with or deal with like the oven or the walls. I've also told management about the cleaning and they sent someone up to handle it right away, were extremely apologetic and for the most part handled it well but now I feel like I can't trust anything I touch in the apartment. I've done my best to clean what I can but now little things like when I find a piece of hair in the bathroom I second guess if its from me or from the previous tenant. I also ended throwing out the drain stopper in the shower because I wasn't sure if the dirt and grime and hair there was from me or from the previous tenant. Things like that. The drafty windows I haven't said anything to management about yet and I'm hoping that the problem is just from it being so chilly the past few days where I live.  

Sorry if this is hard to follow but its basically things like that which have kind of put a damper on a time in my life that should be really exciting. I was in a really bad rental situation previously which is what actually caused me to move back in with my parents and now I'm terrified of being in another one. This all happened over the course of less than a month and it was a big change to happen in such a short amount of time and now I'm really starting to have regrets. Maybe I should have pushed harder to take my time, looked around more and dealt with the commute for a few weeks until I was sure. Now I feel like I'm locked into this place and if I don't like it I'm screwed. I had some of these negative feelings going into the situation but pushed through because I felt I had to. Now that I'm here I'm scared and anxious and worried about what is going to happen. 

I've only really lived in the apartment for a couple weeks and feel like because of my previously bad rental situation I'm fixating on the shitty parts and not taking into consideration all of the good parts that had me want this apartment in the first place. Just to answer any questions management was and still seems to be very customer service oriented and very responsive so at least I have that going for me. Am I over reacting here? Do I just need to give things a little while longer and not think the sky is falling until it actually does? At this point I feel like I'm sitting here just WAITING and WATCHING for something to go wrong.

245,"Hey all, I know that I'm the one that really has to decide the answer here and that there isn't really a wrong decision but I'd love to just get some advice. Maybe you've been in a similar situation, or maybe you just see things from a different perspective.


So I'm in my mid-30's and a couple of years back made a career change to tech. When I had a career change I managed to land my dream job, the pay is good, the hours are great, the amount of time they allocate to personal development is extremely generous and the work itself is super interesting and stimulating etc etc. 


But the job is in a city I really don't enjoy living in. Although we (wife and I) have a bunch of very good friends here housing is un-affordable (we live with a flatmate to make ends meet), the commute is terrible and the hobbies I love (outdoors, beaches, the ocean) are really inaccessible here. I've lived in this city for at least 10 years and I feel like I've done my time here.


I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, I can't say I loved it at the time but I have really grown to appreciate the small town life. I recently spent a significant amount of time (1 year) in a small town that I totally fell in love with. The housing is not only affordable, it's cheap! It's big enough to attract decent shops. It has some amazing outdoors and the ocean all within 5 minutes drive of the town center. And it would be the perfect place to raise a family (which is on the cards). But finding a job there will be quite difficult, let alone finding anything like my current job. Remote working for my current employer is not an option. And we know very few people there.


What the hell do I do? I feel like I'm choosing between my life at work and my life outside of work. How do I even go about making such a decision. I'm in no rush to make a decision, in fact I'd like to stay where I am for at least another 1-2 years to gain the experience.",06Mar2017,1

Hi, 
I've been dating a woman for 5 months now and I like her and enjoy having sex with her but I don't like her in the sense that there's no daydreaming or butterflies in my stomach. I do enjoy her company and am attached to her. The emotional intimacy that I've experienced with her is nothing like I've ever had before and I love that part about us. 

I have hooked up several times with a girl friend while travelling before (that was purely sexual). 

Most of my relationships have been with men. I'm attracted to men physically and sexually but there's a struggle with opening up emotionally or committing to them.

However with women, the attraction is physical initially and it's much more easier to open up emotionally or be in a relationship. Sexual attraction is something which builds up with getting to know her better. 

 Having said that, if I'm at a bar and if a man and a woman hit on me, I'd go home with the man. But I'd like both :) 

1. Am I true bisexual or is this just a phase? (College)  
2.  How's romantic attraction characterised? Is it physical or sexual or emotional affinity?

247,"I’m 10th grade and she is 9th grade student in Turkey. We get on the same public bus both going school and after school. I met her and her 3 friends somehow. Actually, they came to me themselves and started the talk. And afterwards, we kept chatting each other while waiting for the bus etc. But those days, only one of her friends USED TO* be there.

1. She USED TO** call me as “kardeş” (means “pal, buddy, fella” in EN)
As Turkishmen, we believe that if a man or girl calls opposite sex with this word, this means he/she feels something to other.

2. She standed on my foot for few times. I don’t believe, it was accidental.
Honestly, never saw her while standing on others’ foot accidentally.

3. One day, I noticed that she held onto my right arm while the bus passing a hard corner. She said “sorry” while doing it and damn I haven't done anything to turn the situation into my own advantage.

4. She USED TO*** touch my shoulder and greet me as she passed by me.

5. One day, I saw her waiting behind us (me and my cousin****) and she seemed to be waiting to have a talk with us. Her friends are already got off the bus. So say why you think so? Because the seats in bus weren't filled and she came behind us afterwards her last friend in the bus got off. She was holding onto iron pillar on the top to stand on her feet. We were turned our backs with my cousin towards window and watching outside. I was realizing her standing behind me. Let's point the result, and damn again, I didn't even turn my back towards girl and talk to her somethings, she just hopelessly waited for us to turn and when she gave up, she just went to back of the vehicle and sit down somewhere there.

* That times (when she was interested in me) they were only 2 people included that girl. After about a month, they've been total 4 people (3 her friends and 1 herself).
** I use ""USED TO"" here because she begun to call me with my name and stopped calling me as ""kardeş"". I suppose she CUT THE PAINTER between us.
*** Now, she doesn't even care me. She would be outside the school in break times and she STOPPED doing it too. I just see her only in the bus!
**** My cousin studies at another school. He is in there sometimes. Our homes are close.

The thing is I left school after high school so I can't go to university, and last august I come to UK as an au pair, and after having problems with the host family I decided to leave on 17 march, right now the situation is awful, they just insult or ignore me because they are angry that I'm leaving. I'm feeling very miserable and the only thing I want to do is just go back to Spain to live with my mom like before when I was depressed, I think I have the same symptoms as when I was at my lowest.

But my mom and my sister are telling me to stay here(in uk) and find a job and go back to school, my sister is living here with her boyfriend and my mom said she will pay my rent until I find a job.

255,"Hello,
So to begin with I just want to say that I'm 22 and from the UK and I started a job almost 2 weeks a go. This might seem very ramble-y and not very well put together but I have no one I feel comfortable with telling this around me right now so I apologise for that. I just need to get this out.
Okay, here we go. I went to university and got myself a good mathematics degree. I realised during and more so since leaving university that the traditional jobs people go into with a maths degree just aren't for me. (They seemed boring, work experience in accountancy firms and data analyst teams just weren't for me.) I started working at a very large tourist attraction taking, taking photos, selling souvenirs. It was okay, I enjoyed it, the job was mind numbing but the people were great! I worked there for about 4 months, I also met people on the marketing team at said tourist attraction. What they were doing really interested me and I started looking into it. I would go on to the digital garage run by google and learn everything I could about the digital side of marketing with websites like Wordstream.
Fast forward to November and I see a job listing as a PPC Executive at a web design and digital marketing agency. This company looks amazing, from the young average age to the company culture itself, It's somewhere that I can see myself thriving and enjoying. I go for it as a long shot even though I have zero experience and they were looking for someone with a year or more.
So I go to all the interviews, I seem to get a long with the specialist and the head of marketing at the company. I feel good. I get the job. I feel amazing.
So this is my predicament, I'm now 12 days into the job, learning all that I can about the job, doing the projects they set me outside of work (non client projects) because I enjoy doing them and they're helping me learn but I don't feel like I'm fitting in AND I don't feel like I'm contributing anything to the team. I get small tasks to do that my boss says are ""shitty"" but he says they really do help because it's less pressure on the team. I don't know whether or not he's just saying that to make me feel better.
I also feel a bit paranoid. People in the office whisper a lot around me, I try to say to myself that they're probably not talking about me and that they're just whispering because they don't want other to hear that they're being gossipy or it's personal or what ever but I feel like they're talking about me and talking about how I'm not actually doing any work, I'm reading blogs or doing google exams/studying for them. Then I start feeling like a dick because I sound like a narcissist to myself.
I just feel like I'm having a problem with adapting and being patient and I was just wondering if anyone else has had these sorts of feelings and whether or not you could shed any light on how you've dealt with them?
Again, I'm sorry for how this is all come out and it's jumbled up. I've written it as it's come to mind and I just needed to get it out. So thank you in advance for any help.",06Mar2017,1

Okay so I have been with my fiancè for 5 years now (been with him for 5 years, been engaged to him for a year). I have worked for the last 3 years and pay bills in the house, pay for my own school and anything I need. So i decided to book a trip with my fiancè to Miami next month for 5 days. Last time i tried to do this, they (my parents) were flipping out on me and told me i am a disgrace and that they are going to kick me out so i didn't go. I was 20 at the time. This time i realize i got to do what makes me happy and since I work I can buy whatever i want. So i told them briefly about my trip and they did not take me seriously , probably because they think that i wont go again if they yell and try to make me feel like what i am doing is wrong. They say that the family will think im a hoe for going on vacation with a guy. They really care about what people think of me because i am the only girl (i have 3 brothers) but i am the oldest one. 

Quite frankly im sick of the manipulation. I hate when they say "" we tell you these things for your own good. You have to do things in the right order not do whatever u feel like it."" It irritates me. I am looking for a place with my fiancè and they even disagree with that saying i am not ready for the responsibility of cooking and doing laundry and cleaning.

271,"My friends are a couple and they live together in a 2 bedroom apartment.  They have 4 or 5 cats - I know they had 4, they got a new one but I think one might have died.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of cats and they are always rubbing up against me, staring at me, sometimes jumping on me, and it makes me very uncomfortable.  I really don't like cats, I don't like them touching me or even just sitting and staring at me.  Also, the apartment smells very foul. 


Recently they said - albeit in passing - that I should come over to their place to drink and maybe even spend the night. I'm only visiting home for a month (I live in another country).  The problem is, I live in the countryside of the US and I can't drive, which means the burden is on them to drive to me if we want to hang out.  I know it's a pain the ass to drive back and forth, and probably the reason they want to hang out at their place and me to stay over is so they don't have to drive me back when they are tired.

I know it's unfair that they have to do all the driving, but I am constantly on edge when I'm there and I certainly don't want to sleep at a place where cats run around.  The only other option is basically to tell them ""let's not hang out because I can't drive myself and it's too stressful for you guys,"" which is also harsh.

276,"I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year, and he's absolutely amazing. 
The problem, is his ex-gf. 

When my bf and I first started dating, his ex's best friend added me Facebook, which at the time I didn't think much of until I found out that she was already following me on instagram.  I let it go because honestly even though it’s crazy its natural for ex’s to lurk. 

a couple weeks after that, we ran into that same friend at dinner who was a complete bitch to my boyfriend and I.  That same night without me asking my boyfriend texted her friend and was like “ I have never asked you for anything,  but I know your adding my gf on social media, and your behavior today was unacceptable. please leave my gf and I alone”  to which he obviously never got a reply. 

A couple weeks go by, and his ex wishes him a happy birthday as does her sister and his exes sister tells him that she’s happy he found someone new because he’s such a great guy. 

Up to this point I didn’t really care about his EX.  


Until me, my bf, his friend, &amp; our mutual friend who hooked us up went to dinner and our mutual friend said that she thought my bf would get back together with his ex.

That really upset me, and it also upset my boyfriend.  

The next day I went to lunch with my friend, to clear the air and ask why she would say that, she told me that my boyfriend was really upset after the breakup and she even asked me if wanted to listen to a voicemail he left her when they had just first broken up about how upset he was. 


She told me that my boyfriends ex wants him back because he is really wealthy and she want’s an easy life, and she knows that he can provide that for her.  She also told me that my boyfriend is the type of guy you marry,  and that his ex has always known that but she wanted to go be with other guys because she expected my bf to wait around for her until she was ready to get married. 


From what I have seen on his ex's social media, she's is now dating a guy who lives abroad.  But This morning when I woke up, my boyfriend goes “ I don’t know how to say this to you, because I don’t want you to get upset but last night when I was sleeping my ex texted me saying ‘Hi how are you’ at 1 am.  I didn’t reply”

I told him I wasn’t mad and that it wasn’t a big deal because it’s not his fault, and he can’t control what she does.  He then asked me if It would be better to ignore her or text her asking for her to respect our relationship and stop texting him.  I told him to just ignore her. 




I trust my boyfriend 100% and know he would never get back together with her, and I know that I should drop it and let it go because of the trust I have in him.  But other people keep putting it in my head that she want’s him back.



My “friend”  and his sister in law still likes her pictures, which I don’t get if they all say that shes crazy and that they hate her.  


Does she actually want him back ,or am I just being paranoid and crazy?

I just feel like there’s nothing I can do because I trust my boyfriend and I know that there’s nothing I can blame or call him out for because he has done nothing wrong. 

So how do deal with his ex texting him?

281,"Hey /advice/

I want to preface this post by saying it will probably be a little long, but I am making an effort to keep it concise.

My life has been pretty turbulent, and I've had multiple psychotic episodes over the years. I had an incredibly bad breakup with my first serious partner at 18, and there were a couple of episodes during the relationship and in the aftermath. I won't go into detail on any specifics, but we both did abhorable things to each other, and I can say for my part I am deeply ashamed of how I treated her in the aftermath, my mental health is no excuse in my mind and I have suffered greatly for many years from the guilt and with the exacerbation of my preexisting mental-health issues.

Last year I had some more traumatic events and after having some time off work, rumours had begun spreading, a colleague I considered a friend confirmed this to me but it made work unbearable, I tried to continue but I eventually reached a breaking point.

I had been drinking regularly and excessively alone and had also been fairly isolated from friends due to my mental and emotional state. I was also struggling massively with sleep problems which sleeping tablets only made worse except in the short-term. 

During this time, before reaching my breaking point. I made some friends online through Omegle. I spoke to anyone, and often swapped Skype details with those that I had a great time with, who felt the same and wanted to speak again.

There was a variety of people I met and kept in touch with, one my age, and a few younger (I was 23) Every relationship was platonic.

I confided in fgriends that one person I met on Omegle lived in the same city, and was potentially expressing interest in me, but I wasn't sure. I've not been able to trust my instincts regarding interpreting subtle social signals due to my history of delusions and paranoia. This girl was 16 turning 17 and we had an enjoyable conversation and I agreed to swap contact details and even Facebook. Looking back now I see this is completely innapropriate but at the time I was uncertain, I was lonely and flattered at the possibility of someone being interested in me and as a way of guaging interest I asked if they would want to meet, as we lived so close. Despite being a lonely guy with a healthy sex-drive that wasn't what I was aiming for. I feel pretty stupid about it now. I had spoken to friends about this and they told me the age difference was too large and soon after, to really stick the boot in - she confessed she had lied about her age and was actually 15. I told her while I liked her I was incredibly torn morally because of the age difference, and now she had told me that I would not talk to her again. I believe I was over-nice in my response, but I wanted her to not be upset and I also wanted her to go away knowing that trying to seduce older guys (I now know that was clearly what she was doing, albeit quite poorly) is not OK and wanted her to understand the negative impact it would have on the guy, if he wasn't able to just reject any contact with them.

More recently, in the second half of last year, I had a serious psychotic episode, I thought my computer had been hacked too, and my bank details were definitely stolen as someone had stolen money from my account. This reinforced everything. I felt I was followed, and I now feel like some of my paranoia was justified, and I think that either something that happened in my first relationship that I am guilty of that I have shared with friends, or that my ex may have shared with mutual aquantinaces, or the episode with the teenage girl, has been spread about me.

I get the impression that people, basically the entirity of my local community, think I'm a lechourous cradle-snatching pervert who pursues teenagers, or something approximately as terrible. I'm not sure what or even if anything has been spread about me, and what side of the story has been given. I don't know who, everyone denies knowing anything, except in indirect hints. So I've not been able to defend myself by explaining honestly.

I've seriously considered suicide and other serious actions, what few friends I have still barely speak to me now, or if they do it seems something is ""off""

I attempted to go back to work twice after having bouts of seriously bad mental health, alcoholism, or taking harder drugs - and both times after about a month stress, lack of sleep, paranoia and hearing voices of colleague's in my head at work insulting me got so bad that I had to go off again. 

I don't know what to do. I'm thinking of at least starting a new life for myself somewhere. I do have some therapy potentially starting soon, at long last of fighting (NHS trusts are being throttled to the brink of death due to underfunding thanks to the Conservative government in the UK) but I can't imagine, despite the help I may receive, being able to enjoy life in my home city unless I can make a few new friends.

I'm incredibly dissapointed that people close to me would believe rumours or gossip without speaking to me and giving myself a chance to defend myself. I would expect people to not just blindly assume what they hear is the entirity of the truth.

Of course there may be other reasons why people have shunned me and people in my community seem to talk about me hatefully in my presence in a covert way. But what I've explained is the best explanation I've got. I just don't know what I can do about it. I've tried confronting friends to see if something's been spread about me but they tell me that nothing has.

Either I've been very deluded and paranoid, and if there is no truth to these paranoid thoughts I am in a very bad way mentally... or there is some truth to them and it means I've effectively lost what pathetic a life I have managed to scrape together for myself over the years, and I am for all intents and purposes dead in the eyes of my neighbourhood and wider social circle. 

I don't know what to do. I'm meeting my therapist soon but this is too much to go into in person when I've only just met someone. And besides, the therapy isnt on this, its about the other symptoms and issues I have which are not related to the potential rumours spread about me. 

I don't know whether to give up on these old friends, move somewhere else... kill myself... or stay here but just be alone most of the time until I can eventually hope to make some new friends in the future... ",06Mar2017,1

I recently got back from holiday where there were a group of girls around my age staying at the same hotel. They were all attractive but there was one girl that  just caught my eye. She was bubbly and cute, out of everyone in that lounge she chose to dance with me, several times.

I didn't manage to get her number but found her on facebook and on Friday (after a few drinks for dutch courage) I messaged her asking if I could buy her a drink or take her to dinner  sometime. She thought that was a great idea an we took it from there. 

I don't have facebook so I was using my mum's account by last night she was getting annoyed with me using her account saying I should get her number already. Sneakily she messaged this girl with just my number. I find out and freak out because to me just sending a number looks a bit pushy and desperate. I was trying the slow and steady approach.

Now this girl hasn't responded, not even to the one I sent before my number was sent. I tried to explain what happened whilst I was at work but I haven't got a response. 

I want to explain again what happened but I'm not sure how to go about it. I know facebook isn't idea especially as it isn't my account so I'd love to get her number or some other platform that's more private.  Any help will be appreciated. Thank you for reading.

285,"First I will probably delete this tomorrow, not sure yet.  

So I have been a caregiver to my father (60) since I was 16 (now 21). He has early onset Alzheimers and is entering the late stages of it. In May last year he moved into a nursing home, he was still relatively aware at the time. It took ~9 months for him to approved for medicaid because of a mess up on the medicaid side of the application and was a huge stress on me (with college and everything).  


He was recently approved and due to his rapid decline over the past year, I really only go see him once a week. The reason being is that he yells at me and for putting him in a nursing home, he claims that he can live in an apartment and threatens me with my ""inheritance"" or just says I don't love him every time I over there (I know this isn't the real him talking, and am not angry at him for it). So me going over there every other day was taking quite an emotional toll.   


I just don't know what I am feeling right now, taking care of him for the past 4 years as severely limited my social life and taken tons of free time away. Now that I don't have this added stress, I feel kind of empty or lost. The closet thing I can think of to how I am feeling is like Red or Brooks in Shaw Shank redemption. I thought I would be feeling the relief part of being a care giver but its not that. The world seems foreign to me now, I don't care about what most people in my age group care about and have trouble relating to people my age. I would say it's loneliness, but I don't think its that either, I have tons of ""friends"" (quotes because not really attached on an emotional level) from my fraternity and also my old high school friends. Is there a name for what I am feeling right now? If I could put in it a quote it would be this:  


&gt;These walls are kind of funny. First you hate ’em, then you get used to ’em. Enough time passes, gets so you depend on them. That’s institutionalized. They send you here for life, that’s exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyways.  


Not the same as prison I know, but having this burden for all my adult life it was like being a prisoner in a way. One last thing is one of my professors asked us the question ""What is your idea of a perfect life?"" and I couldn't really give an answer, I never really considered the day where the only person I had to worry about was myself.  

To restate the questions: Is there a word for what I am feeling right now? Is this normal for caregivers? Also thanks for listening.

288,"Heyo, so recently i've noticed something that I do, I get really defensive when someone makes a joke aimed towards me, and get really pissed off, until someone explains it's just a joke later on, why do I get like this, and how can I change this, or is it something that cannot be changed? Sorry if this question is dumb, or not something to be asked.",06Mar2017,1
289,"I'm an insecure 18 year-old male student. For the past couple of years I've been working hard to improve myself and therefore come to like myself better. While this has worked to an extent, and I've picked up skills and good habits, I still find that I have low self-esteem.
This is starting to really get to me for numerous reasons--one of which you can probably guess is a poor lovelife.
So, my question is: how do I know when I'm being too hard on myself? Trying new things and working to improve myself only takes me so far. I just assumed I would come to like myself in the process, but that seems to be a separate step.
How can I tell which flaws I see in myself need to be addressed, and which ones I need to say to ""fuck it, this is me and I don't care""

292,"So I googled my therapist's name to try to find his fax number and I stumbled upon an article from about 15 years ago describing an inappropriate relationship he had with a female patient. It stated that during their sessions they held hands, kissed, and he fondled her breasts. He paid a large fine and his licence was suspended for 12 months. I have had a positive experience with him and have benefitted greatly from our sessions, but am shocked and disgusted by what I have learned. Should I try to find a new Doctor? Discuss it with him?

294,"Im fully aware that almost every person goes through high school and college faces this issue.  I have been lucky enough to do well in high school w a 4.0 gpa (4.6 w that stupid weighted stuff) w rigorous courses and a high sat and act score (1400/1600 and a 30/36).  Ive been accepted into the University of Georgia and will be going for around 10k a year due to scholarships.  

My problem is i have big dreams and want to be able to make a lot of money to satisfy my love for cars and traveling.  Again-still sound like every student ever. 

I enjoy math a lot but most engineering jobs dead-end at 150-200k from what ive seen.  i would like to make a lot more than that if i work for 20-30+ years.  

Ive been thinking a business major (hopefully PhD) perhaps?  and an engineering minor maybe?  

Hoping that would allow me to work my way up higher in a tech company or something and making paths to a higher salary while doing something i would enjoy.  

Any thoughts or personal experiences?

295,"I've been friends with this girl for like a year, we worked together but I quit a few months ago. She has been a really good friend to me, and is fun to be around, but she's REALLY negative. 

I usually wake up to 4 texts why this day is the worst day ever. Then she'll complain throughout the day. 80% of her texts are complaints and when I share a good story with her she will respond with ""That's good"" and be done. She considers me her best friend but she is far from my best friend largely because of this. 

Last night she sent me - not kidding 17 texts about her roommate doing something that I wouldn't have even batted an aye at. I finally lost it and said you need to stop being so negative. She got pissed and sent me the middle finger emoji. 

Tonight she texted me ""sorry for being rude but you were rude too"" and when I said I can't be your friend if you're so negative she said ""that's what friends are I complain to you and you complain to me"" and I couldn't disagree more. Honestly today was a good day without her complaining to me from the second I got up. 

I don't think I want to be friends with her anymore but I don't know what to do. Les Brown and Dr. Phill - among others - say negative friends drain you and that's how I feel. I'm an optimist and she's causing me a lot of mental stress. Should I just go ghost on her or should I just completely no holding back explain myself like I did here? I don't want to have an argument because it's not worth it, seeing as how the friendship doesn't mean a whole lot to me at this point.

299,"You know we must have had all happened to us at somepoint in our lives but how do you deal with a friend who never contacts you first, never asks how you are or interested in anything about me. Shall I just not bother with her and leave it and move on? ",06Mar2017,1
302,"I am posting on behalf of my fiance. We met a little over 3 years ago. Very soon into our relationship, he disclosed that his last GF was a drug addict. When he broke up with her after just a few months, she accused him of rape, which he obviously denies. She told him she would ""spread a rumor"" about him, and soon after, this started circulating through their social circles. She emailed his work supervisors at his day job claiming she had filed a police report, but HR eventually found that no police report had been filed and the issue was dropped.

4 years have now gone by. We moved to a different state for a while and the issue was gone and forgotten. Most of his friends took his side or no side at all, knowing that the ex had drug issues and a history of acting out.

Suddenly, we've moved back, and she's back, too. My fiance is a semi-professional actor next to his day job, as was the ex-GF. Last month, two of his gigs were mysteriously cancelled without clear reason. Whatever, things happen. This month, someone in charge of an upcoming gig contacted him and let him know that he was receiving emails telling the company not to hire him because of the alleged rape. The employer was skeptical of the emails, saying they came from someone known to cause trouble. They also said that the emails had certainly been sent to other employers (likely explaining last month's events). However, the employer was understandably concerned about what could happen if they went forward with my fiance in the lead role as planned (protest/boycotting? not clear exactly what the threat was).

Our sex has always been 100% consensual. I know this alone does not mean someone didn't rape someone else, but I simply cannot believe that he did. The biggest problems we've had in our relationship have been related to him being a bit of a pushover - I can see exactly how he was the perfect target for this woman.

He doesn't want to cancel the gig, because he feels like he (1) may be seen as admitting guilt and (2) feels like having a 3rd gig in a row cancelled because of this may put him out of the business forever. On the other hand, he has no idea what these people who are spreading rumors might try to do, and doesn't want to jeopardize the reputation of his employer.

What should he do? Given the current climate surrounding these issues, I understand how important it is to protect the right of women to speak out on these issues, police report or not. On the other hand, it appears to be one or more men sending these emails (likely at her bequest), and it is ruining his career. To add to the fun, we are getting married in two weeks. I will stick by him no matter what, but it is frustrating to feel like I can't help him. ",06Mar2017,1
303,"I'm in high school right now. I took both Precal and essentials math so that I would have a safety net. I ended essentials with an 80% last semester, and just now started precal a month or so ago. I'm very bad at precal. I don't want to continue it, because I don't need it for what I want to study, and it's stressing me out. 

My parents are okay with me dropping out, so I talked to my guidance councilor who talked me back into staying in precal, and signed me up for a tutor. That was 2 weeks ago, and just today I got my tutor. I really want to drop precal, but I don't know how to at this point. Please help. ",06Mar2017,1
