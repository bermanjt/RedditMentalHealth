3,"I've been attending community college for almost four years now pursuing a degree in computer science, but all of that was filling out prerequisites for other things and filling out ridiculous ""diversity"" (or whatever the stupid word is that they use) requirements like history 101 - as if you need history to work on *computers.* I feel like I'm going to end up spending another four years stuck in community college working towards something that, in the end, isn't going to guarantee me a decent job. What's worse, although my grades have been good so far (I even keep being sent invitations to join fraternities, but I refuse them because they want $80 for me to join, and there's other things I'd much rather spend $80 on), I know it's only going to get harder from here onward, and I'm already sick of doing the work. 


Furthermore, I don't even want to pursue computer science anymore. I originally chose that because I want to get a job in the video game industry, and I though it would be cool to work on console hardware, but I've come to realize that my mind is just not of the sort to be able to work in that field. I have a pretty crummy memory, and I struggle with numbers and serial codes (so things like comparing computer parts become difficult). I came to realize that what I really want to do is become a character designer and writer for games (and maybe do a bit of composition work), but in that case I should focus on improving my art and creativity, which - to my understanding - is more important for artists than a college degree. Employers of artists care more about what you can do than where you've been, right?


At the same time, I'm also interested in getting a part-time job because I'm sick of never having money to buy things with, and I don't want to juggle college and a job. College leaves me with little enough free time as it is and I simply *need* an adequate amount of free time to not go insane. 


Basically, my plan is to drop out of college, get a part-time job so I have a bit of spending money, and look for an internship with a game developer to help get me into the business. I know my parents aren't going to agree with this plan, but I sure as heck don't agree with theirs (that being finishing college). How can I convince them to let me go through with this, if anything for the sake of my own sanity?",20Feb2017,1
4,"I just got a hysterical call from my mother, the credit card company just called her and informed her that her credit card has been maxed out. She currently has me and my brother as an authorized user on her account.  I checked the credit card statements online and he's been purchasing shoes and car parts on eBay? (I think) The transactions say PayPal. Each charge is for $500 or more. 

This isn't the first or second time he has done this. He has taken checks from my mother's checkbook and has forged her signature and has written himself checks for $1000, plus. When he gets caught he cries, says he doesn't know what's going on with him, he says he's depressed and promises to stop. And then he does it again. ( he's done this 3 times now.) Says he will pay her back and only ends up paying her back half and then forgets about the rest. 

My mother doesn't want to get the police involved? I don't know why. She says she's going to take him off her cc, but never does. He is manipulating her. 

I guess I'm asking for advice to help my mother cut him off. How can I help her do that. He's 25, living at home, rent free. I believe he needs to be reported, how do I do that? Just call the police? Do I have authority to report him or does it only fall on my mother?  She hasn't spoken to him yet regarding the credit card charges, I'm wondering what he'll say this time. 

Thank you in advance for any advice. ",20Feb2017,2

10,"One of my best friends, who is also my neighbor, constantly lies about having a girlfriend. Usually, it's one of the girls at the corner convenience store or a resident at the apartment building where he works as a security guard. Nobody among his neighbors or friends has ever seen him with these girls. His answer is he doesn't want us to meet them, so he has to rent a motel room (no fraternizing with apartment building residents either). The problem with this excuse is that everyone knows he's an alcoholic, gets home mid-afternoon, never goes anywhere after he starts drinking, and passes out by 8:30. As a residents of a small, tight-knit apartment complex, we're all pretty aware of eachother's comings &amp; goings. He's over 50 and doesn't have the money for a motel room. On top of that, he's not handsome (missing teeth, worn out clothes, etc.) nor charming (watched him strike out on multiple occasions). There's more evidence, but I won't bore you. I understand psychologically why he's lying (jealousy, insecurity, etc.), but my question is this:



How do we explain to him that he doesn't need to lie about this?",20Feb2017,1
12,"Hello. I met this girl last semester and we became fast friends. She is gay and I am bi and when I told her, she asked if I would like to casually hook up. I agreed. I went over to her house and we cuddled but I was not ready to hook up. I had changed my mind about being just casual. I realized I started to like her. We went on several dates and then I realized the type of person she is. Needless to say I am very disappointed. She is extremely narcissistic and can barely hold an intelligent conversation. She is also involved in drugs and alcohol. She is the only gay girl at my school that I find attractive. I am disheartened by this but I know that she is not good for me. I see her everywhere everyday, we have to sit next to each other in two classes. Recently, I haven't said anything to her and she hasn't said anything to me. I find this painful. I want to clear the air so that I can get through my day and stop thinking about her so much. What is the best way to get over someone you see everyday? Should I attempt to remain friends with her?

16,"Hi, I have a bit of a problem, and I need some advice. For the past few years, I've started seeing homemade/store-brought/frozen food as ""gross"", ""bad"" and ""not as good"" as food made at a restaurant. It's honestly a big disappointment when I have to make dinner at home. For example, hamburgers at a restaurant taste amazing, but hamburgers I make at home/buy at the store taste awful. I'm assuming this mentality came from the fact that, when I was a kid, my parents rarely cooked dinner at home, and went to restaurants often. How can I change this mentality?

20,I know this has been asked multiple times but I really have no idea when it comes to talking to girls. There's this cute girl in one of my class and we only see each other twice a week (I am graduating this June so I barely have subjects left). I wanted to ask her name and anything (but since  I am always early in class because I am having my OJT before going to class) I have no chance to talk to her because she comes up exactly when the teacher comes and when the class is over she literally goes with her friends (they come in 3) and leave since our class ends in 7:00pm. There's only 3~ months left and our class is only twice a week. I don't know if I am just making excuses for not to talk to her but I have no experience in this.

22,"I'm certain this is a problem many many people have, and yet I can't find much on Google asking this. So here I am.

My parents are wonderful parents. They're not perfect in any regard, but they certainly love me to the depths of their core and try their absolute best. I of course love them back. And yet, I'm not close to them at all. It was strictly a parent - child relationship. I have friends whose dad sends them emojis and memes and stuff like that, which is cool and all but I honestly prefer it this way. It gives me more freedom. But despite this freedom and lack of closeness, I still want my parents to be happy because quite frankly if I didn't after all they did for me, I'd be a sociopath.

The problem is what I want to pursue in life is entirely different from what my parents want from me. What would make my parents happy would make myself unhappy. I could adhere to their traditional expectations - college, job, marriage, nuclear family, family reunions once in a while. Maybe a week long vacation to Europe twice a year. My parents want grandchildren to spoil and celebrate the holidays with. Their dream is a quiet life in some suburb in Virginia with a fireplace and my brother and I to visit once a month as we live only 30 minutes away. But I wasn't meant for that sort of life. I live that life right now, and I am so incredibly unhappy. Perhaps I'm young and naive, and you'll tell me when the hormones stop raging through my body and mind my desires will align with those of my parents, but right now I know that's not going to happen. I've gone abroad before alone, and only there did I find the satisfaction of a ravenous hunger subdued. I want to travel the world with a pair of worn out sandals and a few coins of change, half of which is foreign currency from countries whose names I cannot pronounce. I want to be a foreign correspondent in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, an international volunteer for the Kurdish liberation forces, a deckhand on a fishing vessel in the Bering Sea, a sort of man that half the people he meets thinks he's insane and the other half thinks he's extraordinary. There's so much I want to do, and yet none of it would make my parents happy. 

I want my parents to be happy, I really really do, and I feel so guilty about that. But at the same time, I only have one life to live. The worst part is a compromise seems out of reach, as if I run off to do what I want to for even a few years, my parents would be sick with worry and unhappy during the whole time.

28,"So about a year ago my friend and I both were in a bad fight with our old friend, who chose to spend more time with her boyfriend than with us. It was bad, it got to the point where she wouldn't even respond to our texts or phone calls because she didn't want to spend time with us. One thing led to another and we basically got dumped by her as friends. At the time it was quite mutual to end the friendship, but while we lost a true friend she gained a boyfriend and has never looked back.
I won't deny I was being petty, but at the time I changed the comment of one of my Instagram pictures to 'back when we thought we had a real friend #fakebitch'. Now, I know it was petty, but I completely forgot about it. 
Flash forward about eight months after we stopped being friends, and I get a comment on that picture. It's her older sister, posting about how rude and immature I am. I know I wasn't in the best place in my life at that point, and I still haven't gotten over the friendship dissolving over a boy (a boy, mind you, three years her junior, and who is still in high school). The relationship wasn't that serious and now I not only have an ex- friend who thinks I'm a complete bitch, but her whole family and her boyfriend probably hate me too.
I have never gotten over our friendship ending, it hurt me more than I can explain. To be treated like someone's toy to throw away once they don't want it isn't the best feeling in the world, and it left me with a lot of trust issues. I hardly make any new friends anymore, and it makes college life kind of difficult. 
I shouldn't care what they think of me, but I do. So what can I possibly do to make it any better? I know I will never be friends with her again due to our complicated ending but I feel like a horrible person all over again over one stupid comment.

30,"Hi. I've recently been invited to participate in a rush for a sorority colony, or a brand new sorority on campus. I've got mixed feelings about this event (which starts on Thursdays and goes through the weekend) and have been going back on forth about whether or not I should participate. I have to make up my mind soon, though, because I have to RSVP. Could you guys help guide me?

Here are the pros and cons of rushing now.

Pros:

-I want to get involved on campus. I don't live on campus (I live about an hour away) and am only in one club, which is mostly an online thing. I fell in love with the campus for the variety of clubs it has and want to get back to feeling that way.

-I'd get to be a founding mother, which would be really cool. I love the idea of helping to mold the organization into something great. If I waited until next year, I wouldn't get this chance.

-I'm lonely. I have very few friends on campus and would like to branch out. I'm sure that some people here would be willing to debate whether or not Greek life is the best option for that, but for what it's worth, I think Greek life would be a good fit for me.

-I'm ahead of the curve, credits-wise, and will probably graduate early. If I rush now, I'd have more time in Greek life than if I rushed next year.

-My friends say great things about being in Greek life. If it's as great as they say, why would I wait? Haha.

Cons:

-The time. I don't want to be a drive by member that can never go to anything, but I worry that this will be what happens if I rush this year. I'm only on campus two days a week, and staying past the last bus run is always a huge inconvenience for my family. 

Also, everyone says that colonies take even more time than the average sorority, which makes me nervous.

-The commute. This may be a bit redundant, but it takes me a long time to get to and from campus. Adding more commute time for additional events would be taxing.

-I never went through ""traditional"" rush. I worry about never getting the chance to properly ""meet"" the other sororities before signing myself away.

-This is a more short term issue, but for the events this week, if I call off work, I'd have to find someone to trade shifts with, and I don't know if I'll be able to do so.

-My mom is strongly against me joining sororities-or, at least, the ""traditional"" sororities. Earlier this semester, I expressed interest in going to another event on campus, and she gave me this long lecture about how sorority girls are snobby and mean and racist, and how I'll never make any friends even if I got a bid. Even though I think she's completely wrong, it was very emotionally draining to listen to, and I don't think I'm ready to hear that lecture again for a long time.

-This is really embarrassing, but I actually don't have my driver's license yet (for a wide variety of reasons, but mostly because driving scares me). My goal is to have it soon, but I doubt I'll have it before rush is over, which would make things even more complicated.

What do you guys think? Do you have any additional advice for me?

Thanks!",20Feb2017,1

33,"I'm 25 years old and I live in Canada. My parents are proposing me a trip of 3 weeks, that they will pay for. Of that 3 weeks, they plan to go one week to Ibiza the island (my aunt have a condo at ~1hour of Ibiza the city). I don't mind going, since it would be a good occasion to go to a nightclub, but other then that, I not that into it. The remaining 2 weeks destinations are to be determine. I can propose where to go.

But, I don't know if I want to go. I don't like traveling for a touristic purpose. I would rater go on a trip for a convention, a student exchange or just for work than to go just to ""see other places"". I have few places in mind that I would like to go, but again, it would be more to live/work there for some times than to visit those places. I need a reason, a purpose, to do something.

If you're wondering, I still live with my parents. I don't have a bad relationship with them, but I wouldn't say that I have a very good one either. Also, I already took the plane with them to Florida when I was in high school. So it is not a fear of plane.

There might be something else. 5 years ago, they made me the same proposition. I wasn't trilled, but I was planing to go. Until I had to cancel. I was seriously involved in a startup and I didn't want to miss that. Thinking about it, a feel that the startup was a pretext not to go.

I don't know what to do. At this point, not going is just stupid, as I would miss a incredible opportunity. But I don't feel it. I just don't have the interest of going. *Can you help me understand what is holding me from going? Also, can you think of something we could do other than visiting touristic places?*",20Feb2017,0

45,"So this will be long but please bear with me,

Please note I am the second of three children, I am the VERY quiet kind, not many friends if any to be honest, and very little self esteem. Also, English is my second language, so excuse any errors.
So, this all started after I finished school. I started studying Architecture in a university in my home town and was doing quite well and I did like it. However, my family could not substantiate the amount they had to spend and I was forced to drop out after a year. From then on, I've worked here and there for about a year and due to many problems in my life at that moment (being treated as a child in my house, my lack of a social life, working at something that I wasn't passionate about, and having fallen into a depression) I decided to move to the much bigger city of the capital of my country.
At this point, I had gotten the same job for the same company in this new city (I was a bellboy for a 5 star franchise hotel) and I did very well for myself. It's hard to explain but here everything started going right for me : I was getting payed very well (enough to pay for my rent, food, and then some), I finally lived alone (I loved it! I had no privacy back home), the fact that my work made me interact with so many people on a daily basis made me be much easier to talk to and my social life was getting up off the mud (I was even going on dates and getting laid which didn't happen before), even the city was beautiful with plenty of places to walk around and get lost in (I love walking!) which was a far cry from back home (there was literally trash in the streets with little to no cleanup, nowhere to go since it was a small town, and to top it off a pretty noticeable crime rate, particularly in theft so one has to be aware constantly if anyone is following you, etc). It was going so well that it got to the point where I became very overconfident, cocky even, and I foolishly left my current job with no back up plan (I didn't really like being a bellboy to be honest and one day I said ""Fuck it""). I was so sure that I could get a much better job easily (note that here in my country someone with a high level of English like I have is rare, excluding natives of course). Fast forward a month, no job, and I was chewing away at my last savings. I was desperate and finally accepted a job at a clinic far from where I lived. Thing is, the job was 10 hours, payed me less than the hotel and to even get to and from there I had to take a bus that took around an hour and a half. So my day now  consisted of getting up at around 6 am going to work and coming back at around 10 pm straight to sleep. Needless to say, I wanted out very quickly. I'll also add that my decision to leave was very unpopular with my parents, particularly my mother, and she would call me almost everyday and our conversations would usually end with her telling me to come back and that she did so much for me and I'm throwing my youth away, and that she talked with my dad and he said that now they can pay my brother's and my career (my brother was studying Medicine and dropped out for the same reasons), yada yada. At this point I was feeling very lonely, even if I could talk to people much more normally I still had a hard time making friends so when I left my job so did they stop talking to me. So with my current conditions and my parents' constant pestering I finally caved in, thinking I'd get a career as soon as possible and get the fuck out.
So I returned and started college again and, surprise surprise, I couldn't do it no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't put myself up to it and wold feel no motivation to keep at it. I even changed to another career because I figured I just lost interest in Architecture but it was the same. I ended up dropping out myself and was about to start working again to get enough money to move back to the capital but I stupidly agreed to a proposition from my parents to try out for a national university (it costs dirt cheap but it's hard to get into as the entrance exam was difficult and had a lot of competition for open vacancies. This University is very prestigious in my country so people from all over come to the exam). In my mind I would just humor them and I expected to not get in and that this would give me an excuse to leave. Turns out, the test this year was fucking easy as hell and I got in with barely any study effort on my part. Now my classes start in April (the exam was November 2016) and the wait has been excruciatingly bad. I fell back to my old habits of playing video games all day, not going out of the house, no social life again, I've regained weight (I was chubby before and had lost a lot when I lived alone), my acne was back ( I had an acute acne problem which, surprise, vanished magically when I was living alone, do you see a pattern?) and I couldn't find a damn decent job that wouldn't pay me shit and expect me to work from more than 8 hours a day.
This is where I am, in the biggest depression in my life, no money, no friends, no nothing. I feel empty, I look forward to nothing in my day, no privacy (I share a room with my douchey 24 year old brother and the house/apartment I have is very small for 4 people). There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about leaving again and going back to the place where things made sense for me, where I had a purpose, where I made my own decisions without constant bitching,  and felt like a human being. You might be wondering why I simply don't go up and just leave so I'll explain my reasons. First, even with all their faults I still do love my parents and don't want to disappoint them (they don't know about how I'm feeling. I was never the type to talk about my feelings and they will overreact to this and oppose strongly). Then, I know that if I just endure it I could get my career and move then to have a respectable job while if I go I would have to slug it out (probably go back to the hotel) and work while studying in a half-assed university through their online careers. Also, to move out I'd need a lot of money for travel and rent which means getting a job, and at least 2 months with no spending. Lastly, there is my sister (she is my half sister, different dad) she is 9 years old and just the cutest girl and I felt terrible leaving her when I did (her dad practically abandoned her and my mom when she was only months old) and she was the one that I missed while I was living there. Perhaps these are just excuses to not do anything but they are what is holding me back and in this indecisive state.
To those that have reached this spot, I thank you and ask for your advice. I now this isn't the best place for it but I have no one else to turn to so the internet is my last resort where I could at least vent since I don't really expect many responses (if any). ",20Feb2017,1
46,"I have been trying to change my food habits, but no matter what I do I always find myself going back to sweets such as chocolate, ice cream and cake. I have been slowly gaining weight over this past year and I want it to end because I am starting to feel terrible about myself. I try to eat fruits and vegetables and incorporate a little exercise in my daily routine, but I can't stick to anything. I always find myself craving sweets or gravitating towards general laziness because I am so tired every time I come home. (I typically have 12-14 hour days and the days I do get off I don't want to do anything). I mindlessly eat, stress eat, and eat when I'm bored but it's so hard for me to stop these habits. The worst thing about this is I find myself thinking about food all the time, whether it be a guilty feeling of eating something I shouldn't have, a craving that I am whaving, or ways that I can do better the next time. In my own kitchen I have to fight myself all the time to not grab the sweet, sugary thing, rather than the fruit I have right next to it. I live at home with my family so its not like I can just throw out all the junk so it is out of arm's reach.

49,"I relocated about a year and a half ago, and now my friends who I moved in with are ready for me to move out. I knew this wouldn't be a permanent situation, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to stay in the area.

I feel like I actually brought this on myself when I said about a month ago ""I'd like to try and be in a position to move out sometime this year, just in case you guys decide to put the place up for sale or something"". I feel like that planted the seed, and now that they actually want me to move out (not hostile or anything, they just want to have their house to themselves), I'm getting super nervous.

One thing led to another and we ended up having sex, it was my first time. I don't remember any of it only small bits and pieces. He said I consented. But previous to this happening, he knew I was not okay with sexual intercourse and that I was waiting, he was high also but he said he remembers it all and that I was okay with it. I can't imagine myself consenting and the part I do remember I felt unsafe and scared. I still feel violated thinking about it to this day. he got upset and defensive with me for asking so many questions about the situation and we no longer speak. But I wanted to hear some responses on whether or not you guys think it's rape? Please no trolling or rude answers. Im just trying to get an idea so I can move on and past it. ",20Feb2017,1
52,"Hello, I seem to spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about politics or coming up with strange ways of trying to improve the world. That includes on reddit. (Feel free to browse my account.) I think I do it to such an extent that it interferes with my life goals and causes me to be unhappy. I am wondering if this is a kind of pathological altruism. Right now I have a secretarial job that seems too low-paying to be a long-term fit. I live in my mother's house. I want to move out like a normal person. Do I have a right to mostly focus on getting a better job, one that's commensurate with my ability? Don't I need to devote at least 10 or 20 hours a week to political thinking or organizing? This is too much time for me right now to balance with my career goals. I just don't have the time so I have to decide between one or the other. What if the country makes the wrong choice?

55,"So I like this girl (bet u have never heard that b4). We talk alot in the class and she's really nice. Always says goodmorning and asks about my day b4 I do. We play some sports together (Outside of HS, Like other league that do mixed gender teams). She always puts me on her snap story and always asks me to put her on mine which is an obvious giveaway that she likes me according to my friends. They say a lot of stupid shit though so idk what to think. I snap her sometimes and we just talk about dumb and funny stuff. She's not talking to any other guys, like pretty much all of her friends are girls. So my question is, how can I closer with her?

56,"So for a little background information, my boyfriend, Shane, is gay, a legal adult, and isn't out to anyone in his family.  About a year ago, he was involved with a guy named John.  He and John weren't talking for long, but John became very attached to him.  After a while, Shane broke things off with John and now, a year later, Shane and I are together.  

John has since contacted Shane telling him that he has a nude picture of him.  He even sent the picture to him to prove it. John told him that he wants Shane to do sexual favors for him or else he will send the picture to his family.  When Shane asked John why he would do that, John said, ""I just want to hurt you like you hurt me.""

At the moment we don't know what to do.  Shane does not want his family to find out because they are very conservative and would cut off his funding for college and probably disown him.  Shane does have all of the messages from John in writing through text message.  What do you all think we should do?  Should I call John to have a conversation with him, or could that make things worse?",20Feb2017,1

59,"This post may sound like a first world problem to some.

Everyday, I live because I can't die.
To briefly introduce myself, I'm currently a junior student with a 2.5 GPA at an Ivy League university. I'm not a part of any extra-curricular activities and I barely have internship experiences. My parents don't know my GPA and are hoping that I get into a law school within the T14. 

It's too convoluted to explain why, but I was stuck learning a major that I quickly realized wasn't for me for the first two years of college. I couldn't change it even if I wanted to. By this year, it was too late to pursue something else.

I've never sought professional help or got diagnosed, so this might be complete bs, but I was pretty depressed in middle school. However, things improved dramatically in high school; I became very outgoing and I also overcame my lack of self-esteem. This completely changed again in college. Freshman year was really bad. I had numerous suicidal thoughts, but never suicide attempts. My suicidal thoughts are less frequent now, but this is probably because I've sort of just repressed my despair... if that makes sense. I stopped thinking often about my future or how fucked I am, although it's always at the back of my head. I just lead a very numb life - albeit fragile, because if I really sit and think about my life, I can start crying in 10 minutes.

Right now, I suffer from extremely low self-esteem and social anxiety. I have zero social skills. I try my best to never get out of my comfort zone. The very small circle of friends I have know that I'm a bit socially awkward, but don't know that I'm depressed or struggling internally. Actually, nobody does.

So now it's the second semester of junior year. My friends are all applying for their last summer internships. I don't know if I'll be able to get a single unpaid internship with my GPA and CV. Beyond that, I don't know if I'll be able to go to a grad school. Everything in life just feels too late.",20Feb2017,1
60,"I'm a good student. Exams were last month, and I managed to get perfect scores on almost all of my subjects. The only problem is, the administration called me down on suspect of cheating (history exam), and now it's going to be on my record forever.

I'm a huge perfectionist, I hate failure and I'm terrified of being wrong - so, in my stupidity, I decided to write down some of my answers (not /the/ answers, but my answers) on my hand so that I could verify whether or not I got the question right when I got home. They caught me, I was sent down for further questioning, they took pictures of my hands and arms and sent me home.

The teachers were - thankfully - very lenient. They took off points for questions that contained the keywords I'd written on my hand, and left the rest intact. I had a perfect score otherwise, so I still finished the course with a good grade.

But I'm still really worried - will this go on my record? I know I didn't cheat, but universities reviewing my high school record won't know that. Have I just destroyed my entire future?",20Feb2017,1

65,"Hi /r/advice,

I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. I started my job 2 weeks ago today. My probation period is 1 month and to be honest, I'm not liking it at all.

So, I'm living together with my girlfriend and we need the money for rent. She has her second interview today and things seem to look good. In case she does not get the job we will both be out of work and I'll have to find work really quick or we won't make next month's rent. 

I've been offered an interesting chance at another company and I've sent an email, I should be able to land an interview at the very least and it's a better position than I have now. 

Basically, at least one of us needs a job to pay the rent. I will be able to pay next month's rent with the money I get from my probation period for sure, but if neither of us lands a job we are in trouble. 

Is it smart to already inform my manager I won't be continuing? If I do continue there's a month's notice before I can quit and I really don't like it there. 

What would you do?",20Feb2017,3
66,"Hi there. I literally just finish writing a big thing about my current situation, and it got deleted by accident.

Anyhow, I'll just summarize. For the last few weeks, my mood has been gradually declining. What finally set me over the edge was when I got fired from my first job last week, after only 4 days of work. Since then, I've felt pretty useless.

I have no motivation to do anything, not even stuff I like to do. I've felt apathetic before, but I've never been in a slump like this. This whole week I've done little to nothing productive. I only have to go to school once a week, so I'm technically not failing, although I'm behind in homework.

I'm not necessarily looking for advice or sympathy or anything, I just wanted to put this out there. If I get around to it, I may post more about what I'm going through. Thanks for reading.

68,"In the last year, my mom met a guy she really likes and she's planning on moving in with him in the next few months. Currently, I share a tiny one bedroom apartment with my boyfriend which we rent for $450 a month. Together, we make just over $3,000 in income a month after taxes. 

Since my mom is will be moving, she has offered to let us purchase her home. It is a 4 bedroom home that needs a bit of love: it is in a very safe neighborhood and the house itself is in fine condition. The issues it has are largely cosmetic. The most costly improvement that will need to be made is that the basement currently only has one retaining wall and will ""flood"" (no more than 1/2 inch) of water during heavy rain. 

I absolutely love the home. I spent a large portion of my life there and when I look at that house I see limitless potential. It has a huge kitchen, central air, and lots and lots of space. 

Currently my mom owes $120k on it (out of $130k; she refinanced last year) and makes $950 a month payments. She has agreed to pay $300 of that cost for the first 3-5 months we live there while we get settled in and has stated that we can take 1-2 years to determine if we like ""house ownership"" before she officially transfer the house to us. She has also said that if things don't work out with her new boyfriend, she has no interest in moving back into the house. 

There are a lot of benefits here: more space, a house I love, a house my boyfriend and I can grow in, a house we could start a family in some day (if we choose to do so), and the ability to have pets. 

The downsides are that the payments will be much higher, we will not be moving any closer to our workplaces (currently we commute about 45 minutes to or from work), and that we will be living in my mother's house (it may take a year or two for her to let it become ""our house."")

The finances are what I'm most concerned about: although I budgeted everything out and we should be able to do the $650 very comfortably, currently we live paycheck to paycheck because of our poor spending habits. We frequently eat out and I (to be blunt) often get depressed and blow money. I have several expensive hobbies which I also often spend money on. 

This is something that I really want, but it's also a big commitment. I'm thankful to my mom for giving us *so* much flexibility, but the thought of all it of still makes me really nervous. I'm looking for some second opinions... What do you think Reddit, should we go for it or nah?

Edit: It's not set in stone yet, but I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and currently am attending night classes to brush up on my programming skills after not having programmed in several years. My boss is aware of the situation and my goal with my current company is to move into development ($30k/year -&gt; $45k/year) in April. We are working closely with the development team, management, and HR to make this happen. If it doesn't happen, I will likely be looking for programming work elsewhere. ",20Feb2017,1

They told me I don't have to do any nudity, and I get my own studio so I don't need to worry about the technical stuff. It's only  25 hours a week, and I've always wanted to be a model. 

The problem I'm having is that I feel like I'll be seen as a stripper, because that's basically what I'm going to be, only no nudity. It's a job that I can't tell my parents about, it's a job that people are going to shame me for. It's great money and I don't have to be nude, but I'm confused?

73,"Hey y'all, I'm a Freshman in college and recently started an active sex life. I belive I'm generally an okay person (I guess everyone does though), and have always practiced consent and safe sex in every relationship I've been in. But I had an incident early last semester that has been haunting me and might end up blowing up in my face.

Me and some friends were having a party in the dorm room of a mutual friend who I had never met, a girl who I'll call Kate (for reference, I'm a masc presenting genderqueer person). Everyone got really crossfaded, including me. But I have a higher tolerance than most so I was a level or two behind everyone else. Me and Kate were hitting it off, having fun and it was just her and I left in her room at a certain point. We both got into her bed and just kind of cuddled for a bit (clothes on). I was just planning on falling asleep there and leaving in the morning, but at a certain point, she stuck her hand down my pants and started to jerk me off. Now, while I wasn't as drunk as her, I was drunk enough to think the next few things were a good idea (not that it's a justification for anything, just a circumstance). I responded by doing the same. I was getting into it, so I asked her if I could eat her out, at which point she mumbled something incomprehensible. I then released that she was too drunk for this and stopped touching her and rolled over. At that point, I should have just left and gone back to my room, but I was drunk and tired so I just tried to go back to sleep. At some point, Kate's friend entered the room and kicked me out, so I just went back to my room anyway.

The next morning, I realized what had happened and instantly regretted it, realized that she was too drunk for what we did. At some point later I told a friend, but they didn't really say anything of note. Kate and I continued to hang out, and I even stayed in her dorm for a few nights because her roommate had moved and I hate being in a single room. At a certain point she asked me if I remembered what happened that night, and that's when the panic started to hit me. At that point, I made my worst mistake of this entire ordeal, and lied to her. I said that she tried to jerk me off and I refused. I gaslighted her like an asshole, like an abuser, just like the rapist pieces of shit that I had rightfully demonized in the past. 

A day or two later, she suddenly kicked me out of the dorm while I wasn't there and put my shit in the hallway. I assume this is because my friend told her what I had told them (as they should have), or she just didn't want a roommate anymore (she's just kind of an erratic and not very nice person by nature, so it's honestly not out of the question). I thought this would all go away if I ignored it. But more and more this guilt is piling up and I don't know what to do. I want to talk to Kate about this, but it happened so long ago and I'm so deep in this already that I can't summon up the courage to. Her friendship isn't that valuable to me (I found out over time that she's just not really a great person), but it's the principle of the thing that matters. 

I've been seriously reanalyzing myself and how I actually morally am. I hope I didn't make this out to be a sob story, and that I have successfully communicated the guilt I feel about the situation. I'm not looking to be told I did nothing wrong (because I obviously did wrong), I'm looking for any advice anyone can give me. I also would hope you all would refrain from simply writing me off as just a piece of shit, because reality is more complicated than that.",20Feb2017,1

79,"So, where can I start?
I finished high school in december/2015. As usual in my country (Brasil), I took a couple of tests for colleges (FUVEST, for the USP and VUNESP for the UNESP), and an SAT-like one (ENEM).


With the ENEM results you can get in three government program type things called SiSU (to get into federal/state universities), ProUni (to get into private ones) and FiEs (this one is just a sort of student loan).

Anyway, I get into SiSU and, with my grade, get in the Computer Science course for a nice Federal College (UFSCar).

It's in a city a little far, so I move to a frat and start studying there. But, in the very first week, I realize that only one of the 5 classes I have through the week actually deals with programming. The other ones are focused on Math and Physics. Also, I start feeling like crap, being away from my family and my gf, only coming home on the weekends. After the second week, I give up and go back home.

I know, I didn't really even try to stick it out. But, you see, I've never really been a big ""selfesteem"" kinda guy, and being ignored by EVERYONE from my classes (I'm not into parties, and that's where they met each other) I just felt really bad. I listened to podcasts 24/7, just to have some human contact.

When I get back home, I decide I'd take the ENEM again this year, so I sign up.

Anyways, I wait around 'til june (there's a SiSU/ProUni/Fies thing every semester), and, with ProUni and my 2015 ENEM grade, I get in a private college to study History. I've always loved History, and had already tought of being a History Teacher for a while.

I still take the ENEM test, just for the heck of it. The semester goes easily, as I live with my parents (the private school was on a city just 40min away by car) and (mostly) have no problem developing friendships within the class.

Fast forward to the beggining of 2017. I get in two courses on SiSU: Social Sciences, again at UFSCar, and Biology, at USP (one of, if not the, best college of the country). I skip the UFSCar one, as I don't want to live there again. But the USP one gets my attention. I don't like Biology as much as History (though I do like it), but, studying on USP would be a great opportunity. Even though I'd have to move to another city (1h away from where I live, but there's no way I could go there and back everyday, because of the class hours).

Anyway,
TL;DR: Currently studying History, a thing that I really like, with great people, and living with my family, close to my girlfriend. But in a very weak, unknown to most, college. Also, if I undergrad in History around here, the only option I have is to teach. And, as much as I think I'd like that, I'm not that sure. Have a chance to study Biology, that I don't KNOW if I like that much, in a great college, probably the best on the country. But would have to find a new place to live, in a new town, away from my family and girlfriend, to see them only on the weekends (though I already only see my gf on the weekends, so no harm there). If I go with Biology, besides teaching, I could also focus on lab work, and reserch. Also, in USP I would probably get great networking.

TLTL;DR;DR: Currently studying something I like in a crappy college, could study something I don't know if I like that much in a great college. But would have to move away from family and gf.

Anyway, any advice is accepted, please. I'm desperate and don't know what to do. Also, I have to decide by 21/02 morning, so REALLY desperate.

P.S.: Sorry for the long post, and for any english mistakes (it's my second language).",20Feb2017,1
81,"Long story short I told this girl that I've known for 3 years  that I liked her(second time I've told her, first time was last year but she was seeing someone) and wanted to be more than friends, she said she wasn't interested in a serious relationship at the moment. So a few weeks pass by and we agree to go on a date.it was January 20th  It goes well we walk around town eat icecream, I don't hold her hand or touch her much during the date, but after the date when we were outside my house I held her really close to me and she held me back and I was close to kissing her but people came and ruined it and she had to go. She later texted me that she had fun and thanks and that kind of stuff. Fast forward to valentine's day I ask her if she wants to hang out and she says yeah, I offer to go to a fair, but it rains so I come up with going to get coffee at this place cause she loves coffee. She asked if there's wifi there cause she wants to do homework...so I kinda doubted if she knew it was a date. I show up to her house but she texts me that she's at the library, I go to the library and we leave from there. I gave her flowers and she seems really happy about it. So we hang out drink coffee, do homework, and then we head back to the library. We hang out in the parking lot for a while outside our cars, I hold her and she hold me back, righr before we both have to go I held her really close to me and was about to kiss her when all of a sudden she grabbed Me and kissed me. It lasted a little bit and then we both left. Later that night, she texted me ""sorry about kissing you I just always wanted to do that ever since I liked you wayyyy back in the day, it won't happen again until we both know what we want"" this confused me because I already told her what I want. So how come she doesn't know? If she really liked me wouldn't she already know and not have to question it?.

83,"I feel pathetic and weak right now. I feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like everything I do is pointless and meaningless and nihilistic. I chose to major in Economics and become an analyst/broker/trader because I honestly don't know what else I want to do with my life or what I want to become. My plan was that I'd retire at 35-45 after I'd saved a good amount of money, like what some of my econ professors and teachers did, but I have a hard time seeing that light at the end of the tunnel. 

I get mood swings. They happen relatively common and take over the course of hours or sometimes days. I'm in a relatively happy or neutral mood and then I get bombarded with these thoughts and scenarios about career, about money, about romance, about companionship, about solitude, about life and death. I think about all the people that I'm close to right now that I'll never get to see again, and how it feels so cold and distant. Eventually they fade away or on the rare occasion go away because of something successful that happened to me.

Speaking of success, I feel like I'm fucking up every opportunity that I've ever been handed in life. I've been accepted into one of the top 30 schools in the US, I've been part of a financial task committee board for my hometown's public school district, and I work an office job where I do data entry and organization at my university's medical school. And yet I still fuck it up. I should be preparing for my midterm I have tomorrow and getting a good night's sleep and here I am on Reddit at 1 AM.

I can't ever concentrate. It's so hard for me to do so, even when I get 9+ hours of sleep. My mind goes spastic. Somebody on Reddit once described ADHD as being a window that allows you to look into the outside world, and that people with ADHD/ADD can't control where this window goes. I have a hard time controlling where this window goes, but I especially feel guilty about it because it never goes to anything productive aside from the occasional beatboxing tutorial or r/AskHistorians post.

I don't really have anyone intimate or close to that I can go over this with. I don't have any close friends that I could talk to about this. I have tried to confront this with my parents and they were extremely unhelpful. I can't really go to my roommate because 1) He has his own midterms he needs to worry about, and 2) I've never felt he was a qualified person to approach on mental problems. I don't have a girlfriend or siblings, so that's not an option. My school offers counseling services but I've used up all 10 of my complimentary appointments and I didn't feel like they helped me out very much. 

The worst of it all is that compared to some of the people I know who have very serious mental issues, my problems seem trivial to theirs. At least I don't have heart palpitations and at least my parents are probably still going to be alive a decade later. At least my dad, in his own way, still loves me. At least I'm not affected by Trump's travel ban, and at least I belong to a model minority group. Hell, a lot of the people on this very subreddit have gone through more shit than I ever will.

I get unhappy with often perceived things. Whenever I hang out with any group of friends, I feel cold and isolated and unwanted even though that's probably not the case. Whenever I talk with my parents I feel like my existence has been reduced to a checklist of things that I need to fulfill. My current path is filling out that checklist, but if I stray from this path I feel like I'll end up like my parents, where for a good chunk of their lives and mine we grew up poor and ate boiled lettuce for dinner because they screwed up somewhere in their lives. And quite honestly I could describe my romantic struggles and desires through the music video to Hozier's ""Someone New"". My attractions and feelings for various women in my life are strong but that makes me feel distant. If I don't take a risk and ask them out there's just this romantic and sexual tension in the air, but if I do, I've found out that it always fucks up the relationship between us and basically makes it to the point of where we can't hang out anymore, if nothing else because we drift too far apart and lead too busy lives to constantly see each other.

As I type this, I feel like I've been drugged. My feelings seem to be incredibly dull when I'm actually trying to express them and incredibly sharp and painful at the worst possible times.

I've tried so hard to implement Noah Elkrief's 5-step process. I bought his book, I bought his audiobook, I have used his website many, many times. I wished I could implement it correctly because it seems like I've muted some of the more beneficial thoughts and left my mind to deal with some of the more unsavory ones.

A non-university sponsored therapist is just too much of a financial and logistics burden right now. I wish I could be prescribed medication or something, but that is a hellishly long and convoluted process. I am at my wits end.",20Feb2017,2
84,"Hi all,
I'll try to keep this very long story brief.  I moved into an off-campus house in my final year of undergraduate.  Several weeks before signing the lease, I notified my roommates (one whom I knew before, one whom I had never met) that I was going to adopt 2 kittens and would need a place/roommates who would be willing to live with cats.  I additionally told them it was fine if they didn't want to live me still, and gave them time to get back to me.  They decided that it would be fine and we signed the lease, mine including a special addendum which allowed for two kittens to live with me for a $300 non-refundable security deposit ($150/cat).  

Cut to 5 months later: my roommate who was abroad (the one that I didn't previously know) returns.  She's lived with me and the cats for a month and a half and comes into my room to tell me that she is allergic and would like to work out a solution.  I promptly looked up anything and everything that I could do to help (I don't want her to be miserable in her own home) and found several solutions: deep cleaning regularly, not allowing them in the common areas when she is in there, replacing the air filters, brushing/bathing them, etc.  I started on my cleaning regime the next morning and sent her a text letting her know what progress had been made.  She said that was great and that we could re-assess the situation in a couple of weeks.  Two days later, I receive a text saying that she talked to the landlord and he said I can keep my cats at his unoccupied home across the street, which he currently uses as housing and office space for himself when he is in town.  I did not feel comfortable moving my animals into an abandoned home, partially because it wouldn't be fair to them and partly because I was worried about them getting into things.  I additionally didn't think that it was appropriate to include the landlord in this since we (1) hadn't waited more than 48 hours to see if everything I did would help, (2) he is not an RA, and (3) I am legally entitled to have cats in the home.  This did not go over well.  I was informed that I had until the end of the week to get them out and was told that I was not being empathetic and that her allergies were extreme (e.g. swolen eyes).  

I politely discussed with them, but after not getting anywhere I called the landlord and inquired about me moving to the place across the street.  He said that it would be fine, although he was ""doing us a favor"" because the lease had not been broken by any of our actions.  My rent and utilities will stay the same, but because I am occupying his accommodations while he is in town, he needs my security deposit to cover his hotels for the next three months.   I had planned on using the deposit for future housing/expenses (poor college student) and did not have it within my budget to pay.  I admittedly also feel as though it is unfair to ask me to pay to inconvenience myself half way through the semester by packing up an entire house worth of stuff and moving.  

I am willing to leave because I genuinely do want what's best for my roommate, but do not have the resources/am not willing to pay.  I am being berated as being cold, un-empathetic of my roommates allergies (to be fair she didn't know that she had them, although I was informed that she was aware that she was allergic to most other animals before moving in with me), and ridiculous for not wanting to move and pay for myself or keep my cats at an unoccupied home for 3 months.  

Am I being unsupportive of my roommate? I feel as though I have been reasonable in going out of my way to accommodate her/be responsive to her needs (offering to corral the cats into a certain area, cleaning daily, and if that didn't work moving during the middle of the semester), but they don't seem to be on the same page as me.  Advice?

tl/dr: told roommates I was getting two cats before moving in.  Roommate then discovers that she is allergic after living with them for a month and a half.  Wants me to pay $600 to move myself out of our house, unwilling to compromise or cover moving expenses. ",20Feb2017,1

--

A few weeks ago, after a lot of introspection and reflection, I finally admitted to my boyfriend that I am considering the possibility that might be polyamourous. I won't go into detail on how all of the realization happened but I wanted to be honest with my boyfriend so I told him. I love my boyfriend very much it's just that I feel that I have been hindering so many blooming relationships because polyamory is taboo and ""wrong."" 

Being the absolute saint that he is, he told me he understood me but would not be able to handle being in an open relationship. He asked me if I could remain monogamous for him and just let him know if I was starting to have feelings for somebody else. I said yes.

Honestly, at that time, I though I could do it ans was starting to disregard this attraction I have with this new guy. I put that aside because I didn't want to lose my boyfriend. He is the most amazing, understanding, and generous person in the world and I can't lose ""us""

Fast forward to last Saturday. I got drunk and had sex with the other guy... that turned to a semi-three way because we were having sex in our friend's room while she was there and had to ""ask permission."" The sex was phenomenal.

Clearly I was wrong having betrayed my boyfriend's trust when I promised him that I would be faithful. I have decided to tell him about it tomorrow and admit everything (we will only be able to meet tomorrow and I'd rather tell him in person). Being the nice person that he is, he will probably forgive me, ask for space, but take me back. I would love nothing but to be with him.

My dilemma is that this sexual awakening. My boyfriend is a virgin and I have been waiting for him for two years (which is really difficult for someone with such a high sex drive). Sex was so good with the other guy and he is more than willing to be fuck buddies with me. I am also bisexual and miss having sex with girls a lot. Having amazing sex after this two year period of third basing every three months made me want sex all the time again. I am horny 24/7 and am fully aware that I will have to wait again in case my boyfriend does take me back.

I am half ready to break up so that I can become sexually active again. But I love him and losing him will means losing someone that loves me wholeheartedly and I know I will be happy spending the rest of my life with... eventually. It's just that thinking about it, I feel like 25 is too young to think about the ""rest of my life""

I'm sorry this sounds so confusing. I am very, very confused. I love him and want to keep the relationship. But I need sex as well. Help me, please. What do I do?",20Feb2017,1

I grew up in a house where my father was not around much and when he was, I was scared of him. I was scared because he yelled A LOT and would sometimes physically assault my brother. He was also creepy in a sexual way. I didn't like him and I didn't want to be around him.

Years later I found out he sexually abused my mother, sister and brother and had serial affairs with my mother's friends.

I've had years of therapy for depression. I'm now seeing a psychologist whose theory is that, as survivors of abuse, we need empathy and then identification. As in, it's hard to explain, but he says that I am like my father. 

He says my problems are to do with rejecting the part of me that is like him. WTF? 

I have always morally judged my father, even as a young person, because my mother did. It was a complicated relationship. And now I'm told I'm like him.

I'm wondering if I should kill myself. He was a fucked up jerk and sure he had his own issues and was loved by some, but if I am remotely like him in his insensitive, boundary-crossing, rage-fuelled disregard of others, then I don't want to inflict that on anyone. 

Don't tell me I can be different to him if I 'try', I've been trying for years and this theory actually makes sense to me. 

I don't know if I've given enough information.

My coworkers and I were sharing cute childhood stories. I told them about my early childhood best friend. We met in preschool and always played and hung out with each other during school. If I remember correctly I went to her birthday party and knock off chucky cheese in our town although that memory is a bit fuzzy. Anyways for the most part we were friends at preschool. After preschool we never saw each other during the summer. When kindergarten came around I was dead set on not going. My mom and me were in front of the school doors and I just wouldn't go in. I was honestly kind of acting bratty and just wouldn't go. Out of no where she comes up and grabs my hand and I instantly shut up and go inside the classroom. Instantly stopping my complaints and not saying a word. After kindergarten we both moved away. So being kids we never talked anymore. Every once in awhile I will think back and wonder what would of happened if we never moved.

Anyways, all the girls I work with asked me if I ever tried to look her up. In response I asked them ""Wouldn't you find that creepy"". They all said ""No, that would be romantic"".

109,"I'm a 20 years old, and I have been dealing with a more than dysfunctional relationship with my mother for the most part of 8 years now. I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.

I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.

University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.

I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.

It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.

I know, it is ridiculous to be jealous of my sister, who is still kid. But ever since I introduced my boyfriend to my sister, she is kind of obsessed with him. She talks about him all the time, how great guy he is etc. And he reinforces that by taking all three of us to cinema or other kid friendly events frequently, to see kids movies. He also gives her expensive gifts for good grades or birthday and generally is being really sweet with her.

Sometimes, I feel like he likes her even more than me and that they are more happier together than we are in the relationship.

I'm a lazy man in nature. I would often slack off in bed and do nothing to help with stuff at home. Of course, it's expected that it's one of the **prime** reasons why this all started, but my dad used to be so pessimistic about it.

I'm sure doing the best I can to do some chores here and there, but it seems that he's not doing his part anymore (in my perspective). He would start ""engaging in combat"" with me if I start using my phone (which he bent in half just recently) or the family laptop, and say that I use them too much.

He's also against the LGBTQ community since he's very religious. When I came out as pansexual, he was *extremely* against it, and he said that I would never go to heaven because ""I'm living out a sin"". He also said that he accepts me as a son and not as a pansexual, but I extremely doubt it. 

It would rarely lead to stuff like physical abuse, but there was just this one time where I just couldn't grasp the injustice in his actions that I ran to one of my classmate crying. I am certain that he knew I didn't open the gate and leave our pets to sh*t inside the house, but he had to make a big deal out of it and landed a blow on my stomach. Outside the house where everyone could see. I let it pass anyway.

Just now, he kicked me out of dinner and said up front that I could never start a conversation with him ever again. I just need advice on how to deal with him, and to how I can fix our relationship once and for all.

(Also, please leave some clarifications as I know myself that I explained this vaguely. I was in a rush when I typed this.)",20Feb2017,1
116,"I know they're right. But I suffer from depression and though I take pills for it, it still seems through sometimes. Not only that but I also have ADD and sometimes it causes me to have no filter. It's not unusual for me to say something hurtful even though I really like someone. My friends also tell me I shouldn't judge people so harshly. I usually try and use my bitterness for comedy but I can tell even when people laugh, they're worried about me.

121,"So this is going to be a little lengthy, and I need some help here. 2 years ago my best friend from middle school (that's a girl) let it be known that she liked me. Would visit me at work everyday (i worked at a gas station) talked to me every morning, etc. 

I've always felt she was in my eyes, the most beautiful girl i've ever laid eyes on, the most insane smile, and great personality. 
We talk for a few weeks, which at that point she was going through a divorce. Well the guy also came into my work would never say nothing to me but thought we were having sex. Now i'm not like that, and I told her that I don't want to be a ""home wrecker"" so I would back off.

Fast forward a week later or so I get completely hammered and tell my best friend who had a long relationship with her that she wanted to have sex, and date blah blah blah.

Now it's been two years almost, she had deleted her facebook and also cut communication off with me. She is now divorced and single. I got her to text my phone last night after contacting her best friend and I kind of just left a little bit of clues here and there to her friend so I am assuming she got curious and texted me with the ""so why do you keep trying to get ahold of me""

Long story short, I pretty much told her how she's beautiful, how i've had a crush on her since middle school, and acknowledged that I messed up. Her response was, it's been 2 years what do you want me to say? 

This is where I am stuck and do not know where to go from here. I am horrible with girls, and have a problem with things like this. 

Any advice would be sweet. Thanks in advance. Sorry for it being so lengthy.",20Feb2017,1
123,"I'm trying to be as ambiguous as possible with my company  &amp; country to remain anonymous, sorry if it's unclear:

I started working for an international company that gave me an amazing break-through experience into an entry level position with minimal training.

I did multiple jobs as our business grew because it wasn't in payroll to hire more ppl - but I was grateful to get the experience. Fortunately, my main role is creative, so I enthusiastically put in overtime to finish my tasks. 

I worked my ass off for over 6 months and impressed our marketers as well as my colleagues. This may seem too anecdotal, but a few coworkers have said, ""You're the face of our company branch""/""I've been to similar organizations, but I've never seen (blah, blah) done so well."" Even the assistant director of another branch told my boss I was practically running the place when she had to fill in for him. She eventually took me aside one day and said you're better off leaving if they don't give you what you want because you work too hard for the company.

I now have to transfer to a student visa in order to stay in the country, which I did for multiple reasons that I'm happy with, as well as wanting to stay with the company for at least another 6 months to have it look good on my resume (1 yr). 

Unfortunately, you can only work 20 hours on a student visa. Which two of my colleagues are doing to stay with the company, and he's paying them full time, to work full time, while they take a dodgy self-assessment course where you don't need to actually show up to class. 

I asked my boss for the same deal, and he said no. He made an exception for them, and not for me, which hurts considering all the effort I put into this role. (And it went right to the head of one of my coworkers who successfully got full time &amp; student visa, who frequently made mistakes - ugh!).

My boss has since hired 4 full-time new people, and all the extra things not in my job description have been given to them, and I can finally focus on my main role.

I was ok with this, because I got to keep my job and relax a little (study).

Here's the issue ... one of the new people he's hired is taking a vacation for 3 weeks, and now my boss is going to ask me to work full-time until he gets back. Obviously, I can use the money, but it's the principal the bothers me. At first, I thought he was doing me a favor by keeping me on part-time, but then I realized I could easily fulfill a full-time role with the position I've been doing all along. I'd like to believe he's keeping me because he knows I'm good at it, I can successfully do my role in only 20hrs/week AND it's good for payroll.

Am I in the wrong for feeling the way I do? I want to negotiate, but I feel like I'm in no position to do this, and I feel too stubborn to take on the extra hours for the next few weeks based on principal - is that stupid? My girlfriend is angry with hin but says I should do it to keep the job because it pays well. What would you do? ",20Feb2017,1

126,"Hello everyone, I want to thank you first of all for clicking here so I can share my story with you. First I want to just say how fucking terrified I am right now. 

So this is what is happening, my fiance came home from work on Thursday with what looked like bite marks on the bottom part of her breast, her bra was drenched in sweat, the marks almost look like pimples or fire ant bites they were pretty red. At first I tell her not to stress out about it because maybe an ant got into her bra or something. See fast forward to Saturday we went to a couples massage afterwards she said her arm was hurting in the side where the bite marks were. I feel her side and feel a small lump under her armpit about the size of a pea. She works at a hospital so she tells me that's her lymph node. Immediately i feel a cold sweat coming to me. I tell her that it's probably the lymph nodes reacting to the bite. Fast forward to this morning and the bite marks are slowly going away but her arm is still very sore and she said she can still feel the lump. She wanted to wait a bit but after insisting she said she will set something up for Wednesday. I'm just loosing my shit but trying to seem composed for her. I wanted to let this off my chest so bad but I don't know anyone I can do that with :(

I have been googling every single other possibility that isn't cancer and didn't get to sleep much because I am thinking of the worse. I am imagining going through something this tough with her. And seeing her smile go away. I feel so scared and I don't know what to do. I am trying to be strong and positive for her but damn it's hard as hell not to feel like crying when I see her smile at me.

135,"It's my third year of college, and my biggest obstacles for most of my life are just getting harder: health anxiety, general anxiety, some social fears, some depression, and my ~four year relationship. 

I feel insecure in my field (digital media) when it requires me to be talkative or work with others. Sometimes just the project itself is hard because of time or medium constraints. I feel insecure as a friend because I have a few close ones I love and always worry they will become angry at me and I'll lose them. 

I feel insecure in myself because when I am happy I am talkative and I feel like I am annoying those around me (sometimes) or talking too much about myself and I feel selfish (this is mostly around my boyfriend, who is also less talkative than I am in general).

My relationship is stressful because I am at a place where any romantic relationship feels like a stressful task. Maybe due to psychological effects of my parents divorce and my first love from a decade ago (whom I am not quite over, I realize, though I deny it, and though I haven't spoken to him in years), and other things I don't know, I set standards for my partner when I enter a relationship and slowly they become more and more unmet. Aside from the half-harsh standards, this relationship leaves me wanting more. He's supportive and funny and we connect, but he doesn't often inspire me or lead much of his own life (no friend of his own, his spare time goes to video games etc). I often find myself wanting to be friends with him, but I'm being honest about my feelings to him rather than suddenly breaking up (which I've already done to him twice). I also often still want to cuddle him etc, so I'm confused there. I want him to experience more and he has permission to be with others, though he hasn't pursued that. I think we might just slowly fade out, which is apparently what he said would be most painless for him, if we do break up, I guess??

I feel stuck in my relationship, but I also feel stuck in my living situation. I am a full time student so i can't afford my own place but I hate having roommates. My social anxiety (?) Sometimes keeps me stuck in my room when they are in the kitchen outside and it just sucks. I don't feel like I can be creative in this space sometimes, which is bad for an artist. Maybe my boyfriend always being here is a contributor to that. I don't know.

I feel my depression creeping back because of all of this. I don't want to cut again. I don't know myself anymore. I don't know what to do. Yes I'm seeing a counselor. It's just a long process.

tl;dr: School is overwhelming. Relationship is confusing (comforting yet constricting). I feel stuck and lost. How do I find myself",20Feb2017,1

He emigrated from what was then a communist eastern european nation to the US years before I was born which is part of it.

141,"Has anyone dealt with strange friendships?

I have been dealing with an ex-friend for 8 months where I unfortunately have to see her. She emailed me giving me an excuse to how she felt like she couldn't be my friend, but then she publicly posted a status on Facebook (so that I could see it) saying ""Just a friendly reminder y'all to live your own lives and dream your own dreams. Competition is ugly."" To which I responded with a cordial ""I'm sorry if you feel that way"", ""goodbye"" and ""thank you for all of her help, I wish you all the success in life."" END. It was too bad, but it is what it is. I had to block her after her public post.

The friend had been cold to me ever since I got engaged and then married. I thought that it might have been because I had been so wrapped up in my world/wedding that I didn't spend enough time on my friendship. Everything seemed okay talking to her before. She has been with her boyfriend for years, and before she mentioned marriage (she even looks up rings), but then she was telling me they ""don't want a real wedding"".

Fast forward to running into her once (and possibly for future endeavours as well) where I was the bigger person and said a quick hello, congratulations on your job success (she got a new job before we ended our friendship) and a smile. Moved on to the next conversation. After this I got nasty looks, pointing, and being whispered about while she was in the corner with her friend. I pretended not to notice.

Now she's getting crazy on everything social media (8 months after the end of our friendship). Linkedin, Instagram, etc. to which I had to block her. To which she got mad, said ""Winners are focused on winning, losers are focused on the winner."" and then went out of her way to get around the blocks and block me herself.

155,"Hello everyone I need some advice on a problem my house is having with our MUCH older roommate, two of us are 20 and the other is 21 the problem roommate is 26. I'm just going to refer to everyone as their age instead of names because it's kinda complicated haha. 

So we moved into our place this August and 26 was kind of a last minute addition when another person dropped out. We found her on Craigslist through an ad that requested 420 friendly fun and adventurous roommates to join our house. 26 replied and for the first few months she seemed pretty cool but condescending but she seemed to warm up after a while. However she always had something to complain about whether it be how people our age are so immature, petty and passive aggressive, or leaving passive post it notes about things she ""noticed"" around the house that needed to be fixed instead of talking to us personally. 26 also has a cat and our door is kind of sticky so her cat got out a few times two of those times were completely my fault and I apologized right away, two more times I found the cat outside when I was on the way to work, and a few other times the cat has been found outside by others. Also 26 has been sleeping with/dating our former friend who is 19. Majority of the time of our lease she has been unemployed until this 19 year old said something that supposedly ""motivated her to get a job"". 

So lately especially after getting said job 26 has been acting short and rude to the roommates but especially myself. I decided maybe I was doing something to make her angry so I got ready quieter, didn't listen to music in the morning, went to my room to watch Netflix so it didn't wake her after she went to bed, and tried to be extra clean. I also thought maybe I was just imagining things because I have bp2 and anxiety and have a lot of negative self talk. But one night 21 and I were talking and he brought up that she was acting short and weird with him too and wondered if she would want to or if we should agree to live with her again next year. 

A few days later 26 and I had plans for a Friday night/ Saturday kind of girls weekend and come 4pm Friday 26 said I'm going to my BFs for a while see you later. She didn't come home till 6 pm Sunday. On Saturday I texted her twice asking if she was still wanting to shop and if she was going to come home since we hadn't heard from her. After a text exchange of a few messages she started getting rude and eventually snapped on me in a very unneeded way to which I thought I'll talk to her in person and figure it out. 

Monday night 26 came home and I talked to her about the text thing and we came to an apology and explained our sides at the end I asked her if there was any thing else we needed to talk about and she said no. Tuesday was Valentine's Day and I have a tradition of giving roommates valentine candy so I put candy outside 26, 20, and 21's doors. 26 was avoiding 21 and I and was getting drunk alone in her room when she came out to the candy I asked if she saw it and said happy Valentine's Day I thought we could all use something sweet! She said thanks! I didn't get you anything but I will tomorrow to which I replied that's  okay you don't need to. 

Wednesday 21 said we all need to make sure we lock the door to our roommate chat to which 26 said I can confirm just found the door opens and the cat was outside. 21's girlfriend said she found the cat outside on the porch the other day and this is when 26 gets more immature. She said Jesus fucking Christ I can't believe this we need to talk about our living asap this is the last straw for me. This part wasn't unexpected. 21 said that he had been the last one to leave and apologized to which 26 replied well this is my last straw we need to talk tonight when will everyone be home. 21 said when he was off and I said I didn't know because I was out of town.  26 then said okay well I will do this now I refuse to sign a lease with you because you are too lazy to make sure the door is closed and the cat doesn't get out. 

21 and 20 both called me to say they couldn't believe she had been that rude and blamed me after 21 said it was his fault! After this 26 has been too immature to speak to me in person and has gone as far to leave more passive aggressive notes and went to get her own pots and pans so she could tell us not to use them since majority of our cookware belongs to me. She's being very rude to all roommates and passive aggressive we do not know what to do especially since she is older and supposed to be more mature than us. She is so cowardly as to avoid us and not talk about any of it in person. We just don't know what to do and have 7 month of our lease left... HELP

156,"My younger sister (She is 15 I'm 28) has been struggling with her mental health. A little background: My dad got a job out of state my mom spends half her time here half her time with my dad. So my sister can finish high school she is living with me part time. 

 She claims to have multiple persons in her head that tell her to do things. Today she texted me telling me that she wants to hurt herself, which is new, usually she wants to hurt other people. In the past I have encouraged her to talk to the counselor but usually end up bringing her home. She is in therapy weekly but not on any medication, she doesn't want to be a ""zombie"". She was on the swim team and swimming 6 days a week but all the exercise didn't seem to reduce her anger/anxiety.

I think this recent bought has to do with her ex boyfriend (who is still her ""best friend"") taking another girl to the recent dance. Almost all of her friends are boys and she is the only one from their group that didn't go to the dance. I have also firmly put my foot down that she may not get a license while having these thoughts.

I don't want to sound cold or uncaring because I care a lot as I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and self harm. I know bringing her home from school reinforces the anxiety that she is feeling. Not to mention how everything is effecting her grades. I worry that sending her to live with our parents full time, changing schools especially will set back all the progress she has made. But maybe I'm in over my head and she is playing me.

157,"Sorry for english,non-native speaker. 
So my mum had an accident in which she broke her wrist and damaged some other small bones in her hand. MRI confirmed it last friday. Since then she is having a bad time, because of her forced inactivity. No household-chores, no driving, not able to give her yoga-classes, no working-out. So basically nothing which includes turning or twisting her wrist. The doctor said she should not even attempt to do any kind of lifting or grabbing in the first couple of weeks to ensure a proper healing process. 
What she's doing the whole time is reading, doing crossword, watching tv or sleeping.
I am currently writing my thesis at home and will be doing that for another 6 weeks. So I will take over the chores etc. That's not a thing for me.
What bothers me is that she doesn't know what to do the whole day, because without going to work or her other activities which keep her very busy during the week, she feels irrelevant and is totally bored. 
How can I give her something to do on her own, because I still have a lot of work to do for my thesis?",20Feb2017,1
159,"I'm living in a college dorm with a depressed roommate. He was suicidal in December but has gotten counseling and is doing a bit better now. He has so many issues and he dumps them on me, and out of respect for his privacy, I'm unable to speak to friends on our floor and gain their emotional support.

Back in high school, he had only a few friends, but he mucked up those friendships and those people refuse to talk to him now (in his defense, a couple of these people were real jerks). As a result of this he's very clingy. He revolves his schedule around spending time with me, whether it be taking a shower next me in our dorm's communal bathroom, following me to breakfast, or even sitting in silence next to me on the couch while I'm reading.

Weird stuff has happened. There have been times when he's gotten mad at me because I refuse to change clothes in front of him, because apparently I'm not ""comfortable enough"" around him. He's forced me through many long conversations about why nudity is such an important thing to him, guilt-tripping me for wanting my personal space. He's also left me creepy notes - for example, listing traits things he likes and dislikes around me (including things like my physique and my eyes), or jokingly offering to give me a blowjob if I find his phone which he's lost for the hundredth time. This makes me feel so unsafe and uncomfortable in my own room.

I don't know how I can manage another year with this guy, but he's desperate to room with me. Whenever I mention maybe not rooming together next year, he cries and begs me not to leave him. He's told me dozens of times that he's ""willing to do whatever it takes to make me happy."" He has made many positive changes, but now I feel entitled to stay with him even though it's chipping away at my mental health. I want him to make these changes, but I want him to do it for himself and not for me. This all seems like it would be a little fruitless on his end too. Since coming to college, he's made a fair amount of friends, several of which would be much better roommates for him.

I finally caved and said I'd room with him for one more year. I regret it so much, but I don't think I could live with myself if I abandoned the guy like his old ""friends"" did. He doesn't understand that we make terrible roommates, and that we'd actually have a shot at a decent friendship if we roomed with different people. At the end of the day he does genuinely care about me as a friend, and I him. I feel like I can have important conversations with him about life and our struggles. But I don't know how to deal with his issues, and more and more resentment is building up in me. I'm afraid that someday, I won't be able to take it anymore and I'm going to say or do something that hurts him really really badly. I keep dropping major hints in hopes that he comes around and realizes that we'd be better friends if we didn't room next fall. Because if we don't room together, I'd hope it to be a mutual decision and not me kicking him to the curb. Honestly though, I feel like living with this guy's depressive spirit is making me depressed myself.

Additional reasons why we make poor roommates: He's ridiculously messy. It's ludicrous how often he loses things. He has poor hygiene. He always wants to spend one-on-one time with me and it drains me. He sleeps naked and always rolls in his sleep so his rear is the first thing I see every morning. He spends hours sprawled on the couch in his boxers eating our food, and dropping half of it under the cushions. He's an introvert, always wanting the door closed and locked, while I wish that friends could come and go as they please.

What on earth should I do, especially in regards to our living arrangement next year?",20Feb2017,4

163,"Hey all,
I currently live in NJ at my dad's place and was given an opportunity to receive a conditional raise to move to Manhattan (where I work).

Since I don't mind sharing numbers, it would be an additional $7000 to the salary.

While it wouldn't cover the whole rent and living costs, it is something nice and I always wanted to live in the city. I would also opt to search for a place with my GF. The issue is my personal savings isn't extremely high.

I also have to be in NJ at least twice a week to take care of my fish (which I can bring), and captain a tennis team I'm in. (Monday evenings)

I also like to play golf/tennis during my free time, which would be done on the weekends (or weeknight evenings for tennis)...

So...OP is ""in the closet"" gay and found a guy through this app. Long story short we started dating, movies, netflix and chill, sex ;) this goes on for two months. It was great. One day i asked if he wanted to watch A Dog's Purpose and he said lets shoot for Thursday. That comes by and stayed late for work and tried to shoot for Friday instead. Work got to him again, and he apologized and said ""I'm sorry"" I told him it was fine. Next Saturday it was raining (life is foreshadowing my sadness) My dorky self asked for a RAINcheck and got no answer. 
This day was also my friend's 21st surprise birthday and so it was rough trying to not get too drunk so I don't drunkenly call/text him unnecessary things while watching over your friends party hard(drunk texted my manager once). Got a lot of questions of people if I was okay by people at the party. I said I was but I honestly was not it was bothering me, I did not want to be the center of a attention at a friends birthday party(looks at birthday boy sitting on the floor whipping and singing karaoke twinkle twinkle little star with a shot glass on his other hand). This day was fun seeing my closest friends drunk af, but i was sober (drank a bit) but he was still in the back my mind. I was quiet and reserved that night. 

Next Day i finally called him to see if he's alright or if he has blocked me. The phone rings normally all the way thru and goes to voicemail, didn't leave a message and hung up. Texted him if he's alright...no answer. Later that day i messaged him on Facebook cause i saw he was Active on it and sent him a few things if he's alright. I asked if he's ignoring me and ask why...no response. A few hours past by he still active, no time stamp he saw it but he got it for sure. Im a optimistic person so sent him that they were good times and nice meeting him cause I knew that was it. 

So this was my first time in a relationship with a guy so it was very nice being able to be myself. But WOW does being ignored leave you feel shitty, cause you start to wonder what you did wrong or if something happened to them. It was a fun ride and will cherish them as memories this was Sunday, wanted to get some closure, dont seem like I will get it. On the bright side Sunday night, i coincidently think i met a new guy thats seems wonderful. Happy ending maybe??? 

Now brings us out today 5am typing this post and awake for my 21st birthday (yes i was drinking underage). Yep...this all happened on the final days of my birthday. Still feel shitty and never knew how much you heart can hurt. 
Man...life has sick way of making memories, good and bad.
I was going to come out to my closest friends this morning, but I needed my family too with me (who I cant come out cause that is a different story) I guess I'll just make the most of my birthday and try to get over it but im struggling here. Any advice to get over a person?

170,"My girlfriend wants to get a PhD in clinical psych. She has a 3.9 GPA from undergrad, is published, and has great work experience. However, given the extremely low acceptance rates, she's having trouble getting into a program. So far this round she applied to 15 schools and has gotten one interview so far from Nova Southeastern University in Florida. 

The biggest problem with this school is the program is not funded, so by the end of it she'd be out 122k in tuition fees. This school is also poorly ranked, not even in the top 100. Overall it comes off as pretty fishy to me. 

She's concerned that if this is the only school that accepts her, then she has to go. I disagree and think it absolutely is not worth the financial investment. But I don't know many good alternatives for her beyond 'apply again', go to a Masters program first (which has obvious drawbacks), or switch career paths.

176,"I'm struggling to decide on what to do with my life. I feel like I'm in a bit of a shitstream, not knowing where I'm going to be and what I'm going to be doing in the future. I'm 21 years old.

I have no relatives to live with, no money or savings or financial support from anyone, no job and I just share a house with two other students. I'm in my overdraft just about scraping by with rent and living costs etc. 

I'm worried that very shortly I won't be able to afford rent, and I'll hence be evicted, and made homeless.

What would be the first thing you would do? I have an unconditional offer from the university I graduated with, to study an MSc for a year, and with a student loan, that should keep me surviving for another year I guess, but I just can't seem to get a full time job at the minute, I get really inconsistent, infrequent hours at this retail place, and tutoring just about keeps me afloat, but come June when exams are finished, no one will need tuition so I'll be shafted.

I feel like I have the potential to make something good of myself, but with no platform (e.g. a some capital, a family home, or indeed, a family), I feel I am truly fucked. I'm feeling really down, but better since last year (I tried to commit suicide a week before Christmas)... I just feel like I need a little support, however that manifests itself. I guess in an idealistic world, someone would come up to me and say ""Hey, you're clearly a bright young man, friendly and hard-working. I'll invest £10,000 in you!"" and I would reply ""Thank you, you life-saver. This will be a worthwhile investment; I will repay you gratefully (and then some) in 5-10 years when I have a good job, a happy life and a good salary.

I get very jealous of others who lead different lifestyles. E.g. my flatmate who gets the rent/bills for free (her Mum is the landlady), her Dad gives her a monthly allowance for living costs,  and she just saves her student loan (she basically doesn't need the loan). Oh and her Dad has £20,000 saved for her, for when she wants to buy a house. This isn't uncommon, but it just makes me sad - kind of like ""what have I done to not deserve that?"". I always try and seem happy because there are others that have it worse. But then again, saying you can't be sad because others have it worse is like saying you can't be happy because other's have it better - it's just not true.

I hope I haven't sounded miserable, or too jealous, or a dick, I just want some help here. I made a Reddit account purely to ask this question so sorry if it's against the rules or inappropriate. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you &lt;3",20Feb2017,1

I am 19, life seemed perfect last summer, everything was going great, when slowly symptoms started to occur, burning mouth, burning when urinating, blurry vision, numb/tingling arms, headaches, weight loss and slow healing wounds... I didn't bother at first, but they got worse and worse until my stomach also started to feel horrible when I ate, I got a heavy gastritis since then, serveral medications couldn't help so far..

My body started to hurt, I was weak and felt my pulse in my whole body at that point, I couldnt leave my bed anymore at that point.

Out of desperation I began taking vitamin-b pills which included all B vitamins, after a few days I could eat better and walk around again.

But the symptoms are still there, just not as horrible anymore, when one symptom worsens, all the other worsen aswell, when I stop taking the pills, in the matter of a few days they worsen radically.

I have seen 2 docs now... and did serveral blood tests and all that... nothing.... I am ""healthy""

The only thing they always say is that I have to eat more and normal again.

But that is problem, everything I eat makes my stomach feel as if it would explode or even hurt bevause of the gastritis, sometimes making me nauseous.

My parents want to send me into a mental hospital now, but I feel mentally completely well, aside from the thing with my health at the moment! I try to tell them that I am not mentally ill, but tzey don't believe me.

This is my first time posting on this sub, so please ignore any spelling mistakes. 
I'm currently 16 years old in the UK. I have finished high school with good grades that have opened doors for a lot of careers. I have decided to go for an apprenticeship in engineering. I have applied for big name companies and got accepted on my second choice. But they had the offer for both a maintenance engineer and a manufacturer (skilled machine operator). 

Since the both bosses was present they had to pick who they wanted till have in that position. I was offered a role as a manufacturer, which isn't what I want to do. I've been in college for the past 7 mounts now (part of the apprenticeship is being in college full time (paid) on an engineering course).

So I've took it upon my self to look at other opportunities. So I can get the full amount of qualifications, rather than not getting them all as a manufacturer. 

Even though I want to me an engineer, I'm not sure if I'm capable of it. I know I'm being trained and it's still early days but it's really hard work. So I'm considering if I should stay as a manufacturer. My mentor at college said I need to have a deduction made soon because when I turn 19 it's a sort of a point of no return. As I'd have to fund it my self to be re trained.

195,"This is a problem that everyone has encountered or will encounter, it's mostly prevalent on the internet and among less educated people who dont really know how to debate. This problem, if left unchecked can have serious consequences and change the entire course of the debate.

It seems like almost every time I make a statement, someone else in an attempt to ""one up"" me and just straight up lies and misrepresents my views, this is a dishonorable and disingenuous fallacy called a ""strawman"" where your opponent fabricates your position to make it easier for them to attack. 

A real life example of this fallacy is if one person says that Public schools should not force children to pray, and then their opponent will accuse the other person of trying to spread Atheism. If I get aggressive and call out his lies and fallacies he will send me some religious verse that tells me not to get angry and tells me to ""calm down"" and ""let your guard down"" to appear as a higher moral authority to others and then completely ignores the fact that he lied about my views in the first place. What ends up happening is that I look like I am angry and my opponent looks calm and cool even tho he lied to get where he was.

The worst part is that that my community is filled with a bunch of retards who are too stupid to realize what going on and just go along with it. By the time I ""pin down"" my opponent for lying and misrepresenting my views, he moves on to another subject and does it all again. This process is very time consuming, and inefficient becuase my opponent continuously does the same thing over and over. The worst part is that my community can't tell the differance. It seems that if I ignore my opponent he will continue to misrepresent my views, this will result in negative publicity for me and more upvotes for him because by ignoring him i leave his argument uncontested. If I respond to him, it will just be a waste of his time becuase he won't admit his mistake or change his position and will continue to use the same slimy tactics over and over again.

My question is how do we deal with assholes who constantly lie and misrepresent my views? Do I just block or stop responding to them and hope they just get board and leave? Do I make an ""Exposed"" post on them? or I continue to waste my time constantly correcting them?

But today I just popped my head out into the backyard and saw more fresh orange peels around her window, and now having taken a good look at the area and how the trees in our backyard are arranged, it would take a bit of effort to get them to the places they're sitting on the ground. It wouldn't be a casual toss over the fence, it would be a deliberate throw. Although the weather has been really crazy with wind and rain so I suppose its possible they were pushed around by the wind. Another thing I noticed is that there's an orange tree in the backyard of the house behind ours. However, it's separated from our backyard by an alleyway that can't be accessed except by climbing our fences, so someone would have to take an orange from there and eat it in or near our yard for those peels to make it all the way over here, furthering the theory that someone is in our yard.

Now, to be honest I'm a little extra paranoid because I've been watching creepy YouTube videos. I know, I know, but I'm sick and bored, give me a break.

205,"My mom is white and my dad was a native pinoy, and i hardly ever saw my white family growing up. Instead all of my fond memories are of my filipino family in america and of my lola when she could afford to visit. I never had any questions about my cultural herritage until my dad killed himself 2 years ago. I moved with my mom since at the time i hadnt turned 18 yet and she moved to be closer to her family in an area of almost entirely white people. I havent seen any of my family since my dads funeral and i dont really care about seeing my moms family since i hardly know them.
Ive never been to the Philippines, we were going to go before my dad died though. Im technically still roman catholic (although i never really attended mass and im now an atheist since age 10 or so). I speak a small amount of tagalog that i learned as a small child (but still more than some of my full cousins). Ive never met or spoken to my lolo who is still alive and have met 4 of my 5 uncles and never met my aunt. I can cook adobo, lugaw, nilaga, etc from memory since i grew up eating it.
My moms boyfriend is also as white as they come and knows nothing about pinoy culture so he'll often make food after ive already made food because he wants to eat food thats familiar to him.
Its been years since ive had dinuguan because nobody here will sell fresh pork blood.

My question is essentially do i have the right to be a proud filipino if im not a full filipino. Ive grown up my entire life believing i am filipino and only until recently have i had people tell me otherwise. Most filipino people ive met will instantly know and treat me as if i am filipino but everyone else will tell me that i am not filipino or white. How much blood do i have to have? I grew up in a very filipino household, no shoes, one big meal on sunday that lasts all week, etc and hearing the adarna bird and about the wakwak, mananangal etc

Multiple times I've told him to stop or I try to laugh it off so it doesn't look like i'm making a big deal.

He also keeps making fun of me because im a virgin. I'm nearly 17 and don't see the rush. But he says that I need to leave college, lose it and come back when I'm ""a real women"".

222,"I have recently come in to contact with an old friend of mine.  We lost contact due to someone they were dating, it turned sour and we just stopped talking. 


When we first started talking again, they were very interested in the conversation and it was extremely nostalgic and really, we hadn't changed that much.  (We last spoke over 5 years ago).  We still got on really well. 


My issue is that they are so hot and cold.  One minute, I can't get rid of them, they want to speak to me all the time and then the next minute, I won't hear from them in weeks despite trying to start up conversation. 


I appreciate we're a lot older now and have other commitments, there is also a timezone difference but, they literally don't speak to me for weeks, even if they read my messages, open my snapchats etc, I get nothing in response.  I am also not trying to talk to them every day, I might once or twice a week send a message.  I'm not wanting to talk to them 24/7, I don't have time or the energy to be constantly talking to someone, I just want a regular relationship with them.  


I'm just getting a bit upset and angry that the conversation always seems to be on their terms and depends on whether they can be bothered for a conversation.  I'm tempted to explain to them that I'm starting to get pissed off that we can only converse and play video games when it suites them and the lack of effort they put in to the friendship is really dragging me down sometimes as I feel I am the only person willing to make the effort but, I don't want to risk losing our friendship even if it involves every so often talking, I'm not really willing to lose our friendship a second time as it really destroyed me last time.  


I'm just extremely confused because when we talk we get on extremely well and I can just tell that they genuinely enjoy my company, when we do speak or play video games, we can be playing for hours.  They also suggested that we meet, they offered for me to stay with them for a week or so and they were extremely enthusiastic about finally meeting me in person etc but I'm just not sure anymore, I don't want to spend the time, effort and money meeting someone when they can't be bothered with me more than half the time. 



TLDR; Friend is hot and cold with talking to me, doesn't make much effort, starting to get a bit upset with lack of responses all the time and only talking to me on their terms.

228,"So I've been at my job for almost a year. It's great and I'm so lucky to have landed with a great company. There's 3 of us in my team, and one is like a sister to me, and the other is a testing kind of person. She started working there just over 3 months ago, and within the first week, I knew something was a bit off. She is a pathological liar which is obviously a problem in the workplace, especially for me when she's in my team. (Went for a team lunch just after Christmas, she spent most of the time talking about all the things that have gone wrong in her life)
So within the week of having just started, this girl has told me her pretty much life story, along with everything about her fiance and daughter. After about 4 days she tells me I simply must go to her wedding, and my colleague and I sense something's a bit funky bout this gals social boundaries. She has a really intense scalp problem and she is constantly digging her big nails into her head to scratch, and leaving big flakes all over her work area. She keeps saying she's no longer smoking, while smells like ashtray. Plus she says she has diabetes, by the way she eats, I find this really hard to believe. 
My biggest issue with her is that she just won't take initiative and do things for herself at work. She asks me very mundane and silly questions about decision making, so much so I'm just now asking ""what do you think you should do?"" I get about 6 calls per day to my desk phone from her, anytime I email or message her with a question. She is struggling to juggle simple tasks, such as organizing someone to come in and empty sanitary bins, and ordering catering. But she won't speak up when she doesn't understand how to do something. Plus it reflects badly on the whole team. 
Big important part of this is that this girl is 8 years older than me, and socially we have pretty much nothing in common. I'm really trying to be nice.

I'm a pretty patient person, but I'm really coming to the end of my tether.

I've passed on to my boss that she should be more pro active, and I know the reason she's not is because she doesn't have that confidence, but I can't keep holding her hand..

232,"Hello Reddit,

I've come to you, because I feel like I can't keep up anymore.

Here's the story : I was a procastinator in highschool, I took a gap year to do nothing but procastinate. I enrolled in the equivalent of community college and procastinated for a semester ( but still managed to get top of the class, because I didn't procastinate during exams weeks )

A teacher told me that I belong somewhere way more prestigious, so I took his advice and signed up for being a candidate of one of the biggest, if not the biggest, undergrad program of my favorite field of study in my country.

However, even if my teacher told me I could do it, I was certain that with my current set of skills I wouldn't be able to make it, so I decided to stop being a lazy fuck, and I did. Since January, I have been working on skills that were related to the undergrad program: Piano performance, Music Composition, Ear Training, Music Theory, Math, Programming, German ( I wish to study computer music )

And this is where I need you guys, I'm losing patience, I can't keep up. I know I'm making progress, but it feels painfully slow, even if I set multiple milestone before achieving proficiency. At first there was this romantic feeling about working hard in a dark room with a weak lamp, but now it has come to the extent where it feels painful in my mind. The thing is I know that people have been here, and they succeeded. How did they manage to keep their motivation? 

Overall I just feel like I can't keep up, I get tired in the middle of the day and early at night. I live very far from my parents, sometimes all I need is the pat on the back. There's also this issue with video games, before I felt guilt, now it feels like a need. A need to break from the constant stress and hardwork. I wish of a day where I can play videogames, or just relax, without worrying about what comes next.

What should I do reddit? Help me please

234,"I found out yesterday.

I'm 22 years old and I struggle with depression. After I graduated high school at 18, I did next to nothing with my life for 3 1/2 years, I got a late start in life because of depression and feeling unsure of myself. I am now a freshman in college and I'm finally starting to invest in myself, believe in myself, and push myself out of my comfort zone. I'm even talking to a girl, who we will call Rachel. She's wonderful and makes me smile so much.

But then yesterday afternoon I got a phone call. It was from a girl I was sleeping with until a few months ago, we will call her Lucy. She told me she was pregnant even though she was on three forms of birth control (IUD, injections, and morning after pills). Now for me, this was my biggest fear. I can't be a dad, that's just not an option for me. I have no money, poor mental health, I live with my parents, I don't have a car, I don't have a job, and I just started school. 

Lucy understood this, she knows me very well and knew I would panic. She told me she even considered not telling me at all and just cutting ties with me, but she wouldn't have felt right about that. Lucy is a lot older than me, she's 28. She has 2 kids already, she lives with those kids' father (they are separated and he knew Lucy and I were sleeping together), she has money, and she's emotionally capable of raising another kid. So she took more responsibility than I did at first; especially since she was the one who convinced me not to use condoms after I asked about ten times if she was sure. She seemed so sure . . .

My first response was to try to convince her that an abortion was the best bet. My reasons for this were, in my mind, beyond just the fear I had about the situation. She is high-risk and had a lot of issues with her first two pregnancies, and I thought she should do what's safest for her. I was also worried about my own mental health. Because I have had suicidal thoughts over much smaller things in the past, but that was the least of my worries if I'm being honest. I was more afraid of being the guy who abandons his child and its mother than I was of not physically surviving. I was also worried about a child growing up without a dad, there's enough of those in the world and the guilt would be overwhelming. She was against the idea at first, but eventually said that she would talk to her doctor as soon as she can get an appointment and ask him if abortion would be the safest choice.

She then gave me the option to just ""disappear"" right now. I would never know whether she had the abortion or not, and we would just part ways and leave it at that. As an opportunist, I decided I should take advantage of the altruistic offer she was giving me. It wasn't an easy decision by any means, but to me it was the only thing I could live with. Because if I found out she was keeping the kid I would be devastated. So I told her that's what I needed to do and she agreed.

But then a few hours later I got a text from her saying that she changed her mind. She was saying that she was being too passive and we were making this whole thing about me. Yes, both of those were true. She said she didn't want the abortion, she was going to keep the child regardless of what I thought. It is her body, and that is her choice, so I told her I respect her decision. She did mention that the father of her other two children would step in and help out, which made me feel better about the child's well being.

I told her I was sorry multiple times, but that I just couldn't be there for a kid that I don't want. She said if I was choosing to disappear, that I would have to stay disappeared. Her family wasn't happy about what I chose, and she said I should stay away from them forever.

So that's where I am right now. I guess what I've chosen is set in stone now and there's no turning back. But this is where I need advice from you guys. I'm talking to this girl Rachel. We're not ""official"" yet or anything, we are also long distance as we met online, and we haven't known each other very long, but we've hit it off really well so far. I don't know how, or if, I should tell her about this. I don't want her to think differently of me, but I also don't want to keep something like this from her if we end up dating; I'm torn. Do I tell her? If so, when do I tell her?

The second thing I'm asking is I guess confirmation (or not) that I'm not a terrible person for what I chose. It didn't feel like I had an option because I don't want the kid and I can't be a dad. I should have been more careful, but we definitely weren't careless either. This wasn't supposed to be possible, but I guess that was naive of me to believe.

tl;dr - I'm not fit to be a dad so I left the girl that I got pregnant; how do I tell the girl I'm talking to now? Am I a bad person?",20Feb2017,0

I always go out of my way to meet new women and try to have positive experiences with them. I try to do everything right according to the unwritten dating laws of the universe. I dont come on too strong and I try to seal the number deal early.
Problem is, while the girls will respond postively and ultimately give me their number, that's usually where it dies. I try not to be boring in my texts and to kinda catch their eye, but to no avail sooner or later the results remain the same.
I can kind of pinpoint the problem boiling down to my looks. I'm not fat but not skinny or jacked either. My hair is thinning out (I tried to shave it, it looked ridiculous) and my face is oddly shaped. I know this means I'm immediately weeded out from potential mates due to lack of physical attraction.
So what's a fellow to do? I figured its time to begin to give up on ever finding anyone as I'm likely not cut out for it. Should I buy hairplugs? Accumulate large sums of money and attract them that way?",20Feb2017,1
248,"I have a friend from a few years back. We used to be pretty close, and still kept in touch pretty well until a few months ago. She just dropped off the grid there. Her facebook was deleted and she must have changed phone numbers too. Talked to a few of our friends we have in common, and it was the same with them. Then suddenly, I found her new facebook profile. She had none of our friends in common (used to have like 40 on facebook), was in a relationship with someone 15 years older and she was posting these weird tarot cards with some strange text every time. Tried friending her but she must have declined. I looked through her friends on her new account, and all of them go to this religious center not far from where we both live. And several of the girls have ""in a relationship"" with the same guy as her. It says it's a free Yoga class, but it seems super sketchy to be honest. Not sure what's happening to her or if she's okay, but I'm thinking I should go to that religous center and check it out for myself. Maybe I'll run into her and I can talk to her? Am I making to much of this?",20Feb2017,70
249,"Hi guys. I'm new here, so I'm sorry if I do this wrong.

Recently, my boyfriend was offered a really good position at another company. When he put in his two weeks at his current job, they countered with a similar position for about 3.5k more. 

We're not really sure what to do here. The other company is located in a cheaper area, so the salary would end up being pretty much the same, and the earning potential might be better at the other company.

But his current company pulled a lot of strings to offer him this new job.

They're both great positions that would be great for his long term career and we're not sure what we should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

251,"I think I know what the answer to this will be and I'm mostly just venting. Please go easy on me here - I'm still trying to figure out how to manage the casual dating scene.

Two months ago I got out of a long-term relationship with this guy who was my first love. After our breakup I decided that I would start to see other people without the intention of getting serious with anybody - just to see what was out there and encourage myself that there were other decent men in this world. After going on a few dates with various people I decided I'd let things progress a bit more, but not to a serious stage. I decided I'd look for men who I enjoyed spending time with, and perhaps engage in a casual, FWB type situation.

Here's the thing: I lost my virginity to my ex after we were already in love. I have never had a casual sexual relationship before, and I wasn't really sure how to go about it. I didn't want to catch serious feelings for anyone, but I also didn't think I could have sex with someone who had an abhorrent personality, even if they were hot. So I attempted to opt for a middle ground by finding a guy who I liked spending time with outside the sheets and in them, hopefully creating just enough intimacy for me to be happy but not enough for me to be too vulnerable. 

Cue your eye roll and deep, knowing sigh about how this will turn out.

Then I met Jake [24M] on a dating app. We texted a ton and then  met up for drinks, and it was an instant connection. We talked for three hours until I had to go, and I could tell we were two people on the same wavelength. He was very open and shared a lot of personal information, including that he lives with bipolar disorder, and I was a bit more reserved, but still shared more than I do on typical first dates. I could also tell he was nervous and enjoyed spending time with me too. 

We texted a lot over the next week and met up again on the weekend, since I'd been really busy and hadn't been able to see him on weekdays. He invited me to come to a paint-your-own pottery outing with his roommates, which I thought was interesting - we all got along really well. I followed them home and we talked for a long time in his room about deep, personal things. I was touched he shared so much with me. Of course, we ended up making out for quite a while, but I stopped him there, and he respected that. I went home. He texted me immediately to say he'd had fun, his roommates liked me, and he was glad I'd come over.

Over the next week we continued to text sporadically during the day. Then I initiated hanging out one night to go to a bookstore we both liked. We had a short perusal through the bookstore before it closed and then walked along the street talking for a bit - he put his arms around me to keep me from shivering because it was so cold, which I found to be a bit more relationship-y than hookup-y. After a while he invited me back to his place to ""watch a movie."" We put something on, but obviously it didn't last long, and we hooked up. He was very sweet - we cuddled afterwards. Before we had sex, he invited me to spend the night, so I did. The next morning he wasn't rushing me out - we cuddled for a bit, then had sex again, then went out together to buy materials to make breakfast, made it, and then when his roommates woke up we hung out with them briefly. (I had asked him if he'd like me not to hang out in his living room - I wasn't sure if he wanted them to see me or if he'd prefer I stayed low. He laughed and teased me for even asking. I've never done this before lol.) I cleaned up breakfast and was going back to my place, so he took the train into the city with me, as he would be going in the same direction a little later anyway. All morning he was touchy and kind, and we kissed goodbye.

I had told him earlier that week that I'd be gone for the weekend, and he texted me later in the day after I left his place to ask where I'd be going. I texted him back a few hours later but he didn't respond. The next morning he texted me again, and we texted very sporadically through the day. Then on the third day post-coitus, he texted me in the morning to respond to something I'd said the previous night, and I didn't respond for over 6 hours, as I was busy and thought he knew this. 

It's been almost 24 hours and he still hasn't responded.

And I'm losing it.

I know I'm being crazy. I know he probably isn't into me and saw this as a hookup thing. I know I probably read his cuddliness and openness about his personal life as signs of interest when really he probably was just looking for sex, and now that he's gotten it he's probably done.

But part of me also thinks that maybe leaving 6 hours between a reply to his text (the longest we've left between texts) made him think I wasn't interested in him, so he's pulling away.

But maybe that's me justifying disinterest.

Reddit, help me here. Put my head on straight. I know I'm losing it over something trivial. I know I've caught feelings for this guy when I intended not to. But it's already happened. 

What do you think he's thinking? How should I proceed? I'd ask him what he's looking for, but I don't want to get that heavy about it too soon.

**TLDR: I thought this guy was into me and now it seems that he only thought of me as a hookup after nearly 24 hours without a text. How should I interpret his actions? What should I do now?**

**EDIT: I just saw that he posted on Instagram earlier today, so it's not that he hasn't looked at his phone or he's too busy...**",20Feb2017,1
252,"Hear me out:  my stepson is eight years old and we have a great relationship.  He knows I like him, I know he likes me.  That being said, for the past couple of months he's started doing this routine that just drives me up the wall.  It's too much for me.

It's a very noticeable pattern: he starts a conversation with an adult (sometimes in the middle of a different one) with ""do you know what would be hilarious?""  Then he just ad-libs for awhile: ""What if Deadpool had a bazooka, and he was wearing high heels, and somebody saw him and was like 'OH MY GOD'...""  (That's how he began the most recent one.)  He keeps going until he gets a courtesy laugh.  It seems like it's good for him.  He's learning, I get it.

The problem is that, *to me*, a lot of what he's doing just isn't funny.  He's funny every once in awhile, but overall it's just WAY too much for me.  I don't know how to say it, but I feel like he's burned through all my courtesy laughs and I'm just exhausted from convincing him that stuff is funny when I don't actually think it's funny.

I'm worried that if I keep it up, I'm setting a dishonest precedent.  I don't want to teach my kid that getting laughs is as easy as asking for them, because that cheapens the whole thing.  I don't want him to think that humor is as easy as saying whatever you want after the question ""know what would be hilarious?""

But if I don't give him a courtesy laugh, what's the alternative?  Silence?  I tried that earlier and it felt horrible for both of us.  I don't think it was the right approach, which is why I'm here.  Help me out, please...

253,"Some quick background information about me is that I'm currently in my third year at a state school in Ohio, but technically graduate after the upcoming fall with a Finance degree after meetings credit hour requirments. My resume currently lists out my education(Finance 3.03 GPA), previous employers(Kroger clerk, Lowes clerk, McDonalds clerk), and activities(only being in a fraternity). I have zero student loans/debt, and adding more time in school wouldnt add debt. 

I've been struggling these past semesters to find a co-op/internship position before I graduate, and desperatly want to build a stronger resume before I step foot into the real world after college. I'm hoping some of my online applications placed right now lead to future interviews for co-ops/internships this summer or fall. 

My first idea to build my resume that I've been comtemplating is to become a double major in Finance/Accounting. Accounting opens a lot of oppruntunity and correlates well with a Finance degree. Another less-demanding idea is take some business online courses I've looked into that offer a ""Continuing Professional Development"" certificate after completion. I could put these certificates under a ""Business and Technical Skills"" segment in my resume. Other examples could be getting certified through Microsoft's Excel And Word courses on their website and adding that under the same segment.

What is your guys opinions on these ideas? Is a double major worth the time commitment? It definently would add another semester of classes or perhaps even more. Also would the online courses build my resume, or only seem as crap-filler to my resume.

254,"Hi Reddit, I'm hoping you can provide some counsel - my boss is harassing me (and other women) at work. In staff meetings, he said Hillary Clinton's vagina is a garbage disposal, and told a female coworker to wear a tight dress to a meeting so we'd get better funding. He's mostly left me alone up till today. Today, however, when I walked in the door, he said (quoting verbatim, it's seared into my brain) ""Your hair looks great today. I bet somebody would love to see it spread across their pillow."" I was so shocked I blanked and just kept walking. I don't want him to think that's ok, so I want to do something, but I'm not sure how to handle it. 
For some context, he's in his 70's (I'm 28) and is the CEO - we are a small enough company to not have an HR department. He also has a temper and has zero problems shouting at people. I'd love any personal/legal/common sense advice on how to handle this. Also, I live in a state that permits one-party consent to recorded conversations.

255,"Hi Reddit. So here's some background. In 2015 I had some extremely poor health problems (anxiety, depression, huge ovarian cysts that required emergency care, so on) that affected my school performance. I didn't anticipate how bad it would get and was put on probation and then ended up failing out. In 2016 I got my shit together, got mostly A's and a couple B's in concurrent enrollment to the university I was kicked out of and took summer classes. I re-enrolled and got in. Everything's great! Except one thing.

My school requires a transcript from an online class I was taking. I enrolled Oct. 31st (school starts around August 25th or so), so would finish at least two months after a normal semester. In any case, my school wants the transcript for that class NOW but I just don't have it. The actual enrollment end date is April 29th and earliest the transcript could be received two weeks before that (online exams have to be mailed, forwarded and processed, it takes a while). For some reason I thought the end date would have been March 6th and I told the school that but it's not and they're expecting a transcript no later than March 17th. If they don't receive it, they're going to cancel my registration for this semester. This might seem so trivial but I honestly can't fathom what I could do in the future if I don't get into college. I've tried and worked my ass for to get re-enrolled. If I get cancelled I've got suicide notes + will + suicide plan at the ready. Should I forward an e-mail to school that states the course end date and try and get an extension? I don't know what seems like a good plan and while suicide sounds like a nice option, I prefer getting my bachelor's degree. Thank you for reading guys, this means a lot to me.",20Feb2017,1

257,"First of all, we both live in a small village so it's unavoidable to see each other at some times.

So last year in Febraury, me and this girl got to know each other better and better and eventually I developed a big crush on her. At first she seemed to reciprocate it, but then she rejected me, when I wanted to kiss her. Her reasons were that she was not ready for another relationship yet (she broke up half a year ago) and that she was afraid of the rumors in our village (they spread very fast there) because she already had 3 boyfriends and didn't want to come across as a slut or something.

So obviously I thought that these reasons will fade soon, because she mentioned nothing about me as a person, so I still had hope and we remained friends, met sometimes and continued to write messages on a daily basis.

The better i got to know her, the more I liked and even loved her. Because it was pretty obvious from my side, she then told me in September again that we won't be a couple because she can't develop feelings for me. But she also said that she likes me very very much as a friend and if she could, she would say her heart to love me.
Now we were on a party this weekend and we spoke again about this topic. She said the same things but also added that I am pretty much the only person that she can tell everything. So basically the cliche ""gay best friend"".

That was basically what happened between us in this year. But this year was also the worst year of my life, i couldn't concentrate on the university, because I was constantly sad about her and had to think of her. According to that my grades are pretty bad, I just barely pass the exams.
Also my mood was constantly down.

Now everybody of you would say that I should cancel the contact to her and let time fix my problem....

BUT: She is the genuiest and nicest person i have ever met and I feel like nobody of her friends really appreciates that or show her that they appreciate it. 
Also she was pretty good friends with her last ex-boyfriend and lost him because of their failed relationship. At that time she also lost her best male friend she knew since kindergarden and now she and her female best friend are slowly losing contact, too.
So she is going through a really rough time and I fear that if I cancel the contact to her now, she will fall even deeper into the hole she is now in, because then she will loose the only person that she can tell everything and it would not even be her fault.
And as i mentioned above she is such an awesome person that I don't wanna do that to her.

So it is pretty complicated between us and my question is now: Should I stop writing and meeting with her, although I will see her still sometimes in our village or should i remain friends with her to support her, because she is such an awesome person, and hope that the time will still fix this problem?

259,"Hi all. First time poster here. Really needing some help. This post requires a little bit of a backstory. If you want the simple version scroll to the TL;DR. Otherwise, the story really helps to know.
I'm going to provide the names of everyone involved so I don't have to work with a Roommate #1, Roommate #2 confusing scenario. The names of all involved are: Troy, Keegan, and Ian.
Troy, Keegan, myself, and my girlfriend have lived in a home together for about a year or so. Troy and I have been in the house a little longer and thus we are the two listed on the lease. When Keegan moved in, we did not have him added to the lease because he moved in right after we had signed the lease for another year.

I have always handled paying the rent. We split the rent up and each person sends me the money (electronically or hands me cash).

In November, Keegan informed the rest of us that one of his buddies, Ian, had recently been screwed out of money and needed a couch to crash on. We were told it would only be a few weeks and that would be it.

Ian had a job at Starbucks. He's not jobless, just homeless.
His ""few weeks"" continued to grow longer and longer. Eventually, in mid December, Keegan decided to tell the rest of the house that he would be moving out immediately. He was going to move in with his parents and go back to school. Ian was quick to mention that he would take ownership over Keegan's part of the rent when it came to January 1st.

Keegan moves out and January 1st comes and goes without receiving the rent money from Ian. It was around the holidays so I hadn't seen him much and luckily I had enough in my account at the time to cover what he owed me for rent. Finally once I saw him again, he said he had been having a pay card issue with Starbucks and also bank issues with Wells Fargo.

I was very patient with him. I told him to get me the money as soon as he got it all worked out. But a few days later, all of his things were gone. He had moved in with his girlfriend and gotten an apartment with her.

After a few days, I contacted him on Facebook and gave him my number since he didn't have it before. He said he would text me on his next break from work. I received nothing. I messaged him again on Facebook and did not receive any reply.

Getting tired of the silence, I got Ian's phone number from Troy. I texted Ian. Nothing. At this point, I've sent him about 6 texts (and multiple Facebook messages) regarding the issue and have not received anything since that first facebook reply that said he would contact me on his next break.

I reached out to Keegan about this who informed me that he (Keegan) gave Ian his (Keegan's) half of the rent money back on December 27th (about $250 in cash.) At that point, Ian was still in the household and withholding that cash from me. He never mentioned it in all the talks we had while he was still at our home.

Keegan knows where Ian lives and knows where he now works but Ian is beginning to avoid Keegan as well. I've had Troy try reaching out as well. Ian will not speak to any of us about the money issue, but will respond to them when they send Ian memes or stupid stuff like that.

ALRIGHT STORY TIME OVER

Ian right now owes me $505. He took $250 from Keegan which means he really only should have had to fork up about the same of his own money. But I've seen nothing and I'm getting more and more wary that I'm never going to see/speak to this person again unless I take action. Furthermore, Ian still has a house key to our house which makes me feel EXTREMELY unsafe considering he's essentially stolen $500 from me at this point.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

260,"Here's the backstory. I'm 22, my girlfriend 20. We both haven't had full time jobs since we graduated high school at 18. We come from small mining towns 1 hour away from the cities &amp; don't have alot of money. 

We are planning on moving to England to acquire jobs we have already been offered jobs there we are just waiting for our government to give us our passports. That was our plan until my girlfriend acquired a sales job selling beauty product's via telemarketing. This is a really great thing to have happened for her and us but she's struggling because of the distance. Every morning she must travel to the big cities which is far and yesterday which was her first day she was 2 hours late because of traffic and flooding due to rain. She was driving for 4 &amp; a half hours when her journey should only take an hour. She's enjoying the work but the driving is causing her a lot of stress. 

Also I think the fact that it's far away from me is making it difficult. I feel very bad for her and try my best to coach her through things, her mom doesn't help so I gotta be there for her even more which I don't mind it just seems to never be enough. We are quite close emotionally but still have our independent lives. We do our own thing in the week and spend all our weekends together. So yeah basically I have a few questions. 

1. What can I do to help her in this difficult transition in her life daily? 

2. Anyone care to share their first working experiences? Bad days perhaps? 

I just want to have someone tell me it's okay you're heading in the right direction I often am left in charge of getting our lives together she relies on me emotionally I just wanna hear someone else tell me you're on track... 

Before I get judged. 
I know people have it worse and it doesn't seem that bad, I'm extremely grateful for her job and so is she I'm just struggling emotionally to help her I want her to be happy and not struggle...
