1,"I need words of wisdom. I am currently deployed and something has happened with my wife and I. The biological father of my stepson messaged me through a fake account to tell me my wife was cheating on me through meetme. I know this is true because her and I made the account together and I am logged into it the same time she is. But he insists she's hooking up with guys and girls, to try and get under my skin. He then proceeds to say that my wife had sex with him before her and I got married and recently. I know my wife. She despises him more than I do and she is as loyal as they come. He then begins to try and convince me by describing her underwear and I recognize what he says. He then sends me naked pictures of her. I would believe him at this point but it's very convenient that he only described things that he had pictures of. Then I realise that he must have access to one of our accounts where he downloaded the picture. The messages were through Facebook and when he was finished taunting me, he said goodbye and the whole message thread deleted from MY account and I can no longer find his account. And it worries me because he has to have access to my Facebook account and a cloud account too because one of the pictures he sent was never exchanged through facebook.   

I know some of you may think me as a fool and that my wife sent them, but you cannot possibly understand the struggle he has put my family through. Year's of court, him never paying his dues, or taking his visitations seriously. He demands respect from my son, and my son doesn't see him as his real dad. And because of this, he is emotionally abusive towards him and my wife despises him for this. 

Another thing, he tells me that my biological son is not mine and it is his. This and everything else lead me off the edge. 

Since we are going to court again in the near future, my wife does not want to do anything about this yet. She believes she never will because she suffered from a abusive relationship from him for years and she still freezes at moments like this. She wants to ignore it.

I tried getting legal action, but the investigators said they cannot do anything yet because there is no proof that he hacked. He would of have to admit that he hacked to get them. 

Now here is my question/problem. I am filled with anger beyond belief. All I can picture is him laughing at us, jerking off to my wife's pictures, and thinking he can disrespect me and my family  and do as he pleases. My wife doesn't want to do anything about it. I feel helpless, angry, and threatend. I don't know how to feel or what to do at this point. ",18Jul2017,1
2,"So....I'm 25, female. Have been watching a show called Below Deck. I have become obsessed with wanting to work on a yacht.

6,"hey reddit, i have a question regarding heartworms.. my family and i recently adopted a 1yr old rescue dog from a local shelter. We've had her for about 8 weeks now and we love her so much and she's very happy with us, but there's just one problem- she has heartworms. We adopted her knowingly that it would be trouble but we had no idea how much trouble. Every vet we have contacted says either it will cost $1500 to treat her (we actually found one that will do it for $300 so we're considering that) or it's not worth it and to just euthanize her, but we can't bring ourselves to do that. Our only hesitation with going through with the treatment is that it is extremely painful and long (3 months). She wouldn't be allowed to play or do anything that would raise her heart rate for those 3 months. Also, a few people that my mom has asked that have gone through with the treatment for their dogs say that their dog isn't the same afterwards because it's such a damaging treatment. They related it to chemo therapy but for dogs :/ So basically my question is what would your advice be? We don't want to return her to the shelter because she is already domesticated and we feel she will be very unhappy there, since she has lived her entire life locked up in a cage before we came along. She is the sweetest pup ever and we just want what would be best for her.. any suggestions?",18Jul2017,1

9,"I'm a rising Senior in high school so there's not a lot of things I can do at this point to affect my chances at colleges. That being said, there is no way I'm going to an Ivy, but my parents seem to think it's still be worth applying. But they are pretty specific with schools too, and I think it's all really so my mom can brag to her friends if I end up somewhere like an Ivy.

Whenever colleges my mom doesn't like are mentioned she rolls her eyes and shakes her head. I'm only going to college because it's a necessity for the fields I want to go into but it's obnoxious to patronize schools that many people attend all because she's heard bad things.

I also kind of just wanna go to Hollywood and become an actor or director or something lol, but I probably need a degree to fall back on.

10,"Ok, where to start? I'm currently married. I have been for 3 years. I've been dating  my wife since I was 18. We've lived together for 9 years. She was the second girl I slept with. The first being a virgin drunken one night stand. I've always been comfortable around her. It's why I've been with her for so long. 
The comfort got stale. I had an affair. I went out with a girl from work. She believed my wife was only my girlfriend. When she found out I was married, she was mad, of course. 
But she continued to be with me. We spent a lot of time together. We'd go out every week. We spent weekends together. The passion was incredible. I fell in love. 
I was always to chicken to tell my wife. To let us both try and find happiness. I left trails of infidelity. Hoping she'd see so I didn't have to tell her. I left texts open on my phone, hoping she'd see. She did. She confronted me. I was honest. I said I wanted to leave.
Now, the girl I fell in love with wants nothing to do with me. She's found someone else, saying we could never be together. Even though she told me she loved me, and would be there for me. I've been so angry I've destroyed anything I could have with her. To turn an affair into a relationship, can't happen anymore. I destroyed my life, and deserve this heartbreak.

20,"I'm sorry this is so long so I understand if no one wants to read it. 


So first off I'll start by saying my mom and my dad aren't together anymore and they haven't been for a long time. When I was in kindergarten I met a girl and will call her Jill. Jills Mom and my dad started dating and theyve been together ever since. Jen has two kids from previous relationship Jack and Jill. Growing up Jill was always the perfect child she never got in trouble, did  homework on time, graduated high school, never drank never did drugs she was the apple of my parents eye. I always felt they treated me unfairly, I was complete opposite from Jill in literally every way. When I was 18 I moved out and I started to build a relationship with my mom. My mom is an alcoholic and a drug addict and she's been in and out of jail but she's always honest with me and she treats me with respect, like I'm a human being. I found myself relating a lot to her, and found the things my dad told meabiut her growing up weren't true. My dad HATES my mom and had no problem letting people know. I get anxiety because I find myself to be like her, and I know my dad doesn't like her so does that mean he doesn't like me?

Yesterday was my sisters birthday dinner with my dad and my stepmoms side of the family. Before meeting them I hung out with my mom and we got to talking about how nobody ever tries to talk to me but they'll go out to lunch with Jill and they'll spend so much time with her. I know it's a 2 way street and I should also put in effort to talk to them but I feel like they don't want to hear from me. My stepmom said something that really left me confused and hurt because she said that she didn't call Jill on her birthday and Jill was mad and I said ""nobody calls me on my birthday"" and then she asked if I wanted people to call on my birthday I said ""obviously nobody calls me any other time of the year so once a year would be nice"". And so we got to the house for dinner and nobody asked me how I was doing, how my life was,  they just constantly talked about themselves. I've been trying to go vegetarian and vegan because of a documentary I saw it was really life-changing so I asked for a veggie burger and  I just got so much judgement, and eye rolling and snide comments yet Jills talking about how much drinking she did that day and I'm not saying anything because whatever it's your life you do what you want.I just find this constant negativity every time I'm around them and I don't like to be around them. 

Jens older son Jack hasn't been in contact with them for about four years because he thinks that his mom Jen is mentally and verbally abusive.I kind of disagree because I never really saw it but I'm starting to become more and more aware and I'm not sure if I want to be around them anymore. 

I feel stuck I know we can't pick our family but when I'm around them I feel so low and not good enough. My dad always makes plans with Jill, they've gone whale watching, kayaking, dog sledding and the I never hear from my dad. 

I get pretty depressed because no one puts in the effort to want to be around me, so I guess I'm battling myself because I don't know what I should do. Do I suck it up and just accept that this is my family or do I remove myself?

21,"Returned from work this afternoon (17th of July) around 3pm and let my cat in with me. About 20 minutes later he crapped on my floor and all down his legs (liquid, it was grim &amp; stunk beyond belief, not a normal toilet). I picked him up took him out the the garden so I could clean up my room then went to fetch him to clean him up in the bathroom (I live in a shared house, landlady has asked me to keep my cat in my room, don't leave him wondering around the house although I walk him through the house to allow him outside, which I am allowed) anyway.. I haven't seen him since. Now I am aware that it probably wasn't the best thing to do as he was probably ill but it's done now.  Now I can't find him anywhere.. All I can think is I threw him out when he could have been ill and now he's out there and won't come back. Do you think he is hiding somewhere is a bad mood or something? It's my first cat so I'm not an expert but I have had him 5 years and he comes when I call him 95% of the time. It's currently 3am here in London so I can't shout his name down the street (quiet residential area) like I had been doing earlier this evening, also I shook his food and treats and left his litter tray outside.

25,"I hope this is a good fit for this subreddit. To quickly sum up the gist of this post: 

I'm 25 and I live in a small town with my parents. I'm in the gap between undergrad and grad school (with humanities degrees), and was unable to secure funding in my grad school applications the first time around, meaning that my stay at home and in an entry level job customer service job has become considerably longer. It's customer service because I have had difficulty finding a job where my bachelor degrees can put some work in/matter much to employers (think retail, industrial parks, food services, and medical jobs). And this stumbling block has really taken the wind out of my sails. 

**And in much more detail:**

In December of 2015 I graduated from college with quite a few humanities disciplines under my belt (thanks to good planning/time management and so many courses double-counting towards things): a Bachelor of Arts in History, a Bachelor of Science in Philosophy, and minors in English and Gender Studies. And less notably, a couple years experience as a Resident Adviser. The fall I graduated I took the GRE, got letters of recommendation, and submitted applications to Philosophy Ma programs. I got accepted to a couple schools, but was unable to secure an assistantship (and I have no interest in taking out more loans). While I can see myself teaching at a college down the line it is admittedly hard for me to think in terms of committing myself to a lifetime career of any kind. When I applied to these programs it was out of an interest in broadening my knowledge of modern/continental philosophy and studying the construction of identity (anything psychological is very interesting to me). So when I realized I couldn't get in that school year and broaden my knowledge in an area of academic interest, I spent a lot of time reconsidering my plans and questioning my future.  

I live in quite the small town- the biggest city being Ann Arbor well over an hour away. While bachelor degrees can be broadly applicable towards all sorts of upper level full-time jobs, I have had trouble finding a job where my degrees can put some work in. While considering such jobs as publishing, copy writer, etc., it seems as though I live in an area exclusive to retail/food services, medical, and industrial jobs (quite a few industrial parks around me). That I'm in an area where my college experience doesn't seem to matter much to employers (unless having a more eye-catching resume to a retailer counts). 

In this awkward span of time I haven't had much of a social life to speak of (I don't know anyone around here). I've been working part-time (the hours vary) at a theater, and I did save up enough to pay off one of my smaller student loans in one go (perkins/about 2000 dollars) which I'm a bit proud of. While having register experience seems nice for a resume, I'd really like a more fulfilling job for the time being, but I have no idea how to find it. 

The best I can think of doing is saving up enough money through a job I don't enjoy, to move to an area with a job I would enjoy/one where my degrees matter (though in that case full-time would definitely be the way to go regardless of occupation).

Does anyone else who became a bit lost and disillusioned after undergrad have some advice I can take to heart going forward? Because the slog and the soul-crushing boredom and monotony is real and it's hard to feel like you matter much when you don't have meaningful work to occupy yourself with. And when you don't have it/are lost on what to do, it's easy to feel frozen in place and it becomes hard to do *anything* else, even to commit some time to hobbies and amusements (games, reading, writing, cycling, etc.). Hopefully this doesn't read as *incredibly* lame, but I appreciate any advice and feedback. ",18Jul2017,2
26,"My boyfriend has a fan zine for a band that's really taken off. It includes interviews from band members, exclusive art from shows, etc. This other guy decided to make a website for it without asking and told my boyfriend that he's paying $30 a month for it which my boyfriend literally never told him to do.

He also started social media for it and was posting weird shit without asking my boyfriend. 

So he asked the guy to stop, guy went crazy, now the website says that he is the original zine and he's creating one on his own for cheaper.

27,"A few years ago I was hurt badly by a man, causing long-term depression and trauma. I went through the proper channels to try to report and right the situation many times, but failed. 

Recently I listened to an amazing interview with a guy who was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent 20 years in prison. Upon being vindicated he met with the prosecuter who handled his case and they apologised. He forgave them saying that it was the only way he could move forward with his life and not be consumed by hate and anger. 

I want to forget and forgive and move on with my life, too. But unlike the story above, the person who hurt me will never admit they were wrong. I do hold a lot of resentment and anger and even hate towards this person and I want to just let it go. But I find it very hard to forgive someone if they don't recognise my pain and admit they did wrong.

55,"So I have been best friends with these 2 girls for about 2 years now but there has been a few things bothering me about them recently and I'm not sure whether to start distancing myself. My friends are B and M.

So B has a lot of friends other than me which is fine. The problem is, most of them hate me for no reason. B literally admits there is no reason for them to hate me, but that's how they are and I need to get over it. I actually do ignore it most of the time. It gets uncomfortable if I ever get stuck in a group conversation with her friends and they basically only talk to her and refuse to look at me. But there is one of her friends and she intensely hates me. She has hated me ever before I spoke a word to her. So much so that she goes out of her way to tell people not to talk to me on nights out and always spills her drink on me. We were at a prom a few months ago and I tried to bury the hatchet and be civil by complimenting her dress. We all sat at the same table for dinner, and when I asked her to pass me the salt she moved it about two inches across a massive table. I know it's such a small thing but it was really humiliating to be left standing there and have the whole table laugh at me, including B. When I said it to B that night, she said she was laughing at the fact that I dared ask her for the salt. The next day I said it again and B claims she never saw it happening. 
I just think if I ever saw my friends treating anyone like how they treat me, I would be so angry with them. B knows I have such a hard time dealing with people who dislike me and it gives me such bad anxiety. She and my other friend M tell me that I just need to accept the fact that these people who I have barely talked to, will hate me regardless of what I do.

So this one is about M. M and I are a lot closer than B and I. She works a lot less than I do so she doesn't have as much money but it's no big deal most of the time. The whole Summer she wanted to go to this festival that I had no interest in really. She asked B and B said no because of lack of money. So she begged me to go. I said sure, I'll do it because she really wanted to and it would be good fun anyway even if I didn't like the bands. So when I was buying my ticket I called her to make sure she was absolutely positive she would go. She assured me she was buying her ticket at the end of the week. So I bought it. 3 weeks later, I said we need to look at accommodation as the festival is 2 hours from where we live. She says she isn't going anymore as she cannot afford it. I say fine, as long as you help me sell the ticket on FB. She says no, why can't I sell it myself? Kind of pissed me off but whatever. A week before the festival I still haven't sold it. Desperate now, I offer to buy her another one as long as she pays me back. She says she will need to get the roster for the pub she works in, 3 days before the festival.  I say no way, I am not risking leaving it until 3 days before hand, text your boss and ask him. She agrees, hesitantly. So I call half an hour later to see if she could go. I got radio silence for 3 days. She claims her Facebook messenger wasn't working. I did end up selling the ticket, but she has never apologized and ugh I just think it was shitty. She is also constantly bitching to me about B all the time, which makes me think she's doing the same to me.

When we presented this news to Elliott and Corinne, they started complaining that they didn't like it and wanted something else. We got pissed because we worked damn hard and this was what we had. These two, who didn't even help research while they were abroad, had the nerve to complain to us. They could literally end up coming back to Chicago homeless, and they wanted to just push it off until we found a dream home. Needless to say, before Casey and I decided to blow up and tell them to fuck off, Vander came in and got a special deal for a house from a family friend who attended his mom's funeral. He wanted to present a secret deal, a sweet place, as a sort of gift on behalf of his now dead mother (pretty weird, in my opinion, but nonetheless a godsend).

We got the place and signed. Elliott and Corinne were content and finally came back around June. Casey and I now had to leave: him for vacation and me for other work. We told Vander we could all split up the work (talking to the real estate agent, helping repair the house which all five of us would be leasing, research, etc.), but he wanted to do all the work like a saint, much to our persuasion. We left it at that and let him do what he wanted. 

Casey's still on vacation and keeping in contact, and I'm finally back in Chicago. Now comes the trouble. Vander has been working on the house gratuitously, and even adding things past the repairs in order to make the house even nicer. It's nice of him and all, and we're grateful even though we didn't ask for it. We were really thankful he could do it, but we kinda wished we could've all just done most of that stuff together when we were all there in August so we did it together, as sort of a pseudo-family. Plus, we felt bad not doing work for the new house (although we worked tirelessly looking for houses at the beginning of the year). We're now deciding on who's getting what room. We have two doubles and two singles. We also wanted to be open to a sixth housemate down the road to help lower rent for the whole house.

Vander decides that he wants to ask for a personal favor and request a double all to himself since he did so much work for the house and felt he deserved it. Casey and I were a bit taken aback, as a) that completely disregarded and disrespected the crapload of work we did to look for a place when the other three did nothing, and b) we never asked him to do that extra work or force him to do business negotiations with the real estate agent, so now he's asking for a reward for what was assumed to be generosity.

Elliott and Corinne are totally on his side, saying he deserves it for all his hard work and that we need to show we're grateful to Vander for everything he did, and because he wants a bigger place to rest when he's tired. Casey and I were taken aback by this, as this was not only disrespect to our own work, but totally unfair. The couple would take the other double, and Casey and I were to take singles. Should a sixth housemate move in, Casey and I had to be the ones to accommodate to the sixth roommate and switch all our stuff and rooms for them and try to bunk together in a smaller room. Vander got special rights for being ""house manager,"" according to them. This pissed me off, and I tried to reason it out to them that not only was it unfair, but it made things harder on me and Casey and put Vander on a pedestal. We weren't fucking equals in this house. This plan was also inefficient, and it would've made more sense for Casey and I to get the double and room together (we were cool with it anyway), give Vander the single, and allow the potential housemate to have the other single.

Vander then felt guilty from all of that and decided he wanted to pay double rent to accommodate for taking a double to himself. Casey and I thought this was fair, especially because he'd be covering the potential housemate and our lives wouldn't be made needlessly harder (and he wouldn't need to take the other roommate). Plus, his gratuitous work wasn't a job that results in payment, which would be his preferred room. It should still come at a cost, in our opinion, and it was only fair. Otherwise, we should just all get even more rights and free things in the house anytime we decide we want to do more work than expected.

Corinne and Elliott were furious and called us ungrateful. They began getting angry at us and ranting and fuming with us at how disrespectful we were for even attempting to agree with Vander's idea. They called it unethical and said that it was completely unfair to Vander. When I pointed out how much work it was going to be to move all our stuff out just to arrange around Vander and how inconvenient it would be compared to the other plan (for future efficiency purposes), they accused me of being lazy and also said that I needed to stop planning towards the future so much and just wait until we get to that point in time. They would even move my stuff for me if need be. I decided to take a step back and leave the conversation, requesting to stay quiet for now and get time to let things cool off. I wanted nothing more than to sock them in the face at that moment, but insulting them and blaming them and pointing out their mistakes wouldn't solve the issue at all. Especially the fact that they've done next to nothing this whole process, and even have the nerve to complain.

Now, I don't know how to proceed. What was supposed to be an awesome living situation for five grad friends is now a war with a couple against two friends, and one (Vander) who feels guilty and doesn't want to take sides. 

Vander is incredibly stubborn about getting the double to himself because he thinks the singles are too small, and following the couple's plan just so they don't get pissed off completely screws over me and Casey and any sort of equality in the house. At the same time, I don't want to piss them off further because I just want peace, but I'm not about to let Vander get what he wants for work that was simply gratuitous in nature and not promised any reward or payment (not to mention making life a little more inconvenient and him getting away with taking up space for two but only paying for as if for one). We didn't fucking hire him to do that work, and even told him he didn't need to play saint and do everything by himself for us. Like, we're thankful he did it, but we all could've done it together. Hell, we could take him out to dinner sometime or throw him a party, but to ask for a reward that's going to have a much longer term impact (at least one year's worth)? I don't think so. Also, the couple is getting on my fucking nerves, even if they are close friends to me. They're ganging up mentality is probably the worst part of all this, since they have absolutely 0 differing thoughts, and it's always 2-1 or 2-2 (and Vander usually sides with them anyway so it's 3-2).

We have strong emotions for each other, but he often pushes the limits. However, SK and I are really good friends with some sexual tie in's as well. I am kind of horrible with making friends, so he would introduce me to his. He reconnected with an old roommate a while ago, so I was given the chance to talk to this guy again (we'll call him Lu). Lu and I get along great, and he's a great friend. Within the past couple of weeks to maybe a month, I've picked up on him being more than friendly towards me. I asked him about it, and fuck, he likes me. I went over to his (plus roommates) place to drink a bit and watch Bob's Burgers (generally hang out and chat). Everything was going fine, very PG, until he started ""bridging the gap"". I didn't think much of it, until he started rubbing my leg. I asked him after about three seconds of him doing this ""What are you doing?"" To which he responded ""Oh, sorry. I get handsy when drunk."" He removed his hand but didn't move for a bit. 

My issues come from a handful of points: I am attracted to Loo as well, but I have zero desire to hurt SK. However (not to use this as an excuse, just to help with the discussion), I have BPD. This can cause impulsive, sexual behavior. Next, I don't want my friendship to have a constant undertone of sexual opportunity. Also, I don't want to lead this guy on.

I was pretty enthusiastic about the club at that point, and things were going pretty smoothly.

He abruptly left the club in the middle of the year. I didnt see him for a couple months until my birthday party, to which I invited him. 

Now Jack was never the social nut really, but he seemed off when he came to my birthday party. He just sat in the corner on his phone the whole time.

72,"When I first moved to my city I made a friend, and have talked to him almost daily ever since. We have spent a lot of time together, good and bad. As a younger self I was a bit naive since I was lonely and just wanted a friend, but now that I've matured and grown up a bit I've noticed some very glaring, unhealthy problems with our friendship.


First of all, we are dare I say, ""too"" friendly. We literally never say anything bad about each other. Any conflict we have is mutually defused, it's really strange. If we have a disagreement, we both almost implicitly change the topic etc. I think this stems from some past issues that I will not go over. It's very awkward because I have friends I've known for 1/10th of the time that I have very funny, harmless banter with.


Second of all, everything he does seems incredibly selfish. If I bring up a topic he isn't interested in, he will just ignore it, not even being polite enough to entertain it. The only discussions we have are about mutual areas of interest, which at this point are confined to various forms of media. I find we have very awkward gaps of silence when we exhaust the current topic of discussion because I'll attempt to bring something up (which he never does, by the way) and he will give one word responses like ""oh"" to dismiss it. It's really irritating, but I don't know how to bring it up due to the non-confrontational nature of our friendship.


Lastly, he displays worrying sociopathic tendencies. Without going into detail, he pretty much ignores morals as long as the outcome benefits him. Sometimes it even seems like the only time he will contact me is if he needs something from me. Like, he will call me to ask if I want to help him work on his yard, or if I can give him a ride, but he'll never ask to go for drinks or something simple like that. 


Don't be mistaken, just because these bad things happen doesn't mean we don't some good times (though they happen less and less often as we grow up). I just don't know how to break off this friendship, or communicate that I want to. We live almost next door, and have gone to school together many years, but as I've grown to realise these things about him my view of him just gets increasingly cynical and I don't think I have anything to benefit from this relationship.

93,"Hello

I'm a 16 year old guy who's been having a serious issue troubling me the past few months and I know this may sound stupid but the fact that I don't know which hand to use for day-to-day tasks makes me very frustrated and uncertain.

I was born left handed but at the age of 4 I was being forced to use my right hand over my left by my dad. I started with holding things, brushing my teeth, etc. When I was 6-7 years old I started writing with my right. 
Between the ages of 4-10 I had severe mental problems such as stuttering, nailbiting and anxiety just to name a few. I even go through nail-biting phases every now and then too, and I think most definitely it's stress connected to the switch.

Now I'm 16 and I can practically do most things with my right hand proficiently, but I do have a preference to do some things with my left hand such as picking up things, handling thin, narrow things, such as toothpicks or picking up coins from my wallet, folding clothing, wipe with a cloth, etc. I even mop left handed and bat either handed.

Now comes the frustrating (indecisive) parts... I noticed after experimenting a little with my left hand, that:

Using a spoon/fork/knife/pen/pencil/toothpick/toothbrush and the like with my RIGHT feels more snug but at the same time uncomfortable, while using my LEFT feels more natural/comfortable but also clumsier. It doesn't feel as snug, it almost feels as if the thign were to fall out of my hand. My left hand feels more ""flexible"" while my right feels more ""stiff"".

Now I DONT KNOW what to do. Which hand should I go with for spoon/fork/knife/pen/pencil/toothpick, etc. Should I go with my right, which feels more secure but oftentimes uncomfortable, or should I go with my left which feels way more comfortable but at the same time way more clumsier?

I have some questions that may help:

1. After all years of (innocently) being forced to use my right over my left, does it mean I am ""innately"" right handed now since it took place under my childhood when the brain is very plastic and still develops.

and as a follow up

2. Does that mean it is too late for me as a 16 year old to swich back?

3. If I would switch back to being left handed, would that also mean I would become ambidextrous since I grew up with using my right hand over my left?

4. Can I reverse my handedness? Meaning, if I do all onehanded things with my left hand instead and NEVER use my right, after a few months, would it be as proficient as my right hand was and would my right hand be less proficient?

I really need advice since I don't know what to go for anymore. I wake up every day crying and switching constantly between my hands. It is really frustrating I just want ONE MAIN HAND to use for every one-handed activity, but I am afraid it may cause bad effects or simply not be worth it for whatever reason. I don't want to talk with a doctor for this either because it isn't really something they can help with. I just need advice from ordinary people who may know a bit or two about this issue or have experience themselves.

Thank you in advance...",18Jul2017,1
95,"I didn't want this to be my first reddit post but I really need help. 

To give a quick background, I recently found out someone has been using a twitter, tumblr and reddit account in my name and writing all these horrible things (as me) about my friends and family as well as a heap of porn. Luckily a family friend told me about this and I have been able to report the reddit and twitter accounts and they have been removed. I have contacted my local police and they are working on having the other account removed.

Over the last few days my three friends at school have been acting really weird, as though they are really close but I am not as close to them. I have a feeling that they are mad with me or hiding something but I really can't tell. In fact they are really supportive of me trying to get it fixed.

The only thing I can think of is that they saw something that this person who is impersonating me has said and assumed it was me saying it about them. I have discussed the problem with them and they are fully aware of it. 

This isn't the first time I've had this feeling. An old group of friends started behaving this way and we ended up having this huge argument about it because they wouldn't tell me what was bothering them. It turned out they were angry with me because I had become reclusive (due to undiagnosed depression at the time) and didn't tell them what was going on. With these school friends though, I haven't done that to them so I think the ""false identity"" thing may be what the problem is.

How should I go about asking my friends what is bothering them?

I'm at the point where I stay late to finish work, sometimes paid hours. Sometimes off the clock so I don't go overtime and piss anybody off. (We're both part-timers) If these tasks aren't finished, I'll most definitely be thrown under the bus!


This is all a HUGE problem, because he weasels around and gets credit for little projects. Giving the look that he works hard, when in reality he's low effort.

Even now I'm at university it seems like I'm only invited along to events because the guy I'm dating is friends with the same people (we had mutual friends before we started dating who now only do stuff with him unless he brings me along). It's my birthday and not a single one of the people I thought were my best friends have even said HB. Which sounds really petty but a part of me wonders if I've wasted the last two years of my life on them. 

Hell some of the last people I considered my ""bff"" (for want of a better word) have tried it on with my last two exes while we were together. 

Am I just letting myself be a doormat? Every time I stand up for myself I'm told I'm being crazy or jealous by my so called friends... Thoughts?",18Jul2017,2
106,"Hey. This is a pretty long one, so I hope you have the patience and time to read this. Help me out, okay?

I'm pretty young. &lt;don't know how this is relevant. Haha. I've got into a fight with my dad a few minutes ago, and now I'm just sitting on the bathroom floor crying. We fought over something stupid. Me forgetting about my school website's password. My dad and I were struggling to log in. You know, blah blah blah, frustration, we take it out on each other, and next thing you know, we're arguing. He said some pretty hurtful stuff about me being useless, an idiot and why I should be more better in terms of standards and therefore my single mom wouldn't come here, see how pathetic I am and take me away from him to ""make me better"". That really hit me, and we've had arguments like this for about 2 years. My dad doesn't care if I'm crying, because he says ""It's something so little to cry over about."" I don't know what to do.

Other things to add salt into the wound:
-my dad saying he wants to kill me sometimes (probably doesn't mean it, but it hurts. Haha. Ha. This isn't funny at all. Don't)

-my mom wants me to go to China with her after two years living here in my home country. I'm perfectly happy here. I don't know why I can't tell her I just want to stay here. Maybe it's because all the times she cried when she says her only goal is for me to live beside her. Maybe it's because she'll probably kill herself if I don't agree. Or maybe it's because I'll die of guilt. Yay.

-It does get better. There are days where we do get along. And then we fight again.

-OH GOODY MY TWO PARENTS ARE HOMOPHOBIC, JUST MY LUCK, IM FUCKING GAY

- I want to fucking die. Not that suicidal yet. I know there'll still be people that care if I die or not. I mean. Things hasn't gotten that bad. I hope.",18Jul2017,9

I received nothing. On the Wednesday I sent an email asking if there had been any updates as the sooner I knew, the sooner I could put notice into my current employer. No reply. 


The following week still nothing. So I tried to phone and got an answer machine, which each time I've tried to call is all I've gotten.


Following week I email again. Nothing. Then over a week later (10th July) I try again an get an auto reply about them being off and they would be back on the 10th of July. No reply all week.

119,"This question is pretty stupid, but to me it's incredibly important. I'm getting anxiety even asking it because I know it's stupid, but it's as if I have a mental block that's restricting me. Even now I'm thinking to myself ""this is stupid, I should just go for a walk."" Which I probably will do, but I don't want this feeling of motivation to go away. 

Let me preface this with the fact that writing this brings me no pleasure, in fact I have to push myself to even say any of this. I've deleted what I wrote multiple times and re worded it, and I can't stop shaking. I really don't know why this subject gives me such problems, but it does.

I'll try to sum it up, for years I've been stuck in a depressive loop. A cycle. I wake up early because I get about 5 hours of sleep a night. I'll sit in my room (live with my parents) until I go to work (I work a lot because I have nothing else to do) but while I'm sitting at home all I do is smoke pot and watch TV or video games or bullshit around on reddit. I'll occasionally go to bars both alone and with friends and I'll rarely but often enough to mention will go to a casino. I wouldn't consider myself an addict, but I do have a massive dependency on weed.  I have no skills so the work I choose is very low maintenance, so this combined with comfort from food and smoking a copious amount of pot on a daily basis has made me gain over 100 pounds. I know what I do is stupid, I know I should stop smoking pot but I just get this incredible urge when I refrain from smoking and I can't help it. I have no distractions, I pushed away most of my friends and the few I do have have lives so I don't push for their company. 

But here's the reason why I come to you, reddit. To make a long story short, every once in a while I'll get this thrust of motivation. It's happening right now, which is why I'm now motivated to post this after years of thinking about it. The problem is, this motivation fades. It's like a high, only for a moment. A moment of clarity.... I don't want it to go away. After I post this I'm going for a walk, but I know when I go to sleep tonight I'll go back to my old ways. I'll pretend as if this post never existed and I'll say ""fuck it"" and smoke that 8th I have upstairs. I'm literally about to cry because this shit doesn't stop. I don't know how to break this cycle, is it fucking laziness? Am I just a bullshit artist? I don't understand man... 

I've been to rehab, voluntarily. I've seen therapists, but I suppose not as many as I should. I can't afford it and my insurance is strange, I'm also horrible at talking about my feelings. My parents and I have a weird disconnect, I love them and thank them for everything they've done for me. (yes I do pay rent) But it's difficult for me to talk to them. They feel in many cases I should just get over it, that I'm doing it to myself and it's up to me to change. And I agree, but I don't understand why I can't get the motivation to do so. I have this weird aversion to medication, because I don't want to swap one addiction for another so to speak and I understand anti depressants aren't necessarily ""drugs"" or whatever they told me to try to convince me when I was in rehab, but I just don't feel like **I** am making the change if I use medication. Stupid I know, but it's just how I feel. Maybe I should just ignore it?

I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone can relate to this situation and what they did if anything to break out of it. I'm not expecting anything groundbreaking and if you made it this far I thank you. I know this is not the most important thing in the world but I don't know what to do anymore. 

tl;dr Depressed and unmotivated, don't know how to break the cycle. Getting worried of my mortality.

Edit:
Okay well I suppose I *can* afford to see more therapists, I suppose I just don't trust they'll be helpful. From what I've seen when I did talk to therapists, they just talk about my feelings and offer few solutions. Idk man",18Jul2017,1

I have a plan starting tomorrow and i need you guys to tell me if it sounds alright.

But before i tell you my plan i have to tell you a few things about the girl.

- She might be a lesbian (she came from an all girls school) but she left because she didn't like the environment so idk if she's lesbian.
- She's new to my school (I am too)
My plan:

Step 1: During dismissal, i wait for my mom to pick me up (she does not trust me to walk home since we're new in the city) and she waits for someone to pick her up too. So while we wait, i ask her ""What's your name again? (I pretend i forgot her name)"" since we're classmates, she'll probably answer my question without hesitation, once she tells me her name--

Step 2: I then ask who's picking her up and if she lives near.

Step 3: Every day after that i keep talking to her during dismissal about what happened during classes until we're acquainted enough to talk during class.

128,"I have been at my current job for over 1.5 years. Long story short, it's a decent paying (I work retail) job that is easy and I am too comfortable at. But, the environment has become toxic for me, as one of my coworkers has been rallying to get me fired even though if that's the case we would only have one real employee left. 

Pretty much, my feelings are hurt. And I flat out do not want to be there any more, because they have no respect for me. They do not realize how much will not get done once I leave. 

I have some interviews and leads set up. But until then I have a little over half my rent and am sure my last check will cover the rest of my rent for august. And I know it will not be hard to find another job.

130,"My brother has been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and ADHD. He has always been difficult to deal with, but things have gotten especially bad in the past year. My brother used to work at McDonalds but he quit because he hated his managers. Since then, he has worked off and on with my dad, who owns a small business, but my brother and dad also fight off and on so my dad fired him when he realized my brother was talking crap about him to customers. Before he dropped out of school, he was skipping class. He spends a lot of unnecessary money on weed, vaping and food. In fact, he made $500 in a month and wasted it all away within days a few months ago. 

Problem 1: My parents. They have never been the most understanding, but knowing that my brother has been depressed for a year or two has helped become more patient and understanding. However, they have not taken away his phone or internet. They allowed him to drop out of high school but told him that he needs to get a job and get his GED. However, they have done nothing to reinforce that so he has just been sitting around for almost five months. He turns 18 next month, and at this point, they want to just kick him out. He steals from them when he can, he eats all of the food in the house and he complains when things don’t go his way. Of course, this is my parent’s fault for not teaching him that his actions have consequences. 

Problem 2: My brother. As I mentioned, he turns 18 next month. He’s depressed but he has zero motivation to get better. He refuses to take his medication. He does not want to go to school. He tries to get a job every now and then but he gets frustrated and he gives up. In fact, he was just in a job interview the other day and we found out that he lied to them and told them that he graduated high school, so I don’t know where that is going. I have tried speaking to my brother about why he does not want to get better. He does not think anything will make a difference. He also blames his mindset and behavior on our parents, rather than taking responsibility for his own actions. Both my parents and I have sat with him and asked him what he wants to do in life that will make him happy. He doesn’t know, and I can understand that. But I don’t know how to make him want to get better when he doesn’t want to try.

Problem 3: Suicide. My brother has threatened suicide a couple of times. He was admitted into a children’s hospital but he did not stay for long, since he was being violent against other children and bullying them. I know this goes hand in hand with his depression and lack of motivation. I don’t want it to come to this. I want to prevent it, but again, I don’t know how to get through to him.

Problem 4: Distance. I am seven years older than my brother. I live about 150 miles away from my parents and brother. I want to help but I also know it’s not really my problem. I haven’t lived with my parents in seven years. I talk to them about once or twice a week. Many think that my brother living with me would be great because it’s somewhere to go where we know he will be safe but he will also get away from his stupid friends in the area he lives in. (I can go on for days about his friends but it doesn’t seem worth it, since I am sure it’s easy to guess how they are.) However, I wouldn’t take crap from him. I have full control over my house and technology, so I know that he would get frustrated with me and probably run away. Of course, he would be running away with no where to go, but that’s also what scares us. 

On a similar note, we are afraid of what will happen to him if my parents kick him out. He thinks his friends are there for him, but we know how his friends really are. Like I mentioned, we don’t want worst case scenario to happen. The sad thing is, I almost want him to be arrested so that he is put in a program where he is watched and not spoiled. 

Has anyone ever had an experience like this? What more can we do for him? I know my parents need to actually discipline him, but at this point, they are counting down the days until he turns 18. They have practically given up. I want to help him but I’m not going to spoil him. What can get through to him?",18Jul2017,1

134,"To start I am 18 years old and I have been dating this girl who is the same age as me for about 4 months, though we've been together as friends, and friends with benefits for a total of 6 months. Since we've started dating we gotten really close and serious. I've met majority of her family and we've opened up about everything with each other. Our relationship has been steady and great for majority of the time, though we've had to overcome some personal issues to compromise. I've overcame my trust issues (not trusting her with other guys because I didnt feel enough for her) and she has overcome some serious communication issues (bottling up concerns, insecurities, and feelings). We've become so close and connected that we've said I love you to one another, we do several activities and responsibilities together where it even comes to the point of being clingy with each other. Going a day or more without one another simply sucks and can easily affect our moods.

Now to move to the issue at hand. My girlfriend and I are regularly on good terms, but with every couple comes small tiffs and arguments. Usually they dont ever blow up and become a serious matter, but last night is the first time an issue has blown up into something serious. 
To basically sum up what happened last night, my girlfriend has had a lot on her plate as of recent events that have been stressing her out such as school &amp; grades (summer semester), work and payments (Car Insurance, Music festival tickets), and issues with her mom. Yesterday we planned on seeing each other in 3 different periods of the day, we planned on hanging out before she went and hung out with her best friend, she woke up late and didnt have time to meet me. She randomly decided to get her first tattoo yesterday even though she was going to be short on her car insurance payment if she got the tattoo. I told her I wanted to be there for her to when she got her first tattoo, so she told me she would come pick me up (did not have a car to drive) and take me to the place because there was a person in line before her, 20 minutes had gone by and she told me that she didnt have time to come get me. Finally she told me that she would meet me after she got the tattoo and before she had to go to work at 5:00 PM, but by the time she was done with the tattoo it had been 4:15.

The entire day had went by without us seeing each other and at the end of the night I asked her if she wanted to hang out, she then told me she had online homework that was due by the end of the night and she had to wake up early for her exam in the morning. By the time I got out of work and went home I was really upset that I wasnt able to see my girlfriend, so I facetimed her to at least talk to her. She was in the middle of doing homework so she didnt give me attention and I asked her if I was bothering her or if she had a problem with me (I will take fault for this because I can clearly tell that she was stressed and had other things to worry about). We then blew up into a huge argument that lead to her breaking up with me, or at least I thought because a minute later she said she regretted what she said and that she loved me and didnt want to lose me in her life. I went and I saw her at the end of the night and we made up.

This morning she texted me the usual good morning text, snapped me, and everything feels normal and fine. We facetimed while she was studying for her exam and I could tell she was focused and determined to pass her exam so we didnt talk as much like usual and I gave her space to study by ending the call after 10 minutes had went by.

The reason she said she was going to break up with me is because she doesnt want to have to constantly worry about me, my feelings and making me happy and secure. She said I dont deserve the shit she puts me through and that breaking up would feel like relief coming off of MY shoulders. As of right now I feel insecure and worried that at any given moment she is just going to want to break up with me if we have any issue sprout up, and I am concerned and in need of good advice to tell me how I should be feeling and if I am overreacting at this problem in my life.",18Jul2017,1
135,"Using a throwaway, but also before someone writes this off as a joke, I'm being totally serious here. And I also apologize for the wall of text that's about to follow.

So short backstory, I've have a little over a decade of experience in the film/news/tv industry. But I no longer live in a viable market (NY/LA etc.). Moved because of my wife's job. Where we are the job market is pretty slim as is (it's rural America). I've spent most of my life behind the keyboard. Writing both narrative short stories and screenplays, but mostly the latter. When I was in elementary school and middle school I won a few contests for my narrative work, but nothing of substance. As for my screenplays I have sold a few shorts and even had the director of Quantum of Solace and World War Z personally request one of them. 

Point is, if I were to write another screen play it would be with the intention of making the film myself. Something I can shoot on a budget here in podunk nowhere. Except that recently over the last 4-5 years I have felt burned by the industry. I get rejection is part of the game, but I keep going in for jobs that sound too good to be true and thats exactly what they are. For example, most recently, I went up for a position as a Production Manager for a brand new studio that was opening in the area. 

They had sound stages, recoding booths, editing suites and all. It even had that new house smell it was that new. Problem was they wanted someone to run the studio, but they didn't want to pay them. It was the funniest thing I had even heard of. Now don't get me wrong, I've come from the late 90's and early 2000's of indie film where ""Copy, credit and food"" was a form of payment, but that's what you paid your friend to hold the boom. This has happened a few other times. And it wouldn't be that big a deal if I didn't have a wife and two kids. So money is kind of a big deal right now. If I were to pursue the film as an option it would have to be strictly in my spare time or something I took vacation time to do in the future.

If I went writing the novel route, I already have a specific story in mind. That screenplay I mentioned from earlier - the one requested by the director - it's won a few contests (about a decade ago) and it would be a reverse adaptation where I could put everything that I wanted into the overall story. If you're wondering why I just don't make that movie myself, it's because when I had a reader look over the script, the budget for it (in 2003 dollars) was $165 million. That might be lower now because of technology, but still out of my price range. Also I already have multiple ideas for sequels and spinoffs should I go this route (think Enders Shadow/Speaker for the Dead or the Shannara series). The only thing holding me back is that I haven't tackled something this large before in terms of page length. Sure I've written 144 page screenplays before, but not 350 pages of prose. 

So basically what I'm sitting here thinking is if I go with the book, I feel like I'm missing out on movies because I've dedicated so much of my life to doing it. I've always been ""the movie guy"". Anytime I hear a podcast or see some behind the scenes I get this tingle of ""I should be doing that"" or ""why haven't I done that yet"". Some of my best work days have been the 16 hour long ones on film sets. Some of worst ones have been 8 hour office jobs. But I have this fear that, what if the film I make is garbage. I make something, then that defines me. I am ""That filmmaker"". We have this critic culture where people spend years making a movie or video game only to be defined by a metacritic score.

If I write the book, I feel like that will be an impressive feat, and far less an expensive endeavor. I also feel like I can get that story that I've had on paper for a near 20 years out there in the ether. I even had a family friend who's a published author of multiple books, take a look at the screenplay. He thought the story was overall a good idea. I just feel that if I write the book first, then that's what defines me. I'll be an author. I can only think of one author that was also a filmmaker and that was Michael Crichton. 

Long story short is I'm wondering if I should just give up on the film thing because I'm tired of having my heart broken because of empty promises and move on or give it one last go and see what happens. I'm not looking for people to make this decision for me necessarily, just what they might do in my situation.

137,"Hello reddit!

Two weeks ago I was in a low speed motorcycle accident, no actual collision, but to avoid the guy who pulled an illegal u turn right in front of me, I braked hard and went over the handlebars. At first I though it was no big deal, ER x-rays were fine, but an MRI has since revealed a fractured shoulder. 

At this point, I still have to see an orthopedic doc for the next step- I have been out of work since the accident, and have no idea at all how long I will be out before I'm fully healed. 

I am a union engineer, so I have a great deal of job security- I have a generous medical leave in our contract, but it is unpaid. I have some savings, and a couple of other sources of rainy day money, but I also have a full set of bills- Mortgage, credit cards, etc. 

I am trying to look on the bright side here- I have wondered what it would be like if I had the guts to quit my job and try to make ends meet from home somehow. I suppose this is my chance! (The plan is to get better and go back to my engineering job though) 

One thing I am already working on is drawing portraits- I used to draw ages ago, and have gotten back into it recently with decent results- I have an old friend who paints pet portraits as an income source, so I'm about to set up a site for that. (Friend is on the opposite coast, and I will be talking to him beforehand, not trying to step on his toes!)

The other thing I know I really need to do to survive this is to make sure my days are structured- Spending half a day on reddit should not be an option. I know I should wake up early to stay on a schedule, take the dogs for a walk, get some breakfast and then get to work, etc... 

So I guess what I'm looking for is any other advice along these lines. Sources of income for someone who can only use one arm, any tips for staying productive while out of work for an extended period of time...

150,"Hello, I was hoping to get some advice from some other users. My girlfriend(F,20) and myself (M,21) are moving into a house together here in a month or two. She's in her last two years of nursing currently, and I still have a few years to go. 

I've lived by myself for years, paying bills myself and everything but my lifestyle was very young and ""bachelor"" you could say. Partying, experimenting, gaming all day and night, etc. I was never late with rent or bills, paid everything with cash including my car so I never had a chance to build credit. She's lived with me on and off when she's in town from school so we've spent plenty time in the same house. We're moving to a much bigger city together in order for her to continue her schooling, and it was the same city that had the school I'm attending next year as well. We're getting a nice apartment or townhouse and we'll be busy with school, both taking more than ""full time"" worth of credits and also working, and she will have to put in hours at the hospital. So, we'll be very busy. 

Our main question is, what are some things we can do to take that next step into adulthood, rather than having that mindset of a young adult. I understand we're still in college, but I think if we can get organized now it will be easier for the future. I'm thinking of getting a credit card strictly for gas and bills, then repaying it off monthly with the cash I was going to spend anyways to start building credit, look into saving/investment options, etc.  Also, what can I do to make this house a little more ""homey"" than my last? And not look so much like a bachelor pad that's only good for partying and sleeping. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, even if it doesn't answer any of my questions. Thanks a lot and have a great day! ",18Jul2017,0

I cannot say that I hate my job, and at the same time it is not likeable. The pay is basic for fresh grads and this job is not what I had in mind when I was job hunting. 10 months into it, I can see it is not bad and workload is quite okay. The plus is working hours are flexible. However, I can't help but feeling empty on this job. As for colleagues, I guess they are okay but they are not people who I wanted to bond with. My family and closest friends live in another city. I thought of finding another job, but in this kind of economy (my country) it is really hard to find a job for someone who has little working experience. So I stayed.

As for my personal life, since I live away from friends (whom I see once every month), I don't really have anyone close to hang with. So basically my daily routine is home work home. It is quite frustrating because I am young and I want to go out. I tried making friends, but it feels fake to me. It feels like I'm befriending them for a purpose and also it seemed like I'm the only one who reach out to them. 

I wanted to move into another city, find another job. But I'm scared. I don't think I can get good job out there and I don't even have enough savings to move.

As a short introduction, I'm a final year Economics student at a Russell Group university.

I had to take a break from university two weeks prior to the start of exam period (May - June) after our family suffered a bereavement.

The university have been really understanding and I've been given permission to sit for the first time alongside those taking resits.

I have 5 exams, all worth 100% of their respective modules.

Whilst the funeral was in late June, I had my first chance to sit down and consider the extent of the workload last week Monday. Throughout the week I attempted to pick up where I left off but realised quite quickly that I'll be unable to follow my previous revision plan as time just won't allow for it!

Does anyone have any tips/study techniques for studying for these exams in just under 4 weeks? 

Any sort of advice would be highly appreciated.

Thanks :)

170,"I've recently been going through some things and the way I view the world is in general negative, something I've been trying to change for a while now. I've made progress, learned how to better react to situations rather than just breaking down and pulling the ol 'woe is me' bit, crying to myself and asking why people would treat me this way when I've done nothing wrong to them.

Instead of getting sad and depressed I've been getting angry. I've been standing up for myself more, I'm not afraid to speak my mind anymore when I see something unfair, but I still do fear ending up alone which is why I wanted to try something Steve Harvey of all people said while in an interview with Barack Obama.

He talked about his son in law and how he loves him like his own, but at the same time with loving him there's a small thumbnail sized bottle of hate towards him deep inside his heart that is there for when he needs it. I've been adapting that practice and I see it in me when something goes wrong.

I'm considered one of the nicest people, but I don't like bullshit and drama. I don't have social media of any kind and I mostly just work all day. Recently I feel the hate though in me when something happens, my 60 year old uncle borrowing money from me, his 23 year old niece and then still lecturing me and telling me how the choices I make affect me gets on my last nerve. He's been using cocaine recently and when I go to his house sometimes he takes my car without asking.

It aggravates me, but because I have to deal with the respect boundary I get annoyed. My solution from what I've been through recently was to get a hotel room to be away from both him and my mother but I get a lecture about spending my money on a hotel room just because I got it along with a 'I need to talk to you about something' after I left there yesterday AND gave him money.

Our fights were pretty infrequent, but the last few weeks we've been fighting over anything and everything. We have acknowledged this problem and have been doing better since we have and both stated that we didn't want this relationship to fall apart over stupid small things. Anyway, during our fights he use to have the worst temper and I would cry for a while after he blew up on me, then realized he needed to work on it and he hasn't had a problem with his temper really in months. I, however, have been more stressed out lately and have been ultra sensitive over things and have started fights that have been unnecessary. My temper has been worse since I've had family over—I know, not an excuse, but my question is, how can I control my temper? I ended up saying some not so nice things to him today and I never use to curse during our arguments. He just set me off and I know he didn't mean to and I know how I acted was NOT justified at all—just like when he would curse and say some unpleasant things when we argued. 

How can I deal with my temper? I don't want our relationship to fall apart. Someone please help. I notice that I calm down when I have time to myself, but I just need help.

178,"First I will give a little backstory. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. I grew up with ""John"" and became really close to him in the past few years. I'm the only girl in a small group of friends. John met a girl and quickly married her (We are all aged 19-20). ""Sarah"" became a best friend that I deeply care about. I even made their wedding cake and was with them at the Dr. when they found out the gender of their baby. They were my best friends. 

The thing is, I found out two days ago that John is having sex with another girl. His wife is 35 weeks pregnant and I am sickened over it. I have never lost so much respect for someone in a matter of seconds. I just don't know what to do. She has had a rough pregnancy and I am afraid finding out could throw her into premature labor. Also, her great aunt is in hospice dying of cancer.  It is very painful for her to have sex and John has been very selfish and trying to continuously get her to do things, regardless of her feelings. She has cried on my shoulder upset and scared that she can't please her husband. Now, she has been having stomach pains. I also don't want to ruin the birth of the baby and make it a sad day for her. But, if it were me I would want to know. 

He has said some mean things to her and she is very forgiving and I am afraid she will side with him. I have already decided I am done with the piece of shit and he is no longer welcome in my house. I've decided that if she stays with him I am done with the both of them. I can't just sit around and watch him cheat and mistreat her. Her family really dislikes him but doesn't say anything so they won't push her and the baby away. 

Like I said, we live in a small town and I know of at least five people that already know. With that number, the whole town will know in no time. I just don't want her to get blindsided in public and get angry at me for knowing and not saying anything. But she is 35 weeks pregnant and I don't want to ruin this time for her. I have thought about waiting until after the baby is born. 

Please give your advice as I desperately need it. This is a shitty situation either way. 

Edit:  Thank you all for your advice. I am extremely grateful for the help. She is out of town and will be back in a day or two. I will tell her in person then.

Now I'm worried about issues like terrorism, but also the influence of religion - particularly islam seeing as Christianity is less popular -  on the west and if one day, it can affect the laws of the west. I fear what happens if religions like islam takes over.

 Very soon my girlfriend and I will be going to college and they're very far apart from each other.

But as we get closer and closer to the days that we leave, I've noticed that this is going to be extremely hard on the both of us. We love each other so much, but being apart from each other for that long will kill us on the inside. We struggled to survive a full week of me being out of town on vacation. We were constantly texting back in forth ""I miss you"" ""I want you here"" etc along with face timing. This is just a 1 week vacation, and I can't imagine doing this for a whole year. I love this girl so much, and she seems to love me just as much. I sincerely hope we can make this work, but I feel that staying together during college could ruin a future relationship with this girl because of things like jealousy, and lack of physical connection and emotional connected from one another. Also this is the point in our lives where we grow as individuals and ""find ourselves"". And I always hear it's harder to grow when tied down to a relationship, especially if she's 10 hours away by car. For me In a perfect world we take a break for college and just grow as individuals. We would meet and date different people to just see if we are good for each other. And at the end of college, if we still have our feelings and we were ""meant to be"" then we would get back together. But I almost feel as if I am being selfish for wanting this. (Am I bring selfish for this?) It makes me seem as if I don't actually love her, but I do. And I just want the best for both of us. I don't know how fine she would be with this, as she said she wants this to last through college and potentially farther than that. Again, I love this girl so much. And I honestly see a future with her, but I don't know if staying together through college would be good for our relationship. I would be open to a break in the relationship to just grow as people, and then maybe come back together in the future. I honestly don't want to just end this relationship because she has had such a positive affect on my life. And she has said that no one has made her feel as happy as I've made her feel.

Plus my boyfriend fell asleep on the phone, so I can't get any more help from him.

I really don't know what to do, and I'm panicking since he said ""ooh, you're in trouble"", and now I'm worried that when it comes to my career, I won't be able to keep up with the people who naturally excel at mathematics. I'm so scared. ",18Jul2017,2

206,"Hey, this is my first post, so excuse me if I'm not completely with Reddit etiquette. Anyway, I need help, or advice. I myself have never done anything worse than weed, I disagree with drugs to be honest with you. However, I am in foster care and have been for my whole life because of my parents drug abuse. It was only around 5 years ago I got to start seeing my father unsupervised, because social services were convinced he was clean from heroin and safe for me and my sister to be around alone. They were wrong. I believed this myself until last night, when my older sister, who has left care and lived with our father for around two years, broke it to me that he's been on heroin again and never stopped. It then all clicked in my fucking mind as to why he never has food in his house, why he's always asleep or sounds monged out, why I kept finding random squares of tinfoil in his house. I don't know how to feel, I understand it's a difficult drug to quit but I'm so angry at him for keeping it secret from me. I have told my social worker about his usage as I am happy to not see him until I turn 18 next year. In fact, I'd rather not see him at all until he sorts his life out. I texted him and told him he's not my dad anymore until he gets his act together yet I still want to help him. Any advice on how to get through to him? Any comfort, advice or anything other than hate or useless nonsense is appreciated.

208,"Hello,

I need help deciding if a job opportunity is something I should pursue. Currently I work in a museum doing signage and other graphics for the exhibits. I make 32,000 per year. I have a flexible schedule, easy job overall, easy commute, good benefits and I work with some great people and I love the culture. I bring home $890 biweekly after taxes and insurance for my family. 

My bills with out gas and groceries are $600 bi weekly. So I have about $150 for gas groceries and misc. per week. I usually run out after one week if I want to do anything fun like go out to eat or to a concert on the weekend.

I recently was reached out to by a company I interviewed with while I was still in school a year and a half ago. I didn't get the job but I was a close second to who they picked because they had more experience. I graduated and got the job I have now, been there 13 months.

This other company emailed me recently asking if I was still interested in opportunity, that the company was growing and they now had a spot for me. 

I told them I was interested, had an interview that went well. Benefits are similar to what I have now. This gig isn't as big of an operation as the museum but the work will be more tailored to what I want to be doing which is marketing graphic design. I do this at my job now but most of the work is making signs and simple things among other admin tasks.

Initially when asked my desired salary I said 50k because why not, I've got nothing to loose. So after the interview they wanted me to do a design test, which I did and they liked. It looks like they are going to make an offer. I am still waiting to see if they are going to offer the 50k.

My question is do I leave a cool job that I like and that works for me and I am comfortable in to go make more
Money? The new job isn't as ""cool"" objectively but I feel it could further my career in the long run, having a real graphic design job and tile. 

I feel like my time at the museum will be cut short if I leave, but the thought of getting an 18k raise is very appealing as I currently live paycheck to paycheck.

210,"So context, my older sister has always loved chameleons. She got one a while back when she was living on her own, but couldn't afford to properly take care of her. So... for this past christmas she decided to give her to me. I wish she would have asked me before putting the life of an animal in my hands if I would agree to it. We both live with our parents right now as we are both relatively young. Anyway, I did the research, and I did everything my sister explained to do. As of a couple weeks ago or so, she started turning grey to almost white which is unusual as well as staying near the bottom of her cage. I made the environment cooler for her since it's been in the 90s F, and adjusted her diet and the diet of the crickets she ate. My sister never believed I was treating her correctly even though I easily spent hundreds of dollars on trying to keep this chameleon happy. This morning, I found her passed on. She was still slightly warm so she hadn't passed on too early in the night.

I need advice on what to do about this. I feel absolutely terrible about it and haven't told anyone yet. I don't want my sister to find out and have some unspoken hate for me even though I know she needs to know or will find out eventually. 

Edit: Well I told my parents about it. We might not tell my sister, or at least will try to ease into it. At least my parents were supportive of me. ",18Jul2017,2

222,"Hello,

I just wanted advice on this. A few years ago for my first Biology lab class at my university in Fall 2015, I sat at a bench with five other girls. I'm a guy by the way. Four of the girls were very nice towards me and would talk to me. However, it was this one girl in particular I felt as though she didn't like me. She would never talk to me or initiate conversation with me, she wouldn't make eye contact with me, she would roll her eyes at me, etc. Whenever I would try to talk to her, it was as if I was bothering her or I would get a vibe such as ""Why are you talking to me?"" Sometimes when we weren't busy we would have conversations as a group, and when I would speak she wouldn't even look my way, or really respond to what I would say. When I would ask the group a question, sometimes she would answer it, but she would look at the person next to me as if they asked the question. I don't know why she acted this way towards me. She wasn't like this with the other girls. She was very friendly with them, would talk and initiate conversations with them, would make eye contact with them, etc. She wasn't like that towards me. I never did anything to her and was very nice to her just like I am with everyone else. I am a shy, reserved kind of guy. When I meet strangers for the first time I can be a little awkward, but as I get to know them a little better, I come out of my shell, which I did in this situation. I don't know if that could've put her off.

Another situation this past Fall 2016 semester, I took pre-calc. I often went to the math tutoring center on campus to get help for that class. There was this guy who I'll call Chad in my pre-calc class who would always be there. We started sitting at the same table, would help each other out sometimes, and would sometimes have conversation. When he would walk in and I was there I would acknowledge him and he would do the same. However, I noticed he would look at me weird sometimes. As the semester went on, I would walk in the tutoring center to sit next to him and I would say ""Hey Chad"". And he would ignore me. But, he would start talking to me later. A few other people from our class would come there, and they were very nice towards me and would always respond when I would say hello. I really enjoyed being around them. Anyway, the class and the semester ended. Then in the beginning of the following semester, Winter 2017, I went to the campus bookstore to purchase some supplies for my new classes. I was waiting in line, and I saw Chad. He was in front of me. He turned around, I nodded my head to acknowledge him, and he just looked at me. He didn't smile, nod his head back, say what's up, put his hand up, etc. He just gave me a blank look, then turned around. We were never friends, but we were in the same class and I would often see him at the math tutoring center and would talk to him. And if I run into you, you can at least just say what's up or something, but he totally just ignored me making me look stupid.

Just to let you guys know, this doesn't happen that often. These are rare occasions. Oftentimes when I meet people, they're very nice and don't act the way those two people acted towards me. And oftentimes, when I run into acquaintances or people I met in my classes, they will smile, say hi to me, talk briefly, be happy to see me, etc. People always tell me I am a very nice person. I treat everyone with respect, I don't get into any trouble, drama, etc. Therefore, this doesn't bother me that much, but I'm just curious why those people or people in general would act like this or treat me like this? However, like I've said, I am a shy, quiet, reserved, kind of socially awkward person. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it. I would love to hear what you guys think.",18Jul2017,1
224,"I need advice on helping figure out what to do with my career.  A little background: I had my dream job, doing hair, but lost that due to a car accident.  I went through some anger and depression but I am ready to move on and start something new.  My problem is, I have no idea what.  I keep telling my loved ones maybe I should be a teacher, maybe I should do something with art, maybe I should do something with English, or maybe I should do something with animals.  I have lots of interests but none of them seem to grab me enough to be like YES this is what I want to do for a living like being a cosmetologist did.  I think teaching English could be fun; it would involve reading a lot, which I love to do.  The schedule of a teacher could be good for me since I deal with chronic pain, so having long breaks would be nice.  I also thought about becoming an editor or publisher.  I also stumbled across Animal Cruelty Investigator which sounds heartbreaking but rewarding.  It would be awesome to write or do art for video games but that is extremely hard to break into.

228,"Hey,    
first of all, I am not sure if these words exactly mean / describe what I actually mean, since I only know the german words and translated them via an online translator, so here we go.    
    
Since forever, I have a bad sense of direction. I can't for the love of god memorize where things are. I am feeling lucky being able to remember where certain ""major"" things are I visit more frequently, but other than that, I would need to use a navigation app, even if I was there (even more than once) already.    
Trying to imagine the way from here to X, it just doesn't work. Everything is all over the place in my mind. Even if it was just the way to things I know I can find, I couldn't ""imagine driving"" there. I was there often, hence I know when to turn, but only when I am actually there and not when trying to imagine it.    
I ""solved"" this problem by using navigation apps, as I said, and it works well, of course...    
    
I wrote this beforehand because I have a feeling this might be connected to my ""new"" or at least more recent issue, being ""scatterbrained &amp; clumsy"". IDK how to exactly explain this, but I can give examples.    
Sitting at my PC and being bored, I open up youtube, followed by reddit, twitch, twitter. After reading through it all, I close all the tabs and continue what I did before (watching a stream, often). Then, max 1 minute later, I open all these websites again, only to notice afterwords that I just opened them already. I would maybe not call it really forgetting that I opened them, I just don't think when doing this. But I can't get myself to start thinking about things like this. At least I think so, it might also be something else (maybe really forgetting? sounds scary tbh..).    
Another thing is listening to directions etc. that people give me. I listen to them, often repeat them to make sure I got them right, only to completely forget them a minute later. I might have some parts of the said things here and there, but I generally have to go back and ask the person to repeat himself.    
Do I think about too much at once, hence mixing up stuff, forgetting other stuff, etc.? Might my low amount of sleep be the reason, or part of it? Could this even be something else, more serious?    
edit: I just thought about something else, I also cannot ""make out"" what letters of the alphabet are where (in terms of ""come early"" or ""come late"") or which month is corresponding to which number (1-January to 12-December), at least for everything in the middle (4-9).. I always have to start counting from the beginning to make that out. What the hell? Could this be a ""dumb"" or ""faulty"" way of thinking / storing memories? But how would you even try to change this? I mean everyone kinda learns this himself..

However my friend went on holiday for a week so I took it home as my other friend who normally gives his weed to my friend also had to take his home. So it was like 2 weeks ago I took it home and I had 3 20bags wrapped in tissue and put in a face mask pot (lol) and kept in the zippy inside part of my bag and I was pretty sure you couldn't smell it. However two nights ago my dad who was pretty drunk came in my room and said where is it? I knew what he was talking about but I was like where's what..? He said 'the marijuana. I've smelt it in the house for weeks so where is it?' My Mum who came in too was like it's obviously not your sister or your brother so where is it? I stupidly said I don't know so they searched my bag, but even more stupid tbh on their part they didn't check the zippy pocket. However, they took my baccy and inside the pouch found a joint and so took away my phone laptop purse debit card and baccy. They said they were going to kick me out of the house!, then they were going to make me quit my job bc that's where I meet all these druggies!, then they were going to ground me for 2 months! My mum was so angry, my dad was also incredibly angry but told my mum to leave so he could talk to me. He said he used to smoke it and so is really disappointed in me and he's not going to make me quit my job but I have to promise to 'sort myself out' I said ok, and I intended on getting rid of the weed next time I saw my friend.
Anyway, my mum dad and I were back on speaking terms since that night, however, today when I came home from work my dad called me downstairs and said 'what do you think I'm going to ask you?' I was confused as hell so I was like ..what? Then I saw the face mask pit and he was like you said you didn't have any weed on you and I was like I just didn't want to get into anymore trouble (I literally cried my way out of punishment the other night lol) he asked me where I was getting it from so used a friends name whom he's never met and doesn't know. I didn't really get in trouble considering he just found 3 20 bags but hey.

As a result, all three of them have become really close, always hanging out together. They all live in a town 4 hours away while attending college and only come home during the summer. Last December I hung out with the best friend and we had a really good time. We went on a couple dates and he was my New Years Kiss. However my twin sister found out and straight out told both of us that she didn't want us dating. She was really angry about it. So I decided to back off because I didn't want to cause problems between all of us. They went back to school and came back this summer and last weekend all four of us decided to hang out and we got drunk and I ended up sleeping with him. He really seems to like me and I like him too but he lives 4 hours away and my sister is such an asshole about it. When he tried to talk to me the day after we slept together, I blew him off and made it seem like no big deal. He came over to my house (where my sister is staying for the summer) a couple days later and I decided to stay in my room until they all left.  My sister is very possessive and like I said before she isn't close to me or my family. She's basically made a little family between her boyfriend (and his family) and his best friend.. I can't stop thinking about him but I don't know what to do. At this point, I've already basically pushed him away and he hasn't tried talking to me again just randomly sending me mass snapchats of nothing important. But I just feel like maybe he might be the right guy for me and what if I miss out on something because I don't want to make things awkward. What if I tell him how I feel, that I really like seeing him and I would've been with him sober or not, and he doesn't reciprocate those feelings? Maybe I'm just venting..

255,"I met this guy online and we started talking about our lives and I told him a lot of things I've not told other people, we became pretty close and would talk every other day.

I have no friends at all because I'm home schooled and have terrible anxiety and other things that ruined all my friendships, I made friends online but they have all left me after a few weeks of talking.

The guy has stopped talking to me, like others, for no reason. I messaged him to ask how he is but he said sorry can't talk now but will catch up in a few days. He said that three weeks ago and hasn't responded to me last message I sent a few days ago either.

I thought he was going to be different because we had promised we wouldn't do exactly what he did. I hoped I was gonna have someone to talk to and be a friend but maybe I'm not meant to have friends. I don't blame him.

I'm sorry I've kinda gone off point.

Thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you if you are able to give me any advice. Xx :)

TLDR: Met a guy online. We got close and talked a lot. He hasn't messaged me in three weeks and had promised he wouldn't do this to me and I made the same promise. Is he ignoring me on purpose or am I jumping to conclusions?

256,"Hey there. My current college semester is ending. I have some e-textbooks, in the form of PDFs, that I had purchased from a seller on eCrater. My question is, can I legally re-sell these textbooks myself (such as through ebay), and if so, is there any logistics about it? When I bought the pdf via eCrater, the seller had a limit, which to someone clueless like me, doesn't make sense given how I could just (in theory) copy the file. Is there a hidden rule I am missing?",18Jul2017,2
261,"Having a summer birthday means my friends are always away on vacation. This year literally no one is around. So rather than pouting, I want to celebrate alone! Yes - it's sad, but what else can a girl do. 

I cannot decide whether I want to do something relaxing for myself or go on an adventure. I am looking for suggestions. Has anyone else done this before? What did you do to celebrate solo?",18Jul2017,1
263,"I found out my 15 yr old brother is drug dealing. Hes in a private school and gets good grades, bur hes been influenced by the wrong friends and has gotten caught up in selling weed and mdma. He doesnt sell to school kids, he sells out, to adults or late teens. 


I've warned him to stop and he said he will. So i created a fake account and messaged him saying ""can i buy xx grams of green for $200"". An offer thats hard to resist. He said sure meet me here bla bla bla. 

So he lied to me. So now I want to plan a fake meet up with him to teach hin a lesson. The dangers of dealing like getting rolled and bashed or stabbed. 

Any thoughts on this? Would this make him stop, if i scar him. Maybe have a fake gun and wear a mask, then let him get away and run home? 

I appreciate any advice given
