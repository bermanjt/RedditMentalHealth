2,"I am an 18 year old male. I have spent the last year completing my freshman year of college. I have obtained 45 credit hours as a college student, but I slacked off and finished the year with a 2.2 gpa. My father, who was paying for me to attend the school, has decided that he will not pay for me to go back and is insisting that I drop out and join the military. I want to finish school and truly believe that if I go back I can focus and do far better. However, I am only 18 and cannot afford to go back on my own. My dad and I have never gotten along and he insists that I am lying every time I try to plead with him.",25May2017,1
3,"Hi everyone. I am currently interviewing for jobs. I am changing careers and am doing something new. So I have had a handful of interviews. I have one in about an hour, and I have an offer on the table. I also had a phone interview this morning, and they were going to let me know if they wanted a face to face, but I don't know when they will let me know that.
So the offer on the table is close to my house, has great learning potential and growth. But I don't love the idea of working for a construction company, also the money offer they gave me feels low. The phone interview is farther away but I like the idea of working for a design company. And their starting offer would be more than the one I currently have. However I don't know when I will hear from them. And I need to let the other company know by tomorrow.
I am excited for the interview this afternoon. And if that goes well, that would be great. But I am not sure they will be ready to let me know by Friday if they are interested in hiring me or not.
So in the end, when tomorrow comes, do I decline the offer I have for the possibility of more money and a more interesting work place? Or do I go for it?
I am looking forward to getting a job. And I have other things going on, so I am not desperate. But I am getting there. I don't want to get to a place where I am starving for a gig.
So...Thoughts, opinions, etc?",25May2017,1
4,"Hello, well my story is a bit of a lot of bad luck combined with bad choices in my life. First of all when i graduated high school at the age of 18 i made a poor decision and attended a community college that was not in my ""county"" so my tuition was higher compared to if i had gone locally. So because of this decision i ended up doing 3 semesters there before i got sick, had surgery and diagnosed with crohns disease. I eventually just dropped out because i couldn't make the days.  I spent a good amount of time healing, in bed and my parents had no problem taking care of me. The Community college then said i was responsible for the semester i dropped out about a $3000 balance. Of course  without a job and my parents weren't going to pay that as if it was too much for them. i didn't look back and just ignored the balance. fast Foward at the age of 22 still unemployed i felt better about myself and went to a different school where i completed a certificate program on networking, eventually i did a internship there the whole thing was a year long now i'm (23) the school loans, and financial aid weren't enough to cover the whole program so i was left again with a debt of around $3500 this time and they wouldnt hand me a certificate or job placement assistance until i pay the balance. again i ignore this and try to look for a job on my own to no success. About a month or two later after finishing this program i fall sick again and spend up to this day almost 2 years later visiting the doctor over my condition and taking a lot of medication. While sick i've been trying to look for ANY job but i always get declined. Now i'm 24 i owe both schools money, and im working on getting my health back on track. I'm still applying for jobs and i've gone to countless interviews and the latest one i went too as soon as i walked into the door the interviewer said ""well i'm going to be totally honest with you, you're not fit for this job."" It might be my appearance who knows, But i'm really trying and giving up hope on what the best thing for me to do is. Sometimes i feel like trash since my own parents are losing their patience with me, even while working through my condition. Ideally, i would want to go back to school but without paying the 2 previous balances from 2 different schools i have no other options. If i went to a new school and started fresh, since now i'm 24 and considered a independent student i may get more aid now which would cover the entire tuition. If anyone has been in a similiar situation please share how you got your life back on track. Thank you.",25May2017,2
5,"Two days ago, I made a big mistake. I was in my ""Leadership"" class, which for us is more carefree then normal. You can eat lunch, leave, talk, play music, play on phones, free time. Halfway through, someone came it and asked for help counting the ballots. The subsitute(a math teacher at the school), told us we could all help, and as a joke, I said ""No!"" And left the class. I did a short lap and came right back to help.
This was my magor mistake, but the story gets worse.
The teacher told me that I was in trouble and he wanted to talk to me after class. Some other kid took a blank ballot paper and began to jokingly fill it out, with his intent of throwing it away. I know this kid. He would never do something bad like ""cheating"".
I was watching him the entire time, until the teacher came and grabbed us, telling us we were both in trouble. The class, confused, just sat there. He took us to the office, where we sat as he freaked out. Eventually, the vice prez came over to us and told us we needed to talk. Then he gave us a referral, which really angered us and everyone in our class.
The VP did nothing. He basically just said we were lying, even though we were telling the truth.(I swear.) He then gave us trash bags and made us clean trash for 40 minutes.
After the day ended, I felt bad for what I'd done, and went to apologize. The teacher basically told me to go away.
Fast forward one day, our real teacher is back. He understands, he's not mad. He understands that we are good students(at least, I hope we are), but says he has no say in what the other teacher did. After this, I'm feeling pretty okay, besides the referral. I go back to the sub's class to try and apologize again. 
This time, he tells me to sit down, then explains how horrible I am, no one will ever trust me(I dunno), permenant record, etc. This whole time I'm thinking, ""Wow, you suck."" 
Then, he gives me lunch detention for the next day, and threatens me with suspention.
And here we are now. My leadership class hates him, and so does anyone that witnessed it. I agree I should get some punishment, but this teacher is being a complete pain in the ***. I really don't want this referral, but the teacher's actions is what really got me here.
So, I need help. What should I tell him? What can I do? Who is right in this situation?  How can I fix this?",25May2017,1

7,"﻿I’m a fine art photographer and I think that I’m reasonably good at what I do. My work is routinely displayed at galleries (including solo shows), wins awards, gets published, and I just exhibited at a reasonably large art fair. I’ve shot models from weeks old to in their eighties, male, female, and trans.  While I work with many attractive, young, naked women, for me it is not a sexual thing, I once explained to my wife that it was a bit like buying tampons for her, the first few times it seemed intimate and a bit titillating, but at this point it is no more exciting than buying paper towels.

Despite the fact that I clearly approach what I am doing with a high level of professionalism and that my photos, while often showing a nude, are almost never remotely erotic, people often make comments about how I must get a thrill out of being around naked women. At the art fair yesterday somebody looked at a photo and made a comment along those lines. I find the comments a bit insulting. My wife’s a doctor but I’ve never heard anyone imply that she or any of her colleagues do their jobs because it allows them to see naked people. I never know what to say to people that make these comments. I sometimes will give a little lecture but I think it makes me seem preachy and defensive. Often, I just don’t bother responding.

So, redditors, what do you think my response should be?",25May2017,1
8,"I have been working for a company for 2 years. I absolutely love the work (it's in my field) and ALL of my co workers. In fact I love the entire management team, except for the owner. The owner is male, and about 15 years older than me. I am female in my late twenties. He has been pretty mean to me the whole time I've been working for this company, except for in the beginning.

I have been one of the strongest performers in my department and my reviews have reflected this, but the owner, until recently, micromanaged me, criticized me, and never made small talk with me. He is perceived by most as quite demanding, but he put more pressure on me than anyone else, hands down. And the problem is, it was always negative, negative, negative.
Recently in the past 2 months, he has finally been treating me well and making conversation with me. I'm not sure what to make of this. If he can remain consistent like this, I'd stay in the company, because overall I'm extremely happy.

On the other hand, I started job searching a while back due to his treatment of me. It has finally been bringing results. Another company has been giving positive signs that they will be offering me a role soon. It may pay 10 - 15 per cent more than my current role. 

Should I keep working at my current role, and anticipate getting along better with the owner, or should I take his past behavior as indication that it's not the right fit, and consider the job offer that may be forthcoming?",25May2017,1

16,"Greetings Reddit, While I've lurked for sometime on this peculiar little 'site, a recent unpleasant turn of events has forced me to search for any sort of advice wherever I can get it. Which eventually led me to here.

I'll cut to the chase: My mother is physically disabled (end-stage COPD) and cannot work. I've recently graduated from High school and about to enter college, a college in which my brother is currently attending. My brother and I practically run the house, as my mother is bedridden nearly 24/7. The ""breadwinner"" for our household would be my (not insulting, totally honest) brain damaged father (likely resulting from 13+ concussions he sustained during a semi-pro boxing career in his early 20's).

My father (prior to his brain damage taking toll) was a Sergeant in the US Army, but lost rank and was eventually discharged due to allegations of sexual harassment/misconduct (he grabbed a woman's ass, she reported him). Hence, he eventually was booted from Fort Knox and became a truck driver...

However, his Truck Driving career did not exactly bear any more fruit than his time in the military. While he did get his CDL, he has been fired and hired repeatedly from multiple truck driving companies. He's mostly been fired due to the fact that he is an awful driver. He's hit multiple people's vehicles (one wreck resulting in a critical injury, secondary to a man's death) various structures and has been in so much legal trouble as a result of these events that there are certain states he cannot legally drive in.

My father's trauma induced Dementia really came apparent a few years after he was discharged from the army. He cannot keep in track of the days of the week, frequently calls me by my brother's name, does not remember the answers to questions he's asked on multiple occasions, among other things. My father is pretty much hated in my family. In accordance with the aforementioned ass-grabbing, he's committed adultery with multiple women. One of his mistresses was married; her husband started stalking my father. My mother intend on leaving him high and dry until her health plummeted and she had no choice but to remain married to him in order to keep a roof over our heads.

My father is (to put it nicely) a total asshole. Besides the adultery, even before his dementia became symptomatic, he displayed blatant favoritism of me over my other two siblings, viciously emotionally abused my half-brother due to not being his biological son, treated my mother like shit frequently, would make huge financial decisions without any regard as to how they would effect everyone else (he bought a fucking 2015 Nissan just because he felt like it).

So after my mother's COPD hit her full swing, and my father's discharging from the military, my father's paychecks from whatever trucking company that had hired him were the only source of income in my household. Which brings me to the problem at hand:

My father and his boss went at it and he quit in a huff, leaving him here at home, not bringing in any income, and leaving my mother, brother and myself in a very unpleasant situation. Considering his many wrecks and pending legal issues, he is unlikely to get another job, let alone a truck driving related one. How he got the last one was my family searching everywhere online for someone willing to hiring and hoping that they didn't check his record. Most did, but eventually one didn't. That job however has fallen to pieces with two wrecks and a few more legal dilemmas. For the record, my father is unwilling to do anything else besides drive trucks, so it did not matter what we said about the whole ""you obviously can't drive, how long until you kill someone again"" situation. Father did not care, it's his way or the highway.

So here we are, my mother trying her absolute hardest to get physically well enough to come to my graduation ceremony, and my jackass, slack-jaw father comes crashing in to ruin her sense of well being, bringing with him an absence of an income and countless days of arguing and wasting her breath trying to convince him to go job hunting by himself, instead of relying on us to find one for him.

I suppose what I'm trying to ask is: What can/should I do, Reddit? I'm so scared and tired (this is like the umpteenth this has happened, but it's unlikely to get better again ). I'm just graduating high school, I have no useful skills that I could use to seek employment, not to mention I'll be going to college in August with a double major in mind. 

There's no reasoning with this man, if I question how's he supposed to get a job all he does is throw his hands in the air and state he'll get ""(insert large number) of jobs!"" even though he's had dozens of wrecks, dozens of pending legal issues and is FUCKING WANTED in a few states due to letting these issues that have occurred whilst driving go unresolved.

The future seems so bleak and unpredictable. Knowing that A. My jackass father will be lounging around the house, doing nothing but holding his hand out for food, and B. We will be financially strapped to the wall; my mother's disability checks being the only thing warding off poverty.

I'm so scared, so worried for my mother's health, so tired of dealing with yet another catastrophe that my ""dearest father"" created. Happy birthday to me.
So Reddit, What should I do? Any meaningful advice would be of great help right now. Thank you.",25May2017,1
17,"This year I will be 23 and she will be 30. We have been kind of flirting for about 6 months or so and I kind of want to take things to the next level but I've never been with someone older than me, let alone 7 years older. We get along well and I think we're both into each other, I just wonder if the age difference will matter in the long run. 

Also, I know I shouldn't care what other people think, but I'm afraid people may judge us for being far apart in age. I want to know if people on here have ever judged others in relationships with an age disparity and why they did, or didn't. ",25May2017,6
19,"Ok, I dont really know where to start this, im asking for advice, and to be honest i just needed somewhere to get this off my chest.
Where to start? I guess at the beginning. So around August September time my (at the time) girlfriend broke up with me after just over 2 years, she said I'd changed however everyone (including her sister and her mum) said it was her that’s changed. I wasn’t in a good way after that, I'd lost over a stone in weight in 2 week, wasn’t eating, wasn’t sleeping, id shut down completely. About a month later I moved back to Uni to finish my 3rd year. It was a fresh start for me, get out more, socialise more, get drunk much more. Id started going out with my friends a lot more, many of them girls and it was getting better. One downside to that though was id started getting much closer to some of them, one in particular. Over the course of the next few month we got much closer (purely as friends) and we became best friends. I'd learnt she'd been having some issues with her current boyfriend (tl:dr, he became more distant, didn’t seem as bothered). Then one night after many alcohols were consumed we ended up sleeping together. Yeah…. The day after she didn’t know what to think, she said she'd started to develop feelings for me, as I had her, but she was in a relationship so nothing else could happen, she loved him, she wanted to be with him. So I told her to do what made her happy, and if that was staying with him so be it. Afterwards we went back to normal, nothing was ever awkward between us as we both knew it couldn’t happen again and we weren't willing to lose each other over it. 
Then they went away for the weekend to a concert, I didn’t talk to her much that weekend, yeah we stayed in touch but not much. I ended up asking her when she was coming back on the last day as I was near the bus station and I could pick her up if it was while I was there, it wasn’t so I left it and went back home. This was about 4/5ish, then about 5 hours later I got a message off her saying along the lines of 'that was shit thank god I'm coming back' so I asked what was up, said id pick her up and we could chat. Tl:dr, he'd been a dick and basically just walked off while she was waiting for the bus, she was in tears over it all. Yet I was the one she turned to. The week after we ended up sleeping together again (this is around march time now).
Being the 2nd time now she was really confused, she didn’t know what she wanted anymore and needed to sort it out. We were both absolutely smashed that night so although we knew it was wrong we put it down to that, again we were still fine with each other. A week later, it happened again, this time really threw her, those two still were having issues, and I was making her happier than she'd been in many months (Her words), it had got to the point where she would rather spend time with me than him (again her words), I told her whatever she decided (i.e stay with him, leave him get with me, just be alone for a while) it was her decision and she needed to do what made her happy. She ended up talking to him about their relationship, he admitted he'd been shit and they would make it work together. Don’t get me wrong I was heartbroken, but if that’s what she wanted, so be it. 
Nothing really happened for about a month there, they had issues but nothing major. Then she ended up telling me that she'd been talking to him and it turns out he'd been messaging his ex, for quite a while. She found out because his ex forced him to tell her. The main one that stood out to me was one he'd sent a few days before (so very recently) saying along the lines 'if you and your current boyfriend split up, could we ever have another chance' to which she said no, she had been good about it all, basically saying 'go away and be happy with your current girlfriend'. So the day after she told me about all this, I went up to see her (We had both gone home for a few days, luckily she only lived about 30 mins away). So I went through, and we talked about it all, she showed me everything she'd been sent and didn’t know what to do, what to feel. Again she was in tears over it all. She didn’t know if she could trust him anymore. She was seeing him in a couple days so I told her to focus on revision (Middle of exam season now for us) and just talk when you see him. Apparently (I say that as I think all this is bullshit), he only asked her that, and other things, as he needed 'closure' to help him move on (even though they'd broken up 3 years ago, and he was with his current girlfriend for over a year). She believed it all and they’ve stayed together. 
Now we've caught up to the current day. She's still with him. I still love her and want her to be happy. Don’t get me wrong I want her to be with me, I feel she'd be happier with me, but it's not my decision. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore, part of me wants him to know about us (She's never told him as she knew it would end things for them), part of me wants to leave it, part of me wants her to be mine, part of me wants her to stay with him as he DID make her happy and possibly could again. 
I love her. And it sucks ass. 
Holy jesus this is long, I wasn’t even looking while I typed this up so didn’t realise it was so big. If you wasted your time reading this, thank you.

21,"Hi, I'm a young college student and ever since I was young I've never had any dreams or ambition. Whenever my teacher would ask us about them I would draw a blank not even beginning to know what to say. Fast forward to college and I'm still in this dilemma, most people I would ask have at least something they aspire to be or some goal they wish to pursue, something that gives them a sense of purpose. For me I just go with the flow, I'm taking post secondary education not because I want to, but because I know that it will yield some kind of benefit for me in the future. I don't have any passions so I just do things for my own benefit or to keep a good relationship with my family. Honestly, the only thing that I can think of that I enjoy is video games and surfing the web (like most other people my age). Also, for as long as I can remember things that would make other furious wouldn't bother me at all. For example, during my recent semester were in assigned groups to make a presentation, but when I found out that half of the group flaked out on the presentation day my remaining group members were furious while I was indifferent to the situation completely, we almost failed the project but I really wasn't bothered by it, whatever happens, happens. I've went to countless forums and the like and have stated that it might be a symptom of depression but in my situation I disagree. I'm fully content with my life, no strong desires other than living comfortably and being more independent.
Now, if this was all then I wouldn't be posting here atm. The issue is that as time goes on this aspect of my being has been bothering more and more. I'm just so damn envious of people who have goals and dreams that just thinking about this angers me like nothing else does.

Have any of you ever felt like this? What exactly do I do to remedy this issue? 

Sorry for the length of this, just wanted to vent and hopefully get some kind of answer. ",25May2017,1

26,"--Throwaway due to work related reasons--

I began a federal job a touch over a year ago, dealing with warehousing and warehouse management. We are a 'new' office with fairly stable funding.

I have had a variety of work so far, but the issues that concern me is the manager. Simply put the manager is unprofessional (swears at employees, creates a hostile environment or darn close) and has a decent set of double or triple standards. I honestly have never dealt with someone like this before.

A decent portion of my coworkers are prior military members and I get along with the majority of them. My manager (Mike) was a career military member, and lets just say he has had minor experience in workplaces outside that. I have also heard of multiple failures in his previously roles, meaning he is far from being the shining star he makes himself out to be.

He has created an abrasive atmosphere where outside offices are leery of 'Mike' and say his name with a scoff. This is because he essentially burns bridges by yelling at workers in our office and parallel offices. This often involves belittling, swearing and such. Since I am one of his reports, I more often than not get remarks of pity for working with him from other employees.

Mike often times has double standards for employees (behavior of employee A is not accepted by employee B, all else equal). I would easily say he gives too much of a benefit of the doubt to other former military members (of which I am not).

Mike as a whole appears to be immature due to his focus on wording, phrasing and delivery and lack of regard to what he dishes out on a daily basis. In other terms, Mike seems like he unable to work for himself if ever put in that situation.

I have found myself being questioned to the nth degree while others are not. I am honestly tired of this type of treatment, and do not know how to constructively handle it. I am wondering if Mike expects to be treated differently (possibly poorly (yes, I can only imagine), because I have only been cordial so far. 

I need assistance on what to do next. He has been referred to as an 'asshole' by coworkers inside and outside the office. Without resolution, it might be time for me to change jobs, but I don't want one personality to drive that. Possibly, I might need assistance on how to mentally wall off worktime to hometime.

I am hoping to leave a HR option as a last resort.

Thanks!",25May2017,5
27,"So lately I've been in a pretty shitty place. I'm finishing up my junior year of university (only one month to go) and I'm not sure I can even make it. I'm not suicidal or anything, but my body and mind are insanely worn out from being a full time student + working 20-30 hours a week depending on my schedule. It's been tough this year watching my bills and debt pile up while I drag myself to another class I'm barely interested in. I would be taking classes I actually want to take, but my college wants us to be ""well rounded people"" so I have to take 6 classes outside of my main area of interest. 

The reason I'm asking for advice is because I am considering taking a gap year in between this year and my senior year of college. I know a lot of people might say ""oh you just have one more year, just push through!"", but it's a lot harder than you think. I haven't had a real day off since about the 8th grade, as my mother would make me take courses at the local community college over the summer, and every weekend from when I was about 10 was filled with sports events, violin lessons, and orchestra practice. After high school I had to take summer classes between college years to make up credits so I could change majors, and I love the major I'm in now. I still haven't had a weekend off in university yet due to working weekends. My body is completely exhausted after years of just constantly doing things. I know people say to never have a zero day and stay motivated, but I would love a day where I didn't have to do shit. I can barely get out of bed, I sleep anywhere from 10-15 hours a night (which usually causes me to miss class) and can only stay awake for 4-5 hours at a time without napping for a few hours. Because of this draining exhaustion, my grades are slipping and I'll be lucky to finish this year with a 2.0. 

I'm really not sure if I should take a gap year or not. If I were to, I'd definitely spend time working, saving money, and working on practical skills since my area of study is almost useless unless I go to graduate school. 

I am at a crossroads and don't know what to do. I'm supposed to sign up for classes in the fall this week, and I just don't want to. I think I need time to recharge and regroup mentally, but I'm not sure if I should just power through it and try my best and hopefully not fail out of school, or if I should take that year off and try and regroup. Thanks to anyone that replies. 


TL;DR I'm burned out at school and exhausted all the time, can't stay awake and can barely get out of bed, cry because of stress a lot. Should I take a year off and just work and save some money or should I try and just graduate next year. ",25May2017,1
28,"My Girlfriend grew up in Montreal, where there is a really good public transit system. When she went to school she moved from the suburbs into the city, and long story short she never really had the opportunity or pressing need to learn how to drive from her parents.

Unfortunately, she also passed by her opportunity to learn, and use their insurance and car in order to learn how to drive. She has finally gotten around to learning, but now she doesn't live with them anymore (she lives with me), and we are without a car for her to practice on.

Society is definitely **very** geared towards learning how to drive from your parents, but there must be people with similar problems.

I am, if I say so myself, a decent driver. People say I drive like a grandpa, but I just drive for fuel economy with a ""get there when I get there safely"" philosophy. However, I sold my car when I moved into the city, and have only been using a car sharing program. This means that I can't actually legally teach her to drive, or at least I haven't found a way to do so.

I use a car-sharing program, but the insurance it provides *only* covers me. Since I don't actually have a car, I don't actually have car insurance of my own, and thus cannot add her to my policy as I do not have a policy of any kind. 

For her to pay a driving instructor to learn is outrageously expensive. They can teach her good habits and fundamentals, but at the end of the day she really needs lots of opportunities to **practice** these habits, and that's the crux of the problem here. 

Does anyone know if any rental car places would allow for me to rent the car, and provide insurance to me that would extend to her, so long as I am in the car providing instruction to her? 

Likewise, is it possible to get an insurance policy without having a car, and have **that** policy extend to a novice driver?

To be clear, she has passed her written test, but she is at the stage in her graduated licensing where she cannot drive alone, a licensed driver (I've had my license for over a decade) must be in the car with her. She is also prohibited from driving on highways.

Thanks in advance for any replies, I hope this is the right venue for such a specific question, and apologize if any of me reddiquette is off.",25May2017,1

In my senior year I grew bolder and was able to make a lot of friends and eventually started dating a girl who we'll call Jane. We dated through college and the relationship was perfect.

Then she cheated on me. And this is the point where everything fell apart. Jane was the first girl I dated and for the first few months I tried to forgive her and make things work. I couldn't, so I spent the next months distracting myself with work and alcohol. Enough time had passed and with the advice of my peers I tried to date again.

And then I met another girl who we'll call Kelly. She was amazing and for the first time in a while I felt like I could be happy again. But then I panicked. As the relationship matured, I was too afraid of her cheating on me like Jane did. So I broke up with Kelly and went no contact. I regretted what I did. I dealt with my personal demons and after some time passed I reached out to Kelly and apologized for everything. I told her the truth, that at the time I wasn't ready for a serious relationship and I should have communicated that better. I didn't dare ask her to take me back, I felt things were beyond that now and I just wished her a good life.

Two weeks later I was arrested. I put into an interrogation room. I was afraid and confused. A detective comes into the room and tells me I am being accused of rape, by Kelly. I insisted there must be some mistake, I just patched things up with her. No one believed me. I spend the next 36 hours in a jail cell. When I was finally out, I spent the next year in and out of the court house. Every single court date was a panic attack. On the final day, Kelly refused to testify and I was set free.

And here we are today. I can't even approach a woman, much less one I am interested in. My friends keep telling me to ""just keep going on dates"". I can barely hold a conversation with a girl without having severe anxiety. How do I learn to trust again?",25May2017,5

I am .8 points away from a B and I put in my best effort this quarter, part of the reason I am struggling I think is because of emotional stress with real life problems.

32,"So little bit of back story. Im going into my 4th year of college...should be graduating but due to severe depression and sleep apnea, i havent been doing well academically the past two years. 

Ive sought out medical help and depression is getting better as well as i should be getting a cpap soon to fix my sleep apnea (i stop breathing 38 times per hour). 

Anyway, im currently a chemistry major and pursuing a biology minor as well. However, as I struggle with my depression and trying to control it, i end up thinking alot about my life, my interests, what i want from life, etc.

One of the problems i face now is that im unsure whether i want to pursue chemistry anymore. As i have thought about my life and what i want,  i keep coming back to the same urge for a better connection with nature. I have a very ""hippie"" mindset i guess. That we should live with the land, not off the land. With this i seem to have found a passion for sustainability and taking care of our earth. Recently i have actually started reading about permaculture, organic farming, etc. And find it really interesting.

In summary, i find myself thinking about switching to an environmental science major and focusing on water/soil quality and things of the permaculture nature.

However, one of the reasons i originally chose chemistry is because i have a passion for cannabis and its medicinal/recreational uses. And i want to work in the cannabis industry, and i figured the easiest way would getting a chemistry degree/studying natural products chemistry and either making extracts for a company or in a lab doing quality control on cannabis.

So in conclusion my big dilemma is whether to continue pursuing chemistry or go more of an environmental science route that focuses on water/soil quality and plants. My end goal though is to work with cannabis. Whether growing, analyzing, or extracting... but its hard for me to put my thoughts together and figure out what to do. 

If anyone could provide any insight, suggestions, or opinions on the matter i would greatly appreciate it.",25May2017,1

37,"Little backstory is that I'm the youngest of three and I was the only one that stuck with sports in high school which our dad pushed on us. I always had the feeling that he was trying to live through me even though he said it was to keep me involved and even though I hated every practice I stayed with it because I felt bad for my dad since my brother and sister both quit their sports. I'm 19 now and my brother and sister have both moved out but I'm still here because my paperwork for the military is taking a long time. Which was also my dad's idea and a big regret (not serving just going the way he wanted it) now I'm stuck here with my parents and I feel like a bum but I don't really have a choice. I'm working 30 hours a week just killing time before I go and even though I hate my dad I've tried to bond with him but every conversation or activity I try to do with him I have to fake enjoying or it ends up with him yelling at me. The only reason I haven't moved out and just completely cut contact with all of my family is because of my niece. My sister was a teen mom and when she had my niece they lived with us for 3 years. I babysat constantly and we're really close now even though they've moved out. I still see her twice a week and I would feel terrible leaving her because when she heard that I was leaving for the military she started crying. I really don't want to do that to her but I wouldn't be at any of the family gathering so that I wouldn't see my dad and after I cut contact I don't know what my relationship with my sister would be like. Does anyone have experience with this? Does it get better after I've moved out because I genuinely don't like my dad.

38,"Hi

Im a 22 year old. I have been born and raised in London by an immigrant family. I hold a British passport and i speak perfect english.

In April i booked a ticket to Barcelona. I was (unfortunately) drunk with a new colleague. I have recently received a job offer and am happy to start a new life there.

I haven't told anyone Im gay before and moving there i can live as a gay man - hopefully freely!

I learnt that my colleague is highly homophobic, like everyone in my life so far, so ideally i will cut him off.

The real worry is my family won't support me. At the moment i haven't got any money and i don't speak any spanish.

At first this may seem like a heavy rant, but genuinely i'm happy to run away and start a new life. One where whoever judges me means nothing, and those who have, are in the past.

Anyway, keep reading my posts and see how my bleek and dark circumstances unfold.

Wish me luck!

My plan since I got into high school was to become an engineer and maybe an astronaut one day if i'm lucky, i'm still very sure of this as a longterm career and designing things and trying to make the world a better place through that is my ultimate goal.  I've been accepted to an engineering program but haven't paid any tuition fees or anything yet.


Recently I've had a close friend from school move to Australia as the first destination in her multiple places she wants to move and work.  We were talking the other day and she said something about how I should come join her on her travels.  At first I wasn't seriously thinking about it but the past couple days I can't get it out of my head.  I've always wanted to travel and I was going to take a Europe backpacking trip next summer after my first year of college with money I save this summer.  It's not even about Australia just travelling around the world for a couple years sounds amazing and a really life changing experience.   I'm worried i'll regret not doing it in the future if I don't do it.  Once university is done i'll have too many student loans and have to get a job, this is the most freedom I'll ever have to do something like this until I retire and I'd rather do it young. 


There's a couple problems i'm having with this decision.  
1- I have never been independent with almost anything my whole life, I've been living at home rent free since I graduated, never had to pay my own bills for anything which i'm extremely lucky and a little spoiled in that regard.  Moving out let alone moving to an entirely different continent sounds batshit crazy to me, but also exciting.  I've never travelled anywhere before so it would be completely new to me. 

2-I don't know i'm capable of leaving my family and friends for somewhere that far away,  I was going to have to leave to a big city for my second year of my degree anyway but that would only be an hour or two away.  My family is very loving, my Mom and Dad are the nicest people in the world, I have 3 younger siblings with the oldest of them being 16 and the youngest 8. I'd be missing out on who knows how much of their lives.  My parents would support me in this decision eventually I think but they would still be heartbroken and I would miss them a lot.  I also have my best friend here and she is a very anxious and depressed kind of person and she would be a wreck if I left.  


I know ultimately I can't let other people stand in the way of what I want to do but it's very hard for me to leave people I love.  This would be a huge undertaking but it would be the greatest adventure of my life.   Also if I decide to go I don't know if I should wait until my first year of college is done and then go or if I should just do it now and start college in a couple years when I'm done. 


This is a wall of text but basically if anyone has any advice or resources about this it would be appreciated, I've never made a choice this big before and I want to make sure I know what I want before I do it.  Advice on how to break it to family and friends once I decide would be nice as well.

49,"This is lowkey a continuation of a post I made a few weeks ago. Below's the backstory for y'all that didn't read the first one (after this paragraph). I updated him on my current situation and he provided a lot of advice and told me to ask if I ever needed anything. It's definitely a nice gesture but how do you respond to that? I appreciate the guidance and advice he gives me but to be honest I've found that spending time with him is sometimes more meaningful to me than even that. It's kinda hard to explain unless you've experienced it but to be able to spend time with somebody that embodies your idealized conception of a parent after having really neglectful parents is a profoundly meaningful experience. I'm not sure if responding with ""oh I wish we could do stuff so that we could bond more"" when he asks me if I need anything, because that obviously isn't a need but it's something that's really important to me. I don't wanna come across as weird or needy but it's something that's on my mind a lot and I know my life would be a lot better if we had more opportunities to bond with each other. Again, I'm not sure how mutual that feeling is so I'm not tryna make him uncomfortable or feel weird but it's something that I think I should express in some way. Any advice on expressing that sentiment (in hopes of it coming to fruition) is really really appreciated. I got so many great responses on my last few posts, I really appreciate y'all for this. Alright, belows the back story. 


I don't know how much context I should provide, but I am a 17 year old male, and my parents have been pretty neglectful, to the point of me not legally being allowed to live with them (no sexual abuse, just physical and emotional abuse - they were also not able to support me financially because of their financial decisions) so I live with my aunt and uncle, who are also pretty irresponsible but thankfully are not abusive in any way. Keep in mind, this all happened recently (within the past few months).

My current living situation is pretty tough, I live in a really rough area, in a two bedroom apartment with 6 other people. An old teacher of mine is aware of my current situation and has provided a lot of guidance and fatherly advice that's helped me deal with everything. I had him as a teacher as a sophomore (last year), and we talked a lot, had lunch together, and he really became like a mentor to me. I can't really look up to my parents because they really are not good people, so to be able to have that type of person in my life that I could look up to really meant a lot.

I hate attributing my personal mistakes in my life to my environment, but I've definitely made some bad decisions in the past which led me to have multiple altercations with law enforcement. Part of that is me being a black male in a heavily policed area but I've definitely done things I'm not proud of.

I was able to talk to that teacher about a lot of the problems that I was experiencing and I felt like he truly understood what I was going through and knew exactly what to say to make things better and help me get on the right track. Our relationship was no longer just a mentorship, it was a friendship. I do live in the United States and am very aware that there are certain policies within public schools that set professional boundaries between students and teachers, but keep in mind, I go to a sort of alternative school and those policies don't exist to the same extent. The student teacher relationships at my school are still professional but are way more friendly than they would be at a normal school (we call our teachers by their first name, etc.), so don't trip about that. That teacher started this rock climbing club at my school, and we'd go every Tuesday together to the rock climbing gym (with other kids participating in the club) and we got to spend time together with that.

He used to drive me to the place and he only had one passenger seat so it was just us, and we got to talk about a lot of things. One day, I decided to talk to him about how I saw him as a father figure in my life and how thankful I was that he fulfilled that role in my life (to some extent). He was confused and preferred the word ""mentor"" because he didn't think he did enough to justify the title of ""father"". I didn't really bring it up again because I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable or make things awkward between us. I stopped climbing towards the end of sophomore year, and there was no longer anything that we did together outside of school.

Fast forward to now, I'm a junior, so no longer in his class, and we don't talk too much anymore. About a week and a half ago, my biological father passed away, and he was the first person that talked to me about it. He gave me a hug for the first time and it made me realize how badly I wished this man could be my actual father. My own father was in and out of jail for all of my life so we never really got to form a meaningful relationship with each other. We never did any father son activities or anything like that which was something that I tried to not let affect me but deep down those were experiences that I wish I had growing up.

That teacher is aware of all of the things I've mentioned about myself above, so I think he understands how meaningful the time we spend together is for me. Anyways, like I mentioned earlier, we've kinda drifted apart because he's no longer my teacher and I don't really see him that much anymore and this has been especially difficult for me because of everything that I've been going through. I don't want to make things weird, but I really wish that we were closer and did more stuff together, but I'm not sure if this is an appropriate sentiment to express or how to go about expressing it. I've never wanted to bond with another person so badly before and it's something that's on my mind a lot. I know this is a super long story, but do any of y'all who've made it this far have some advice to give? It's much appreciated.

62,"I screwed up a lot in life. You've heard it all before. I need any job to keep me afloat. I got lucky and have two ~minimum wage job offers. I need help choosing which way to go.

Goals: Make rent. Save up enough money to fix my car. Save up enough money to find mental health treatment (~$500 for assessment, ~$100 per hour of therapy). Or alternatively, enough money to get a silver healthcare plan so I can afford antidepressants and other meds based on a general practitioner's diagnosis.

**1) Papa John's Kitchen Employee:** 5 minutes away by bike (no car). Got offered a kitchen position at $10.50. Manager verbally promises ""around"" 40 hours a week. Of course there are no benefits below 40 hours a week, so realistically I'll never get 40 hours. 38 at most, realistically. The place hasn't had its grand opening yet and needs workers badly.

Pros:

-Very close. If my bike breaks down I can walk.

-manager wants to rush us through training so I'll probably start getting paid sooner. 

-She really needs employees. Since the crews aren't set in stone yet I can make a good impression.

-Once I get my piece of shit car fixed I can start delivering pizzas and make much more money.

-Looks hard but not worse than being a morning shift baker (my last food service job).

Cons: 

-No benefits at all. But I can buy glasses online through a friend.

-Manager seems super stressed out, but doesn't take it out on the employees. Yet.

-Kitchen staff look fucking miserable.

-I'm gonna be scheduled for the busiest hours at first. If I mess up I'll be stuck with those hours.

-Up to 6 days a week, so less time for getting my life on track.

**2) Chipotle Grill Cook:** 30 minutes away by bike. Just over $10 an hour. Manager ""promises"" around 40 hours a week, but like PJ's, doesn't put anything in writing.

Pros:

-Employees ""seem"" happier

-Health insurance, vision and dental taken out of paycheck.

-Free lunch

-5 days a week -probably

Cons:

-Grill cook is rumored to be beyond stressful compared to other food service jobs. Everyone up front is counting on your perfect timing and logistical estimates so that there are no delays.

-Longer commute. If my bike breaks I'm in deep shit.

He was training me on the first day and seemed really nice and excited to have me there, he kept on complimenting me and telling me I'm beautiful/gorgeous and will get amazing tips and I'm not so dense that I didn't realize he was flirting but I figure some people just have that personality type so I was like okay whatever. Anyways, first thing that threw me off was that he started talking about a girl who once had my position and how she had great boobs and always showed them off and how it helped the tips a lot so I can wear whatever I want then he started saying things like ""I love having friends and complimenting people don't take it the wrong way like the last girl who accused me of sexual harassment when she obviously wanted to have sex with ME!"" (Yea he REALLY said this on my FIRST day) it worried me for sure but the next few days were super crazy with the training so I kind of forgot about it. Then the next week the two of us were alone wiping tables and he started telling me how him and his wife had gone to the gym and he loved watching her bend over and seeing her thong through her leggings and licking his lips while she works out. I'm already an extremely socially awkward person so you can imagine how this made me feel. After that I was on high alert at all times around him. He one day was sitting there staring at me while I stocked drinks and then randomly said ""I just got de ja vu looking at you. You know what that means? You and I are on a good path there are good things in the future for us."" I told my friends about it and they all told me to just start ignoring him and don't even entertain conversation. I heeded there advice and ever since he is nothing but mean to me, it's only my third week and he makes me want to cry every day because he talks to me like I am as dumb as a sack of rocks. Rolling his eyes every time I ask a question and embarrassing me in front of all of my coworkers when I mess up. It's torture and I am so miserable I want to quit. Am I being too sensitive and too serious? My other female coworkers seem fine with him, one of them being young and super pretty as well she has been there a year.

Throughout high school our friendships began to dwindle. They did things and I did certain things as well that caused us to have petty little fights.

On top of that once our friendships ended I began to feel as though they were never really true friends as I looked back on the friendship. 

Now I'm in college and I feel as though I can never really get past that ""associate/cool"" level with people. Because of my experience with those three girls I feel like I can't really trust anyone. Anytime I actually begin to be really cool with someone they just do something shady and in turn it makes me not want to befriend them at all. So I just cut them off.

89,"I will try not to sound biased

I knew this girl back in high school but only remember the name, never talked. We met again in university. We started kicking it but the relationship started extremely weird for me. We had sex like twice a day for the first two weeks even though we were not together and she clearly told me she had guys she was talking to at the moment. I just let her know that I am there for her but i can't let her keep talking to those guys and me at the same time. She told me she would work on it and a month later I asked her out. This was when we were not on campus but apparently we lived 5 minutes away from each other so we were fine(winter break). A week later she asks for a break because we wouldn't be as together as before since we were home and not in each other dorms. I hated the idea but I let it slide since it's my newfound relationship ( I've been lonely for a while now ). During that break / winter break , she ended up kissing like 3 dudes and had sex with one. Plus an incident came up were she decided to go out with her friends on New Years without me because it was supposed to be an all girls thing. But she also invited a guy because he was marines. He ended up being one of the guys she kissed. I was mad because I figured the break meant we just weren't hanging around as much and maybe flirt a little at most. I forgave her once I realized she was sincerely sorry about that. We go back on campus and everything was normal again. It turns out she has depression and anxiety so i tend to do certain actions because of it like not let a fight go to far and such. So semesters over and we don't get to hang out much on account of her hanging out with friends. I explained I have no problem with her hanging with her friends and letting them sleep over her house but I would just like her to call me before she go to bed. We got into this huge argument because over it because apparently that wasn't possible. A lot more go on but I'm gonna skim just because you know , it's a lot. But she tells me that we are fighting because all we do is text and we have miscommunication through that. So I say then let's actually talk through phone by which starts another argument because we can't do that apparently. She eventually asks for another break which I immediately refuse but we argue all night till I basically say HAVE YOUR STUPID BREAK and also say we might not be together after this break and she continues even though we did have plans this week. So my question is what should I do at the point. I know she's going out because she's posting her friends on snap. I tried to apologize but she mentioned her anxiety coming on so she didn't want to talk to me anymore that night but she did say I hurt her. I feel totally justified in my actions but every time I try to explain we end up arguing. so the break is supposed to end at the end of this week and we supposed to go to a mountain trail together with a couple of my friends. How should I tackle the situation? I really don't know what to do. I do care for her , but I'm not sure how much she cares at this point.

The spring concert was also in the week that I missed. Before leaving, I discussed with her on how to makeup for my grade and she said if I helped her at this one event, it would make up most of the things I missed. I come back, only to see that she gave me two zeroes and a 50% for my concert grade. The week I was gone was excused by the school and every other teacher excused me. My friend who has her for orchestra said she always stalls on giving makeups and apparently ranted to her class about me and that she has no makeups for me to do.  She said thats what I deserve. I realize that I missed a big event. However, school ends in a week. In every other class, I have an A and I got a 4.0 last semester. I have really strict parents and they expect me to get an A.

92,"So my girlfriend of 4 years recently broke up with me and we are still living together. I'm going to a community college here in Dallas and I'm about 19 hours away from completing my associate's.  The reason I want to move is to establish some sort of space between us ( I think it would be healthy to have more space) even though we're still friends. I want her to move on, but I don't want to see it happen. I like the area and my friends and there are plenty of potential universities for me to attend here. If I moved out and stayed here, I'd probably go though with my transfer to night shift detail at Carmax. Detailers make decent money, but I'd be paying more rent to move in with a friend to stay in Texas. My other option is to move in with my mom, stepdad, and brother in Arkansas. I wouldn't have to pay rent  but I would voluntarily help out with food, bills, and my own expenses which would likely be much less than having the rent of an apartment here. Is it worth letting go of my closest friend for us both to go our separate ways?

97,"So a couple days ago i was in a bad mood, and i remembered something that my best friend may have told me during a new years party while we were drinking together.

He said one (or multiple) of his organs are failing and theres nothing can be done. He isn't expected to live to see 2018 if what i remember is true.

This is even a bigger problem than it sounds because we live about three hours away from each other, and im the only one with a way to visit. Aside from that, he proposed to a girl he only met 3 months ago, shes kind of a bitch, shes putting him through way more than i thought hed be willing to put up with. Which only makes me think hes getting married as soon as possible to cross one more thing off a mental bucket list.

I dont think he's told her yet if it is true, and if i message or call him shes most likely going to overhear or read the messages about it because she hovers like a fucking hawk.

I've only known the dude for 10 months but within that relatively short time hes been a better friend than anybody I've ever known. He's literally shown me what real strong friendship is, and im scared as hell what im remembering is true.

We both survived the same type of cancer when we were in our teens, at the same hospital (although we never met during that time), and the fact his body may be shutting down not only saddens me beyond words but also scares the shit out of me. What if mine isn't too far behind?

Anyways, i have severe social anxiety so whenever we are hanging out for a week or a few days or whatever im too scared to actually bring it up, and hes so rarely apart from his bride to be, because they're tying to plan and organize a $10g wedding for $3g in three months. 

I know people die, and i know theres nothing i can do if this id going to happen, so people waiting until the end of this to comment shit like that can just keep scrolling, im not interested. If he's going to die then I'll have to find a way to deal with it.

Im posting here because im upset, need to vent a bit, and need some help figuring out the right way to bring it up in a normal conversational way. A way he doesn't feel cornered, or that would make him feel pressured to lie just to comfort me. 

I've dealt with people im close to passing away before, but I've never actually had to confront someone about their possible death... ",25May2017,1

99,"Hey guys- this is extremely embarrassing for me, hence the throwaway.

I'll just get right to it, after high school and dropping out of my second semester of college, I was a bit lost and joined the workforce. Every place I have ever worked (on the books), I worked with food.

Through five years I went from fast food to a bakery to a diner up until I finally had what I thought was a dream job for my chosen career path, I would be working directly under a professional chef. 

The second day I was supposed to work, my apartment caught on fire, and my girlfriend and I lost 90% of our possessions. I didn't go to work that day. 

2 months later, I'm getting to really realize what the restaurant life grind is all about- and soon realized it was not for me. So- abruptly, and quite frankly extremely unprofessionally, 
I quit, right after Easter. No notice- nothing. 

So here I am, with no job, no desire to ever return to the food service industry ( with no experience in any other field) with the desire to go back to college, and with about 2 months of rent saved up.

On top of all this- I don't have my own car, although my loving girlfriend shares her car and is very supportive of my going back to school (her just having graduated).

I wanted to work in animation/illustration, but have been struggling to make it into a career. I would juggle freelance art projects with full time data entry jobs to make ends meet.

It's unlikely carpal tunnel or arthritis. I haven't been able to do any intensive art or computer-related jobs. I can't even grip things without dropping them often (yesterday it was a box of cereal that spilled everywhere).

I have some ideas of where I want to be and what I want to do but am left feeling uncertain of everything at the same time. Ironically enough, it's almost as if there is so many possibilities that I don't know where to start or what to do in order to move forward.

122,"Today when I made it into work I checked my physical mail box and found a small stack of emails someone had printed out from my direct managers work email.

This manager oversees my department directly, and though we have no cross over refuses to write pass down emails so that I can build my routine for the day and set my staff for success.

The emails they wrote are between themselves, a manager at a different location, or all of the day managers including both our bosses.

The emails are very subversive. One talks about a first job employee of mine feeling like I was ignoring their needs shortly after we hired an under preforming employee into my time slot and her department. following a line about how their was an ""undercurrent"" view that I was not being held responsible for my under performance as a manager.

A different one was to all the day managers about a reinstated policy about how I ""will rub it in there face"" if they forget.

The last one I will even partly share was to a manager at a different location about a mistake I had made. It discussed his view of how large it was, his agreement with our bosses angry reaction to it (which he did not have), and ended in an invite to the bar. I find this to be the worse kind of the emails they sent as not only is it his job as my department head to make sure I have the right training and tools not to make the kind of mistake it was, but also stunts my available growth in the company as a whole by tainting another locations department managers view of my abilities in an unfair way.

Here is what I need help with. How do I proceed from here? What do I even do with this knowledge? I don't agree with the fact that someone printed their personal emails at all, but that ship has sailed, and all I have done since moving to this management team is ask for more communication directly from the department heads and bosses who work in the day via email. 

They were the one person I felt could help me breach the communication barrier between the late managers and the opening ones. Now I find out *they* are a wall in upon themselves. They say they don't have time to type pass downs, but they are emailing pass over emails to the managers they work along side, and complaining to other locations on company time.

128,"I've been struggling with depression for a few years now, but over the past few weeks it has gotten so much worse. Every day is such a struggle, and I can no longer find those moments of clarity I once had. Every passing second is pain. The things that used to distract me no longer work, I feel like all of my friends are pulling away. I'm alone.

I tried to speak with a doctor about going on medication, but they were against my request because I was so young. I have been to see a therapist, but it hasn't helped.

I don't know what to do. Nothings working, the only time I feel at peace is when I'm sleeping. I need help. ",25May2017,1
129,"So, im 20 years old, a virgin. Only 2 months ago, i got my first peck on the lips (out of pity i think) from a very beautiful girl at a club. I am terrible with women and that day was the day my mate invited me to come and get loose a bit. I made a reddit post about that story because that night, i've crossed my moral boundaries, including flirting with women that had a relationship. This one girl was beautiful, i took her arms and placed them on my shoulders and my hands resting on her bum, after squeezing a few times, we were just playing and she jokingly said 'oh you are horrible haha' after she said she had a boyfriend. I knew i had to let her go because of that, but somehow i didn't, only a bit after did we let each other go. I felt terrible after.

Another instance was when i met a girl online who i got intimate with (a LOT) over 2 years. She then had a boyfriend. Shortly after her relationship, she did send me a picture of her breasts since our convo on snapchat got sexual. I sent something too, but nothing nude and i tried to hold myself in enough to not get nude, even though its still bad. After a while 2 more instances happened, the convo's got sexual/flirtatious and i could barely hold back since i felt frisky myself (insanely high libido) and time after time i felt VERY bad as i should, but it never escalated to nudity. I then told her that i dont want to talk to her if she had a boyfriend cause i get frisky very easily, especially with her and that i dont want to make that mistake again. But recently, we started talking again and i said something sexual again and asked if she had a picture of her with cleavage, she sent me 2 pictures (1 she had on insta and the other was just her in a dressing room but barely any cleavage). I still felt bad for making a mistake again.

Now, i feel like im a horrible person, wondering if i even deserve a relationship. Im also scared that even if i have a relationship, something similiar will happen with my girlfriend behind my back (as karma or something).

Was wondering what you guys think about it.

My life at school was very, very hard. I Was harassed a lot, and if i wasn't a coward i'd have probably killed myself by now. It left really deep psychological wounds.


I Want to study, or make a gap year, in a english-speaking country. It would be a breath of fresh air and would help me a lot on the psychological level, and let's not hide it, it looks freaking good on a resume, especially when you work in places where English is used frequently (in my case : Programming &amp; Software design)

134,"So I have some things I'd like advice on. I'm 23, study history and English at an Austrian University, and am quite addicted to social media/internet/video games, though I usually can do without at least video games for a couple of days to one week. I do have my social life in check, I have a wonderful girlfriend (even though I'm a bit under her thumb) and get along really well with my sister, mother, girlfriend's mother and most of my maternal side of the family. I'm doing somewhat well at University, I'm not an ace student but I'm not the loser of the year either. 
Now, for my problems on which I'd like advice:
&lt;Br&gt; 
*My father and stepmother​ both think I study English and history to become a teacher. But I'm not. I give supplementary lessons since I don't have a regular job and, hey, the pay is not bad, 15€ an hour for up to 6 hours a week with the different pupils. And I learned two things about myself - I'm shit at explaining things to more than one person and I hate, HATE kids. Teens are okay, but kids... Anyhow, I need advice on how to tell my dad and stepmother who both help me stay afloat financially, put a lot of faith in / have very high expectations of me and who I've basically been lying to for almost two years that I won't become a teacher. I'm scared shitless of their reaction and I really don't know how to tell them - especially since they're convinced that I'll never find a good job with what is basically two almost worthless degrees here I'm Austria. 
&lt;Br&gt;
**Another thing I'd need advice on is getting my ass out of bed and get shit done, especially getting into shape. I'm 191cm tall and weigh roughly 107 kg, so I'm pretty overweight. I'm starting to feel a bit uncomfortable by now, but I love, love eating, never managed to stick to a diet cause I'm undisciplined and whenever I try to put myself on one I get no support from my family. I also don't have enough money to go out shopping everyday and shop for healthy stuff like good fruit and veggies cause it's bloody expensive. The other part of my weight problem is that I loathe sports. I've tried the gym with buddies, bicycling, jogging, skating, swimming, judo, kickboxing, hiphop dancing when I was a kid and recently medieval fencing but all it ever did was cause my body to ache, me being tired and hit by a wave of insatiable appetite and feeling generally miserable. I've never felt happy or proud after any kind of spoet, I just felt like shit. So I'd like some advice on that. 
&lt;Br&gt;
**And lastly, how can I focus on studying for prolonged periods of time without feeling as if my head will explode or as if I'm ready to burst into tears cause of the futility of my spent time? Currently I'm studying Latin for an exam in two weeks and I'm feeling as if I'm gonna throw in the towels by just looking at the conjugations of the verbs. I'm extremely thankful for you reading this wall of text and providing me with advice!",25May2017,4
136,"Well, fuck.

About a year ago while editing a video on my dads computer and surfing the web a bit I saw searches for sex stories based around underage girls. It took me a while but I eventually shrugged off because he's not acting it out at all and it's just stories, not actual child porn or anything. 

Anyway, now I'm logging into my gmail to print some stuff off his computer (mine isn't connected) and without even needing to snoop, the search bar is filled with incest stories of the dad/daughter kind. I didn't open any, but they all come from the same site and are in the ""most used"" section of the search bar. 

I'm 20 and male, I have a twin sister of the same age and we both live at home with him and my mum. I've never noticed anything weird, but the fact that it's sex stories and not porn makes me think he's imagining things or something. 

I don't know what to do, I can't look at my dad the same anymore. I definitely wouldn't confront him about it because it's his life, but I'm struggling to get over the thought of him possibly thinking about my sister. Anyone got advice on how I deal with/get over this moving forward?",25May2017,54

I just feel lost. I've changed my major a dozen times over the last few years and nothing I haven't felt passionate about anything I've chosen. I've chosen them based on potential salary, work environment, work-life balance, availability of jobs, etc. The problem is, I don't really have any obvious talent or skill in anything.

149,"So a little back story. My father was married twice before he met my mother and he has 6 children from those marriages. He and my Mom have been married for over 35 years and he doesn't really have much contact with the male children from the earlier families.

When I was 12 I met his oldest son, G Jr. It was a novelty to find out that I wasn't really an only child and that I had a whole mess of other brothers and sisters. Gene Jr. was in his 30's at the time and married with a step daughter. I would babysit for him on occasion. One night I was over watching his step daughter I witnessed him beating his wife. I told my father about it and I never babysat for them again and I never had any further contact.

When I was 25 my father's youngest son contacted me on Facebook. I had heard stories from my parents about him stealing from them early in their marriage and them having to bail him out of jail on occasion. I didn't exactly have the highest opinion of him. I went on to meet him and I found his hatred of our father unhealthy and ended that contact.

Cut to this last Saturday. I receive a Facebook message from the youngest son ""can you please tell your dad that his first son will not make it to the weekend. He's in the hospital in ICU dying from cirrhosis of the liver period not like he gives a shit but I just felt like he should know."" He then followed up with a picture of G Jr. in a hospital bed hooked up to machines.
I passed this info on to my Mom as my father is in his late 70's and not in the best physical/mental health.

I have been fairly numb since I heard the news and been updated on his deteriorating condition and DNR order. I don't know how I should feel. I feel sad for my father for having lost the connection with his children. I feel sad for G Jr.'s family and friends. I just don't particularly feel anything about the fact that he is dying.
I know this situation is far from normal but do you think my lack of feeling is normal?

Sorry for the ramble.

151,"So I'll give you a bit of back story behind this. At christmas time I broke up with my gf, it was a messy breakup and I'm still feeling the aftermath of it to this day. She's made a bunch of bogus rape accusations about when we had sex during our relationship, never referring to a single time but just saying it in general. She's gone and told her friends this who've told their friends who've told their friends and at this point anyone in my school year who hasn't talked to me in my town hates me. Anyways so back to what's happened today.


Just finished my GCSE Maths exam today and came out of school, I decided to go to the local library to study with friends for the rest of my exams and when we arrive there's a group of girls at the bottom of the steps outside. 

I instantly recognise them as the close friends of my ex, and so I ignore them and we walk one way and they walk another way. Then suddenly one runs up behind me and starts pushing me over and over saying 'rapist rapist haven't you got anything to say to me?' and then starts trying to square up to me. I know she's not worth the trouble of hitting, I don't need a confrontation they're not my thing so I carry on walking up the stairs. 

Then my mates start shouting 'eurgh what a weirdo' and start laughing but when we reach the top of the steps we see some people who go to my exes school. They try acting all tough and start talking like they're from Hackney or Britxton when they're literally from one of the poshest towns in England it's almost embarrassing. 

They form a line and block the steps, there's bout 20 of them and I have 4 mates with me, turns out they know of me through my ex and they start pushing and shoving my friends look my for a fight. We decide to just leave, just straight up go and get food instead since we can do revision later and these guys weren't worth our time, so we start walking back down the stairs. 

Then we realise the group of girls plus about 7-8 guys with them are now following us, they carry on with this for about a kilometre down the road until we get to the train station to go home. All the while they were just trying to insult us and act all tough in front of the girls and trying to get my friend to fight them. 

This might seem small and minor to people, but for me just experiencing that I just don't like having to go through that anytime I go to the shops or the library in town, I can't go out with my
family anymore in case someone sees me. Is there anything I can do about this? I feel so powerless and I don't see people forgetting about it anytime soon, my ex keeps it going when it should have died down because she's very attention seeking and it gets her a lot of attention from people, especially guys which she loves more than anything.

They knew where we were going, so I'm not sure why they were so upset. Then, half an hour later, they're blowing up our phones yelling at us to come back and it's too late and she's still a minor, blah blah blah. She told them ""you knew we were going out, so why didn't you say no when we asked?"" 

So we get to the house and I wait in my car and they're screaming at each other on the porch and then her dad walks up to my car and tells me to get out, so I do, and I wait at the porch while they all scream at each other. 

Then, her mom yells, ""LEAVE THIS HOUSE!"" So my friend walks to my car and her mom says ""no, you go that way, and you go to your car. If she even touches your car, I'll call the police on you for harboring a minor."" So we go in separate directions and her parents are yelling at me while I go to the car, ""where are you taking my daughter?"" And I said ""nowhere, I obviously don't want to go to jail"" and I leave. 

Then, the whole night, her parents are blowing up my phone and her phone and calling my mom and yelling at me for going to my boyfriends house and stuff. All the while, my friend isn't with me, so they start insisting that I'm a bad friend and that she CHOSE to leave. 

So she sneaks back into the house later that night. She was safe the whole time and refused to tell me where she wandered off to. She wouldn't tell her boyfriend either. 

This happens regularly. A month or so ago she calls me sobbing at 3 in the morning saying her parents kicked her out because they got into a fight, so my boyfriend had me bring her back to his house since I was spending the night with him. They kicked their sons out multiple times as well. It's literally their version of grounding them as a punishment. 

They get drunk, pick a fight over guys or her school or something small. She's a good kid with a good head on her shoulders. She's smarter than I am. When I go to parties and call her plastered she gets upset that I got drunk even though I said I wouldn't. She keeps me in line with my school and is graduating a year early. She works her ass off. 

They make her walk home at 11 at night from her job even though it's a 2 minute drive from the house so they can drink. They drink EVERY night. I'm not sure what to do. Should I call the police? Should I just let her stay with me as much as possible until she can move out? I have no clue WHAT to do in this situation. She doesn't turn 18 for another year. I could really use advice from an unbiased source, because everyone close to us is just telling us to yell at her parents, which won't help anything. What should I do? Anything?

168,"Hello

A week ago I was thinking if I should drop out of university due to my mental health, but decided not to and to finish my studies (I only have exams this year and the whole of next year left). However, now there's another question - what should I do throughout the summer? I was considering dropping out of  university because of my poor mental health condition - I'm quite depressed, unmotivated and overall unhappy (it's been better recently though at least). However, as I myself am not working during my studies, and my parents are paying for my rent here, it would only be fair if I dedicated my summer to work and earn at least a little bit of money. I applied for many, many internships but sadly didn't get a single one, so I would be working as a cashier or something of that sort. I am studying abroad so I would be pretty much completely alone during the holiday, apart from going to work. Over my life I have been completely by myself for a month twice (I stayed in my dorms throughout the winter holidays) and it was just horrific. My mental health got completely destroyed and I was in a very bad place at that time. Apart from being alone, I really hate the house I am currently at - it's an incredibly old house, it's full of mold, the bathroom looks like it's been used by druggies or something crazy like that (there's bugs and other crazy disgusting stuff in the bathroom too), and I would be living in this house alone, so that's also super scary as the house was robbed once in the past, so I guess this isn't the safest neighborhood to live in alone. 

If I could decide what to do during the summer without any external factors, I would dedicate my summer to rest - no work, no volunteering, just read book and work out, maybe improve a skill or two (I have recently taken up drawing). I think this would be great for my mental health as the last year of uni will be by far the hardest, and I'm not in a very good place right now, and working for 2-3 months could make me go completely crazy (I'm pretty sure I could get super depressed during those couple of months). However, I don't want to disappoint my parents and stuff, so it's a hard decision to make.

What do you think?

**TLDR**: I have poor mental health during my studies and my parents are paying for my rent so I should make it up for them by working during the summer. However, knowing my trends it's very possible I will become even more depressed. Not sure what to do",25May2017,3

This I feel makes my interviews a lot better and easier but Im so so ashamed of this special treatment. Ashamed that no one else at the paper needs it.

Boss doesn't seem to mind but I can't let it go. He's said many times that they want me to stay long term and write their toughest pieces but this seems ludicrous? I just don't know how to move foward.

175,"Right of the bat, let me just say Im 16. This is supposed to be the age i have doubts. I know. I know. But still. This is a time when choices i make are going to have some long term effects. I need to know why i feel like shit so much.


Maybe this is a common thing. I hope it is. I like reading books. And i used to play a lot of games but who did not when you were my age. I liked physics, it was interesting and sometimes it catches my attention. I like it sometimes and when i do, it's exciting. I like computers the same was as well. But, the thing is, I have this incessant fear of fading away unknown dying as someone who couldn't accomplish great things, who couldn't accomplish anything notable. it's not fame I'm thinking of. It's the feeling that i need to go down in history remembered as someone who accomplished something great, who could not be challenged on the fact that he had accomplished something great. Something important. Something big. When i think of  physics, i suddenly freeze up sometimes as i imagine fading away in history as someone insignificant, who spent the entirety of his life, chasing empty air, and died fruitless. I  wanted to write as kid. And i have some game ideas i really want to see come int the world. But again, it s not IMPORTANT. Physics feels like something important. But then i feel scared that i'll become insignificant. And there are times where i want to be a developer but  i feel scared of spending my life doing something UNIMPORTANT. Its not me thinking i'm amazing or something, its me feeling this need, to do something important. I dont know what it is. But its not arrogance. 

I cant get rdi of this feeling. It leaves me despairing and unmotivated. 
Theres a chance ill die miserable, and broken and unknown. I know. 

Im confused. I knew what i was talking about, but i feel fine now, and i cant recall it. The feeling. I thits me occasionally and only for a few minutes. My head clears and im fine.

Regardless, Do any of you know what im talking about? I hate it. I dont know. There are times when i feel so confident in what i want to pursue, and other dies when i start doubting internally and even worse days, when i have no clue what's going in my head at all.",25May2017,1
181,"So I'm in my second year of high school and am in the best school in my area apparently. Only TODAY this is what happened.

 Several incidents of students getting into fights across different grade levels.

 One class just completely ignored their teacher and had what can only be described as a riot. They turned of the projecter, broke the markers, started shouting and flung tables across the room.

 In MY class the teacher handed out a project for our exam and no one did it.

 No one did anything for the last three classes.

 They attempted to write on the board with the projecter, pen can't be rubbed off it 

 Verbal abuse everywhere.

 Before the teacher arrived students got marker wrote several insults on the board and drew penises on the projector. They continued to act buddy buddy with the teacher when she arrived and faked surprise when she noticed.

 Everyone always keeps interrupting the class.

182,"Located in ND, USA.

I'm going to try and summarize this as best I can, because my brother's life is a hell of a mess.
Basically, my bro has been with his gf for like 8 years, and they have 4 kids, ranging from newborn (literally born last week) to 6. None of them have been to preschool or any sort of daycare in their lives, and my bro and his gf are constantly between jobs because of one reason or another and also between housing. Luckily, they own an RV they bought off some guy forever ago when it was just the two of them, so they do technically have shelter and water access, and they get food stamps, social security and such.

To summarize the gf, she was raised on a reservation with parents who really didn't give a flying f about anything, as her mom had about a dozen kids. I don't know the exact number, but she's the eldest daughter. She didn't even finish middle school, and she is one of the least intelligent people that I know, so homeschooling isn't even an option. 

This came up just recently, as my mother and I have been telling them that the two oldest girls need to get enrolled in school. Well...she refuses to put them in school, will make excuses to us like 'the paperwork has to be finalized' or some equally shabby reason. Well, we thought we could just say f it and enroll them ourselves with my bro, but...he's not listed as their father. This portion of their birth certificate is left blank, and they have her last name. 

She frequently holds the kids over his head as leverage, when he honestly tries his very beat all of the time, and does 10x more work with the kids, plays with them, feeds them, makes sure they have clean clothes, etc. She is a slug. There was even a time she was doing meth between kids, and she smoked during her last pregnancy, so I can only imagine how the new baby will turn out. 

My mother and I try to help out where we can, but we're both in apartments at the moment, and while I am moving into a house at the beginning of July, I just...I know my boyfriend and I could not take in 4 kids, even if it were an option. The issue we're having, and that we debate constantly, is reporting them to child services. Because if their kids did get taken away, they would likely end up with this chick's scuzzy drunk of a mother on the rez, and have less of a life than they deserve. And my brother loves them, and I'd feel like shit, but maybe they'd be better in foster care. 

This girl was just pulled over and put in jail a day ago, and my mom took off so she could watch the baby, and my bf and I took the two oldest (the middle son is mega attached to my bro) so he could scrounge up some funds to bail her out. (It was for like not showing up to court or some shit, nothing super serious.) 

I have never been more tempted to contact chil services, though. She's out today so my brother will have what little help she gives, but my biggest issue is them going to school come fall. If she's not going to put the two oldest into school, then they could stay at our new house and take the bus. I'd be willing to become a legal guardian, if I had to, I just...can't just yet. But I don't know how to do it without them ending up in some shit situation with their maternal grandmother.

Tl;Dr My bro's gf is shitty, her parents are shitty, and I wanna call child services but I'm afraid they'll end up with their shitty maternal grandmother in a shitty life because my bro wasn't put on their birth certificates, so it looks like we're not even related legally.

187,"Hey guys need some advice. So I go to a small college and my family has bought a house with another family 50/50. The idea being we sell the house for a profit to help pay for our student loans when we complete the program. 

Its a three bedroom and I share the house with the other family's child. We had a spare room. The other family had put in a renter who is a bit older than me. The renter unknowing to me and my family at the time smokes weed everyday. He brought that habit in the home. He is also bipolar and often snaps or makes snappy remarks which makes him hard to approach.

Now I tried laying ground rules stating no drugs or smoking in the house. The problem is the other familys child (who is also part owner) often partakes in these same activities. This makes the rules extremely difficult to follow as one owner is saying one thing, and the other is doing the opposite.

The environment started to turn on me, and the two individuals starting treating me with some disrespect, because I tried laying strict rules in the house. This in turn with the pressures of school gave me alot of anxiety and depression. I found my home environment to be very chaotic. The semester for me was a very very difficult time in my life.  

I had a couple weeks off and I approached the other family about the situation. They told me to talk to there son. They said lay some ground rules, both of us have to be strict. The problem is the other son smokes along with the renter. Being younger he is very easily influenced. I tried telling the other family, but they did not want to here it. They brushed it off. They think I'm over reacting and If I just tell there son, everything will change. But this did not work in the past. I do not want a repeat of last semester. 

I tried evicting the tenant, but the problem was I never knew of his habits until after he had moved in and signed his agreement to rent. I even discussed the possibility of evicting with the other owners son, and he ended up telling the renter. That made situations a lot worse in the house for me. Right now I cant evict him, and even if I do he has 3 months before he has to leave. I only have 3 more months of my program left. 

Before I left for break I got a realtor to appraise the house and where it stands both our family's can pay off our loans for school. Meaning I can leave school debt free. That said I dont know what to do for the remaining three months. Living in that house was pure hell for me, and I was so depressed I even thought about suicide. It was a really scary time for me and I dont want to relive it. I found a 2 bedroom home for rent that I am thinking I can just move into for my last three months. From there I can sell the home and make my profit. With the extra bedroom, I have room for my family. In fact they all have there flights booked and are ready to stay with me for at least a month. 

At the end of the day however I feel as though that creep of a renter has won, and that he has taken full advantage of me. That said I dont know what else to do. Everyone keeps calling me strange for moving out of my own house and renting another but im so lost as to what to do. If I could, I would never have purchased a home with another family period. I really do need some advice on this situation. To this day its gives me anxiety and depression. ",25May2017,1

190,"I (32m) have been sleeping with a girl (33f) for almost a year now, on and off. We are good friends, but she has always had stronger feelings for me than I her. I had told her from the beginning I didn't want a relationship and it got to the point I told her I didn't want to be with her. She is a great girl, super nice, sexy, and fun to be around, but I have always had this feeling like something was missing. I am a fairly open book, but she has been holding back a bit because of fear that I would leave...can't blame her.  
We haven't been using condoms for a long time because she was on the pill. Wellllll we just found out she's pregnant (100% not intentional and 100% mine). She came over super upset and terrified. She didn't know how I would react and said she is not ready. I was calm and comforting. I made it clear that it wasn't really my choice but I would support her in whatever she chooses. No way I would let her raise the baby alone and if she, you know, chooses door #2, I would be there holding her hand. We talked but it seems she is very unsure, mostly because she knows I don't love her like she loves me, so she also putting the decision in my hands as well.  
I am really struggling with what would be best. Neither of us have religious or political beliefs, but do believe she has a right to make a decision. I work in tech, make a lot of money and she has a great job as well...so all I am worried about is us and being happy and bringing a child into the world with love.  
Sorry for the long winded explanation, but I guess I'm not only venting but want to know what peoples' opinion, thought, wisdom and even stupidity is. Ultimately, I know whatever we choose is the right decision, but just struggling...big time.

I met girl B a couple of weeks ago at work. We also quickly became good friends, and she developed a crush on me, which I tried to ignore.

Looking back I was obviously overthinking every little detail, and thats probably what put me in this situation. Our #1 streak ended because she snapped another guy more than me, I asked her to the movies twice and she just ignored it like I didn't say anything, and she replied to me less and less. This hurt me, because she was my favorite person to talk to. This is when I made the mistake of going on a date with girl B.

Me and girl b have been on a couple of dates other the last few weeks, and we've made out like a lot, which was fun, but it never felt right. I couldn't stop thinking about girl A. 

Well, girl A's friend saw a pic of us together, and she started basically interrogating me, saying stuff  like ""oh so I see you've moved on from girl A"". I'm sure she told girl A, because all of the sudden shes snapping me like crazy again, and she even asked me to hang out later this week. I obviously said yes, not even thinking about girl B.

I talk to girl B, and this is where I'm starting to feel in over my head. Girl B is coming on really strong, wanting to do things that I'm honestly not comfortable with. I just found out that she thinks we're boyfriend girlfriend, which I do not agree with. She's told her parents and everything. 

I've never even really talked to girls before this, so this is all new to me, and it feels like everything's happening so fast.

He is an extroverted, handsome guy who can be rather emotional at times. Then there is my other friend (14m)who is in my form and classes too. He is a sometimes cold and sad person but he shares a lot in common with her and often talks to herand is very good at maths too. Then to add to that there is also another Spanish kid who likes to flirt with her and talks to her a lot online. He is a really good looking guy with a six pack (according to his social media) and who has long hair and a handsome face. And lastly there is also her crush (who I don't know if they exist or not) who is a 17 year old American guy.

She keeps calling me 'such a gentleman' whenever I hold open a door for her or other people although I'm not entirely sure what she means by this. I think it was just meant as a compliment although she says it really quietly that I only just hear it and the other day I overheard her friends teasing her about it.

Sorry for the rant guys and girls. I know I don't stand a chance but I guess there is that hopeful part of me still so thanks if you read all of this.

231,"I started making myself sick when I was fifteen, managed to stop a year and a half later due to counselling but carried on binging. Finally managed to get back to healthy eating a year later but started making myself sick again when I was 19. Stopped one year later as was travelling. Started again when I was 23, 25 now. Each relapse ends up with the binge/purging episodes getting worse and worse. Won't go into too much detail but let's just say it's pretty grim and I can easily spend 20-50 pounds a day on binge food that I then throw up. The worst thing is it's become an emotional crutch. I eat my emotions. My body is tired. This awful habit is ruining my life. Intuitive eating feels amazing to me but my emotions get in the way.

232,"Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old college student home from college. I am an only child, and because of that, my mom was very overbearing growing up. She had me later in life at 42 and has always been very intense parenting wise. She is also intensely religious and conservative, while I am not. Due to this, we fight a lot. When I went to college, I discovered independence which I never really had, as I was always under their eyes (they let me go out and stuff, but were very overbearing sometimes when I was a younger teen). I love her, but I think she can be very superficial and have a holier-than-thou attitude where she thinks she's morally superior than everyone around her

I got back home from college 3 weeks ago and naturally, have been spending a lot of time with my friends, who I hadn't seen in a while. Now we're on vacation, and I'm absolutely losing my mind. We've fought literally every day, and I can't seem to find what I do wrong. She thinks I'm selfish and ungrateful, and lazy and tells it to my face. She says I'm lazy because I am messy (which I admit, but my mess is very minor, often a closet door open or t shirt on the floor). She thinks I'm selfish because I only care about myself, which is a complete lie. When she asks me to do something I do it. She says I don't care about the rest of her side of the family, yet I love them very much but don't feel very close to them because I didn't grow up around them and have only lived in the same country as them for 6ish years, and spanish wasn't my first language (it was theirs). She also says that since I've gotten home, I'm like a stranger. This is because I haven't spent much time with her, but only because every time we do spend time together (like on this vacation, haha) we end up fighting over one thing or other, so I'd rather salvage our relationship and stay somewhat distant. I am also not the most expressive person, neither with friends nor family. I tend to be pretty emotionless, and since I grew up being around just my parents 24/7, I spend a lot of time with my friends rather than with them.

I feel like she makes every problem about her, and tries to find things that I do wrong to just call me out on them. I love her, but I can't continue on like this. We just had a massive fight and if this continues, I fear our relationship will deteriorate to the point where we won't talk. I already bite my tongue at least once every time we talk, just because I don't want to start a fight, yet it starts regardless. I am losing my mind. I know obviously I can improve on some things (messiness, maybe trying to be more expressive), but I am not going to be someone I'm not just to give her some sense of satisfaction that she raised the 'perfect' son.

The two people ahead of were hired after answering just basic questions about themselves. My son's turn came and the manager or hiring manager I assume told him ""Sorry bud we just filled our last spot, check back again in a few months."" He left the store.

After this, there were two people behind him. This manager interviewed them and hired them.

So basically my son got told a lie about ""no more positions"" refused to interview him and then hired two more after he left.

This place is an Equal Opportunity Employer, however the only people who work there are women, the 4 they hired today were women. They turned down my son and another guy.

240,"Hello reddit.
Long post coming ahead.

I started hanging out with two of my classmates 2 years back, and we became very good friends, but last year, one of my friends, lets call him Z, started talking to this other kid in our class, lets call him T, with whom he didn't interact much before. Suddenly, they become best friends and so he joined our group as well. Then another kid, let's call him M, also started to budge in our group although we didn't even talk to him a lot, and he became best friends with Z as well over their mutual love of Dota.

Now this all happened in the course of three months, and me and my best friend, hung out with them because we had no one else to be with. And I've become really, really pissed at these guys, especially T and M, and Z as well since he has become really distant with me and my best friend, ever since those two joined our group. Now the problem is that these guys are assholes, and behave like they're the smartest people on earth, frequently going into discussions regarding space and time etc.
I don't have an interest in these topics that much, because I'm more into history and politics, but I tried to start conversations with them regarding these topics, like friends do, but they just shoot me down and say that I'm dumb and don't know shit. I'm also average in my studies, so whenever I asked them questions regarding a topic or subject, they'd just tell me to shut up and start making fun of me and not give a crap as to my feelings. They'd also start making fun of me for no fucking reason, and I just played it off at first, but soon I got angry and told them I didn't like it, but they'd all say that I'm not their friend since I can't take their jokes, and If I ever say something in my defence they say the same thing. They also shoot down my opinions on different things, and whenever I try to say something in a conversation, they just make fun of it and don't pay any heed to it, and they just don't seem to give a fuck about me. I just look like that awkward guy while I'm with them.

I tried to bare it for a while, but soon it just got really bad. I used to have good self-esteem before and was decently confident, but their constant asshole-iness (can't come up with a proper term) has made my self-esteem low, and I also don't speak up in a conversation or express my opinions anymore because of it, and I suffered through some depression a while back because of it. My best friend has also seen the same things, and he too has really gotten pissed of at them, but since we have no one else to be with, we just 'be' with them.
I've started to work on my shattered self-esteem and confidence, to bring it back to my previous level, but I really want to stop being friends with them, but since I'm still in class with them, it's gonna be hard to tell them why I don't talk with them anymore. 

So I need some advice as to wether I should stop hanging out with them, or should talk to them about this. I still have many other good friends, and I hang out with them, but I wanna know If I should cut these people out of my life?

241,"Hi all, I'll try to be brief. 

I went for dinner tonight with my wife and some friends, and one of those friends drank quite a few pints. At the end of the meal, he seemed to ""turn"" as though he was unwell, make an excuse and drove home. So fast, in fact, that he'd left the car park before I'd even strapped my son into the car to go home myself.

A Police car was at the nearby petrol station where my other friend (who gave me a lift there), stopped to re-fuel.
I flagged the officer over and said that I thought my friend was drunk or in some way unfit to drive. Whilst he may be a friend, killing someone because he's too stupid to not drive when he isn't fit to do so, isn't something I want on my conscience. 

The officer asked me for ID, asked if I was known to the police. Several times asked me ""What's gone on?"" to find out why I was reporting him since if he's a friend. Persistently asked why I was reporting him, and if we'd fallen out - such as my reporting him was an act of revenge, and thinking my story would change if he 

The officer then told me, that if his driving is fine, but they pull him over based on my report - then they would tell him that I reported him. 

My worry is, that I *am* known to the police, but only for good reasons. I've made several job applications, one of which was successful, but I failed the medical, the other I'm interviewing for on Saturday. Does anyone know if this would go against me at all? Whether this will affect my interview on Saturday? Or lastly, whether it's worth complaining in some way about the way in which the officer spoke to me?",25May2017,3

255,"Every single person I've ever been able to get close to were... well... pretty fucking psycho.

And I wouldn't have it any other way.

I just can NOT bond with ""normal"" people. I can't. If I even start to, I feel this intense need to distance myself from them and the friendship/possible relationship fizzles.

But with crazies? I'm all in. People who are unabashedly themselves, no fear of judgement from society, wild and dangerous and weird and twisted and dark. Psychopaths, sociopaths, omg I'm SO drawn to them. People with mental illnesses, I attract like a magnet and am equally attracted to them. They give my life color and meaning.

I don't know why I'm like this... I myself am as normal as can be (I think...). I had a very happy, stable childhood and my parents actually raised me to fear and stay away from people who were different. I have no clue how I ended up being so drawn to them. I'm my parents' worst nightmare. I have to lie to them because they tell me to stay away from certain people who they know aren't right in the head and I say I do because I don't want them worrying about me but I don't. I don't want to stay away from them, I want them in my life. 

I broke up with my ex because he went manic and I figured I needed to protect myself and honor my parents. But I miss him daily. I don't want to end up with some normal sane guy, I really truly don't. The thought pisses me off, actually. 

I need to be with people who are broken. It's a requirement for me. If I find out that a guy has had a good childhood and a loving family, I don't want him. He becomes virtually undatable to me with the attractiveness level of a piece of paper no matter how attractive he truly is. My first ex was a child abuse sufferer and nearly died (drowned) at hands of his own mother. My second ex had a decent family but was torturously bullied and outcasted throughout all of his school years. My latest ex was continuously molested and raped by family members as a child and abandoned by his parents.

Not sure why I'm like this and I know it's far from healthy especially since I was badly influenced by some of their behaviors. Any one else like this? Am I secretly crazy?

257,"Mid thirties, I have nothing to complain about, which makes this all the more frustrating.  If someone else took a look at my life, they would say I have it pretty good.  So I feel guilty/stupid even posting this.  

I have a girlfriend of many years, we own a home together.  She wants to get married next year.  I guess I'm on board with it.  We both have good jobs ( we both work second shift).  I work from home.

Every day feels like Groundhog day.  I just seem less and less interested in ... well, everything.  Nothing excites me anymore, and hasn't for a while.  I feel like I'm just treading water.  I exercise, eat right, take vitamins.  But all I want to do is just lay in bed.  I am utterly bored with the internet and television.  Not trying to sound elitist or anything (if that's even the right word) but it just seems like everything is garbage.  Nothing appeals to me anymore.

I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.  I'm taking all next week off work, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself.  My girlfriend told me I could take a couple of days and go somewhere if I want to get away for a while, but I don't know where to go.  And I don't have much drive to go anywhere.

268,"It hard to judge one's own face, and we often perceive ourselves in ways that other people just aren't seeing (whether we overestimate ourselves, or underestimate). And when others aren't telling you anything (no ""you're ugly!"" But not being told you're attractive either). 

**My situation below - which will probably help because of context, but it's long, so feel free to post based on the title and what you just read (or just scroll right down to the tl;dr)**

I almost *never* hear anything about my appearance. Ever. I do have one female friend who claims I am attractive - she calls me ""stunning"", ""beautiful"", and gets annoyed if insist otherwise (such as saying ""yeah, you're just so ugly with your petite body and innocent baby eyes) etc. It makes me embarrassed when she insists so in public, as i always imagine that others around cringe because I feel I'm obviously am not ""stunning"". And I think that's just something girlfriends say to each other regardless. My other female friend claims I'm pretty, and when I asked her what makes me pretty - she said that I ""just am"" and that she's a bit jealous of me. A couple of my guy friends have also said I'm not ugly or plain like I feel I am. But then again , these are isolated cases that I find hard to believe. 

On one hand I wonder if maybe I am attractive - but then on the other hand, there's the fact that I have never, ever had an attractive guy show interest in me or ask me out. The only guys that ask me out are ones that befriend me and seem okay at first (albeit unusual), then develop feelings for me and ask me out. But most of them turn out to be complete losers/weirdos, and they are all quite unattractive. This suggests that I'm in their league, aside from that I know I am not a creep or weirdo - but I'm 'different' (I'm a girl that loves computers and science, sci-fi, and philosophy - yeah, not popular with the young crowd haha). All of them have said they find me ""really pretty"" or ""beautiful"" ,  but I think that's only because of the fact that they have feelings for me, which make them see me in such a way. 

As for girls.. well, they don't usually like me. They either ignore me, or give me nasty and loathsome looks. I also notice the two extremes of either avoiding any possible we contact with me including if they are saying something directly to me, or just staring at me or looking over at me constantly, always expressionless. 

I'm not really sure what to make of everything, because usually I never, ever get compliments. It's only once in a blue moon I will hear anything about my appearance. And the fact that when I look in the mirror I see a girl that is a notch below average(not even just average), and nowhere near ""pretty"" - says something. 

So, are there any pretty good indications for whether a person is attractive, average, or unattractive? 

**td;dr:** What are some pretty good indications that a person is attractive, average, or ugly? For example, perhaps something to do with how others treat you in certain situations. Anything, really, aside from straight up asking people (but it's no secret that that would come off as incredibly desperate and awkward). ",25May2017,3
