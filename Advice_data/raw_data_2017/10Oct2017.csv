1,"So, I have this bad habit of disliking people instantly.

A lot of the times I like most people after I get to know them, but that usually takes a lot of work on my part to let those people in enough to get to know them.

I would like to switch that around, so I like everybody at first, and choose to dislike from there if needed. lol",10Oct2017,1

3,"So! Here’s my fucking story.

I was at Walmart and I was contemplating getting this stupid light thing, and I went through self check out with a combined cart of groceries with a friend. We took two different check out machines and the same cart. I was still contemplating at self check out and got lost in conversation and COMPLETELY FUCKING FORGOT ABOUT THE LIGHT. 

I finished it and we went on our merry way and then we get stopped by a secret shopper and she was like, “lEt Me SEe yOuR reCeIPt FoR tHe LiGhT” and I literally said, “I am so sorry, I completely forgot. I didn’t even realize, I’m more than happy to pay for this, I’m so sorry, this wasn’t on purpose, it was a complete accident.” Nah, she was like you covered it and touched it, you need to come with me and basically told me I’m a shoplifter and the cops showed up and saw the whole cart of groceries I bought and then aside they saw the $12 light they accused me of stealing and I guess they also found a $1.40 drink mixer water packets that didn’t get scanned and so it looked like I was thieving Walmart.

So now I have a citation and have to show up in court and lemme tell ya, I don’t have any fucking money to pay the ticket. It was a complete accident and I know there’s nothing I can tell them that I haven’t already to convince them it was an innocent mistake, so I’m kinda just gonna bite the bullet and go pay my dues for my accidental mistake.

This is my first ANYTHING! I was in tears. I’m a pussy, dude. I didn’t know what to do and I was terrified.... I’ve never gotten anything more than a parking ticket on campus that was more than $21 and even those scare me. 

I’m a full time student athlete with an on campus job that pays me no more than $20 at most every 2 weeks... and I’m not sure what I can do to roughly make $200 by November 1st, but if anyone has ANY IDEA, or if someone has been in my position where they needed money right away, please help! 

There’s not a lot I won’t do for money.... so please, any suggestions.... ",10Oct2017,1
6,"So I've been dating a girl for 4 years now. She is my first girlfriend and only girlfriend I've ever had. I met her through a mutual friend at a Halloween party. Eventually she and our mutual friends became enemies. In turn, I haven't spoken to my friends just as she hasn't. Which really isn't a big deal. I was trying to focus on getting my degree and creating a life for her and myself. However, for the past 2 years she has been trying to get pregnant. Personally I want to wait at least another year before we conceive for the sake of stability. So every time I pull out or insist on wearing a condom. The main problem is that if I don't impregnate her she gets her period and when she gets her period she turns into some one else. Someone I am afraid of. She treats me very poorly, beats me, abuses me, spends my money without my awareness, and worst of all manipulates me into thinking I'm worthless. Every month for the past two years I've been feeling like I'm stuck with someone who is going to leave me for someone else after bearing my child, taking my child support and feeding terrible habits. A week ago she got arrested for possession of marijuana and I paid a part of her fee but still owe about $1,000 more. She does not work and says that she wants to be a stay at home mom. This is extremely difficult for me because my job does not pay enough to support her needs and my own. I tried leaving her multiple times because clearly this is a toxic relationship but she keeps finding her way back in. The first time I broke up with her she made out with one of my friends. The second time I broke up with her she bashed in my car windows. The third time I broke up with her she pointed a gun at me and threatened to shoot. I broke down crying and begged for mercy. I'm at a point where I feel like I am her bitch. I literally fear for my life and don't know what to do. 

TL:DR I'm dating a psycho and don't know how to get her out of my life. ",10Oct2017,1
7,"So I'm a first year on the team, we're a D1 school, we're currently 5 - 0 and it feels great to be associated with success. I'm a 3rd string (maybe even fourth?) I've played Football for one year before this, I was recruited just for my strength and size. I'm awful technique-wise, and I doubt I'll see the field until my 3rd year. So here are my pros and my cons:


Pros: I get the swag, might start the 2nd year, 100% will start 3rd, I won't let my parents/teammates down, won't lose friendships, keeps my mind busy and out of bad things, good workouts, decent meal plan, and that's really it.


Cons: Knee injury is only going to get worse, I'm tired of being 270 +, I'd like to slim down but can't, no time for partying/other hobbies, constant stress with fucking up, 12hour days 630am - 7 pm, I have to drive 30 minutes there, stress with school, classes are only going to get harder, frowned upon from current teammates/family/old teammates, that's it.

8,"My friend has dreamed of flying since she was very smol and we have had many conversations about how meaningful it is to her.

9,"A while back (2 years, per-say?) I had a friend in this group, which I'll call the MT, who I'd gotten to know very well. We were best friends, but summer of 2016 came around and there was a huge falling out in our friend group.

Basically, in our iMessage group was complaining that their brother said there were only two genders. I gave my input, stating that I'd grown up believing there were only two, and thus that's what I believed. In turn, they exiled me from the friend group, and refused to talk to me because of it. This caused me and this close friend of mine to stop talking because I ""hurt"" them so badly.

Eventually, they began throwing threats at me and gave me no reason to stay at the high school I was currently attending. I dropped out into my home high school, which gave them the opportunity to ruin my reputation entirely, as well as turn old friends to dislike me.

This old close friend of mine, who was in that group of people originally, doesn't go to their high school either, and thus doesn't know the full extent of what they say about me. We began talking again and we talk on a near-daily basis.

Here's the Problem:
The MT still has a major disliking for me, and this close friend of mine is not allowed to be my friend. Basically, if they knew she were friends with me, she'd be ""exiled"" from the group like I was. She also has an opinion on abortion that they completely oppose, but they all think that she's on-board with what they think.

Question:
What would you do if you were in my shoes, and do you think they're actually worthy of being her friends?",10Oct2017,1
10,"My girlfriend Jane and I were traveling this weekend and we stayed at Jane's stepbrother Joe's house. He warned us when we showed up that his front door was notoriously tight-fit into the frame and required a good push to open. I found over the course of a couple days that I had to check into it with my shoulder with a good amount of force to open. Anyway, this morning I checked into the door and heard a huge crack. I looked down and found that I had shattered a part of the door. Apparently there was a glass panel about 14""x14"" that had been painted over by the house's previous owner to look like the rest of the door (which was solid wood) and I had just rammed into it. I apologized profusely and asked what I could do to fix it (fortunately I wasn't cut!). He said it was bound to happen sooner or later and that he was planning on replacing the door anyway. Cool, I thought...until he said he would ask a guy to come out to assess the cost of a new glass panel, then charge me the cost of that panel to offset the cost of the new door.

Part of me thinks it is kind of silly to say it was bound to happen and then hold me financially responsible for it, especially when there was no way for me to know the panel was glass (who paints over glass like that anyway?). Also, since he is already replacing the door, why should I have to help pay for it? Sure, I'm maybe accelerating the timeline for the purchase, but why should I have to pay the cost of a glass replacement when that glass could have just as easily been a piece of plywood painted black?

Maybe I'm just upset because this is probably going to cost me something like $200. I don't want to argue with my girlfriend's stepbrother and ruin a family dynamic, but do I have a leg to stand on? What do you think, Reddit?",10Oct2017,17

12,"Hello! I am a sophomore in High School, and I have been developing a project i want your feedback/opinion on. My school uses many different websites, and I have always wondered how fads happen, and the psychological effects of knowing something is stupid but still doing/using/buying it because others do.

The experiment is fairly simple. What I plan to do is create things I call ""ChromeCoins"". These are small, 9x9 Pixel Gifs of coins that spin, some shiny and some not. I have friends (all from slightly different social groups, as I am a bit of a jack of all trades) who, along with me, will suddenly use these coins as our profile pictures on school accounts, and subtly began talking about them with other people, who don't know what's going on. I am hoping to see this information spread, and once people have the idea of them in their head, I am going to create an online website where people can ask for certain ChromeCoins and I will begin making them for anyone who wants them. I am getting fairly good at making them, and I could easily create one in under ten minutes, so it will be fast production. Eventually, I will hope to have my entire school wanting these useless profile pictures, because people start to use them as status symbols.

Here is where you come in. First, I want to get some feedback before I start the process. I already have a few friends who want to do it, and I want to see if anyone has any ideas or tips for this to be successful.

Secondly, I don't want to stop there. I believe this could become  a worldwide thing, if I can try hard enough. Once the test has been completed, I want to gain some Reddit volunteers who want to start doing similar experiments around the world, until the newest fad is a 9x9 pixel gif as a profile picture. I can already see the uproar this would cause. I can imagine the amount of backlash and support for this, but I wanted to get a rough idea of this before I start the experiment.

I will be doing the experiment no matter what, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to help me out with advice or tips or ideas.",10Oct2017,1

17,"Ok so this is weird I know but it's been bothering me. Usually when I'm with guys I feel weird when we get physical. Like I automatically get this feeling he's perverted for breathing heavy or touching me certain ways. Because of this I've never been into it.

When I started thinking why this is I thought about when I first did this. I was maybe 6 and at a birthday party. It was Power Rangers theme and the red ranger was there. We played this game like musical chairs and I was out first. The ranger asked me to come over to him and tell him who I wanted to be, and I said the pink ranger because she was my favorite. Next he told the kids to go around again and he stood behind me with his hands on my shoulders. I just remember almost having a panic attack because I didn't want to feel his penis touching and rubbing against my back(he didn't do that), but for some reason I automatically thought that and pushed him away. I started having a fit so bad that my aunts had to take me into the kitchen and ask me what was wrong. I refused to tell any of them. Then when it came time to say happy birthday I was so angry and started to tear up because they let him in. And I know he had a helmet on but I just kept thinking he was staring at me and I was so uneasy.

I guess my problem is why I think all of this, I literally have no idea why I associate these crazy things and I feel like I'll never get to be in a healthy relationship because of this.

Also not sure if this helps any but I do remember knowing about sex at the age of 3 as something that was a game and something that you did to feel good.",10Oct2017,1

I am a woman in my late 20s in Europe. I have kidney disease and I live on dialysis. I don't have anyone to donate me a kidney but I am on the transplant list here. 

My husband is a great guy and we don't have any financial issues. 

My husband wants to have kids and were I in normal health, I would have loved to have them too. The thing with kidney disease and dialysis is that the average life expectancy on dialysis is 5 years, out of which I have already lived 3. 

However, a transplant in Europe can drastically add at least 2 more decades to my life. 

You see my problem now? I don't know whether it is morally correct for me to have kids? If I die in a few years, I don't want to leave young orphans. I feel selfish for having a desire to have kids. 

My husband's and family's counter argument is that anyone can die anywhere and any time. That is no way to plan life. Additionally my husband says he'd rather have some kids than none with me. He is a great guy and I know he will be a wonderful father with or without me. However I feel like leaving him a single father will reduce his pool of potential partners in the future.

I have a good relationship with my mom. I’m lower middle class. I’m living well. I go to therapy every other week to talk about simple stresses and anxieties. Girls find me cute. I’m kinda short for my age, 5’5 but apparently I’m actually fairly attractive.

Which is why I feel so selfish to say this.

I hate my life. I’m not suicidal. Fuck suicide. I’m not at all. But I really, really dislike my life individually. Like, as a person.

Space is awesome. The world is beautiful. Animals are adorable. Some people are awesome. Movies are awesome. TV is awesome. Youtube is awesome. Friends are awesome. 

But I hate high school. I hate it so much. I hate it so much. Everyday of my life is the same classes and free periods with friends with slight variations in conversations or tasks. I hate it.

I want to be an actor. I’ve never been to a single class. But all my friends and family say I genuinely have a raw talent for it.

I want to be an actor so bad. I want to live in LA. I want to have life long friendships and bonds with my cast mates and be part of amazing projects I’m proud of that’ll make people happy and excited to see. 

How. I live 45-hour away from New York city. All open casting auditions I can find are 18+. No one wants a 16 year old. Even for extras. 

Guys. 85% of Americans hate their jobs. I refuse to fall into that percentage. I want to be an actor. How do I do it.

I’m funny. And I try not to mean that egotistically. Every single kid I’ve met, if they can say one thing about me, is my humor. Even my teachers and moms friends tell me I am hilarious and entertaining.

I spend all my free periods writing movie scripts. I have so many ideas in my head. I want to write, direct, act

It hurts so bad having to shove through another 2 years of HS. And for what? To go to some performing arts college to have some chance? 

I’ve tried YouTube since 2008. I just can’t get famous.

And it’s not about fame. It’s about doing what I enjoy.

Also, it’s about being famous. I love seeing entertainers become influencers. Like, the stranger things kids twitters and the IT cast twitters. I want to be friends with them. I want to be able to have the following to do so.

Also, I was tryna think of kids my age who are famous / popular actors and I could only think of stranger things and IT. That’s kinda weird.

I’m thinking/typing out loud here. Guys, I’m being honest, I will never take my own life but waking
up and going to sleep is really painful. It’s just turning into numb with some flares of bitterness and anger. And I hate to feel that way.

If any of you can help me in anyway, please please just do so.

I recently started living in an apartment complex after living in a detached house for several years.

I often wake up through the night with difficulty breathing and can smell what seems like cigarette smoke.

I've never smoked cigarettes or anything else, but I think I know what cigarette smoke smells like because I've occasionally been near people who were smoking in public.

Along with breathing difficulty, I seem to have stomach discomfort and some forehead tightness, and the smell is quite distinct.

As time goes on when it's clear that someone is smoking inside, I cough increasingly, I feel throat irritation, and when I breathe in I can hear a sound from my throat (I think it's called wheezing).

I think I'm not hypersensitive, but I'm just not desensitized like some people may be.

This is how this apartment complex works: each floor has a long row of apartment doors like normal (and my apartment is on the bottom floor), and inside each door (for example Apartment 1), there are 2 more doors (Apartment 1A and Apartment 1B).

For A apartments, the door opens to an apartment on the same floor, while for B apartments, the door opens to a staircase that goes up to an apartment above.

Once, late at night, the smoking smell was very strong inside, and I opened my A door to our airlock and the smell was extremely strong, and the air was even visibly thick with smoke.

At the time I checked outside the main door and it was not smoky in the main corridor, and it was more smoky in the airlock than in my apartment, so I'm confident that the smoke was coming from my neighbor. At the time I took a photo and a video in the airlock with a flashlight, and it appears visibly smoky in both. I'll take another photo and video again one night when it's not smoky for comparison.

The building is pretty new and the inside corners of walls and light fittings seem to be well sealed, and I keep the windows closed most of the time.

The only place I can see where smoke could come in are the  gap under the door and the drains in the showers and sinks.

There are anti-smoking laws here and also anti-smoking bylaws (clauses for nuisances, odors, toxic chemicals, etc) for this apartment complex.

Yesterday I asked the girl in the other apartment whether she smokes inside, and she said she only smokes on the balcony with the door closed.

I'm quite sure the smoke was coming from her apartment and not from the balcony, but she may or may not stop smoking inside.

If I continue to smell the smoke inside, I'll wait until the next time the smoke is very strong in the airlock and I'll ask a building security guard to come to the airlock to check as a witness, and try to get her evicted.

If I don't notice the smell etc again, then I'll be happy about that.

I want to get your advice about some things:

Does cigarette smoke go down drains and up again? Also I don't know how drains work, but are they daisy-chained from apartment to apartment or would the smoke have to move quite far before coming back? Would the smoke just be absorbed into water sitting in the pipes?

I heard cigarette smoke rises when the temperature of the smoke is higher than the temperature of the air, and falls when the temperature of the smoke is lower than the temperature of the air. Is it right? Then does it mean that it can't come back up drains after falling? And does it mean that the smoke will fall down the stairs from the apartment above and go under the gaps at the bottom of the doors to gather in my apartment, making my apartment much smokier than theirs?

Where does the smoke eventually go? Is it gradually all absorbed into my furniture, clothes, skin, etc? And when I breathe it in, does it go into my blood and then into my brain?

Also I don't know much about the effects of secondhand cigarette smoke, and when I search about it I get a lot of the long-term effects like cancer, heart disease, etc. But what are the immediate effects and what is the chemical in the smoke that causes each effect? For example, why do I feel tightness in my forehead, stomach pain, wheezing etc? If someone knows a good information source for a list of secondhand smoke chemicals and their effects, please let me know.

Finally, general smoke detectors are common but is there any kind of cigarette smoke detector that the apartment complex committee could install into each apartment to detect and prevent smoking? Even if it requires convincing them, or suing them, or raising funds from other tenants to have a system installed. Although it seems like my neighbor chain-smokes inside, and may or may not stop, it's possible there's also smoke from other neighbors.",10Oct2017,1
42,"My parents first grandchild (23) molested their youngest grandchild (2). When I told my parents they were really upset but shortly afterwards they stated that they wish to remain neutral and maintain relationships both with my daughter and the molester. I informed my parents that they simply could not be neutral in this case and that if they wished to continue to have a relationship with the molester that my wife and I couldn't have them around our child. They tried to make excuses and claimed that because the molester was molested himself as a child that he deserves some consideration. While I understand situations are different case to case I am sure there must be some resources that give guidance to family members in a situation like this on what the proper response on their end should be. By that I specifically mean what a trained professional would advise in a case like this. I have never been in this situation and while I'm no expert I know in my heart that their response is not supportive to my daughter as the victim. I wanted to provide my parents some resources to review that might help them to see that they simply can't remain neutral in this case. I understand that they may not change their position on the matter I need to try to get them to understand how serious this is and what the right response from them should be. Even if they never look at it, it would seriously help me. Can anyone help steer me in the right direction?",10Oct2017,1

45,"So, a couple of months ago in a party I saw... the most fucking beautiful girl ever. Holy shit. She was just beautiful. She was way out of my league. Actually, way out of anyone´s league. If I considered myself an ugly person I would not even think of writing this post. Hell, I am not shy at all so I think we are good on both sides of the coin. (look at this jerk with his mountain sized ego). So, a friend of mine gave me this girls number and I tried talking to her. Who had to respond other than...

...her boyfriend. 
Yes people, this magnificent girl had a damn boyfriend. Silly me for not thinking about it. Well, I gave up my hopes with her and just moved on. Was not in the mood of getting beat up by a douchebag (This all happened a couple of months ago, I think June.)

Sooo, a couple of days ago I got a friend request on Facebook from this very girl (WHO THE FUCK USES FACEBOOK ANYMORE, AMIRITE). I decided to accept it and then she starts adding me on other social networking sites. ""Hell yeah, I thought."" Maybe I did have a chance with her after all, ffs. I found out a couple of days ago (friday, specifically) that she was single. That same day, I was under the dear influence of alcohol. Shit. ""Fuck it."" I thought. Texted her, talked to her, all good. 

Man, finally. The moment I had been waiting for the last couple of months come true. She was amazing. Volleyball player, liked quality movies (blade runner and all that shite) and was just... THE girl.

Until she stopped replying.

Sunday marked the day we stopped talking. She never replied to my last text. And here is where I ask my question.

What the hell should I do? This girl is someone I really want to keep talking to but I do not want to sound like a creep tryin to force this shit to happen.

Need your help, people.",10Oct2017,1

But a week ago (first week of uni for this year) I got a huge panic attack . I couldnt sleep , eat  , I was crying , I vomited a lot of times and generally I felt as if I wanted to die. Now it was really late in the night  (4am) so I couldnt/didnt want to call anyone (my parents,girlfriend) . Next morning I sat down made a schedule of how I will come back from a really bad year (basecally retaking all the subjects and in the meanwhile new subjects from the current year) . My parents are really supportive and don't push me or criticisize me or anything and they offer me every last bit of support I could've asked for . Point is although I have a plan worked out and I am already actively trying hard to achieve it , I still get panic attacks. Not as serious as that first night  but I dont have really any apetite what so ever , I smoke A LOT more than i used to . I am really anxious , I dont enjoy things that I used to (video games/tv series) and everyday I wake up from nightmares.

48,"(Names have been changed. Extremely long post...) 

This was over a period of 3 years we met at the age of 15 to 18.
 
I've been through alot of fake friends and bullshit people... enough times to know when something's wrong or when someone been lying to me.... well my most recent best friend Kara was completely different from all the fake people I was friends with before. But then this year that changed suddenly but I don't think it's Kara. All I have been getting from Kara is texts and they don't sound like her at all. I need help figuring this out or at least give me something to help me not worry. 

Before I ever met Kara my mother brought this women in our house (let's call her sofia. she's not really that important. Just how I met kara) Sofia was my mothers bible student (We are jehovahs witnesses) Sofia ended up living with us for about a year. Sofia was kind, funny, smart, and very lovey. But her real personality is that she's a mooching manipulative lair sociopath that preys on the kind hearted, gets to know EVERYTHING about them, and uses them to her advantage. Sofia had me fooled so well i told her everything about me, she got me to hate my mom for things she didn't even do, she lied to me and about me, I lost the only 3 friends i had to her... But she made me believe they wanted nothing to do with me But in a weird psychopathic way she was right. Everyone Sofia wanted me to be friends with that decided to talk to are still my friends today, she even introduced me to my husband who I love dearly. Also she introduced me to a girl she knew would be perfect to be my best friend. Kara. 

Sofia met Kara at a different ""kingdom hall"" or church and knew we'd make a great pair. But before I met Kara, Sofia told me about her mom. (Sofia, being as crazy as she is, is very intelligent when it comes to pointing out everyones flaws and pointing out signs of abuse... she's done it many times, It was how she was so good at manipulating people.) Sofia told me that Karas mom was controlling and a a bit crazy. I thought she was joking around. But I found out later that she wasn't wrong. 

When I finally got to met this Kara, We were at a bonfire at another JWs house (november 2014). Kara and the other kids were playing hide n seek when we got there. Sofia ask Kara if I could join and let me hide with her since I didn't know anybody there beside this girl Sofia has been telling me about. So me and Kara ran and hid in the back of someones truck and while were hiding were talking about doctor who and anime.... by the end of the night we were in a hammock looking at the stars legs over legs just talking about life. Family, school, doctor who, ect. Like we knew eachother for years.

Kara started hanging out with me soon after. She would open up more and more each time she we were together. She was shy but she wasn't around me. Dancing to the wobble, painting tattoos on eachother in blacklight. Going on walks all over town  in crazy clothes, spending almost every weekend together for awhile. Kara started talking to me more and more about herself. Things she claims shes never told anyone. She told me how she was bisexual and how she's had a relationship with a girl before. How she wanted tattoos and piercings and other things you wouldnt expect a JW to do. Then soon after she started opening up to me more about herself and her family.  At first it seem like normal family stuff but then it just got worse. 

At first it was how Kara parents call her names. Kara didn't like to wear hats at home due to the fact her parents call her retarded and a moron and told her she look awful in them. (Kara looks amazing in hats). Then one time Kara  told me how her step dad called her a faggot for wearing black leggings, and Einstein t shirt, black converse and glasses with her short hair pulled back in a black beanie. Kara wasn't even allowed to have t-shirts went i last talked to her because they make her look to ""boyish"". All she had was the Einstein t shirt. She didn't even have any beanies beside a old black one that her mother barely ever let her wear. Kara had to hide 2 t-shirts she had bought at my house because she knew her mom would make her get rid of them. Kara also had to hide multiply other small items at my house. She even had to sometimes hide necklaces i gave her at her house so her mom (Roxanne) wouldn't throw them away. 

Another thing Kara ask me to hide was a razor blade. Yes a razor blade. She ask me to keep it away from her (summer 2015) I notice scars on her thighs before when she would wear shorts but never knew how to bring them up or how to even talk about them. She one day told me how she has bad anxiety and depression... I ask why and she told me that her step dad had been abusing her for sometime. Mostly emotional from both her parents treating her like she's nothing but a slave. Kara told me how he even said before him and her mom got married that he pulled Kara and her younger brother aside (at the ages of 8 and 5/6) and told them that he has anger issues and shouldn't do anything to piss him off when he becomes there dad. Kara told me of him yelling and screaming at them when there mom wasn't around and how even one time one of there friends (who was working out with her dad) had to step out because of how bad her dad was screaming at her younger brother. At first I tough kyla was just trying to get attention like everyother girl I met would do. But then I witnesses it for my self. Even my mom witnesses it.

My mom over heard as kara stepdad say ""i can't wait till they go. they can move out now for all I care"" also at a hotel: ""if the kids at the pool are to loud I'll just throw my beer bottles at them."" Kara even had a panic attack at my boyfriends house after telling us how her step dad punches her in the stomach. And so much more. I asked Kara if she had told her mom any of this and she said ""my mom doesn't care. She would never believe me. My mom also doesn't believe in anxiety and depression and always passes my emotions for my period."" Her famous line about her mom was ""she would never understand"" Kara told me more about her parents and even started talking about asking her mom to emancipate her when she turns 17. Kara talked all the time about leaving at 18. She made it a goal. 

One day Kara and I took a picture of our legs crossed over eachother in my bed. We weren't naked. We weren't doing anything sexual. We were in shorts and had drew designs on our legs so I took a picture. Kara ask me to send it to her. Within days of her being at home her mom called and ask if there was something going on between me and Kara. My mom ask me about it. I showed her the picture and told roxanne that nothing was going on and that all best friends do things like this. After then Kara slowly was stopped being allowed over to my house. Especially when Kara came over one day and her dad dropped her off. It was night and she expected her step dad to be gone by the time we changed into our Pjs. She was wearing a shirt with the sides cut out and a small tutu. I was in a sports bra, same style shirt and shorts... he didn't look happy seeing kara in that. Kara even froze when we walked outside to find him still there talking to my dad. She wasn't upset like she was gonna get in normal trouble... She was scared. 

 Kara soon after was only talking to me over the phone and texting (late fall 2015) And soon that stopped to. I remember her even telling me ""My mom just doesn't like you for some reason"" (reason? Because kara could be herself around me and my family)I was disfellowshipped or ""shunned"" from being a JW (Nov 18 2015... my birthday... being disfellowshipped means i was not allowed to talk to anyone that was a JW. Not even my parents till I proved I wasn't ""sinning"" anymore). While I was disfellowshipped Kara secretly texted me from January of 2016 and continued till May of 2016. Always talking about the day she would be 18. How she was gonna live with us. Making plans and everything. Our last conversation was her telling me how she couldn't wait to go to Mexico so she could video chat me the whole time she was there. She was supposed to be gone all of May 2016. It was May when she stopped texting so I expected that her mom kept her tablet at home while she went to Mexico. June hit and I never got another text. 

In March of 2017 (the month i was reinstated) I saw Kara at a JW assembly after I got reinstated. We hugged and cried just like I expected. My first words to her were ""do you want me and my husband to pick you up on you 18th"" she told me ""I will be there on when I'm 18 but right now they are paying for my school"". We talked for awhile. I showed her my tattoos and just sat there happy as ever able to talk to her. Kara told me about this guy shes had a crush on for a while and how they dated openly for awhile (which made no since at all because knowing her mom she wouldnt let a boy sit next to Kara let alone date her) Kara said how it didn't work out.  I ask Kara  if i could have her new number and she told me how her mom had put an app on her phone so she could see EVERYTHING on karas phone and didn't want me on there. (I even texted Roxanne (karas mom)before this when I got reinstated if I could just talk to kyla over the phone until she thought I was ok to hang out with her daughter. Roxanne reply to me was exactly what I expected... basically not now. We want to take small steps. Soon But not right now. ""Soon"" never came. While me and kyla were talking her stepdad came up to her and at first told her to get her brother... he later came back and told her to go talk to him. Minutes went by so went to go look for her and as I expect i found her arguing with her dad. She walk away and joined a group of her friends and as she passed me she mouthed ""I cant"". I ask her for one last hug and we had to hide behind a wall to do it.  After that I didn't see or hear from Kara again till her 18th birthday. Me and my husband planned to sit outside her house till midnight and then knock on her window. 

July 12 2017. While we were outside my husband decided to park the car in a parking lot acrossed the street from her house. We were facing her house. About an hour after sitting there Roxanne was shutting the curtain and saw our car. She closed the curtains, walked outside to her car and checked it as if something had been stolen. Then she walked back into the house. Karas step dad came out seconds later to do the same thing to his work truck but not his normal everyday car that was fancy enough to take. Then he walked acrossed the street toward our car..i dunked down so he couldn't see my face. It was dark. He came up and talk to Davin saying  ""hey  ya know  trucks come through here in the morning you should probably move"" and he also said ""well i hope your not wanting for anyone certain""  (1. Why was our car so suspicious in an already bad town? 2. Why did they check their cars as if something was stolen? 3. How did her stepdad know to say ""i hope your not waiting for someone certain"" instead of ""are you waiting for someone""?) He went back inside. We moved our car and about an hour later the cops came. We told them why we were there. They knocked on the door and ask Kara  herself ""do you want to say here or go with them?"" Kara was right in front of her parents. She told the cop to tell me ""I'm happy here. They're paying for my school"".

I didn't even see karas face that night. Roxanne then walked up to the car and with her greatest bitch face, looked at me and told me ""stay away from me, my family, my daughter, the property and the area"".... man I wanted to flip her off so bad but there were like 5 cops staring at me. 

After that night I tried to ask one of her friend on Insta if she could please give Kara a message for me. I was blocked seconds after asking. All I asked her to say was I was sorry and I loved her.  Then that same night I get texted by an elder of our church asking to talk about it. They told me basically the same thing roxanne told me. To stay away. Roxanne thought that would scare me but after being disfellowshipped I don't give 2 shits for there opinions and I never gave a shit for Roxanne in the first place. Soon me and my husband came into some money. So I tried my best to contact Kara saying we could pay for her school and get here out. I made 3 instagram accounts because my normal one was blocked and I couldn't message her. 2 out of the 3 were blocked. The last one was the only one where I stated that we could pay for her school. Within minutes of requesting to follow her she called me. ""Private Number"" was what popped up on my phone and I knew that it was her. I answered thinking her mom would be on the other side (considering the fact I knew Roxanne wouldnt want me seeing karas number... i thought it would be weird  she'd want me to talk to her)  but it was Kara.  ""You. Need. To. Stop. You need to leave me alone. I'm not being forced to stay here. My parents aren't hurting me. I'm not even in school anymore. Please leave me alone."" It sounded staged. Like it was on speaker too. She sounded rushed and scared. I don't know what to think. 

About a week later I posted a collage of pictures of her and ask if someone could give her a message for me. I didn't say much just asking why she just dropped me. Why she was changing her words. Why she said certain things. I never mentioned her parents excepted when I ask ""and if your not being controlled why did you put 'government says I'm an adult, I don't believe it' on your bio?""
A couples days after her 18th, after we tried to pick her up. She put that on her bio ""GOVERMENT SAYS I'M AN ADULT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT""

After I posted the photo about 3 hours later she (or I think her mom) texted me saying this: ""a shrewd man conceals what he knows, but the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness. Leave me alone and stop trying to contacted me through other people. You ask me to tell you myself, and I have many times even over the phone. I am here by MY OWN CHOICE. Leave me alone. Leave my family alone. And stop trying to contacted me through other people. LEAVE ME ALONE SANDY! NOW!  

Me: 
""From everything you told me you made me Believe you wanted out and that you parent controlled you. You wanted it so bad. How could I believe that that phone call was really your words after you told me yourself at the assembly that and I quote ""I will be at your house on my 18th birthday I'm only here because they are paying for my school"" even when we were at you house the cop told me that you said that ""I'm happy here THEY ARE PAYING FOR MY SCHOOL"" what was I supposed to believe???  I had presents for you. I had a room for you. I had many things I wanted to do with you. This whole year I was thinking of all the things we were going to do the moment you came to my house I guess it was all just dreams I guess it was all just lies but you know what you go ahead and do what you're doing stay with the family that you said  controlled you. Stay with the people that hurt. you you call me foolish?  at least I don't stay with people that hurt me."" 

A little later 
Me: "" you know what no.. im sorry. I love you kyla and always will. There's to much wrong with this. I know you to well I'm sorry all j wanted to do was talk to you one more time before you moved but I guess it's impossible
 I doubt you even typed that message or even sent it. I love you Kara. Goodbye for now. 

Kara: ""So I'm going to tell all this to you now so you don't have a reason to try and think that I am hurt at absolutely dying here with my parents. My parents don't beat me, I am not forced to do anything. My parents are good people who have done nothing but he there for me when I need them most. I'm not being forced to live here, I chose to stay here because I don't want to leave. They take care of me still, they help me and will continue to help me until I'm able to take care of myself and life on my own. So my parents have done nothing wrong to me, so you can get the idea I'm so hurt I can't leave out of your head. Second, when I last saw you after you got reinstated, yes I was moved to tears. I loved you and nothing made me happier than seeing you back with jehovahs people again. However, I have changed since your disfellowshipping. I am no longer that girl, so when you started showing me you tattoos and everything, I made the choice myself to keep myself distant from you. I don't feel that I continue to serve Jehovah faithfully and be in contact with you. So I hid myself behind my mom and saying that she felt we should keep some space. However, now, I am telling you that I chose that  I am 18 years old and a legal adult who can make decisions cor myself, and I choose not to be living with you, not to be in contact with you, and to not be friends with you either. So I am telling you this one more time and I mean it Sandra. I am fine. My parents aren't abusing me, I'm not hurt, I'm not being blackmailed, and in not being forced to stay here. I am choosing this for myself, I'm going to stay at home with my parent, I am choosing my family and most importantly I am choosing to serve Jehovah faithfully over you. So leave me alone and stop saying things about my parents and trying to get other to contact me or make others think my parent are terrible people. Leave me, and my family alone. 

Ok.... 

1. Kara spoke TO much about her parents and how much she hated them. I have texts that I'm posting to a private account on Instagram to help you see what I mean (details below)
 2. The part about tattoos and ""every thing"" pissed me off because Kara wanted tattoos and the ""everything""was pot.... she always talked about getting high with me again so why is she choosing to hate me for these things that I'm probably have been doing for awhile?? 
3. The post that I posted with the message to her said at one part ""if your not being controlled then why does you bio say 'government says I'm an adult, I don't believe it'"". This was the ONLY time I have ever mention the parents being involved. I don't mention name or say anything else EVER that told anyone that Kara parents are bad. Karas parent just already have a reputation that more people know about than they think (they just like to blame other for there problems). Also after I posted that message and after I got the first text for Kara the part about ""government says I'm an adult"" was taken down..... why was it posted there in the first place if she's ""ok"". 
4. I love the part about her mom saying we should keep some space.... Kara didn't give 2 shit before about her mom opinion why does she now?? 
5. Me and I my husband are moving so while I looked up houses I checked to see if there's was for sale.... It's not and still isn t considering this is the month they were supposed to move. But I also believe that the person that was telling me that they were gonna move only said that to make me not want to try to contact her. 
6. This message was WAY to properly typed out. Not only that but Kara doesn't speak in riddles ""the heart of the fool"" shit. 

What should I think. One day she loves me like a sister. I was her greatest confidant and she was mine. We knew everything about eachother and hated keeping secrets from on another  to I'm blocked from everything, she doesn't want to speak to me, she didn't want to be my friend and the only explanation I get is ""when you started showing me you tattoos and everything"" SHE wanted tattoos too. SHE wanted to smoke pot with me again and wanted to go to raves and wear half cut shirt and get piercings and all that shit.... and all of a sudden this...

52,"Okay so I work under two bosses, one is a 45 year old  single lady, and the other is a 56ish years old married woman. We all work on the second floor of a building, and we work for a government job. The bottom floor gets 98% of the work, people rarely come up stairs. So naturally people upstairs don't do any work all day. I am the exception, I basically keep everything neat, tidy and I run all over the place finding work to do.

 Now during the day the 56 year old lady is with me, and after 4 p.m she gets replaced by the 45 years old. Problem is this. The 45 years old asked me to label some things once, I did them, but got a label slightly off, the 45 years old snapped at me. She basically sits at the office and calls her family, I have never seen her do any work. Anyways, she grinded her teeth, stomped her feet over something really trivial. I apologized to her, but then I hated how I had to apologize over something so stupid. Then few days afterwards I noticed that she would tell me she signed me out (we get time cards) but she would not do it. Or she would do it with a pencil but then her signature are completely gone the next day. She would say random weird things like ""Oh now you are a thief you are working when you are not suppose to"" and then joke about it. It made me anxious because I didn't want to be considered a thief.

Now comes the 56 years old. The 56 years old would all of a sudden tell me to do something. But then instead of waiting for me to close a book or w/e I am reading, she says ""NOW!"", I mean I have to fold up my things (I do school work at my job). So I get up and i label things left behind from the lady at night. After some time I realized that labeling the books helped me with my anxiety, so I started doing them on my own. I would ask her for the books and just do them. Now the lady at night truly had zero work.

Okay so I do my best to keep the 56 years old pleased. But she randomly tells me to ""Clean my desk"" with water and soap. Or she tells me to water plants, but then gets upset that I used hot water. Tells me to bring up some stupid newspapers upstairs, then angrily asks me if I did or not like I am an imbecile. She asks me for a question but when I try to answer she cuts it off and asks me another question, I try to answer that and she asks me another.

Here is where it gets really interesting. After I complained about the lady at night not signing my cards, I started getting someone from downstairs to sign them. So the lady at night stopped being mean to me or asking me to do anything. But now, both ladies constantly tell me ""not to worry about things"". 

The old lady asks me random questions, and then says ""You worry too much!"", like every thing she says to me has a veiled insult towards me worrying.

Meanwhile, the lady during the day still tells me to do demeaning tasks, acts really mean at one moment, but then 20 minutes later she tells me ""Xyz you worry too much"". Wtf is going on?? why are they doing this shit to me. Am I really worrying too much? I feel like I am being violated somehow, they are clearly cruel to me, but at the same time I feel like maybe its all in my head. I honestly don't know what the fuck is going on. Anyone ever had this happen to them?",10Oct2017,1
53,"What's up guys, 

Just wondering what I could get me and my brother to do for my grandfather after he was given a 100 dollar bill from my grandfather to go to the grocery store and get some stuff, when he was coming back home on the bike he let all of the change fall out of his pocket. 

We are both underage and I moved both of us out of our moms house to move in with him some months ago. He has made it clear that us living with him has made bills a lot more and that he hasn't been able to eat as tasty of foods as he used to. Today was one of the days he was supposed to but not it's ruined.

55,Okay I've been thinking about about how powerful the internet is for the last few days. The internet can solve crimes just with a few pictures and some investigation if you have enough people interested. So because of that I've been thinking about a sort of Internet riddle scavenger hunt game . Have any ideas? For me I thought of various things and have the rough idea for the game but I'd like to hear your ideas.

How do you post a link in a single word? Like if I had here and it was highlighted blue it would be link.",10Oct2017,1
59,"I wrote about a situation a while back regarding my sister, linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6r3xt7/my_sister_is_being_abused_by_her_husband_my_ex/). Well, I'm not getting much help with this offline so I decided to see if I can get actual advice on here.

Long story short. Jill, my sister who is in an abusive marriage, has been with Rob, her abusive husband, for the most part since the last incident. I've mostly been avoiding her. However, Rob showed up at my doorstep. He wanted to borrow money from me for some gambling debts he's got. I refused. Rob basically flipped out, and tried to bash my door in with his foot. I called the police, and they arrest him.

Jill is livid. She screamed at me on the phone, yelling that I should've called *her* instead of the cops. She blames me for Rob going to jail and her having to bail him out. 

My parents have also chewed me out over this, telling me that ""you never call the police over family"". 

So should I just drop the charges and just leave Rob and Jill be, and possibly patch things up with her? Or do I just keep things the same, and hope that Rob gets his ass thrown into a jail cell? Jill claims she will never forgive me if I don't drop them, and even threatened to slap me if she sees me. ",10Oct2017,54
60,"I know it's long but I'm going to try and sum up 4 months of my life, plus emotions in this post. I've never used Reddit, and simply here for advice. If you can't read the entire post, then go ahead and click that back button.

I am 20 years old.
So back in February I mentioned to my parents that a web development job came up in Tampa, Florida and that I was considering moving there. I was currently living in Dallas, Texas. After discussions and talking, I decided to make the move with  full family support. I paid for everything besides the U-Haul (given that it was the 2nd most expensive thing at ~$700). I told them salary was 35k/year and an evaluation would be given after 6 months... And yes, I made all of it look legit. Real company and real looking offer letter. My family (not my parents) have some serious business men in it, and even them were very proud and believed me about it all.

Now we get to the fucked up part, it was all a lie. Not a single thing was true besides the fact that I do website development, which they have known for a good year. I do freelance website work for small clients. I have no college background.

By me posting this, you can probably guess I've fucked up along this timeline. Just to get it out of the way, before I moved I took my bed and bought furniture before the move. My mom bought me about $300 in groceries the day I moved in. So moving forward, I'm a young, 20 year old who just moved to the beach side of Tampa, Florida. What was I doing everyday? Having the time of my life at the beach each and every day. This lasted about a month, until my 1st rent came up. By this time I had enough to pay rent and utilities, and was left with about $200. During this month I didn't do one bit of development work, in fact I let my freelance profile get out of date, and I stopped responding to past and potential clients. I only spent money. I knew I needed a job, but also knew that no website development place would accept me right. Yes I do website development, but it's small work for small clients. $50-$100 jobs usually. I've only built a few advanced sites from the ground up and am still very new to any advanced languages such as JS, Jquery, etc. I am not educated enough to get a good job at the moment. About 5 weeks after moving I got a job on a tour boat.

The tour boat job was great, I joined in the beginning of the summer. It was long, hot work, but paid great. 12 hour days, 3 days on, 3 day off work. Base pay of $90-$100/day, plus I took home anywhere between $80-$110/day cash. I loved this job. I got to work outdoors on the water and met people from around the world daily. During this time my family still thought I was working my normal web development job.

Moving on to now, summer has ended. Pay dropped to only about $80/day, including tips. With rent at $850, electricity at around $90, and all other life essentials I quickly ran out of money. That's not the worst though, now I'm basically homeless... I lost my apartment due to failure to pay rent. My landlord was extremely nice and didn't put an eviction on my record, which I'll be forever grateful for. I'm now living with friends, paying them a few hundred a month. I put all my items in a storage unit which I pay for.

I'm in the biggest slump of my life. I've made a lot of mistakes in life, and I regret every year of high school, but I've always changed for the better. But this is bad. I don't know if I can keep this up... I've done the math, I'll be able to get back on my feet in 6-8 weeks (I have a new job btw). However, my ""6 month evaluation"" with my development company is coming up on December 5th, and my parents are already constantly asking about my job. My plan before I moved here was to stay on track with web dev, and have an actual web development job by December and simply tell the family that I left for the actual development job, and then life would finally be truthful... But those plans have failed.

I'm not mad or depressed about basically being homeless, I can get through this rather easily thanks to friends. What I can't get through is the train of lies I've created. I love my family to death, and I didn't leave them because they wronged me or I didn't like them. I left because I simply wanted to be free, and I visited FL last Christmas with a friend and I knew it's what I wanted. Since I moved here life has truly been great. I've had so much confidence, fun, and general enjoying life. I'm not a nightlife kind of person, and that's all that Dallas really has. I'm a beach kind of person, I enjoy the warm waters and Gulf breeze. I would rather live 5 minutes from the beach here, than live back in Dallas. But this is tough.

I don't have many options, but these are what I've come up with.

1) Be downright honest, tell them what happened and go back.
2) Tell them I got laid off, and think it would be best to move back.
3) Do what I'm doing right now. Get a new place, and then work towards getting an actual tech job and then being truthful from there... In all honesty, if I put the effort in it would take me a few months to brush up my skills again for professional level.

What have I learned from this? Adult hood sucks?? No, not really. I love being an adult. However, it's really opened my eyes towards how shitty I did my parents. When I graduated HS I stayed living at home for a year working full time making about $1,400/month. My parents never made me pay rent, only car insurance. My step dad always asked me if I wanted to pay for a night out for a family dinner, and I always declined for no good reason. Even when they asked me to get a few dollars of groceries, I asked for their card rather than simply using mine when I could of afforded it. I feel like shit because of these small things and I wish I would of realized it then. If I do move back, I'll be paying rent without question as well as my phone and I can guarantee we'll start doing our Friday eating out again... They stopped a couple years back due to financial reasons and I always got mad because we only went out to a restaurant maybe once every other month... Now I understand.
With all that said, I still can't say whether or not I'm happy I made the move.. On one hand, I've learned so much, on the other I messed up my credit (lost both my Amazon and Capitol One card) and have really been down.

Any advice regarding this would be helpful.

I don't even play competitive, only arcade and quick play, but I still rage incredibly and nearly throw tantrums when I do bad.

I tried playing bejeweled blitz on my phone yesterday, kept getting stuck, and threw my phone across the room. Finally, today, I decided to sit back and play some Pokémon fire red for some nostalgia. I'm stuck in the vermillion gym and rather than train my Pokémon higher to beat it more easily, I thought it would be a good idea to get up, rip open my computer, yank my drive from the Sata connector, and destroy it.

81,"  A few months ago, I confronted my girlfriend of 5 years about a year-long affair she had with a coworker (she works for me.)  Here's the original post in which I describe the situation.

/r/Advice/comments/71si0a/provide_reasonable_consequences_for/ Basically, I allowed her to stay and said I'd forgive her. It's been 6 months, but I still don't feel quite right about the situation or assured that she feels bad enough about what she's done to assure me she won't do it again. Since so many Reddit users suggested that this relationship might not be the best thing for me because her trustworthiness is questionable, at least in my eyes, I started to think about what it might entail to break up with her. Here's the thing: I may be hurt by what she did, but I still have sympathy for her. She gave up her career as a college teacher to help with my business, playing a huge role in saving it from absolute failure during a difficult time (she's worked for me for over 2 years). Because she and I stopped drawing a salary 6 months ago to save the business, which was also around the time I confronted her, her bank account has been overdrawn for months, and her credit is shot. She has no insurance. I pay the household bills out of company revenue, but she carries no more than 10 or 20 dollars on her person at any time, sometimes much less. She's physically and mentally exhausted. She works six days or more days a week, and is integral to the company. She has few material possessions of her own, though she does have a car, ( it's in need of repair.) How can I ethically ask her to leave my home under these circumstances? She'll be unemployed, with no money, terrible credit, and basically have to start over after cutting ties abruptly with the University where she used to work so she could come on board when the business needed her. We don't have kids, but we do have 3 dogs, and I can't see myself parting with any of them, since I'm the one who cares for them while she spends so many hours at work. So she'd lose them too, since she wouldn't be in a position to care for them anyway. I know some of you might say she should've thought about all that before she cheated, but it hurts me to think about her being cut loose in such a vulnerable position, even if it turns out relationship can't be saved.

So how could I let her go gently? I can't just kick her out with her life in shambles, can I? It doesn't have to happen right away -- as I mentioned, we've been carrying on for 6 months after the affair came out anyway. Is there a way to work toward our separation in a way that won't be sudden and disastrous for her? Is it best for me to work toward that end without her knowing my intention to ask her to leave, or should she be part of the planning?",10Oct2017,1
84,"Me and my friend went for a walk and we said goodbye outside. When she thought I wasn't paying attention, she crossed the road and started rifling through one of my neighbours' recycling bins. She did this for a while. I felt really awkward so I went inside, looked out again and she did it for a little bit more before continuing on her way. I thought she was holding something.  

To be honest, she's kind of a sketchy person (and I'm a really innocent naive one). Was she looking for something of value? I've seen rough looking people/homeless people go through neighbourhoods collecting beer cans from recycling bins because you can return them to the beer store to get a 10c refund. Other relevant info is that she's low on money and spends all her money on weed. I'm not sure what other things people take... idk if she was looking for personal info or for things people throw out by accident? Things of value? She's not starving lol so it's not food, she lives with her parents. She was also kinda high when she was doing this but I don't think that would make someone interested in recycling...

I had no idea about it, he proposed in March and I said yes without any knowledge of this. I actually found out he was on Grindr in July, confronted him about it, and he said he had only been with 2 different guys since we had been together. After that, we worked it out and I forgave him but I got an STI about 3 weeks ago and when I finally confronted him again about it, the truth came out.
He says it stems from a sexual addiction- he is addicted to anonymous sex, and the feeling of “being used.” I thought and viewed our sex life as normal to good- having sex often, but not all the time. He tells me the sex he has with me is incredible and so completely different than anonymous sex with guys... and we both talk about how we would never be in an open relationship.
I see an addiction that has been hurting me physically and emotionally (trust/general hurt from cheating and the STI) and I am not sure where to go from here.

3. Not sure she likes me. We're friends (not CLOSE friends but whatever), and when we have talked, she's super nice, but in social situations, she tends to go to her friend group rather than me (understandable).

4. Probably the biggest problem, she's a Mormon. I'm not completely sure as to how faithful to the religion she is, but I've never heard her cuss, and she gets uncomfortable whenever someone else cusses/makes dirty jokes, so I'm guessing she's pretty devoted. I, on the other hand, am not Mormon. I don't believe in the same things she does, and I don't see my beliefs changing anytime soon. I do, however, know a lot about the religion because I grew up around (a lot of) Mormons. I know about their lifestyle and ethics and whatever.

96,"Alright so to  be completely honest this is pretty pathetic of me, but its been going on for so long, always considered asking here but never ended up doing but I guess its finally time!!

So here's a little backstory..
3 years ago, I had a class with a girl I haven't really talked to since middle school, she was always really easy to talk to but I never thought I'd end up developing feelings for her.  Over the course of the year she was the only person  I talked to in that class and little ol' 15/16 year old me was in love lol.. I finally got the courage to ask her out right before spring break and she told me she was busy that day, but she would text me later. She did end up texting me, but she sent me a long ass paragraph saying how sorry she was but she wanted to stay as friends.  I responded how I understood but we stopped talking completely for the rest of the school year.

The next year, I somehow got a class with her again. This time was a bit different, at the time I pretty much lost all feelings for her and I saw her as a friend. She even tried getting me to get with some other girl, but that didnt work out (she had a boyfriend). Over the year I feel like we got even closer than last year, she clearly flirted with me a couple of times (other classmates saw + talked to friends about it without stretching the truth as much as possible). Around the end of the year I saw her in the hallway before we had class and remembering we had a conversation about some movie the other day, I asked her if she wanted to go, she looked kinda excited but she told me she was going to Disney. I got really nervous for class that day cause I didn't know whether the same thing was gonna happen last year where we'd just stop talking to each other, but she asked me if I was being serious about going to the movies and her apologizing and telling me she was genuinely going to disney. I didn't know what to do after so I just never asked her to watch that movie again after that. About a month later on the last day of school I sent her a text telling her about how I felt, and she replied saying she wanted to stay as friends, but she did want to hang out over the summer. At that point I honestly got pretty salty and didnt respond, and I never talked to her over the summer.

Senior year came, and I had zero classes with her, I did see her alot in the hallways said hi a few times in the beginning but that soon stopped. There was a point in time where we ran into eachother and she looked kinda pissed at me and all she said was ""okay"" (literally had no clue what that was about but ya).

Im in college now, she's at a college a few hours away. My roommate (who knows about her because he's a close friend of mine), somehow convinced me to text her like a month ago and I did, and we ended up having a convo for like 2 days straight. But she stopped replying and now I just feel kinda empty inside lol.

I really dont know what to do, I miss her but I feel like at this point theres not much to be able to accomplish. There is a possibility I could transfer to her university (they have a great programming courses), but I'm not completely sure yet.

I've talked to so many people about this, my mom told me shes been playing with me and quite frankly I agree, but I have nooo idea.

97,"Hello and thanks for taking the time to hear my story.  I am a little lost as of what path to take to move on in my life with my two little boys (6 and 3).  Ill give a little background first:

I am divorced from my children's father and we live in different cities an hour apart. We legally have joint custody and he is very active in their lives. Under our agreement, I have the boys 5 days a week (our oldest goes to school in my town) and he has them every weekend. He is a bi-polar and hard to trust. 

I got the house in the divorce (yes I own it, but pay a mortgage), have 3 shitty vehicles on their last leg (2 from inheritance) and very little household repair knowledge; my home needs quite a bit of work and upkeep.  I work as a waitress and average about 15k a year thanks to tips. I must have a babysitter 2-3 days a week for 4 hours a night for my shifts. I am 2 years away from a bachelors degree in accounting/business but do not have the means to attend school physically and am having a hard time finding a university that accepts financial aid to the point where tuition would be paid for.

Now to the bf: I had been with him for 2 years and he lived with us.  However, after this time of non-contribution to the household and alcoholism I am forced to end the relationship even though he was a wonderful ""stepdad"" to my boys.  He has decided his only path is to move back to his home town which is hours away and start a new life.  I am leaving myself with a mortgage and bills I can barely afford and am forced to think of options.  I will list my potential options and if anyone can through a bit of advice my way, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Options:
-Sell my house and downsize by buying a new house, renting, or even possibly buying a duplex and renting out the other unit.
-Find a trustworthy roommate and stay in the house I'm in hoping they can babysit and are savvy in home repairs.
-Move to the city where my children's father lives and being able to go to school physically and have him babysit while I wait tables at night.",10Oct2017,1

I have 6 years in call center sales, and 6yrs in door to door. My current job is stupid money, I sell meat door to door (hence the term ""grimiest of sales""). I actually wouldn't mind staying in meat sales, I'm really fucking good at it. The only thing I would want to change is the hours. I currently work at least 72hrs a week, every week. I'm not big on selling anything I wouldn't buy myself, and we all know how hard it is to sell something you don't believe in. I would list those things but I honestly can't think of many right now. As an example, I tried selling lawn care once; I absolutely hated it mainly because I could give a shit less about a nice lawn. I also sold energy efficient doors and windows in Florida that was ok, but I was young and dumb so I don't think I lived up to my potential really. I was considering moving somewhere near a booming industry, specifically near a natural gas or oil field region. I know for sure I'd sell a shit ton of meat, if that's what I choose to stick with. I wouldn't mind sticking with a strictly commission based job(simply because I think that's the best motivator), even though it'd be nice to have a some kinda base salary for once. However, this post is about suggestion from you guys. For those of you that enjoy your field of sales, what do you sell? What makes it fun? What market are you in (if you feel comfortable divulging that info)? Lastly, what is the pay like?",10Oct2017,1

104,"I am currently living in my grandmother's house. I live with her, my older brother, and my aunt. I want to move out for several reasons, but feel like I can't, or at least shouldn't for 2 reasons. I want to move out because I cannot stand my aunt. She complains/ bitches/ criticizes people nearly everyday when she comes home from work. She also frequently gets into shouting matches with my 87 year old grandmother (who has dementia). My brother also loses his temper quite frequently, mostly towards my grandmother. We often walk on eggshells around him. Furthermore, I am well past the age that someone is expected to move out (would rather not say my age). I have not moved out because I only make minimum wage. I want a career in teaching, but I need time to make connections and get references. I don't feel that I could do this if I worked full-time. Secondly, my grandmother is very dependent on me and my brother. I always drive her to go shopping and banking because she doesn't like going with my brother. He always yells at her for buying too many groceries/ things we already have. She often says that she could not live on her own, and that she would have to move into a retirement home. She also likes to add that we would receive no inheritance if that were to happen. So /r/Advice, what do you think? Should I bite the bullet, move out, and endure my grandmother's wrath? Should I make things harder on myself career-wise? Or should I stay and enjoy the easy life, sacrificing my privacy, independence, freedom, happiness and integrity?",10Oct2017,3

I lied to her about the $1500 and everything and eventually she found out by her investigation and I had to confess then. I'm very sorry for what I did but she's so cold right now, she's saying that she will talk to other boys to hurt me and my act will have consequences and punishment, even breakup.

111,"I feel I don't have anyone to share this with, as most people don't seem to understand my position, or they tell me to just stop whining. I'm 29 years old, and have lived in California for 10 years now. I moved here from Virginia for college because it's more affordable here and there's a lot more financial assistance. My family all lives here too, so it just made sense. 

I lived in Chico for 8 of those years, and felt okay about it most of the time... But after about 7 years, I got very sick of it. Sick of the heat. Sick of a 6 month summer, 4 month winter, and no fall or spring. Sick of the job market and the same old things. I moved a year and a half ago to San Luis Obispo with my wife, who insisted we come here where she went to college. I figured why not, let's try it.

San Luis Obispo has turned out to be Chico but without my friends and family. It isn't as hot, but there's no seasons here, and it's super expensive. It's dry and brown and dead half of the year and I kind of hate it. Everyone just keeps telling me how beautiful it is here and how lucky I am, but I just don't get it really. Yes there's the ocean, but every day is the same here. Sunny, 80, and dry. Not until December do we have any variance in weather at all.

What I'm driving at here, is that I think I may have seasonal depression, but for hot sunny weather. I feel this is kind of stupid, but I've felt this way for about four years now, and it is getting worse every year. I feel like I don't belong in California, but my wife doesn't want to leave now that she has gotten back here. She wants us to raise our kids here, and doesn't want to revisit the idea of moving for a long time because she's tired of moving. 

I feel kind of trapped. I love my wife, so leaving her isn't really an option. Anyone have any advice on how I can learn to like, or even love this place I just don't feel like I belong? ",10Oct2017,1

115,"So it may have taken me 8 long years, but I am starting to realize I may be at fault. Ok, here it goes...

There was a boy in my life, I was 19 (I am F) he's 20, [he shall now be referred to as Brad]. We met at work, and after the first time I hung out with him, we hit it off and then spent every waking moment texting, talking, hanging out. It's pretty foggy now, but I remember him telling me not to tell him I like him. Another guy we both knew, I'll call him Neil, told Brad that he liked him. At the time, I thought maybe Brad was homophobic, because he completely shut out Neil. B and I would be hanging out like we do, and N would text, but B would ignore it. I know of another girl that B shut out completely, she would sometimes text or call too, again to be ignored. This is important later.

So because of B's stupid rule, I was so confused. B made me a birthday cake, he made me dinner for valentine's day, he would stay at my apartment overnight. Once, I was out late, Brad was at home, and I was groped outside of my apartment. When I told Brad about this incident later, he gifted me the very knife from his pocket. 

My memories of him are all very fond. He let me borrow his DSLR camera because I wanted to take a photography class. But stupid me, I went and bought my own camera so that I could return his. Another night, my car broke down. He came and towed me back to my apartment. Very caring, tended to me when I needed him. There's so much more, but I'll get to the point.

We never held hands, kissed, or anything, but I was under the impression that B liked me, and I wanted it known that the feeling was mutual. After another all-nighter, he dropped me off at my apartment one day, I got out and simply said ""I'm not breaking your stupid rule,"" thinking he would understand that I liked him. Some time passed, possibly because of this, the texts were coming later and later. Some days I wouldn't hear from him. Now here's where I fucked up.

Another guy was showing interest in me. I wanted something to happen with Brad. I was a little sad we weren't talking like we used to. My texts were going unanswered, or replies were late, I don't really remember. What I do remember is texting ""You're killing me, Smalls."" That got his attention, he replied. So I did it. I told him I liked him. Through text. I still very much regret it. I don't remember trying very hard to get a response. I knew the consequences. I would give anything to take it back. 

Okay, so back the guy who started showing interest. I'll call him Zack. I started 'dating' him within a month of telling Brad I liked him. Zack says he doesn't want a relationship. Great. Neither do I, not really. I just want to forget that B shut me out. I pretend I'm not hurt, Zack doesn't know of Brad. Fast forward two years, I'm now living with Z, who works overnights. I am doing homework while Z sleeps. My cell phone rings. I didn't have his number saved, but it's B, I recognize the number. I froze. I'm in the same room as sleeping Z, I want to answer. But I don't. I'll never know what that was about. 

Maybe 6 months later, I shoot B a happy birthday text. I hesitated, I didn't want to, I didn't want to be another shut out hopeless crush that still tries to contact him. I've seen Brad not answer those texts. Of course, it went answered.

When Zack asked me to marry him, inside I wanted to say no, but I said yes. I didn't know who to call other than my mom to announce our engagement. I put off wedding planning for over 3 years. I have tried several times (unsuccessfully) to leave. I fell into a deep depression, I drank myself silly. Z threatened to leave if I didn't stop. But here I am, married to Z. I didn't invite many of my friends to the wedding, I blame my depression, but perhaps it was because I wasn't in love with Z. 

Anyway. I need help. I want to leave Z. I'm not in love, I'm pretty sick of this relationship. So I think because I want to end my current relationship, I go back to where my heart last left off. I haven't thought of Brad for awhile, but now I can't seem to shake him. I want to contact Brad, but I'm married, and I'm still pretty sure he wouldn't answer me. But what if he does? And he's not happy that I'm contacting him while married to someone else... 

Like I said before, I would give anything to take it back. I would rather have him in my life, if it means I'll only ever get to talk. I can take no touching, I hate this so much. I'm hurting.

Edit: tl;dr my crush cut me off 8 years ago, and I want to try to contact him now, though unsure if he'll even respond.",10Oct2017,1

117,"I recently switched to online school to take a mental break from public schooling. It's helped my mental health more than I can describe, but the best way to put it is I've only thought about killing myself once this past school year, which is a big deal for me :)


The problem is, I suck at personal achievement. The school I'm enrolled in is all about attendance, and it's all on me to get my hours in each day. I'm horrible at this and I only have around 30 or 40 hours in FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. So obviously I'm very behind. If I switched back to public school, my grades would go down (since I also suck at doing homework, it's just a horrible spiral that I don't want to get into) as well as my mental health status. I know for sure I would think about killing myself way more often if I was in public school. Buuuut if I stay enrolled in online school, I'm going to be behind everyone else and graduate waaay later than I want to.

After 2 interviews, noone told me I never got the position so I basically wasted my time and figured I didnt get it after 2-3 weeks of waiting. I was set to resign last week, Monday, then they suddenly told me that I have an interview on that day so I retracted my resignation plans. They seemed to like me and all and I thought I was gonna get the part. I waited for a week and followed up with the HR and noone responded to me so I filed my resignation yesterday, Monday. A day after filing my resignation, one of the HR people came to my room telling me that the one who interviewed me thought I was set to start my position yesterday and was shocked to know I wanted to resign. But noone even told me I was being considered or I got the position! They didn't even set up a proper meeting with me after nor an e-mail stating that I'm set to start my new position. I'm torn right now because the system in my company is so terrible and I dont know whether to trust them on this new position or to just ditch it. They were supposed to meet with me today to discuss but an hour before the meeting, they rescheduled it.

126,"So I have a friend who I feel very, very affectionate towards, even though to be honest we're not even that close. And no, I don't like him... I am a bisexual guy (he's straight with a gf of 8+ years) and yes, I have pictured ""those"" scenarios of ""what would I feel if he one day told me he liked me"" or ""what if we kissed"" and they didn't feel right. I have liked/loved someone before and it's definitely not that. So, yeah, that question's out of the way (I hope)

Having said that, I feel very fond of him. I care about him a lot and think about him a lot. When my other friends were sick I didn't care too much, but when he was sick, I went out of the way to make him some honey lemon tea and ask him how he is on the daily. I look up to him and kinda want him to notice me all the time. In fact, I kinda want to impress him in some aspects... I just think he's really cool and want to hang out with him more and learn more about him. He never really contacts me first and this genuinely disappoints me, a lot.

(*this paragraph is extra reading... if TL:DR skip to last paragraph) I would love to just go and get to know him more, but ~3 years ago we had a huge class party to celebrate us getting halfway through our 6 year university course (biggest and most anticipated event of the year), but at the time I had just gone through a break up - I cried literally all night and he was the one that had to console me, and eventually he had to leave the party early to take me home. Also prior to that he used to be my ""go to"" person for all my personal problems and I worry now that I've tired him out from dumping all my problems on him. Ever since that incident he's definitely talked to me a lot less, and I've been so embarrassed about it. So from then I didn't want to get too attached to him again, because I feel like I've caused him enough trouble. But I admit I really want to be close to him again, except now in a less burdensome way.

I don't know what you are all thinking after reading that. I guess the question I have is,
1) Do you have a friend who you genuinely feel very affectionate towards and care for a bit more than you think you should?
2) Is uh... what I'm feeling towards this guy ""normal"" for a ""friendship""?",10Oct2017,3

129,"I'm going to keep this as short as I can. Apologies if this is long-winded...

I'm frozen. I'm 23 and graduated university last year with a degree in Radio Production. I always had an interest in music and loved introducing people to new music. I can't play any instruments, but I do have a good natural rapport and find myself quite 'stage-oriented' and love throwing myself infront of people to perform, so it seemed a natural choice. I graduated with a 2:1. fast-forward a year and I'm living with my 2 best friends from university. I love them and would honestly follow them to the ends of the earth, but life isn't like that, we all go our seperate ways in the end.

That's exactly what's happening now, with both of them deciding to go to different parts of the world, leaving me with 1 month to either find 2 new flatmates, or move into a new place. It's not going well, despite advertising relentlessly online. I enjoy my current job, I work in an independent record store. The pay is only slightly over minimum wage though, and the 'driving milestone' is still yet to be achieved. I've been in the job a year now, and I'm scared. Why? I like the job and I realise how lucky I am to be able to listen to music all day, get music for cheap and so on, but there's NO career progression, and soon all of my friends won't even be here. I'll be alone. Stuck in a job that I'm too scared to leave with an (essentially) useless degree.

A big part of me wants to escape, maybe work abroad, but I have no idea what paths would be open to me. I need a career now that would enable me to earn a decent wage and start progressing towards adult milestones such as getting on the road, saving for a house, etc. I've dug deep and searched within myself to find 'my calling' but I still have little ideas. I've flitted from ideas of going into counselling (I'm very good at talking to people, have a natural charm and have dealt with a massive amount of issues within my family), to possibly a career within the music industry - but most of those jobs require experience that I just dont have, as well as the ability to drive which i don't yet possess. before working here I worked 3 months in a regular clothing retail store. I hated it. I felt awful and every minute I spent there felt wasted. I was so upset thinking that I had all these dreams, only to have them shattered and mashed into a no-hope job filled with 30 year-olds who had no ambition. Those 3 months terrified me. There's no way I'm even considering going back to that kind of work.

I've always been very headstrong and I pride myself on my independence, but right now I feel completely lost. If I am still here this time next year I will be completely alone, with only coworkers for company. I always had it in my head that I'd find a music-related job in bristol and move there (currently in cheltenham) but it's looking impossible. There are no jobs related to what I'd like to do (which at this point is, if I'm being sensible, either music-retail or music distribution to retail stores). I refuse to work a shitty retail job that pays nothing. That's what I'm doing now but at least it's within a field I have a passion in, and isn't totally embarrassing to tell people about. 

What the hell do I do? Do I go mad and head to australia for a work-away? I have almost £2000 saved... I understand you guys can't give me a plan for my life, but I'd love to hear from people who've been in a similar situation. Or if anyone could give me advice on getting a career within music industry/distribution or record label careers. I feel goddamn hopeless and it's driving me crazy.

My grades are showing up as low for 2 classes.

I made up the assignments, but those 2 teachers happen to be pregnant and obviously are going to take longer to grade. They even told us.

I keep telling my worried parents that I did my part and retook the assignments and I'm just waiting on the teacher. But do they listen? No. Every single day these past few weeks they've been pestering me asking the same thing. They think I'm struggling. But the teachers are struggling to grade. I keep telling them that, but they just go back to square 1.

I made a post on /r/ApStudents asking what to do but nothing worked.

Also, I sleep late at night. 3 am to 4 am normally. I have to wake up at 7 am for school. That may not seem like a lot of sleep for a 17 year old but I nap like a hog after school for 3-4 hours normally, so that basically makes up the sleep.

I got caught staying up late today and my parents again accused me of my grades and thought I was fooling around all night. Yes, I did procrastinate a bit, but I was doing my work.

They think I won't function in school but in reality I've been doing just fine these past few months with the current sleep schedule. The teachers haven't been doing fine with entering grades though.

135,"Long story short, I had a fairly cushy, if not sometimes difficult sales job that I really excelled at. The atmosphere at the company had been turning somewhat sour as of late, so I left to go to a much smaller company, but one that had a great reputation as a great place to work. The atmosphere is nice, but the actual work is a nightmare for me, and I feel that it’s quite different than described in my interviewing/onboarding process. It’s been making me genuinely unhappy, and I want to leave.

I called my old bosses (it’s been just over two weeks since I left) last week, and was informed that they really want me back and have several spots open, but would have to pay me as a new hire, and I would start from square one (about a 30 thousand dollar paycut over what I’ve been making). I pushed the issue with HR, as well as with upper management, but was told there are no exceptions, policy is policy, and nothing can be done. They told me they would help me try and secure another sales job at the company in a different department, and while I have great qualifications for it, the work would be similar (though not the same) as my new job, and I’m not sure I’d love it, or feel the same way I do about this current job.

I have a house, and some fairly big expenses coming up in the next year or two, so I can’t justify a $30,000 paycut or realistically move out of the area I’m in (Upstate New York). I have a Bachelor’s in Communications and extensive sales experience, but not much else outside of a bit of management experience. I’d quite frankly love to get out of sales, but there is not a lot of opportunity that I can find in the area for jobs in the $70,000 plus range that don’t require a specialized degree.

What are some good industries to get into where I don’t need to go back to school that I can do from anywhere? How do I deal with the creeping thought that I messed up my life (no suicidal thoughts or anything like that, just been fairly depressed since I realized I don’t like my new job and can’t go back to my old)?",10Oct2017,4
137,"Hello everyone!
I am currently 17 year old boy living in Melbourne Australia who is graduating and finishing highschool in couple of weeks. I have been abused by my family (or my father to be specific) like violence and emotional damage which drove me to thinking of committing suicide which I have not due to wondeful friends.

I have come to the point where I point out my father's misdoings and have called him out which initiated fights (he is in denial and my siblings and mother agree with me). These numerous times got me to think I should move out once I become an adult (its 18 here). Its soon my birthday and I do not want to spend any more time at my house. What I would like from this lovely community is if anyone has experienced such difficulty where they have no access to financial support and away from family, please tell me how you got through uni or how I should plan this out.

Tl;dr
I have an abusive father and want to move out. I have no money and will attempt to get in uni. Pls give me advice on how to survive with no shelter and money.",10Oct2017,1

Please I need some help. ",10Oct2017,1
141,"I have been aloof for at least 6 years and can deduce that it is due to several major emotional hits (not emotional breakdown, but shutdown). I was OK with it but as I have recently gone to university which the environment I found is less depressing, stressful, competitive and people were better, I realised I repressed my feeling for too long - I am not emotionless at all as what the majority (or everybody?) from the past thought of me, I just ignored feelings and incline onto my rational side - and now I couldn't be less passionate abt the surrounding except me although I want to be more caring. Even when something stirs my emotions, I either react with anger, sarcasm (stems from cynicism) or just an emotionless tone and I'm starting to hate this numb feeling. 


For what I think causes my shutdown, here I break it to you chronologically (number 4 triggered me to write this post since it is made apparent that I push genuine people away too, AND I WANT TO MAKE AMENDS): 

1) When I was little, my mother (and occasionally my father) always scolded me. They were SO bad-tempered and threatened me in order to obey them jesus christ (my dad still does this today sometimes but I just use logic or apathy to hit back), and my parents now whine abt how I could be so cold to them -_- I used to cry a lot but then one day, I think around 7 y/o, I swore that I would never cry again and after then, every time I got scolded I just ignored my sadness and move on (because I hope for a better future and outcome, still applies today), which eventually made me aloof (dead inside).

2) In primary school years, there was this psychopathic mama's boy who has accused my friends and me for bullying him for 2 years, which is not the case because he made that all up, but his mum believed everything without witnessing anything since those ""accidents"" ""happened"" in school. (Luckily, other classmates were also victimised so they knew we were clean.) This made me think that people are dangerous. 

3) In secondary school years, I was ~60% aloof but I think I have already built a very defensive wall that my words were made up of sarcasm, anger, and aloofness. It became apparent after my fallout with my first best friend during the period which hurt me a lot and I went on like this for at least 5.5 years. As I reflect, some of my friends are also manipulative and cold, so I must act strong in order not to be controlled. Also, the environment of the school is bureaucratic, so the whole atmosphere was quite cold. Nonetheless, I tried to be warmer and made some good friends, but we were never as close as my cold friends and none got into my heart/truly knew what I thought, partly because I don't want them to find my weak spot.

4) I've gone to exchange this summer which had the warmest atmosphere that may be due to the nature of people's professions which require their warmth, e.g. doctors. However, I was already cool-headed and aloof by then that I am too cautious of people's intentions, esp. when someone is suddenly nice to me. There was an older, sensitive girl who was secretly interested in me for a while and clung onto me suddenly but I seemed to be rational all the time such that I wasn't as zealous as her. At hindsight, she was a bit shy, extroverted introvert, but was not extroverted at all when around me so NOW I KNOW sth's up to her. This is how someone who is interested in me goes unnoticed due to my aloofness caused by several hurtful experiences before. Now we are separate apart in different continents. Idk when again I will find someone who is deeply in love with me (be it a friend or a lover) and I feel the same way. I really really hope we meet soon and still feel the same way towards each other.

This is the point where I regret losing one of my potential soulmates and I couldn't bear my aloofness anymore. I still want to be rational, but I also want to be more sensitive and less cynical, yet I feel that sarcasm and cynicism have deep-rooted in my veins. Another blessed curse is that I read ppl's minds easily (which is proven to be correct most of the time), and they are usually bad motives which accentuate my scepticism of others'.


So my major concerns are

1) What should I do to become less aloof???

2) HOW TO MAKE AMEND FOR SITUATION 4???",10Oct2017,3
142,"Even though I'm generally seen as a jolly person with some nice qualities, talents and stuff, I always get myself into these very hurtful situations somehow, where the world seems to be against me. It's like I'm stepping into the same shit over and over again and never seem to see a way around. Recently I read this article that made me realise that I keep on victimising myself (avoiding own responsibilities but taking other people's stuff on my shoulders, always 'failing', panicking more and more, cannot meet my goals, unconsciously seeking love throughout pity). Now, I never wanted to admit that, but I think that's my problem. I keep on putting myself into a victim's position.
Now, I know I'm not the only one doing this, so I'm wondering - how did you stop victimising yourself and accepted yourself as you are, with all your imperfections? How did you manage to get out of the habit of making excuses and taking full responsibility of yourself? ",10Oct2017,6
145,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years now. Most of which has been at an hour and a half away. That's too far to commute to school and work for me or her. I graduate university in 6 months and my girlfriend and myself plan on moving in together so we can get away from our see each other on the weekend only relationship. 

The catch is, her mother, who my gf has been financially supporting for 4/5 years (along with her 14 year old brother), still doesn't have a job or a means to live on her own. 

Any mention of a job or us moving in together sparks anger. She says she has fibromyalgia and cannot work (per a doctor?). If that's the case, she should get disability, which she does not. She gets no kind of assistance also. The only income she gets is maybe 100$ a week from babysitting and cleaning her friends house, if she feels like working and doing it. 

I love my gf but I don't plan on moving in there and suddenly my income becoming her mothers, also. Her mother will take her debit cards and not even ask because ""it's for the house"". I work hard for everything I have and so does my gf. It's not right that she's parenting her parent. 

My gf and I have discussed cutting the cord and moving out even if she isn't ready but my gut tells me that the woman I love doesn't have the heart to leave her mother and brother in a bind when she leaves the nest. I'm worried her moms lack of motivation is gonna keep us from moving out.

Last week he and I were talking about one of the girls at a bar and he was trying to convince me she's ""*really* cute!"" 

J.D (one of his friends) overheard and then told the girl I like her. I don't. This information was fed to me by my friend, the girl said she isn't interested.

As such next time I saw her I politely and told her that there had been a misunderstanding and that I don't *like* her. I did this because I would like someone to do this if I liked them and because I wanted to be clear and forward. J.D. had mis-remembered who was saying ""She's very cute."" 

Now she's pissed at me and hates me and rants about how bad I am even though we hardly know each other. My friend says I insulted her by being so forward and that because I don't know her it came off as being disingenuous and offensive. He also said I'm missing a filter and should've known better.

A few years ago at work someone retired (leaving one other to do the specific job) and I was pulled in to help do a procedure when the other person was on vacation. I was fine with it and the training was quick. 

Now initially I was only covering this a few weeks a year. Back in July, the other person retired and now I’m stuck covering this procedure every other day. They did end up training another person for it but it’s not her primary job either. 

We were told this wouldn’t last too long but they cannot find someone to hire. It’s a dying field and not a common one. 

The reasons I hate doing this is that’s it’s completely disruptive of my day. I have to leave my off campus job to the main campus (about a 15 minute drive). It’s also a lot of waiting for other people involved. I get there and it’s common to wait around for 30 minutes or more. There’s nothing I can do at the main campus either. My job stuff is off site. So I end up sitting around waiting and just getting more angry. 

My manager has sat with us and talked about the lack of applicants but what can I do? I can’t just say no I’m not doing this anymore.

166,"Hello. A rental car employee hit me while I was backing out of a parking space in another rental car. The police report is very vague (airport police) and I was interrupted by the officer while he was taking the report and I was trying to explain what happened. He said he was just there for the basics. He now is my only point of contact to amend the report to include an injury and clarification, but he won't get back in touch with me and I feel he's probably pissed that his work needs to be edited.

Here's what happened:

At 6 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017, I rented a car at a local airport from Budget. I am local and was leaving the next morning to go to the beach to visit friends and compete in a Strongman competition. I located my car, adjusted my mirrors and seat, turned to check clearance behind me before backing up and realized there was a car stopped in the ongoing traffic lane behind me. He noticed I was trying to back up and he backed up to give me room to get out. I turned to look over my right shoulder to make sure he was out of the way. He waved me on and I waved back. I turned and looked over my left shoulder and saw no one, then turned to look back over my right shoulder since that is the direction I was backing up toward. All was clear and I proceeded to back up cautiously. I was just about to press the brake and put the car in drive so I could pull forward, when I felt a large impact. It pushed the car forward and my head began to hurt immediately.

I put the car in park and got out. A gentleman came over to ask if I was okay and I saw that there was a woman in the vehicle that hit me. I started walking toward her to make sure she was okay and she jumped out of the vehicle and started screaming and cursing at me. Another gentleman (the one who'd backed up to give me room to get out), told her to calm down, but she turned to him and yelled and cursed some more. I was shaking and was very upset; I did not say a word to this woman. I did not know if she was armed or what she might do as crazy as she was acting. She argued with the other gentleman for quite a while. She insisted that I hit her, but both men said she came flying through the parking lot, passed the stopped car, had her head down (may have been on her cell phone) and hit me. She told me if she had seen me, she wouldn't have let me hit her. I did not hit her and she would have been able to see me if she had not had her head down. I was backed up far enough into the lane that I was about to proceed forward.

I then learned she was an Alamo employee. When the Budget and Alamo representatives showed up, she calmed down and kept a smirk on her face as she told them all that I backed up not looking and hit her. I was still in shock. I have never been involved in anything like this and have never seen someone as belligerent as her to a complete stranger. I was thinking of her welfare and wanted to make sure she was okay when I got out of the car. She did not care enough to ask if I was okay, but immediately began yelling and cursing. I almost brought my one-year-old daughter with me when picking the car up. All I could think of was what would have happened if my little girl would have been that close to that impact.

I eventually received another car from Budget and went home. My head continued to hurt and my neck began hurting on the left side - since my head had been turned to the right looking behind me when she hit me from that side. My left arm began having numbness and tingling. I got an emergency appointment with my chiropractor who made sure that nothing was fractured, broken or bleeding internally. He adjusted what had been jarred out of place. My neck was sore until Sunday and my head hurt most of Friday. I was very upset and did not know if this would affect my performance in my Strongman competition. This was a very important competition to me and the combination of the injury and the paranoia of someone hitting me while driving on my trip was enough to really stress me out. I kept replaying her actions in my head over the next few days.

Budget has a statement from their employee who saw her hit me, the airport police has a report with my statement and herstatement, my insurance has all the information they need - including the injury, as the numbness and pain occurred after the police report was filed. 

However, as I said, the police officer interrupted me when I was trying to give him a detailed report of what happened. He also did not talk to the witnesses as they were ""not important"" he said. The accident report basically says I said she was going too fast through the parking lot and hit me as I was backing up. It says she said I wasn't looking when I backed up and hit her as she was driving by. I have been told by the claims person with Budget that if the insurance companies cannot come to a resolution, it will ultimately come down to the police report and will become my fault as I was the person backing up. This was very clearly not my fault and I am unsure of how to proceed to make sure this is known and I am not left with the consequences of someone else's actions.

tl;dr - Woman passed another car waiting on me as I was backing out of a parking space. She ran into me. Told officer I was backing up and not looking. Officer cut me off when I tried to explain. Did not take statements from witnesses. Accident in airport rental car parking lot. Not sure how to avoid being held responsible for something that was definitely not my fault.",10Oct2017,1

After that, the regional began text book harrassment making my work life hell. The final action was when she told me to start a file of made up complaints against a tenant that she personally didnt like because the tenant was muslim. I told her that was against fair housing and told her I wouldnt be a part of that and that as the regional she needs to hold the standard higher.

174,"Alright, so this may be a bit long but I want to make sure you get everything because I really need some good advice on this.

- It won't be humble or pretentious, just honest except for names
- My english won't be perfect, but I'm gonna do my best!

First, I'm a guy, french, software engineer in a small company in the US and I work a lot (this company is very important to me because I helped founding it).

There is this girl, french too, she studied in the US and she works in the same company but not in the same city.
I already met her IRL multiple times and using slack as a messaging app, we happen to chat in private from time to time about work, video games or tv shows we like, anything really.

We also have video group calls once a week (everyone in the company is connected) so we at least see each other during these meetings.

One day, she sent me a message during evening, she wanted to talk more than usual and that's we did. 
It continued during few days, sometimes she was sending the 1st message (to engage), sometimes it was me.
That's when I started to like her and to believe she liked me too (just a little bit!). 
I mean she plays Zelda, she likes Rick &amp; Morty, Futurama, rhum, and she's pretty, how awesome is that?
But then, after these few days she just ignored my 1st message, so I waited more than a week... and nothing. Ouch!


So I told myself *alright, she doesn't care much about you, she was just chatting and being friendly that's all, let this go, do not send her any new message and forget about it*

During 9 days, we didn't talk at all and this was all good until last week. 
She actually came to visit our office, spending the week in the same city.
Since she has no cars and was staying at a place near my home, I was her driver (almost as good as a uber driver, I deserve the 5\*! (I mean less than 5 means getting fired anyway))

Before coming, she finally talked to me, and said ""Prepare yourself because we're gonna drink and drink and drink more! Here is my number: ...""

I was thinking *How cool! Even if I don't care much about her, we're all gonna have a good time* because we usually don't go out much with my colleagues and this was a good occasion.
(I think I was lying to myself about not caring much, that was my pride talking I guess)

Each morning, I was whatsapp-ing her something funny/original to tell her I was waiting for her outside in my car.
Each night, we were going out sometimes with my colleagues and sometimes just the two of us, depending on who was available (all my colleagues have families)

When we were just the 2 of us, it felt a bit uncomfortable, like we were both kind of shy, maybe because 2 single co-workers going out at night just sounds like a date.
Maybe it was just me because that's exactly when I started to fall in love with her (you know like my stomach feels weird and your dopamine is not really in control anymore (which is kind of funny (or sad))). 

Anyway, it just happened... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I don't know about you but when I like someone, I'm just not myself, I'm really nervous about everything, I can't talk, I'm not funny anymore, it's just horrible. Like the worst version of myself.
But I fought. Oh yeah I fought hard, maybe wasn't enough but I tried. I memorised some topics so there were less long pauses in our conversations, I simulated feeling at ease (I was really not though), and some little things. I think I talked about boring stuff sometimes but that was not as terrible as I expected. Usually it's far worse (like *how.. are you... doing... ok me too.. bye...*)
I don't think I was a lot of fun but at least I was ok! (I hope)

The Friday night, we went to a bar, again just the 2 of us, talked few hours and went home.
Knowing she was leaving the Saturday and the bus station was 20 mins away, I told her: *tell me when your bus leaves so I can get you there!*
She answered something like *I don't have my bus ticket yet, but ok*.
I started thinking like maybe after a week with me, she didn't want to spend more time with me and wanted some space, so I didn't insist much.

The Saturday morning, I couldn't help myself and I told her one last time *don't forget to tell me when your bus leaves, it's gonna take 5 mins and you'll be there*, and she seemed relieved, she replied *I have to admit, my luggage is heavy so a good car would be welcome. But only if it's ok for you!*

So I got her there, and told her how cool this week was and that ""we all"" looked forward to seeing her soon again (*we all* = I of course)

She replied something like: *yeah it was really great for me too! I really enjoyed the whole week, and... see you in slack or whatsapp!*

Actually I just suppose that's what she said because I only remember hearing ""...great...slack or..."", I wasn't really listening, I was just looking at her. She's so great.

Now I'm back to were it was, few-messages-land (or even ignore-land sometimes).

I'm so confused right now. I mean obviously she doesn't seem to like me the same way I do, I'm fully aware of that ( It's even clearer now that I read this post :( ), she never gave me any reason to believe otherwise. On the other hand:

1. she is really shy so I may have missed something
2. we work in the same company so it's really risky to cross any line, even on a subtle level (I don't even know if she's attracted to guys/girls/ponys). I'm not ready to cross that line if I don't believe a little bit that she likes me.
3. after a week with her, I'm 90% sure she is single
4. maybe she didn't notice / don't suspect I like her this way so she just acts as usual

Anyway, she is supposed to come back in 3 weeks or so and I may change my strategy.

MY FELLOW REDDITERS, I've been reading and commenting a lot in reddit, this is the first time I ask for your help: what do you think? what should I do?

- Get rid of my fear, be awesome and try to make her understand a little bit how I feel? If it seems like a good idea, know this: I'm really bad at hitting on someone, everyone at my work may know and it would be so weird to work with someone that rejected you. I really like this job, I don't want to screw that up.
- Or just be awesome, ignore her the same way she does and move forward. This sounds like the less attractive option I know, but I don't see the point of exposing myself if I'm 60% convinced she doesn't care. 

PS: french don't know anything about girls either, that was all a lie...

189,"Hi guys, this is a throwaway account. I need some advice and help. Sorry if this turns out to be a long read.

I graduated high school in 2016, and for a few reasons, I was forced to take a year off instead of going straight into post-secondary. This was a tough year for me mentally as I really wanted to start school again right away, so I could get it done faster. Fast-forward to 2017, I am in an engineering program at the moment. I really wanted to get into this program, even more so after missing that entire year of high school.

I started school in the beginning of September. This program is not what I expected it to be, and most days I feel miserable. My grades are mediocre and I am passing all my classes, but this may not be the case soon since I just had a huge midterm and it did not go well.

In my heart, I do not want to continue this program given that I am unhappy and miserable for the most part. On the other hand, my family, friends, and girlfriend know how badly I wanted to do this program, and to do well in it too. So I feel as if I was to discontinue this program and pursue something else either next semester or next fall, I would be letting everyone down. Including myself. I wanted this so bad and that is why this hurts even more. My girlfriends support through that tough year after high school was amazing, and I do not want to let her down. I know my parents would see it as me wasting another semester or year if I discontinued this program.

I am at crossroads. What should I do?

Thank you for your help, anything is appreciated as I feel lost and depressed.",10Oct2017,3
192,"I'm 26 years old. I make 80k a year. I'm in a very powerful union and cannot be fired. Seriously, ppl who are drunk or high on the job don't get fired. I have great health benifits and a pension. And, to top it all off, can fully retire at 54. And I mean FULLY retire. Check out of life; I'm done, retired.

But....

I'm unhappy. I'm bored  I'm unfulfilled. I feel like lost potential. I had hopes and dreams for myself and I can see them slipping away. I feel like a cog in a machine; another nameless piece toiling away for someone else. I feel unappreciated and sad. 

My body hurts from the 12 hour shifts. I'm tired from working rotating nights and days. I commute. I breath in dust and stone fines. And on some days: honest to god cancer causing carcinogens.

I'm thankful for the union, but it causes a lot of drama. I can't move up. I'm stuck behind guys as young as me who've only got their high school diploma. Guys who's only previous work experience has been pumping gas or flipping burgers (Their father's got them this job). And because I'm so junior I am forced to do the shit nobody else wants to do while they hide and sleep. The animosity in the air is toxic.

I got here because of debt and fear. I graduated from university 4 years ago. I had debt. Lots of debt. Nobody was hiring. My industry of choice was in a time of transformation. I couldn't even land a part time unpaid internship. Seriously. And, even if I did, how was I going to pay rent and intrest? So I got a job.

I saved every single dollar. I moved back home. I lived in a shared apartment with strange men in one of the worst areas. Drugs, guns, hookers, my street had it. But I paid my debt off. 

Then I got this job, and the money started poring in. I saved some more and bought a triplex. I am a success. I make more than 95% of ppl I know. I've been smart with my money and am on pace to have a very wealthy retirement. 

I never wanted to be doing this. I grew up in a small farming community and always dreamed of escaping. I wanted to go into publishing, journalism, or copywriting. Something with words. I even considered teaching. But nobody was hiring. Not for teachers, not for editors, and especially not for writers. 

So now I'm at a crossroads. I can keep my life. I will have all my needs met and I can retire early. Ppl will continue to envy my life and success. Hell i can even invest mire and buy more property too!

Or

I can start over. 

I can go back to school for 1 year. Take a copywriting program and get a 25 to 30k job as a bottom rung copywriter. Then work my way up over time. 

I could ride my bike to work. I wouldn't have to breath in dust and carcinogens. I could go home at 5 every day. I could do something fun and creative, something I want to do, every day. 

But there's no guarantees.

My generation has no job security. We have no pensions. No health benifits. We are part time or contract workers. This is our reality. 

The fact I have one of the only jobs left that has a pension and health benifits and steady income and security is insane.

But I hate it. And, more importantly, I'm not proud of myself.

So here's the question: what would you do? What should I do? Is starting over only to join the millions of other millenials fighting it out over freelancer/contract positions worth it? Would it be ridiculius to make a massive career change for something like copywriting? Am I being a millennial baby? Should I just grow up? If this was any other generation they would be happier than pig in shit to be where i am. Should i forget my degree and childhood dreams and accept that I'm in a good place and just make the best of it?

Thank you

195,"So I met a girl almost a year and a half ago. I went for a part time job at her university. While I was working, she approached me with her friend and asked for my number. I was a foreigner in their country and they wanted to speak English. The three of us went out for a drink a week later. One of the girls, lets call her Lucy has a boyfriend. So the other girl, Annie, was talking with me more. At the end of the night, Annie asked for my number, since only Lucy had it. We talked a lot. We went out a couple of times, and even invited her to my University for a festival. We talked almost everyday. Eventually I got the confidence to tell her how I felt, she told me she had a boyfriend. I was kinda surprised, but she told me that it was a long distance relationship, and they don't really meet and have no plans in the nearby future to meet. Since he lives on the other side of the world. I told her that I am gonna stop contacting her, since she has a boyfriend and I dont want to be a part of it. I did however tell her that if she has any feeling for me, she should tell me. She said that she wants to try making things work with her boyfriend. She then said that she really doesn't want to stop talking with me. I told her its a bad idea, and I do not feel comfortable. About 7 or 8 months passed and she contacted me for my birthday. She said that she would like to hang out with me. I thought it has been long enough and maybe I have gotten over her, maybe even be friends with her. We started hanging out, but this time as friends. She even tried to ""find"" me a girlfriend.(Did not work) We have now been hanging out for a couple of months, and about a month ago she got accepted to study abroad, to where her boyfriend lives. Over this few months we got pretty close as friends. She finally left for a year on her study abroad. To be honest, I knew from the very beginning that her and her boyfriend will not work out. I didn't say anything to her and wanted her to make her own decisions cause she might take it the wrong way. When she asked for advice I gave it to her. About 3 or 4 weeks ago, she broke up.(Shocker) We started talking more, a lot more. Since she now lives in another country the time difference is quite a lot, but we still call almost everyday. Every since she broke up though the tone of our conversation has changed, it feels a little more flirty. She always says she wishes I was here and just small little things like that. In February I am planning to visit my cousins who live near here, and she was super excited when I told her I was coming. A few days ago she was talking about going out on a dates. (No one in general). I then asked her, ""What if I asked you out""? She replied ""when""? I told her for her birthday, since I will be there. She said yes and seemed pretty happy about it. She asked where I was gonna take her on the date. I described a pretty romantic date. She said "" I can't wait"". Now I am right back to where I started a year and a half ago. Only this time she doesn't have a boyfriend. We have gotten really close with each other and when we talk it feels so nice. We can talk for hours. Im pretty good at making her laugh and when she does I feel so satisfied. I want to tell her how I feel. Im just afraid she doesn't feel the same way. I really dont want to lose her, but I can't sit around and do nothing either. If I see her dating someone else now, it will probably hurt a lot and I dont think I can remain friends with her. So any advice is welcomed.

199,"TL:DR my dad has smoked for about 40 years , he’s a stern bastard who gets sensitive when I tell him to quit.

My dads been a smoker since I was born, it pissed my mum off. He used to smoke in the house and in the car when I was a kid and  it never really bothered me. I went to go live with my mum after they split for about 8 years and I have recently moved in with my dad to help him with work and also for education. I am in a van most days with him and he always smokes, we cover up to 12 hour journeys doing very laborious work and he will have a sterling super king red cigarette every 40 minutes to an hour. He will always make sure he has a pack of 20 on him at all times. Losing my desensitisation to smoke when I living with my Mum , the smoking is really getting on my nerves (and on my clothes and hair). Cigarettes make me feel sick and I feel fucked over that I’ve been inhaling smoke for all my childhood , could I have been more athletic in my childhood ? Better at sports ? Less short of breath now and then? (nothing I can do about that now)

I read into the effects of second hand smoke and I don’t want to suffer any longer especially since I’m 19 and don’t want the effects to pile on into my 20s. If I could tell him to “knock that shit off” I wouldn’t be on here unfortunately but he can be a grumpy old bastard when he’s not had a cigarette and although he says he wants to stop he will 1V1 quick scope you on Rust if you tell him you want him to stop. 

Someone help me out , I also live with my step mum who smokes and I can’t fucking stand it anymore . My lazy ass jobless step brother and other brother have started smoking pot and tobacco and it’s driving me fucking ballistic. 

Basically I am sick of cigarettes and also thinking about how many years this habit has shaved off my dads life (but not my step mums , fuck her .

Now, paranoid me went and found another job within a couple weeks because my funds are a bit low after paying off all those bills (only a few hundred in the bank). Where I need advise is this: I need money, but the new job (way less stressful than the one I quit and pays decent) is a long commute, long hours, and it’ll take away time I need to finish my degree. Without the new job, and sticking to my original plan, I could finish my final projects and graduate within 2-3 weeks and then look for full time work. And although my funds are low, I still have no rent or bills for another 2 1/2 months. 

I live in a large city (Bay Area, CA) with many opportunities in the field i am about to graduate in (education) and finding a job is relatively easy with the proper credentials. Would you guys keep the job just for money’s sake, or stick to the original plan of taking the time off work to stay home, finish within a few weeks and then look for work, even though you may be really broke when that time comes?

I was in a very long relationship with my ex-girlfriend and the last two years of that relationship weren't working out so well. So, we tried to break up several times, but always failed. Finally, I did break up with her, and I had rough times to get over her, but I was doing okay after some time passed.

Several months passed by, everything seemed to be fine. Recently, I had a chance to have a drink with my ex-girlfriend's roommate (female) who also happens to be my female best friend. I'll call her Anna in this story. She is an amazing, wonderful person.

Long story short, Anna and I had a drink at my place with another good male friend of mine (I didn't want to drink alone with her as I considered that really weird). We all got pretty drunk, and went to sleep. Few hours passed, I woke up in the middle of the night, and found myself touching Anna sexually while she was asleep. I immediately stopped. I was in a panic state and felt so ashamed of myself. 

Few more hours passed by, we all split up back to our own places. I messaged Anna about what I had done and she kept asking if I was sure that it wasn't a dream. Then, she started to remember. She was in a really confused state about the whole situation as she is a close roommate of my ex-girlfriend, and the fact that one of her best male friend touched her sexually without consent. 

We talked over messenger (she didn't want to see me personally) seriously for the past two days. She forgave me for what happened, but she firmly believes that this friendship cannot work and that she can't be friends with me anymore. When I heard she say that, I broke down. Now, I am realizing that the feelings that I had for her probably wasn't just friendship, I really must have liked her because I am having much, much harder time accepting the fact that she will be removed from my life. I am in a serious confusion about my feelings right now as well. I cried and regretted about what I did so much past few days and I can't focus on anything right now but to hate on myself. This situation is consuming my life at the moment.

I tried to convince her that there must be an another way to solve this, but she insisted that I let her go and I had to let her go because I was being selfish and she had all the right to handle the situation however she wanted. What I did was terrible and I can't reverse what happened already, but I just want to know if there could be any chance that I can have her as a friend again after this incident.

   But because of problems with my mom's mental health she got sectioned, leaving me the oldest in charge to look after rest of family and deal with her debts, during that time I was this close to being homeless.
   Because I was busy I couldn't keep up with my friends online so they all eventually dropped off.
   
   Fastforward a year and a half and I'm living in my own place, and my finances are stable, but I haven't properly enjoyed drawing ever since, every time I try drawing I just think it's awful and I can't bring myself to continue, it feels like the artistic part of myself has broken.",10Oct2017,3
209,"ok so here's some context. i started dating a good friend last year, she dumped me over summer, seemingly out of the blue. i decided that we had to have zero contact to give myself time to heal. And i know i am not over her yet, but at this point it is taking forever. normally i would just never talk to them again and move on with my life. but we have a lot of mutual friends, some of which i haven't spoken to for months trying to keep zero contact. but this is starting to bother me, i want to hang out with these people. ew attend a small ish (about 2k students) college so its almost impossible to completely avoid each other and trying is starting to get annoying. 

so my question is simple, when do you think its reasonable to start talking to an ex again, if ever. or should i just try to avoid them forever.

210,"I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to put this. There's so much happening right now. There's been about 40 days in the school year so far and I've had 5 of them off and that's like 87% which is definitely poor. I do not intend to keep it this way and would like to achieve a relatively good attendance this year.

Yet again, I will not go into detail on that because I'm sure you won't enjoy  the details. That's the backstory but the main thing is what do I do? Seriously?

Every morning we have to take our puppy outside, however we rotate every other morning and on the mornings she takes the puppy outside the man on his apartment patio calls cat calls to her, except he doesn't quit after she ignores him and instead he gets louder and will apparently start threatening to slap her and teach her a lesson. I've never personally seen him do it because he doesn't make a peep when I go out with her. I also don't have any recorded evidence of this. I was hoping he would back off after realizing I lived with her but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I need advice to resolve a conflict between me and my best friend. I am a male, arround 20ish years old and my best friend is a female arround the same age. Not sure if this is relevant to the story. Anyway. 
  
Last friday we were both a bit drunk and got into a fight because I overeacted to something stupid. I wanted to talk it out right away to solve the conflict and go back to being friends but she refused to discuss it. I've tried my best to give her some space and asking if we are good. She says we are not, however she doesn't wanna talk about it and says that if I just gives it time it will pass. 
  
I however feel like I wanna talk about it. I overreacted and was an idiot and just wanna talk it out. I think it's mostly my fault and I want my friend back now. 
  
In any given situation I always talk a lot with the person involved in it conflict or not. I never leave anything untalked about. I am worried that not talking about this is leaving the situation in her mind as something worse than it might actually be and I am really worried that it will affect our friendship in the long term. 
   
I am a bit dumbfounded since I've not been in a fight like this with my friends since I was like 12, this seems so stupid. I have no idea what to do or how to solve it. Normally I would just ask her for advice but that is not possible, so I am taking my chances on you guys :)

221,"a girl i was friends with throughout all of my last year and by friends i mean like we hung out every single day from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep we did everything together. we lived in the same residence hall in college but weren’t roommates she lived on the other side of the building from me. she was my best friend and one of the few people i have trusted in my life time. at one point during the year i needed to go to target for something and asked if she could take me and she said she didn’t want to so i said ok and asked another friend to take me. she had texted me the moment i got out of class and asked me where i was and i didn’t get the chance to respond so she called my friend who was taking me and he told her we were going to target before i got the chance to and she got mad and pretty much blocked me on all social media and refused to talk to me essentially because i didn’t text her back. she later told me that she was upset because this made her feel like i didn’t support her and i wasn’t there for her which i guess i understood and apologized for. around the end of last year i did something pretty wrong to the guy i was seeing and i told her about it before he found out because i needed to confide in someone. eventually he found out and it started a shit storm that led to her texting me and saying she didn’t know how she felt about me anymore and wanted space so i said ok that’s fine i knew i did something wrong and that it could change the way people thought about me but she also knew about it for about a month or two prior to this and literally said to me “this doesn’t change how i look at you” after that she drove down to the area i lived in from where she lived countless times during the summer to hang out with my best friend and never reached out to me which annoyed me but i can’t control my friends or who they hang out with so i kind of just tried to let it go. we eventually started to hang out again around the end of the summer and we finally seemed good again after all the drama i finally felt like she was someone i trusted again and someone i could consider my best friend. something always seemed a little sketchy though. when we got back to school i took her to a party at the party we ran into a girl that we used to be friends with but i cut her out of my friend group because we just didn’t get along and i honestly just didn’t like her i never told my friend she wasn’t allowed to be friends with her or any of that but she cut her off as well and just followed my lead again something i never told her to do. at this same party she went up to one of my good friends and started saying that he shouldn’t be friends with me and i’m a terrible person and all these things and i’m led to believe she did the same thing to my best friend from home and that’s why we aren’t really as close as we were last year. she then left me at this party and went home with her other friends even though i’m the one that took her there. when asking her about why she said it she lied and turned it around on my friend and started crying saying nobody is a good friend to her or asks if she’s ok or whatever so when she started acting weird after that i asked her if she was ok or if she needed to talk and she got mad at me for asking which was odd but i just ignored her and we didn’t talk to a while then we both rushed a sorority she joined one and i dropped out of the process and as of yesterday her and her new “best friend” (one of the girls she left the party with but not the girl i used to be friends with) she started hanging out with all of a sudden had blocked me on all social media as in instagram, snapchat, twitter all the way down to facebook???? honestly i’m so sick and tired of being treated badly by her and i don’t miss her at all but i just wish other people could see what i see in her she walks around saying i’m a bad person but she treats her friends like this. am i missing something honestly like what did i do to deserve being treated like this by my own former best friend

My roommate built a bed which was just two wooden planks on a metal frame. It was cracking on one side and it was going to break.

The eventual unlucky guy was me which sat and broke the wooden plank. I was sorry and planned to buy him a new plank or at least get the broken one repaired.

He comes into the room and starts yelling and telling my friends to fuck off and they are cunts. (context: my friend was sitting on the other part of the two-piece bed, which was still unbroken.)

I apologized him and told him I would fix it. He pushed me aside and kept telling my friend to leave. 

I told him that he can go repair his bed himself and stop talking to my friend or this wasn't going to end pretty.

234,"I've been working with my current employer for about 6 months. I work within a small department in a larger (albeit relatively small) institution. I accepted the part time position, as I had recently relocated and had been without work for 3mths. When I interviewed, the interviewers and I discussed how it would work with the part-time classification. The institution puts a maximum amount of hours allotted to my position for the entire year, so it would average out to 29-32 hours a week. It was also heavily explained that the people within my department were fighting hard to get the institution to convert the position to be a full-time, benefited, and salaried. They had hope that it would be came to fruition over this past summer, but it did not. While all hope is not lost, the position continues to be part-time with nothing more than wage as compensation.

When I attended my first day of work, I inquired about the break down of which days I would work. I received the 'good news' that the department had enough in their budget to bring me on 5 days a week. This was do-able as there was a lapse between myself and the previous person in the position. This was totally unexpected for me since we spent the conversation during the interview discussing the 4 days a week route. I agreed that I could be here full time because that would mean more money. Also, because full time employment is what I need/want anyway.

Given the nature of the institution, there are several breaks through out the year and observed national holidays. All of which are unpaid for me! On top of any sick days that I may need, all is lost money! This is increasingly becoming more of an issue as the Holidays are coming around now that it is Fall season.

I have been coming to terms with the realization that I will not allow myself to remain in this position, as is, for much longer. However, since the approval of converting my position from part-time to full-time is out of the hands of my boss, I know their hands are tied.

While, my position is absolutely needed 5 days a week, the institution is deciding otherwise.  All the while, they are not feeling the ramifications of this decision. Since, I am here 5 days a week anyway because I make myself available to do so.

I feel as though I am being taken advantage of. I have a Bachelors Degree from a really great school in my state. While I have no big career plan for my degree, I believe that still affords me a certain level of standards. Also, I am a hard worker and every employer that I have had was sad to see me go. All this to say that I believe I am doing myself a disservice.

I am 100% okay with the decision to have to move on from this employer, however I am holding on for a few reasons:
1. the hope that the position will be converted to full time, benefited and salaried within the next 6 months
2. I am less than excited about job hunting again

Am I being reasonable?

TL:dr - I am working full time (40hrs a week) under a part time classification. Therefore, receiving no benefits, paid leave/sick days, etc. While my employer continues to push for the change of the position from part time to full time, it still hasn't happened.

We never confirmed her biases, or talked in a way to encourage her continuing her practices, but she is family and we did not drag her away forcefully either.

She thinks cancer is just a product of some unknown ""unhealthy"" attribute of her lifestyle, and fasting, refusing foods with high calorie intakes, taking THC oils and god knows what other holistic medicinal treatments, and avoiding to even research the cancer she has because ""if she knows the symptoms, they will manifest"". She even said that the ""Cancer isn't the problem, there is something causing it."" And she is convinced that by doing these treatments, and avoiding chemotherapy, she will live. She has two daughters, and no grandchildren, and she has been giving most of her money away to these scammers online. Short of removing her internet connection, how do I even talk to her about conventional treatment? Mention chemo and she is convinced that it will kill her and refuses. Mention surgery, and she is convinced that the doctors will harm her somehow and that Big Pharma will get her.

263,"For context: We are in our early 30s. One of my oldest and closest friends has always been interested in harmless conspiracies as entertainment, like ""Ancient Aliens"" type stuff. No big deal.

But this past year it has started to genuinely influence his worldview. As a Bernie supporter, he was disgusted by the way the DNC actively favored Clinton in the primary and by Clinton's e-mail scandal. He became extremely anti-Clinton, which I don't take issue with, but it took a conspiratorial turn. Clinton Body Bags. Seth Rich murdered by the DNC. Podesta worships Satan. The Soros Boogeyman. Pizzagate.

I thought that maybe anti-Clintonism and general dissatisfaction with democrats would be the end of it. I could cope with that. But no. He's also now a 9/11 Truther. Listens to Alex Jones. And now he thinks the Las Vegas shooting was a false flag attack.

I've seen this exact same thing happen to another former friend of mine. That friend also became dissatisfied with liberal politics, swung deep into anarcho-capitalism, and now trusts the word of anonymous posters at /pol/ more than any ""MSM"" source. I had to cut him out of my life after he called all liberals terrorists (actually, it was after I gave him the opportunity to provide nuance to his statement that would distinguish me and many of our shared friends from ISIS, and he declined). 

What do you do in this situation? I know my ideological center is very liberal, but I can deal with people close to me having a wide variety of political leanings. I can cope with my dad supporting Trump. I don't care that most of my family is religious. I don't feel tense hanging out with conservative and libertarian friends. But I'm finding it hard to hang out with someone who was once my best friend. I don't want him to call me a terrorist like my other friend did.",10Oct2017,4

She wants to double up the dosage for a short period so that's why she needs me.  It has really escalated over the last few days, where it has turned from just asking me to this, into what feels like harassment now.

I really do not know how to even address her anymore.  I know she is going through a really tough time, but what she is asking of me I feel I really can't do.  To make things worse, I actually did this ""favor"" for her a few years ago.  I really regret doing it then, I just wasn't able to stand my ground and her harassment worked.  I don't want to ever do this again, as it's unethical and illegal, and I don't know what I can say or do to either help her.

266,"So I've had this idea for a while for a food van and then hopefully (if it goes well) actually turn it into a store. 

I'm confident in the idea of it not turning out like a waste of time and money, but I've never owned a business nevermind even worked in hospitality (I'm in retail and in my first year of uni for business management) so that's kind of frightening me from the idea of giving it a shot.

I've been offered the use of a food van (which was recently purchased and fitted with equipment, passing safety inspections. Person who owns it wasn't able to use it due to injuring themselves a week after buying it) where I can just lease it on a continual short-term basis to see if it's actually going to work, or if it's gonna go poorly.

On one hand I'm like ""hey sweet, a lot of people wouldn't have this opportunity as a start up!"" but I'm also like, ""wow, I'm only 20 and I have absolutely no knowledge and I could lose money.""
I really have no idea if this is worth chasing, I'm excited about it but I'm just really scared and stressed about it.

267,"I am 19 years old, I have a low tier job washing dishes, I have no insurance, I don't have any money to spend on therapy, I can't go my parents because they will use it as an excuse to slam down hard on me and control everything I do. I don't have the money to live on my own and I've never lived on my own. 

I've been planning my suicide for over a month, having an actual plan instead of just trying to execute it and fail hard at it, I was suppose to do it at the beginning of September, didn't though, then I was suppose to do it at the end of September, still didn't, then I was suppose to do it on the first day to reach 45 degrees fahrenheit, still didn't. Its clear I still want to live but have nothing to live for. 

Seriously, just look at this plan its a shitfest. First I'm going to leave all my stuff at home besides a backpack with some supplies(no tech, for tracking reasons) and about $1400 cash, this is part of the plan I've been trying to figure out why I want to do since I'm going to die anyway, but I digress. I'll leave a note on my computer with all the information they need to get into my computers, read in detail why I did this, basically my journal for the last two years. Then, my plan is to fill my car up with gas, tell its full, and drive in a random direction on the interstate tell I run out of gas, and then hang myself at the nearest tree. My cars gas mileage on the interstate would allow me to go about 350-400 miles before I run out of gas completely which is far enough away for me not to be found for a while. The issue with this is it can fail in several ways, like if someone in my family wakes up and sees my computers on when usually they aren't in the middle of the night, or notice that I opened the garage door, I'd have at most a 30 minute to hour head start, and even then, theres no going back from this. I would have to go through with it and I'm not sure if I would.

268,"For some reason recently I’ve developed a sudden aversion to coffee. At first I thought “oh god, I must be pregnant” but it turns out that wasn’t it. I just have a sudden and very strong distaste for it, and on top of that when I try to drink it anyway I’ll have a very strong physical reaction that didn’t use to happen (at least not this strongly). Basically I’ll feel my heart pounding really hard and instead of the endless energy it used to give me, I’ll find myself energized for ten minutes and then completely wiped out for the next half hour until I can force myself to start being productive again. 


It’s really inconvenient because I relied on coffee to keep up with housework and other general responsibilities and that’s become really difficult now. 

I did try switching to a mixture of black and green teas every morning which has helped but it’s still not that crazy magic let’s-finish-all-the-things energy that coffee gave me.

My neighbor’s dog has been whining/howling/making miserable sounds for almost 36 hours now. The whole neighborhood can hear it. We have contacted my neighbor (a 19 y/o girl who has no prior experience with dogs and lives with roommates) and she said the dog just has storm anxiety (triggered by the brief thunder-less showers we’ve had the past two days?). Last we heard she gave him his anxiety meds. They had no effect on the howling as he howled all night. 

Obviously this is disturbing the whole neighborhood and kept me up all night, but I’m more concerned that the dog is being neglected. I have never seen her walking the dog, it stays in the fence 24/7 and sometimes in a pen from what she’s told us. I’ve worried about it overheating too as it is a husky breed and we live in a hot, humid climate (NC). The girl works a lot and has a bf, so I’m not sure how much she is there. I don’t want to offend her especially bc I know her from dance growing up. However, we have reached out to her several times about the dog when this has happened and it’s getting worse.

279,"Hello everyone! It is my first time posting here and I resorted to doing so because something has been troubling me since I started university this September. I am a freshman in university and it's only been a month, but I am already considering dropping out and just finding myself a miserable job until I decide what to do with my life.

I am feeling really out of place in university. I was not sure how I will fit in even when I was still in highschool. I am a person that socializes really hard and I never approach people. Since my social anxiety kicked in in highschool, I thought it would be a major problem in university, and as much as I want to blame it, it is actually the least one. I just don't think university is for me. It is hard for me to admit, but it is as simple as that.
I have missed a great number of lectures already and also. more tutorials than I should have. There is an incoming exam in less than 2 weeks and I have fallen behing so much with my studies, that I know for sure I will not pass it.

At no point in my life have I really thought about universities or future career that involves any high educational studies. Heck, 6 months ago I didn't even know what to choose to study, or if I should study at all. In the end I just rushed my decision, because application deadlines were on their way. All my life I have imagined that as a grown up person I would be successful, but not through any normal means. Reality checks keep hiting me these days, and more and more I see how much of a childish dream this is. But fuck, I don't even feel as a grown person at all.

The only reason I can remember why I applied to university in the first place is, that I didn't want to disappoint my parents. They are both workers, and I remember them telling me how hard the life of a person with no higher education can be since I was a child. Since then I have had this feeling that I need to accomplish something great in my life, so I can make my parents proud (not that I really put much effort in highschool). I still managed to get to study law in a fairly decent university. But everyday, I ask myself the question - why am I even doing this? I was going to write in this post how I am not sure if I want to continue studying. But that would be me, only trying to convince myself that part of me wants to do study. The truth is, I don't. I feel like I am walking someone else's path.

I have not shared any of this with anyone, and for sure not going to share it with my parents in the near future. I study abroad and they are coming to visit me next month. I will probably have dropped out until they come. I have no idea how I am going to tell them, or if I should tell them at all when they come. I am at a major point in my life, in which confusion has taken over reasonable thinking. I honestly have no idea what to do.
I know a lot of people have gone through similar situations, and I am asking for advice. Any helpful tips on how to get through and how to manage basic situations in life will be helpful, I think.

Thanks in advance!",10Oct2017,1

284,"My neighbor, who is a school psychologist at the local high school, has done some things that I find questionable.

For example, they like to tell me details about the children at their school - like personal details about their issues, personal details about their home and family lives, and personal details about their parents. I asked them if it was ethical for them to be sharing such things with me and they said it was fine as long as they did not name names.

There was another time when I ran into them at the gas station, and they pointed to a young teenager at the cash register and proceeded to tell me extremely private details about them, including that they had been sexually molested. I felt very uncomfortable that they were sharing such private information, especially about a minor.

Another time, this psychologist told me that they did not need to follow the DSM-V or even formal testing methods - they said they’ve been doing this long enough (over twenty years) and can usually determine what someone’s IQ is or whether they have a learning disability or whether they’re autism spectrum after talking to them for fifteen minutes. I am very skeptical that this is true.

I have a friend whose child is a student at that high school and last year, this psychologist said their child had Asperger’s Syndrome. My friend took her child to a formal Asperger’s specialist to get a second opinion, and the specialist disagreed with the school psychologist’s assessment.

290,"Recently, I have found my personality conflicting with many of the relationships I am trying to make with people. I am moderately agreeable, very very industrious and orderly, pretty introverted, have high emotional stability, and I am very open to new experiences (as long as they don't conflict with my morals or views). I love discussing things on a deeper level and it takes awhile for me to feel comfortable goofing off and having fun with someone. Now for some context.

I am a 16 year old boooy and I go to a prestigious small high school (about 25 per class at most). I am one of the smartest in the school. Half the students are resentful towards school, they don't want to have personal responsibilities, and they are generally against trying to utilize their high school to its fullest (especially since it is a very anti-bully heavy school). They're just inarticulate, incompetent, careless, spoiled little rich kids whose parents I have extreme sorrow for having to pay so much for their kid to waste it. Even the AP students are only in trying to do the bare minimum. The small few 2 students in my grade that are truly in for using their high school have been drained of their individuality and interest thanks to their 4 AP classes (they also have to resort to staying up until 1 am to finish their work and they cope with the stress through marijuana which I am not very fond of).

At the beginning of the school year, I realized that my lunch table was full of losers (of the worst kind). Their personalities conflicted with mine so much (as did the majority of the kids in my grade, I have some hidden resentment against them) that I could no longer stand to sit at lunch with them.

In an attempt to find friends who I actually connected with and enjoyed being around and talking to, my friend Jesse and I (who is the king of the losers, but he's trying really hard to improve and his effort is the only remaining likable trait about him) have been finding different tables to sit at. I found one table of interest full of thespians (thespians are really cool from my past experiences lol) and smart people"". Whenever I sit with my friend Jesse, he tells me that he is extremely nervous and uncomfortable sitting at this table. Deep down on the inside I feel the same way, but I don't let it get to me for the sake of my quest to find new people to become friends with.

Currently, Jesse is threatening to leave the table and go to the old table, and I find that the people at the table are hard to talk with (not in the same way as the kids at my old table). These kids are glued to their phones or they're talking to another one of their already established friends. Rarely do I find something to talk to them about (which usually comes up in a class and it's always the same person, the person does drugs and I don't like that, but he's admitted to never peer-pressuring people which seems to be truthful).

I am finally starting to give up and commit myself to being a loner. I want to find people who I really find interesting to talk to and who I enjoy being around. A girl I used to talk to at the table has begun to ignore me (perhaps because I was flirting and I was going to slow, which I wasn't she's just desperate but that's irrelevant). The other dude that does drugs that I talk with is cool and all, but I need to expand my circle outside of people who do drugs (which was pretty much the people at my old table).

295,"(Fair warning, this is kinda long because I honestly feel like this works better when fully written out with context and all that.)

Okay, so basically, I've got a really close friend, we'll call her ""Z"". We have/had a... ""strange"" friendship, that many people described as ""platonic dating""; we cuddled, we flirted a lot, hung out a fair bit, were fairly public about it, but it was just that; all platonic. There wasn't a relationship here, and honestly, it was really nice.

I've had feelings for her for about a year and a half, but, not wanting to jeopardize the friendship, I never said anything. She's very intelligent, fairly attractive and has a great personality, and as such, gets snatched up quite a lot. A lot of people (as of my last count, well over 30) have told us we should be an item, which, as happens with this sort of thing, has led us to discuss it a fair bit. Still, every time she ended up single and I almost worked up the nerve to say something, she ended up taken. 

About half a year ago, she ended up single for a fair while, and I finally talked myself into going for it... when a friend of ours told me he had a thing for her. So, in a moment I can describe now as ""driven by self loathing"" I basically convinced myself that she would've said no anyway, and helped to set them up. We'll call him ""O"". We explained to O how our friendship worked, he was fine with it, everything continued as normal. 

Well, their relationship doesn't really work. A lot of problems cropped up over time (nothing abusive or anything of the sort, they're just two very different people who have two very different views of how a relationship should work), and ""Z"" came to me about them. I helped fix the first few without complaint, but eventually I started getting a little frustrated. About a month ago I told her honestly when she came to me with yet another problem that I honestly didn't think they would work, but I fixed the problem regardless. Since then I've been rather honest with her about my honest thoughts on their relationship, and did my damndest to only do it logically, without letting my own personal feelings getting in the way. We ultimately end up getting rather frustrated with each other over this. 

Well, because of this, we both started (unknowingly) talking to a rather intelligent friend of ours (Call him ""H"") who has been trying to set us up for over two years, and knows how I feel. He ends up arranging a ""therapy session"" for us, where we can work out our frustrations, and to his credit, that worked rather well. We got our frustrations dealt with, hugged it out, everything was good.

Then he says ""so F(that's me), why don't we put all our cards on the table before we continue?""

At this point, I can't say no because that indicates that I'm hiding something major, I can't lie about it because H will call me out on it, and I can't evade the question because it was dead silent before he said it. So, after a few paltry attempts to play it off like I didn't know what he was talking about, despite my reservations, I felt backed into a corner and I told her how I honestly felt.

She admitted she had no feelings for me at this moment in time, which is fine, and then we discussed how she had basically been using me as the emotional side of the relationship that she wasn't getting from ""O"", which she admitted, though she hadn't been doing it on purpose. I thought nothing of it, after all, our friendship hadn't changed in any real way after I set them up, and I hadn't realized it, so I wasn't really bothered by it. 

Later that day we had a rather short conversation about our friendship, where we both agreed we didn't want anything to change, and that was that. Or so I thought; we had this conversation on a Friday, and beyond a few brief texts, didn't talk until Monday. And now everything's just... weird, and I kinda feel like more of it's coming from her. Her and ""O"" finally worked out most of their problems (apparently anyway, I noticed most of them are still there, just marginally improved upon, but whatever.), and everything seemed fine. However, when I brought up the topic of our outing for coffee (which we had planned weeks ago), she got kinda shifty about it, and quietly tried to change the subject. I figured she just felt kinda awkward about it, which was understandable I suppose, and later that day we discussed it a bit more; I made it very clear that I hadn't intended to say anything anyway, since I didn't want to jeopardize what we had, and she said that was fine, she was just tired and didn't want to think about it when she said it. 

Then today we started discussing it again when she basically says ""hey sorry, I know we've been planning this as an ""two of us"" thing for a while, but I told O that it was planned for the three of us, do you mind?"" I told her, honestly, that it kinda bothered me that she couldn't have just said upfront when we started planning it that she wanted to bring him, but I said it was fine.

But I feel like she only did that because she's suddenly uncomfortable spending time alone with me, and that honestly bothers me. I've tried to sit down and clear the air with her, but she doesn't seem to want to do so, and as such I don't feel like it's clear just how much I enjoyed our friendship for what it was.

I have no interest in losing this friendship, and despite her saying she doesn't either, I feel like it's rapidly deteriorating, and I have no idea what to do about it. Anybody have any ideas?

Edit: For reference I suppose, I don't think O dislikes me or anything, and I've nothing against him, but I really don't think he's helping the situation. I have no idea if he knows or not, but I've done my best to keep him included since she is his girlfriend. Last time I planned a me-her outing I ended up inviting him and proceedingly got kicked out (apparently without her being asked) because ""oh I just want it to be a date, we haven't had one in a while.""

We planned it literally weeks before, and I invited him about a week before we were planning to go. He pulled that about three days beforehand. Despite her saying that won't happen again, I feel like I'm going to be utterly extraneous at coffee if he can help it.",10Oct2017,1
296,"So, I'm in my first year of uni. I came to this prestigious engineering university because I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer or something. That is, until I decided I hate math with a passion. For the past few months, I've been occasionally browsing the university's major and minor catalogue. I've considered lots of majors so far, but Anthropology seems like it would open up the most doors, in terms of minors and careers. Is this the case? Any input would be appreciated.

Also, it's worth noting that I currently have not declared a major, so there are no complications there.

303,"Sorry long wall of text. 

Hi I am a 22 year old male from Oklahoma who graduated from OU this last May. I was in a 4 year long commitment to my boyfriend from high school all through college and in the final year I decided to break it off because I wanted to explore what being single was like. I got with someone in between them and there was a lot of back and forth and I actually got back with him before we moved out of the college apartment but then I broke it off again for the same reasons, and we spent the whole semester living together but being broken up. Well when we moved out I started to miss him again and once again we tried to make it work, but it's always been my decision to end it and I ended it within a couple days, I have bad OCD and I think this might have caused all this distress. I basically don't trust my own decisions but I don't like to keep him hanging if there's even a little bit of a chance I would hurt him again. I still think about him all the time and he's the only thing that gets me off sexually...which is very confusing for me because in the relationship I was only focused on what I didn't have which was other people. I seem to focus a lot on what I don't have.

So basically over the summer I didn't do anything with myself, I was severely depressed and didn't get a job or anything. I had this opportunity presented to me to move to California with some friends. My goal in life was to always be an artist at Disney or nickelodeon and art is what I want to school for, even though I hadn't been drawing or working on my portfolio at all over the summer I felt it was the best course of action since I wasn't doing anything in Oklahoma/Arkansas where my family lives. And I actually had the opportunity to snag a job in Tulsa making signs, which would have paid okay, and I would have had a comfortable apartment in Tulsa. But it didn't feel right, it didn't feel like that would make me happy, I didn't want to be known for that, and back then I had never been to California and I had rose colored glasses about it. My parents gave me a loan to come out here even though I didn't have the money. I think that's partly why I'm having a hard time, I didn't put the work in to get here it was just given to me. I feel like a brat. I also got my college paid for.

Fast forward to now, 2 months later since I moved here in August, and I feel completely isolated and depressed still. I came here to take classes at an art school and get better but I have no motivation to do them. I thought I would but my goal of becoming a storyboard artist feels really awful now. I don't wanna be behind a screen for half my life isolated and working myself to exhaustion. I'm not even excited about the END goal, and that really scares me. I think I just wanted the title to say I work at an animation studio. And I won't even put the work in for these classes. I'm also working at target and that's sort of depressing me, because I couldn't get a better job with no experience.

I want to give up. I've exhausted my parents and relatives I talk to them several times a day for hours about how I hate my life and my decisions and just wish I would have stayed with my boyfriend and stopped worrying about what I didn't have. Because the truth is, I am not wanting to be social with anyone or have any of those experiences I so desperately craved when I was with him. I think I was addicted to porn and a fantasy about sex and that really poisoned the relationship and me. I don't think he wants me at this point and he hasn't reached out to me. And usually if I text him it's very short and he doesn't seem to have time for me. And who knows, I may never have changed if I stayed with him, I am probably still the same selfish person now since I can't even see this might be a great opportunity and I'm wasting it.

If I go back home I will be living with my mom in my little brothers room. I don't know what I would be going back to. I'd be happy to see my family but after that I don't know what I would do, I've been clinging to ideas about doing things that I see my friends are enjoying like my roommate is doing really well right now as an actress, she's getting a lot of gigs and I envy her and also my ex has a great job as a vet tech. That sounds a lot more fun than my chosen career. I think I just envy what I don't have but I truly don't know what will make me happy. I'm stuck in a contract right now and have to pay rent until August. I'm worried if I drop the classes I will be excommunicated from the animation industry because the teachers are very well known and have connections and word travels fast that maybe I'm a quitter. I'm scared about starting over and going to school for something different.

I don't know what anyone could say but if there's anyone who has insight into bad decision making because I feel like I impulsively made this decision and have wasted a lot of people's money and time. I was told I'm gonna sink or swim out here and I feel like I'm sinking. I just wish things could go back to normal I was so much happier with my ex but it's just not reality anymore and I think I've broke us too much. I just don't know what to do with myself.

I try to be positive, to spend the least time possible with them, to focus on other things, get busy, but it's just not helping. My life is a struggle, getting out of my bed is fucking painful. I just want to die. I just wish someone was empathic with me, the way I am with others. I'm so lame I also hate walking around like a zombie making people pity me. People pity me.

They are frequently playing in the road, crap all over the yard, just looks like there aren't even any adults around. When we do see the father he's usually got a beer in one hand. The other day the kids knocked on our door asking for us to look for their missing bunny that got loose, they saw it run into our backyard. We happily checked but found nothing. Today my wife actually saw it in our backyard and tried to get it but couldn't. She decided to go over to the house to let the neighbors know. No one answered the knocks at the door. A little girl came to the window and said come in! So she reluctantly did. My wife was calling out for an adult but no answer. The place was littered with junk. There were even piles of dog crap everywhere. The kids looked very uncared for. Eventually the dad came out from who knows where, half dressed mind you. She told him she saw their missing rabbit.

310,"So I am 38, have been with my boyfriend for 12 years and I hate wearing a bra. I'm a little on the chubby side and am a 38C. I usually wear a t shirt then a heavy hoodie over that. No bra. You can't see nipple, nothing is tight. Plus, I figure I am a middle aged pudgy lady- nobody but my boyfriend is looking at me. 

Today I was out for sushi, reading a book, minding my own business when a woman (she looked slightly older than me maybe mid to late 40s)  came up to me, leaned down, and told me that my not wearing a bra was offensive and that I ""better rethink my priorities"". Before I could say anything (what would I have said? I was stunned) she stomped off. 

So redditors, I ask you- is it offensive if a middle aged chubby lady doesn't wear a bra in public, but isn't flaunting her bralessness? 

And for those that are going to tell me that me not wearing a bra will make them sag to my belly button in ten years- that's fine, I don't care, I'll just tuck them in my elastic old lady waistband! ;)",10Oct2017,0

313,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not really sure how to format this. I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons, but even on my main I don't post. this is my first, so please excuse the weird way my post may bounce around. Lets begin. I have little sexual history, aside from one boyfriend. I am a 16 year old female from the US. I had a boyfriend from late 2014-2017 who was six years older than me (we met when I was 14 and he was 20), and he had quite the voracious sex drive. Anytime he wanted sex I was expected to give it. He was always gentle about it, and I was happy to give it. But this required that I be horny pretty much all the time. I remember one time he even called me during math and made me have Skype sex with him in the school bathroom. I was really uncomfortable, but I talked to him and put it behind us. 

Even after we broke up (about two months ago) and I had mostly gotten over the constant horniness, however I still got horny randomly. Now, as a student in boring classes and also someone with severe adhd I find myself zoning out quite a lot. I think about my family, my dog, and most unfortunately, my little sister. Recently, one of my horny bouts happened when I was thinking of my 7 year old sister. Naturally I was very uncomfortable. I love my sister to bits and I do NOT want to be thinking about her in this way. Prior to breaking up with my ex I never had this problem. I put this incident behind me and chalked it up to a gross coincidence. However, I did not forget it. I have the tenancy to obsess about my anxieties and I was fucking obsessing over this. Trust me when I say that it freaks me out, more than almost anything. Now, despite my anxieties my random horniness did not go away.  I still got horny when thinking of random stuff. I feel like my horniness is the result of a confirmation bias. I get randomly horny when I happen to be thinking of my little sister and I only remember the times i've gotten horny that confirm my anxieties (that i'm some fucked up pedo who is into incest) and forget the ones that don't (me getting horny at random times to completely innocuous things, such as my math lesson) And soon it felt like I got horny when I thought of such things. Not just my little sister, things like my puppy, my bedside table, and even fucking gore have become triggers.

 And the fact that I get horny to such things causes me to feel guilty and disgusted at myself. My brain has associated these guilty feelings with being horny. Whenever I get horny I think of the triggers, then I get guiltier. Its a positive feedback loop of confused sexual feelings and disgust. Not only that, I cant even masturbate without feeling guilty. Last time I tried I started crying halfway through. After months of feeling guilty over this I finally worked it out in my mind, and what I wrote above is my hypothesis. My questions are: Does this seem like a good hypothesis, or am I really so messed up that id actually be attracted to an innocent 7 year old. What kind of therapist do you recommend, given that I need it ( I think I do). My parents think I'm a well adjusted individual and don't think I need therapy. How should I ask and how much information about the nature of the problem should I give them? Any other general advice, or insights to the problem that you think I missed?

TL;DR: Me, 16 year old Female has somehow conditioned herself (I think) to feeling guilty whenever she is horny. I don't think this can be condensed, just read the long version. ",10Oct2017,2

To give some background, the program replaces all of your core classes, as well as creating the mandatory (for the program) spanish class. It is mainly to get us ready for college and the real world. Instead of learning the curriculum, we basically learn things about whatever and then relate it back to the curriculum and state standards. This is a public school, and it is verging towards not being allowed at the school, but it’s still going so far. However, the teachers are not handling everything well, and with something like messed up transcripts, me and my parents are very wary of continuing the program.

I’m currently a senior in High School, and it’s homecoming time (saturday is homecoming). 
I’ve gone to homecoming all 4 years, and I’ve never had this issue, but, my parents were helping me find dress pants, as I’ve outgrown my last pair that lasted me freshman-junior year. These fit perfect until this year. (growth spurt)
They were never baggy, and they never had any visible creases, yet they were very clearly dress pants.
Yesterday, I came home with a pair i was comfortable with. They fit nice, just like the old pair did when they fit. However, my parents decided they were too tight, although they fit perfect. I was forced to take them back and get a different pair while they were with me.
Today, on the search, we found a pair i liked, yet my mother insisted I get a pair bigger, so I didn’t argue, I tried them and they were HUGE.
These things are an abomination. They’re super baggy, the creases head out a mile. But, my parents insist that these are a perfect fit.
From past experiences, I have never seen anyone at any of these dances, homecoming or prom, wear dress pants baggy like this. I’ve never stood out pants-wise, everyone has “tight” fit, and it looks 100% normal. However, with these pants, I look like i’m a 60 year old man wearing his 30 year old dress pants on his way to a funeral. Not an 18 year old going to homecoming.
From your experiences, how do dress pants fit? Should they be baggy? Should they be a nice fit?
