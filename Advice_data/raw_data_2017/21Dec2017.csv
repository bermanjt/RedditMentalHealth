2,"I posted this in r/AskReddit as well, but figured this might almost be a more appropriate place to ask.

I have already contacted and filed a police report on this attack and I hope they will respond appropriately.

First off, law wise, I live in Tennessee. My cat was being mauled to death by two huskies that live down the street (while on my property - the primary laceration was within 1/16"" of a fatal wound), and would have died had I not intervened and scared them off. In this situation, had I reacted as such, would it have been legal for me to have shot either of the dogs that were attempting to kill an animal on my property?

I'm not asking for a morality check, I'm asking if it's legal or not, but r/LegalAdvice seemed to be a little heavier than this.",21Dec2017,6

4,"I am going in for an IT internship interview tomorrow and I am very nervous and also feeling like I'm not at all qualified. 

I have had previous work experience in IT, but it was primarily with troubleshooting, general maintenance, and installing some new networking equipment. 

This internship/job, however, is somewhat similar but with they have said there is more of an aspect of development and maintenance of web apps which I don't really have much experience in (especially development.) 

I have been practicing some general interview Q&amp;A as well as more technical things, but, I feel like I know nothing. Also, I am your pretty stereotypical tech guy that isn't the greatest socially and I am pretty nervous about answering questions I may not know asked by people that may decide my future. 

How do I

* Show that my minimal experience in development isn't a problem and I am still good for the position

I had already finished it, but I had to wait to get to home to turn it in. Unfortunately, I had some major personal issues happening, so I forgot to turn it in. By 7,The grade was already put in as a 0, and I know there is nothing I can do about it. I am not asking how to fix it.

12,Basically I'm a 200 lbs construction worker and I have a girl dog. But everyone always says 'he' or 'him' instead of her proper gender.

14,"So i knew one of my best friends was into girls for a while now and that she had recently started ""talking"" to someone but i wasn't really sure who. I then began to notice that she became really close with my other best friend and they started hanging out A LOT and would text constantly. I found some text messages between the two and they were very sexual and i definitely knew something was going on but i didn't want to bring it up bc it would create a lot of awkwardness and i didn't want to lose them as friends. However, i hung out with both of them the other day and they were weirdly touching each other and one of them then preceded to lay in bed naked under the covers while i was there. I quickly left bc i felt super uncomfortable and i thought that maybe they would bring it up the next day or at least tell me that something is going on between them but NO.... despite what i saw that night they still think i don't know what's actually going on and haven't told me and now i'm completely sick of all the secrets.

16,"I've been working at my current job for a little over a year.  Shortly after starting there, one of my female coworkers started becoming pretty fixated with me.  Messaging me on Facebook, hovering around my desk, and just generally looking for BS reasons to get up and come talk to me during the work day...

Anyway, this has been going on for over a year now and it's only gotten worse.  She asked for my phone number under false pretenses, which I regrettably gave to her and now she is texting me quite often as well.  Asking to hang out in the middle of the week, parking near me at our apartment complex (she is also my neighbor), divulging very personal and emotional information with me, offering to give me food, and trying to walk out of the office door at the same time as me at the end of the day.

To clarify: I don't think this girl is dangerous, and I'm not even sure that her intentions are sexual in nature.  Nevertheless, I am *really* fucking sick of dealing with this shit day in and day out.  Going to work sucks enough without having a co-worker who is practically stalking you.  

I am a nice person.  I don't want to make an uncomfortable situation at work, but I am at the point of wanting to talk with my boss about it.  Done with this shit.

Should I talk to her about it or go to my boss?  I'll be honest with you: I am not comfortable talking with her face-to-face about this.  Just not the way I am wired.

EDIT:  Feel compelled to add that I've considered that maybe I am being overly-dramatic about this, but no.  My coworkers have noticed this behavior as well, and they too think it is odd.",21Dec2017,4
17,"I don’t know how to go about this so I’ll just say what I can as best I can and apologise for the poor flow and formatting, I’m just a bit lost in this.

 First semester of the year I completely f***ed up with uni, I was over the moon with just getting in and honest to got thought I would be fine with the workload and optioned to take on more employment, as such I didn’t do a lot of academic work in the first half and by mid semester exams was way to far behind to catch up, and subsequently failed 3 outta 4 of my subjects. It didn’t help that all three of those involved varying degrees of mathematical ability which I really underestimated myself with. I got put on an early intervention where I marked I would limit my working hours to accomodate my studies. 

Come second semester I did limit my working hours (although I did not tell my employer why I was doing it to save embarrassment, I just said I had limited availability this semester) yet still managed to fail 2 of my four subjects (again, mathematical ability). However this time also had an extremely increased amount of personal issues to deal with (more on that later).

Alongside the 8 subjects this year I also did 2 subjects for a second degree I am doing and I am waiting for results on one of them now however early feedback suggests I went very well (the other subject I went very well in as well). 

In total I have done 10 subjects this year and failed 5, and the university guidelines allow for an exclusion for one academic year following inability to pass 50% of course content. I (likely) have passed 50% however as those two other subjects belong to another faculty I am unsure if they count, and that would mean I have failed 5/8 of my subjects for my “core course.” 

Now the appeal process (and thing I am asking for advice on) indicates that I need to appeal on grounds of factors outside my control, not a lack of ability, and I do have various factors that I did not take action against because I honestly and genuinely did not realise they were impacting me this much till earlier this month (exams were early November). Meaning I have no evidence of this until it is to late. To keep it brief, my dad and younger brothers came back” into my life after I turned 18 (early this year) however with that has come a lot of baggage for me to sort through, worst of which is he is facing charges of domestic violence due to his... nature and I’ve been dealing with that, plus a family member has gotten quite sick and I have had to accomodate that as well. Beyond this I have been accused/told (not sure if right words but anyway) of possibly having anxiety though I have taken no action in dealing with this out of stubbornness and lack of time. 

So essentially I feel like I’m wasting my time describing my life and just want to ask this, how the hell can I retroactively prove that I have had factors outside my control limiting my performance in order to appeal this exclusion? I don’t think I can go to my mum about it as she will probably just send me packing and I have never been to counseling about these issues so I’m just lost on where to start. 

I have made efforts to increase my ability with maths (even though my planned subjects for the next year-by all accounts- have no maths involved in them) so when I do have to repeat the failed subjects I can pull it off better, as well I am going to make an effort to better my self in dealing with the more personal issues better than I have, though I’m reluctant to think they (uni) will accept this.

So the TL:DR - How the hell can I get retroactive proof of circumstances beyond my control and it’s impact on me to successfully appeal a forced exclusion from my university (in Sydney Australia).",21Dec2017,0

I slept for 12 hours last night and woke up today because of a phone call and felt confused and dazed and last night felt fuzzy like I forgot how and when I went to sleep for the first minute I was awake. I had a throbbing headache and felt like there was pressure on my head almost. 

I was immediately angry and emotional for no reason, I kept crying over nothing and couldn’t stop crying no matter what and every time someone called me or tried to talk to me today I got furious. I got in screaming matches with both my parents (im 20) and even felt angry at my boyfriend for no reason when he was the only one being nice to me and not doing anything to get on my nerves today. 

Everything I’ve said and done today felt like it wasn’t even me, it felt like my reactions to things were just on automatic and I wasn’t even thinking about what I was saying. things were just freely coming out of my mouth, it’s like my filter just went away and I have no control over my actions. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this while PMSing? Where you feel hazy and out of it all day yet you’re vicious and angry and overly emotional without even trying?

22,"TL;DR: Have lived here 4 months and our health has had a significant negative impact. Property management have been unprofessional and passive about this situation. Who can I contact to resolve this?

Album here: https://imgur.com/a/He1xY


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our unit has a massive Mold and Humidity issue. Within just the few short months of living here we have already been experiencing physical symptoms to our bodies such as headaches, heightened allergies, sickness and breathing problems. I specifically have been experiencing a significant negative impact on my breathing due to the mold because of my Asthma.

Because of this, I myself have bought an Air Filter, Dehumidifier, and Humidity/Temperature gauge in my bedroom to help with my health issues and to keep track of the humidity. However, I still feel no relief. All machines are running 24/7, I replace the filter for my Air Purifier every other week and I find it matted with dark, almost black dust. My dehumidifier holds up to 16 ounces of fluid that I have to empty every other day, that again has remnants of black dust. The humidity gauge I have has never gone below 80%; humidity inside my bedroom has been as high as 91%. We have used the humidity gauge elsewhere around the unit and it still reads the same percentages. The windows and walls sweat. All of our clothes and towels are constantly wet, even our books are soaked to the core. I took down a grooming kit I had in my closet for a few weeks and spores were growing on it. We cannot leave bread, butter or fruit out for more than a day before it expires because of the humidity problem. On top of these ongoing issues, this is the 4th time we have found slugs coming out of our bathroom drain. I have poured bleach and other chemicals down the drain to stop them however nothing works. I find their trails all over the bathroom floors and it is truly grotesque.

We clean every inch of the unit once a week with diluted bleach and simple cleaners and keep windows open through the night and still the Mold and Humidity has not changed in the slightest. In the pictures we have provided, you can see mold growing on the walls and strange fluids seeping from the walls.This happens every week no matter what we do. I reported these issues to my previous Property Manager who told me to speak with Maintenance. Maintenance used their own Humidity gauge and told us we had nothing to worry about, that it was normal. I asked the old property manager through texts if I could receive an official report about our humidity with our percentages and ratings. She told me there were none produced. With this, we assume there were no official reports submitted to Corporate or the Property owners. As of right now, this apartment is not a habitable living environment.

28,"
I'm at a real crossroads where I'm considering leaving my position early and would love to gain your feedback. The department I work for underwent a restructure in September; and I have been struggling to find my stride/sufficient workload in the new team. 

The financial situation at my place is poor and we have just learned that my department will report into a different Director who comes from a commercial background. This is all part of a company merger in which the company is moving towards a 'shared services' model. 

This week I was told that they want me to do an undefined project  within a different department for one day a week (as of January) with the view to do a secondment. The caveat being that they want me to also deliver on my current campaign as part of my existing team! I have concerns about this given that I would be expected to carry out an audit within a team that is resistant to change and who have been there for 20 + years. Basically, I feel as though I am being set up to fail with the number of tricky stakeholders in place. I was also given very little time to consider my position and needless to say, no salary revision has been offered!

Needless to say, the further change is very demotivating. I'm seriously considering giving my notice on the caveat that I will deliver campaign objectives and leave in April (which will take me up to 1+ year) as I think this will have an impact on my health. Morale is low within my office and I'm struggling to see this as a golden opportunity to improve my professional stripes; especially when considering a career change! Very stressed and would appreciate some perspective.

31,"So, a couple of months ago my friend P, (saying initials because it’s easier.) met a girl named B. B and P apparently liked each other? I was never sure because they both talked a lot but never really did anything together. Fast forward to September. B blocks P on Snapchat. After P sent her a snap.  P gets really upset about this thinking he did nothing wrong. I jokingly said “I could ask her sister, S what’s wrong.” He told me do not do that for the fear that S would think that P asked me to do it. I said “okay.” So fast forward again to last week. I was hanging out with S and I asked her why B blocked P. She told me. “It was mostly because B did not want to let P down. She didn’t want to hurt his feelings and was getting stressed out over school and Work and constantly being messaged she couldn’t handle it.” At the current time. I forgot that he told me not to ask her. So, Sunday night, me and P were hanging out and I told him. He gets upset yells at me and reminded me not to ask her. I said “you are right I’m sorry. I forgot that you told me not to ask her. I’m sorry.” We finished hanging out with our other friends and he gets a ride home from one of the other people.

Here’s where I’m getting upset with him.
That night I was in discord talking to a friend. Just interacting and talking about what he has missed from our group. P having powers in our discord. Keeps moving me in and out of chat. To basically mess with me. Then he changes my name to Dumb Cock. And continues to keep moving me. He eventually stops because we were playing overwatch but it doesn’t stop there. We are supposed to go to a Christmas party today. And we are supposed to all dress up formally. A couple weeks ago I joked saying I would show up in a Christmas sweater. And eventually said okay I’ll show up dressed up. Today he send this to the chat. “I’m dressing up nice because that is what I’m asked to do. I listen to what my friends want and not just do my own thing because I want to.” Which is borderline. He has me blocked on Facebook messenger, Snapchat, instagram. Basically everything. So no matter what I say he cannot read it. So he is posting in a chat with people who don’t know the situation and directing his frustration at me. Which he should direct his frustration at me I understand. But, he shouldn’t be involving our friends who don’t know anything. Only 3 people other then us 2 know about what is going on. And we have 20 people in the chat.

So, all in all I still want to be friends with him. He gets upset with me because I “get involved in his business.” But he does it equally as well. And more. And gets upset with me when I don’t want to talk about it at the current time and makes me feel guilty about it by calling me a fake friend. I want to settle this without aggression but it’s kind of hard when he’s acting like a child.   

I tried my best to tell everything that was relevant in the story to the best of knowledge. I also tried to remain calm and rational while posting this. Me asking for advice is coming from a place where I want to resolve this issue without hurting anyone in the end.

And please comment as soon as possible and thank you reddit community. This really means a lot to me.

33,"I worked with a man (married, a lot of kids) almost a decade ago who remained my Facebook friend.  We always got along fine, never close, but always very friendly.  He lives in another country with a particular dialect (this matters later), and we have never met in person.  

I installed that anonymous secret app Sarahah some time ago and thought it would be fun.  I posted the link to my Facebook page and asked for interesting stories, confessions, etc.  and I got some really great ones.

I started to get some very sexually charged submissions though, and I noticed from the spelling and phrasing that the submissions were from a particular foreign country, where I have several Facebook friends.  My husband encouraged me to try and find out who it was, so I posted a Facebook status limited to only those friends, asking whoever had sent me a particular message (I did not share the message, just the time and date) to private message me.

It was the former coworker.  He started flirting and sending me really dirty messages and started to send me dirty pictures.  I didn't mind the flirting but stopped him when the dirty pictures started coming.  However, he was encouraged by my open attitudes about sex, and the fact that for the first time in his life he was free to express himself.  He is famous where he lives for his religious work, and I know that what he does in private can never come to light or it would ruin his marriage and he would lose his job.  So you can imagine how explosive it must have been for him to open up to someone about everything.  I was uncomfortable with all of this and stopped chatting completely.  He asked me to keep this to myself.

His submissions to my anonymous app got filthier and filthier though, and he has been behaving with increasing risk.  What started out as going to happy ending massage parlors and sleeping with a coworker is now blowing strange men in the park bathroom when he's taken his kids there to play, hiring prostitutes, masturbating in public, etc.  I am a very open minded person but the sheer number of submissions and exploits, and their increasing danger factor were too much for me, and I blocked him from being able to submit secrets.

Now all I can think of is the wife.  She has no idea that she is at risk for STDs, or to lose their whole livelihood if he is caught or found out.  

Should I tell her?

39,"Hi Reddit!

So I have moved into a new apartment, nice place in a nice area of town, I noticed in the first few days the heat was a bit off. The back of my house was cold and the front was warm.

Fast forward a few days, HVAC guy comes out, discovered the boiler lines were never bled and an airlock was preventing the heat from getting to the back of the house. Problem solved for a week.

Fast forward another couple weeks: It starts to get sub freezing out and I noticed it was freezing in the back of my house! At night it would drop to 54-58 in the back while staying warm in the front, subsequently, my bedroom is above where the boiler and such is. It’s warmer down in the basement than in my entire house... I reach out to my landlord, guy is pretty cheap as it is, nice guy but doesn’t know a thing about upkeeping an older home. He owns a number of properties as his main source of income.

He’s coming out with his HVAC contractor Friday to look at the boiler and lines, but, I don’t think this will result in anything fruitful. I have to keep space heaters running in 3/4 of my unit while my upstairs neighbors have to do the same. I chatted with them this evening and they made me aware that the heat only works in their front bedroom as well.

I’m getting frustrated, I’ve backed up my complaints with reason and I have been rather political about the entire thing. But if no resolve comes from Friday I don’t think I will be as cool headed. I understand my landlord didn’t bust the heat, but it was never brought to my attention with the search and questions I asked him and the previous tenants.

If he states nothing can be done, or won’t do anything to fix it, what can I do? I don’t feel as though I should be paying what I am if basic necessities I assumed were working properly are simply not working. I live in Baltimore, so it gets cold, and space heaters are expensive to run and a huge safety hazard to run unattended.

Does anyone have any advice on how to best handle this situation?",21Dec2017,1

51,"I am/was a college freshman at Ohio Wesleyan University. I had a terrible first semester because I screwed around and partied way too much, and my depression made it very hard for me to stay motivated. I also have ADHD, which makes school very difficult. I was addicted to weed or any other drugs I could get my hands on(LSD, Cocaine, weird perscription drugs like gabapentin) the entire time because I used it to distract me from my mental health issues and it seemed like the only thing that would make me happy. That was another factor in my failure. Out of 4 full credit courses and one seminar that only met once a week, I withdrew from one, and failed two others. Today, I received an email telling me I am ineligible to enroll because of my academic performance. I am going to try and appeal it, explaining how much my depression and ADHD affected my abilities, but odds are I'm fucked. I feel like a loser and a failure and I'm not sure what to do. There is a community college in walking distance of my house called NoVa(northern virginia) that has a special program. Through this program I would need to maintain a 3.0 gpa for 2 years, and then I could transfer to practically any Virginia state school. I don't want to spend two years living at home, and I don't want to start at a new place where everyone has two years ahead of me. Could I spend only a semester or two at community college, and use what are hopefully good grades to get into a school, or will that not be enough? Do I have other options I'm not considering?

I had some traumatic events when I was about 14 and ended up getting homeschooled from then until the end of middle school but never got my ged to show for it. 

I do not work currently and it makes me feel real bad about myself, but thinking about schooling, GED, 9-5s, bills, etc send me into anxiety attacks.
My depression is at an all time high as well - I’m suicidal and crying myself to sleep some nights.

I don’t know what to do. Ideas of work and school trigger me and I panic, dying is a more comforting idea than doing either.

I feel like my family is getting tired of my crying and depression but I’m super mentally ill.

64,"I live in Tennessee and a few weeks ago, I aided in a fundraiser to help raise money for a local cat rescue. I was asked to help by a friend who trusted the organization and I donated roughly $300 of my own money/products from my business to the event. Afterwards, I stayed in touch with the head of the cat rescue. 
When my younger brother (he's mildly autistic and lives with me) expressed interest in adopting one of the cats, the cat rescue gave the cat (a 6-month old we're calling Magnus) to us for free, waiving our adoption fee as a 'thank you' for my help. I was told to come pick up the cat, and later the paperwork to officially adopt him, including his vet records, would be forwarded to me.

I picked up the cat in a carrier, brought him home, and we immediately noticed that he was limping. We had never seen the cat outside of the carrier previously, so I called and asked the foster (the rescue owner) if the cat could walk properly. She insisted that he could, and he had had a physical 3 weeks prior proving his health. She said if I took the cat to her vet, she would pay for his check up to prove nothing was wrong.

Magnus's leg turned out to be fractured so badly as to need surgery to the tune of roughly $2k. He needed to have metal pins inserted into his leg. I called the foster from the vet's office. She asked me to return the cat to her and offered to replace him with another cat for my brother, explaining that she knew someone at the Humane Society who would simply amputate Magnus's leg for free. Then, she said, he would easily be adoptable as a disabled cat.

I refused to give the cat back and instead signed him over for the surgery to be done. The previous foster is technically still his owner on paper. She does not want to pay for his surgery. Honestly, I'm not thrilled to be out this amount of money myself, especially not at the end of the year, but I didn't have it in my heart to hand the cat back over and allow its leg to be cut off when there was an alternative.

After some arguing, I was allowed to pick Magnus up from the vet, and he's home safe with us now, with all 4 legs intact and a spiffy cast. The question I have is: What now? Can I badmouth this rescue publicly for trying to shove this under the rug? Can I ask the foster to help me pay for some of these vet charges? Nobody seems to know how this cat sustained a broken leg in the first place. I feel like I should do more than just shut up about this and pay the bill.",21Dec2017,2
65,"I've been self harming for about 4 years now (I'm currently seventeen) and I really want to stop, but whenever I'm stressed or sad or whatever the hell, I do it. 

People do it for different reasons, to feel, to punish themselves, for attention, etc, but personally for me, it makes me feel in control. 

It makes me feel like, no matter what happens, I will always have the power to slide this knife across my skin and make myself bleed. I could kill myself if I wanted to. I can reopen old scars, I can make new ones. The possibilities are endless. 

 It's never been a problem. It's been a solution, but recently, people have been noticing. 

I don't know how? I always cover them quite well. I even put concealer on them and cover with long sleeves and long pants, even in summer.  

Maybe one of my friends got a small glimpse of them, and got some of my other friends involved, and I've been telling them bullshit excuses because I'm a horrible liar.  

Oof. This is getting long. Basically I need advice on these things: 

•How can I cover them up more efficiently? 
•How can I make them go away faster?
•Is it even possible for me to stop? And if so, how do I start stopping?

72,"Never had my IQ tested but I feel quite certain that it's low. Life has been nothing but a challenge for me. Always been put into remedial classes. Never been called smart by my parents or teachers. Although I've never had to repeat a grade, I got by on C's. Into adulthood I've faced challenges that I don't think smart/intelligent people face. I have a hard time understanding many concepts and ideas. When people speak I understand aspects/parts but I feel that there are lots of gaps in grasping the main ideas people are trying to get across to me. As well as remembering what they said. Oftentimes I just get smiles from people when I talk or try to explain/retort something, which to me seems to indicate they don't take me serious and realize my intelligence is low, my points fall on deaf ears. All this has brought me to the conclusion of what's the point of life with a low IQ? Nothing seems to be getting any better. And smart people rule this world. They talk over me, make me feel small. Truly, being smart is one of, if not the greatest human power a human can possess. The smartest people are who control this world and make the money, as they are the ones who can best navigate its challenges.

Having a low IQ has brought difficulties such as speaking and socializing. As I am not able to effectively communicate my thoughts and ideas, because I just can't seem to generate the points all at once and one the fly in an articulated manner. Having a low IQ makes all sorts of general problems in life harder, which to an average IQ would be fairly easy. Having a low IQ ultimately limits my upward mobility to certain social circles and economic statues. As those worlds require higher cognitive functions such as being able to navigate complex life problems/situations as they present themselves randomly. For example, trying to land a decent job/career in life and not be doomed to retail and dead-end type jobs. For someone like me with a low IQ this presets the problem of critically thinking and solving random problems such as effectively communicating and answering random questions during an interview, let alone working the actual job. And as the world is becoming more and more technical/automated, less and less manual labor jobs exist now.

Another aspect is trying to find a quality girlfriend/wife, which is difficult in that people can tell right away if you are a sharp knife or not, and women cannot respect a man with low intelligence. Because of the difficulty of providing for her and potential offspring, a low IQ man can not bring in a lot. 

Additionally is the whole idea of being tricked/manipulated/deceived and outwitted, this is intensified when you have a low IQ, the whole world is not out to get me, but the parts that are, I seem to fall right into. Such as any sort of logical traps they've set or word and mental games they play, it's hard for me to play these mental chess type games and win. I cannot talk myself out of these situations because I simply do not know/possess the ability to know what to say or do. Being ripped-off is always lurking around the corner in my eyes. Such as being taken advantage of with car repairs, or legal matters. When someone can make a profit or take money from you, having a low IQ is what these people look for and profit from. If someone is smarter than you, they can trick you/convince you and talk you out of so many things and ultimately take your money. Like the sleazy used-car salesman or any salesman for that matter, I never know how to talk or deal with those types, they always have a way with words that I cannot understand or work around. So a low IQ is an easy-target for these folks, it's like the schoolyard bully who asks for your lunchmoney except now he owns a business and uses words instead of his fists to extract cash from you. 

Also, many other tasks, which I think are relatively easy for normal people seem like a challenge to me. What seems like simple subjects to some like politics, mathematics, economics are mostly a blur to me and I find it difficult understanding the whole logic/point behind them and what they truly mean to me and the world. Most if not all ideas presented go over my head.  With this all in mind, what is the point? Everyday presents so many challenges, and so few solutions I can come up with to solve them. 

Any and all advice is welcomed.

78,"Basically my boyfriend just makes a lot of dumb casual jokes about sex. Nothing too crude, and nothing publically, just to me. Just a lot of stuff about ""doing it"" with me, and turning things into being about my sex when they're not.

Again, he's joking, and he never really says anything crude. I don't consider this as harassment in any way, it's just something he does. 

Now, it never used to bother me, but in the last year or so I'm realizing it does. The way he casually jokes about doing it with me makes me subconsciously feel averted towards sex with him. It's like taking away the magic of it in my mind or something. I'm not even sure exactly what it is, but I've finally realized there's a link between that behavior of his and my recent increased denial of sex with him. 

We still have sex and I enjoy it when we do, but I find myself denying him a lot when he initiates. I think this is putting a strain on our relationship. 

Im not sure how to proceed. Our whole 5 year relationship I've never really mentioned an issue with this behavior.

85,"I moved away to college five years ago, we were five siblings and my mother. Recently I've been treating an addiction, anxiety and depression, of which I saw were all born in my household, and I noticed I was reluctant to come home, visit my mom because I knew that my mental health would deteriorate, I just couldn't pin out the reason until last week.

Three weeks ago I stopped my addiction, I'm sober ever since, and my mental health has been going uphill exponentially, so I thought I would visit home for the holidays, as I always did. Having a lot more control over myself now, I can finally pinpoint exactly where this reluctance comes from: my abusive sister.

She has a very rude and aggressive personality, of which I learned to cope with by simply respecting and ignoring her, and it has worked very well, but the thing is, my mom doesn't have the willpower to confront her. She dictates the rules at home, makes my mom cry at least once a day and everything has to be the way she wants.

The house is constantly a mess, because the only people who clean it are her children (13, 10 and 7), my brother (13), as she is constantly screaming at them, and my mother, who works around 18 hours a day. The only reason it isn't a complete mess right now is because I'm home for the holidays, and I try to make the place habitable for the kids and mom. 

She works with sales all day, but doesn't help in the household. It's always an excuse for never doing anything, but she constantly orders takeout and demands that my mom pay for it, and gets really mad when my mom shows any type of reluctance, and pressures until my mom stops talking and starts crying.

I lived in this household from 10 to 18, and it has damaged me a lot. I had to go through a whole year of therapy to just be able to get up in the morning. My nephews and my brother have been psychologically damaged and it has been showing a lot, they don't have not even a little of self-esteem, they don't have the motivation for basic hygiene and just last week, I found my brother erasing something he wrote on the wall; it read ""I fucking hate living, I just want to end it all"".

I'm a man, 23 and I'm on the verge of going full apeshit on her, and I gotta be honest, jail is the only thing holding me back right now.

I'll never go physical on her, out of respect for myself, because that would just turn me into the person she is.

I have no close relationships with anyone, and I haven't had one in roughly ten years. I'm in my early twenties and I'm still waiting to experience the joy of having a romantic relationship with someone. I'm currently in therapy. Apparently I have both Aspergers and social phobia. 

Now with all of that out of the way, let me start with the real post:

There are very few people I feel comfortable around. My psychologist is one of the few people in the world I feel I can talk to and be comfortable around, but she is the only one I can truly talk to. Recently, I learned that we are only going to have a few more sessions together, because she feels she can't help me and that I need group therapy specifically for people with Aspergers. The problem I'm having is that I'm rarely ever comfortable with other people, and there is no way I'll be comfortable in a group setting. Basically, what I'm saying is that there is no way I'll agree to group therapy and I will therefore just end my days of therapy. I tried seeing to therapists for OCD once, but there is no way I'll agree to something like that again. For aspergers, however, we're not talking about two therapists, we're talking about a group of other people with aspergers sharing their experiences. I feel very strongly about this and I wouldn't even have agreed to something like this had I been suicidal (I sincerely doubt that they'd suggest something like this for someone suicidal. My point is just that no matter how bad things are, I won't do it). It just won't work and I can't get myself to do it. 

This all leaves me with this feeling of hopelessness... This realization that I will probably always be alone because therapy is not an option for me. I felt this way beforehand, but I still knew there was a glimmer of hope that my psychologist would be able to help me change things. This is no longer the case. I feel like I'm left on my own and I already know for a fact that this isn't something I can do by myself. I also know now that therapy is not an option for me. I need to see one person, and one person alone. I don't do groups. You can call me lazy or any other adjectives you may want to use, but this is how I feel and it won't change. I also feel as if it's pointless to seek help the next time I feel terrible (because it will happen. I won't be able to fix this on my own, and therapy is no longer an option) because I know I'll only get a few sessions with one person before I get handed off to a group of people, which I, of course, will not agree to. Therefore I must ask myself... Why bother to seek help? I won't get it anyway. 

This is a terrible feeling and my future seems grim. Who will I turn to the next time things are difficult? Any advice on how I should handle this? I'm currently at a loss.",21Dec2017,0

95,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a 30 y/o guy. I have a stable job that I've been at for 5 years in IT that pays well ($30/h), though I have no college experience. I live in California in a nice condo i'm renting. I travel for work across the US regularly. It's a pretty good setup. Currently no girlfriend, or at least any i'm particularity interested in.

My problem, i'm lost. 

I have zero goals beyond what i'm doing, and I don't know where to start. I feel like I could be stuck doing this forever - and I really, really don't like that prospect. It already feels like forever. The thought process behind which 'road' to take from here is completely overwhelming when I even try to think about it. I'm not a 'baby steps' kind of guy, and I acknowledge that's a problem when it comes to constructing my thoughts and creating life plans and changes.

I've spent the last 4 or so years fucking around, to be honest. Sleeping with a bunch of random girls, going on random trips, and doing what I can to just have fun. It's all contributed to building pressure of 'what next'. I dread coming home from work now, where I know i'll walk through the front door and continue the cycle. I want to take more responsibility for my future. 

A big, big part of me wants to drop EVERYTHING and just move and do something else. I don't even know what.

Do I make drastic life changes to in effort to 'refresh' myself?
Do I find a girlfriend, settle down, and start a family?
Do I just keep doing what i'm doing and let whatever happen, happen?

What would you do with my life?

Apparently he was worried about me so he told my boss. My boss brings me into his office to discuss the matter. He seemed genuinely concerned about my mental health and offered to help in any way that he could. I did admit to him that I have had thoughts of suicide. He asked if there were any triggers and I told him I have good days and bad days but I’m doing the best I can. Have I destroyed my career? Can my agency hold it against me?

I do seek help and I am on six different medications for depression, anxiety, bipolar, and a pill that prevents me from drinking alcohol.

99,"Hi! I’m currently seeking advice for my academic situation. I am a fourth year university student that is majoring in grade 7-12 science education. Over the years of my course work I have felt like I’m moving away from education, I don’t feel as if I’d enjoy teaching as a career and I feel like I should have done something sooner but the issue is I am unsure what I want to do for a career. 

My choice revolves around graduating May 2018, with an individualized studies degree, or, graduate next May with a degree in education and possibly try to stick it out for a few years until I go to grad school. With the individualized studies degree, would I be a poor job candidate? Would I be looked down upon for not having a specialized degree? Would grad school admissions reject me?

Also - I am not opposed to going to grad school immediately after graduation but I believe that in either scenario I choose I wound likely continue my education going into healthcare or public administration.

116,"So I’m pretty sure I have some kind of anxiety disorder. Put the pieces together in high school when I would ask my friends to order food for me at the caf because I thought everyone was judging me, or when I sweat and shake like crazy for any “stand up in front of the class” presentations, or any phone calls ever.

I’m in the exam period right now and I’m really disappointed with myself because I KNOW I didn’t do well. The worst thing is that I have all the tools I need to succeed and I don’t make use of them. My parents have saved up for about 4 years of university and they think I’m trying so hard when I’m really just putting the phone down and picking up a book when they come in. I don’t have the motivation to start anything early because every paper I’ve written in advance has received a lower mark than the ones I write the night before it’s due. It doesn’t make me happy knowing I’m wasting away my education fund. I couldn’t meet the requirements for the psychology honors specialization program (if you want to get anything more than a bachelors basically) so I switched into sociology. It isn’t going well. And it’s my own damn fault.

I finished an exam the other day where one question was worth half the exam. He gave the essay topic to us weeks in advance but did I prepare? No. I had days and days beforehand to study for it and waited until the last few to try and pick up the pieces. I haven’t done any readings. When I have time for readings it takes me all day, but when I have an hour I can read it pretty quickly. I don’t know why I’m like this.

My university has counselling and programs to help you with your studies. I went to one counselling session (the intro one where they gather basic info) and it did not go well. In the first place I made the appointment because I was on the verge of tears for a month at every little inconvenience. I felt bad about the questions she asked. I overeat when stressed, I play video games in my spare time, and the only coping strategy I have is playing piano which I never wanted to learn in the first place and no longer have time to do anyway. I don’t like playing it because my parents always comment about how nice it sounds to hear me play it and once I know someone’s listening I screw up badly, so I only ever play maybe twice every few months and only when no one is home, which is hard because I have a big family.

On top of that I knew I was lying about some questions but I didn’t want to answer the truth. When she asked what kind of video games I play I figured she would assume that once I said RPG that I want to be someone else. And maybe I do. But I don’t want her to know that. She asked if I ever had any suicidal thoughts. I think everyone does at some point, but I am CERTAIN I would never carry it out. I. Am. Positive. It comes out of my mouth a lot though. I usually say things like “I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to die more than right now” or “I wish I was dead.” Of course I would never try and I know I wouldn’t, but I sometimes think about how upset I’d really be if it happened naturally (like an accident or something). I definitely wouldn’t want it to be painful. I don’t self harm or anything.

I didn’t want to tell her this though because I figured she’d place me on suicide watch or something. So I just said “I make jokes sometimes” and when she asked what kind I said “The other day before an exam I told my friends if I slipped and cracked my head on the ice to just leave me there” and she wrote it down while mumbling “.... dark humour”

Once she asked why I felt I couldn’t tell my parents about my anxiety I started crying. I can’t talk when I cry and here she was going “How would you describe the tears coming out right now? Sad?” That was enough to deter me from going again because I couldn’t really give and answer and making the appointment was hard enough as is.

I don’t tell my parents about my anxiety because I think they think I’m a hypochondriac. I kind of am, but I also feel that if I don’t exaggerate the issue they won’t do anything about it. When I thought I had asthma my mom wouldn’t listen to me until I was practically crying and I had to guilt trip her to do by saying I knew she didn’t want to hear it. As it turns out, I do have asthma. When I had a throat infection it went on for two weeks of me eating pudding and yogurt with my parents saying it’s just a cold and then when I was going to the doctor it was “stay home from school today. You’re obviously not well”

When I brought up that I thought I had social anxiety she said “Oh (insert name), what DON’T you have?” which REALLY put the nail in the coffin. I won’t open up to them about anything and sometimes they yell at me because of it. After every test without fail they ask how it went, and if possible I try to avoid telling them when exams and such do come up but it’s pretty unavoidable. Whenever I think it went well, I get a bad result. Whenever I think it went poorly, I get either a bad or okay result. In either scenario I don’t want to tell them how I feel it went in case it doesn’t pan out so I always say “I don’t know” to which they respond “Well I’m sure you have a feeling of how it went” and then my ugly side comes out and I just yell I DON’T KNOW AND I WISH YOU’D STOP ASKING ME

I’m really stressing over this one exam because I feel like this one professor that a lot of people don’t like kinda likes me because I show up to all of his lectures and for the most part understand what he’s saying - but I didn’t memorize any of it before the exam. So I know he’s gonna look at it and think I’m an idiot and won’t like me anymore because I failed the exam (and I’m certain I did. This isn’t even pessimism I looked at the answers in my notes after and got everything wrong and the exam was 30% of my final grade) and I deserve it. I didn’t study. I can’t get my life together long enough to do it. I’m also hella broke because I have no self control. Even right now I have an exam tomorrow at 7pm and I can’t bring myself to prepare

I don’t know if I’m just depressed (which I don’t think is the case but that may just be my fear of admitting to it because even my best friend, who has it, doesn’t think I do) or just a lazy idiot who can’t do anything when it’s all given to me on a fricken platter. I had a meltdown the other day and was almost willing to try online therapy but I chickened out. I don’t want to get professional help because I don’t want my parents to know but I also have an irrational fear of my future employers finding things like this and not hiring me. I don’t know what to do. I need help and I want help but at the same time I don’t and I’m not ready to bawl in front of others about my problems while I’m misdirecting them all the way because I don’t want them to know me or what an awful person I am. I’ve been in the same spot for literally 12 hours pretending to study while I just sit on my phone trying to find something to take my mind off my crippling issues that I can’t find the willpower to take control of

123,"I was in a long distance relationship for three years with a person who I loved with all of my heart. Seemingly out of the blue she broke up with me stating her mental health had gone to shit and she needs time to heal and be alone. I encouraged her to not feel trapped and if shes not happy then I don't want to hold her back.

She made it imperative what she wanted a friend through the rough time she was having and she wanted me to still call her and be friends just not in a relationship. I was okay with it  at first because I still loved this person with everything I had. Then about a month later she gets into another relationship and it hurt but I still loved her and was trying my best to be there for her. She tells me she feels trapped and doesn't like the relationship. She tells me a month into their relationship that she wants me back I say okay but she doesn't want to leave this guy because of feeling trapped and it will happen eventually because she doesn't like making hard decisions and I needed to be patient. I got very hurt and called it out on how bullshit it was and got into a fight with her and stopped speaking too her for another 2 months. 

Two months go by with no speaking and she shows up at my door with flowers and a hand written letter that's 8 pages long saying the other guy meant nothing and it was a weird rebound situation and that she cried when having sex with him as well (She would usually cry during sex and end it). I go through my mind asking myself if I want to be with this person. We have a heartfelt moment and I take her back. Everything is going well and she suggests me going to meet her (we are only 6 hours apart). I agree because it was going well and go to stay a week at her place using all of the money I currently had in my bank to go see her.

This week I spent with her was the worst thing I have ever had to go through. It started out with me and her being happy and things going well. Day 2 we went to purchase condoms from a pharmacy and because of a latex allergy she grabbed a box we didn't usually buy and it hurt because I remember that she had been sleeping with this other buy over a 4 month break. It hurt a ton and felt like she just broke up with me to sleep around. I got upset and killed the mood we had going. I got it into my head that they only had sex once because of the way the letter was written so when it came up it shocked and hurt me way more. she asked if she could be honest with me and said that she really enjoyed the sex she had with him. I felt crushed and we got into an argument about how the letter said he meant nothing to her and she came out and said she lied and that he did mean something too her even though they only dated 2 months. This is where the big issue apeared. She had a full blown meltdown where she broke a ton of things in her room and threw all of her belongings around and dented up the walls screaming obscenities for calling her out. 

She calmed down and we talked and she said she cant be with me again she just wants to be alone and that a relationship is bad for her at the time I was okay with it because I felt what she did was inherently wrong. Problem is that I didn't have anymore money to get home. She said I could still stay if I wanted, till my train home. I accepted it was either her house or outside. The next day (day 3) she wanted to watch the new season of stranger things with me as friends. I agreed because I wanted to watch it as well. She then cuddled up too me and said it's just what she does with her other friends. I got uncomfortable and told her no and became distant because I was still hurt. She started crying a couple hours later saying I was being mean to her and she said she wanted me gone. I convinced her to let me stay ill just be a better friend. (Aka Kiss and hug her and act like a boyfriend.) so for the rest of the week I was her toy.

Its been 2 months since and I've been mostly okay she texted me about a month ago saying she wants to be friends (just run of the mill nothing sexual) I told he it would be better if we didn't talk. I think I made the right choice but there are periods of time where I feel I messed up and should have tried to be a friend because this girl is really depressed and needs one. Like I pushed someone out of a plane because only one person could fit type of thing. I don't know what I need in terms of advice. Anything would be helpful at this point. I'm currently at one of those times and I'm just shaking and sad.

130,"...about how my cousin is acting, she is 26. Her mom was killed in a head-on collision by a drunk driver 3.5 weeks ago. Her mom and her were very close and would talk on the phone as much as 3x a day/text all day (they lived in different states). For just about her whole life, it was just her and her single mom. 
I know everyone deals with grief differently, but my cousin resumed posting on social media a few days after her mom died and was back to partying 2 weeks after. Her snapchat story has shown her out in bars and she posts pics where she’s smiling and happy. Obviously no one explicitly posts the bad stuff on social media, but I’m completely perplexed about her behavior, it scares me. I know that if my mom had died, it would take me several months to even feel like going out. In a way I almost feel it’s disrespectful that she is so candid about her partying so soon after this happened. Maybe she’s trying to run away from her feelings?

132,"22yo male here. Currently working at a call center and living with my parents. Dropped out of school 4 ish years ago. Always wanting to do something big with my life. Start a business, video game youtube channel/streaming get big into music, etc. But i find myself at a crossroads. I could either try to ""make it big"" in things that interest me, that im good at, that would potentially make me very happy my whole life. That is very high risk and i will be scraping by for a long time. Or i can go back to school for computer science and work, full time in between semesters. Then get a job as a game developer or software developer. Low risk, decent chance ill get burnt out. But will provide me income to have some freedom if i wanted to scrape by and save a lot of my money in case i wanted to go unemployed for a year or so and do my own thing. I could either do that or try to work on my ""big dreams"" on the side of working a big boy job.

I always had an association that college graduation and big boy job is where dreams die, and im a dreamer. I am starting to realize i may be able to do a video game youtube channel or something WHILE i work a big boy job. Still some of that association is there though.

Edit: i also see the people working the call center jobs around me, and see just how much i dont want to be like them, i want to be in a better position and have a better mindset in life.",21Dec2017,2

I installed Ubuntu from a USB, but now it always boots into Ubuntu and I can't switch back to Windows. I have a Zenbook, if that helps. Is there some way for me to tell if my Windows stuff still exists and how I can get back to it?

Edit: I've tried lsblk and it shows that I have 1 disk with 3 parts with 7.9G : 230.6G : 1K sizes. It says I'm already on the 230.6G partition when I try sudo mount on it.

145,"Hey guys, I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet as possible as I need some advice. 

Up until a few years ago I was in a relationship (which lasted for 8 years) with my boyfriend doing the dumping after he declared that he didn’t want to put any more work into it. It destroyed me but I moved out of our shared house and sofa surfed with no where else to go. (My parents were very abusive and I couldn’t risk going back there as I suffered anxiety and depression from living with them). He messaged a few months later asking if we could get back together. I said I would if he got therapy for several issues he had. I was still in love with him, unfortunately. 

In the months to follow, we saw each other a lot and were still friendly towards each other and loved each other to bits when he suggested I move into the spare room after I became homeless. My best friend who I’d been seeing every day moved in with me. Up until April of this year, our plans were to get back together after he had therapy. However, he made excuses after excuses, and changed his mind from wanting to go at it again, to not wanting to go at it again. In this time my feelings were continuously bashed and my self esteem dropped to nothing, I was secretly suicidal during the summer of this year. But I held on for him. Of course I did. 

The situation started to become toxic. I felt I was becoming paranoid as best friend and ex would both turn on me at any excuse. One example is my best friend taking a lost kitten which had found its way into the back garden and dumping it in the woods a mile from the house to prevent it returning. I told her that was a completely awful thing to do but the pair of them rounded up on me and beat me down until I apologised for upsetting her by saying she had done the wrong thing. They seemed to defend their actions and I was becoming a scapegoat. I saw a therapist in secret and he advised me to get out of there. That the environment I was in was making me sick. 
I eventually couldn’t take it any more and moved out in September this year, back to my parents. I would rather deal with a narc and bipolar Mother and father than have my emotions yanked around any more. Contact with both my ex and my best friend (who still lived with said ex) dropped as they were too busy to talk to me. This was like a slow burn, and really picked at me. Between September and mid December, they never invited me to go anywhere and would make excuses as to why they were too busy to talk to me. I quickly realised I was losing the two most important people in my life. 

Then a few days ago, I met up with said ex boyfriend after he suggested a coffee and told me that he and my best friend were seeing each other on the sly. My entire world completely crumpled all over again and I told him that I never wanted to see him or her ever again. I felt so betrayed. I still do. I’ve pretty much lost all people in my life, now, as my best friend was really my only friend. 

Am I right to feel betrayed? They seem to think that I’m in the wrong for being upset. I’ve cut them off completely. Blocking them from contacting me any more. I’m so depressed as I now face xmas alone. Where do I go on from here? How do I move on? How do I stop every waking moment being focussed on them and how bitter I am that they are happy together?",21Dec2017,9
146,"I know this will come across as arrogant but these are not my intentions, please bear with me. I am looking for advice on this from someone who has also had experience with this.

I feel like I have suddenly become stupid. Nothing makes sense to me, and nor does anything hold any implications in its meaning. I literally feel like I cannot think.

Since the last time I felt of somewhat cognitive proficiency, the most significant occurences have been a wisdom tooth extraction, accompanied by a shot of morphine, and consumption of three 30g Codeine pills as painkillers.

I have memory that I'm an above average and relatively skilled logical, critical and creative thinker, and I can function nearly 100% with little sleep. But for the last week, I've felt around 20% with full recovery sleep. When I receive stimuli, I struggle to extract useful information or draw productive conclusions from it. Everything is passing like a dream; I'm taking in the world, can do nothing but acknowledge it, then letting it pass. Things still trigger emotions, remains of my functioning consciousness, like a phrase that I know should strike me the wrong/right way, or an argument I know I would disagree with but can't for the life of me decide why. 

I was also rather proud of my empathetic ability; I was quite skilled at reading a scenario and predicting what all parties would presumably think and do. I have no capability of this anymore; I've lost all ability to 

I also have a whole array of half-finished projects that I can't even begin to continue because I can't make sense of them, and have no idea where I was going to take them. As a result I've been worryingly unproductive, because I couldn't  Making even this post sound half intelligible was unbearably challenging.

In short, I can't think, or at least as well as I used to, and I am getting increasingly stressed, frustrated and anxious.

An equally disheartening thing is its effect on my relationship with my family. I love my family and we love each other, but my sister and father are intellectual predators, whether or not knowingly. At the slightest showing of weakness or that you cannot or do not know how retaliate, they return their points with full force and back them up with fragile and vaguely relevant proof, so you are subconsciously forced to agree. My mum is the weakest member of the family intellectually, and, regretably, is effectively in mental submission to my Dad and sister. I've for the most part - and I don't mean to sound cocky, this is for the sake of the subject - felt like I could stand my ground with relative ease. Knowing I was smarter than them and that not participating was a conscious choice was the only way I felt secure and in control. Every time they've posed an argument to me in the last week I've been smacked with the immensely frustrating sensation that it's faulty and I should know exactly what to say to criticise and dismantle it, but can do little but respond ""Yes"" or ""No"" and answer only to the last thing they said. This exposes me immensely to being pushed around, and I feel they are beginning to spot this - but I am helpless to it.

155,"Hey everyone, (first of all english isn't my first language but I hope you'll understand everything)

The tittle is pretty explicit, I'm seeing a psychologist at my university since a few weeks and I'm attracted to her. I wanted to see a psychologist for 2 reasons : studying organization and, quite ironically, romantic relationship problems.

As for the first one, it's working very well. In the last few weeks I did incredible amounts of work that I didn't think I was even capable of. I still somewhat struggle with procrastination but I can clearly see the improvement and I'm very thankfull to her and her help.

And the other eason, more personal and intimate is my relationship problems with women. I only had 2 girlfriends in my life and it was quite a long time ago and I'm still virgin at 20 years old. So, of course, when I see a girl that's very beautiful, almost of my age, and that's helping me realizing things that I thought were impossibe, even though it's her job, it shouldn't be surprising that I feel positive sentiments towards her. But it goes a little beyond that, I wouldn't say I'm in love either because I've only saw her a couple of times and don't know anything about her personally except that she's very cute and helpful, but I'm clearly attracted to her. And I fear that I'll be more and more attracted to her during the next consultations. I'm more and more wondering about what she thinks about me, does she like me or not ? Does she find me attractive or not ? And I don't want it to interfere with the reasons I came in the first place... But on the other hand, as I said, she's really helpful and I clearly see that I'm improving regarding the reasons I came.

So what are your thoughts on this and what advices would you give ?

And, in case it wasn't clear, I'm not asking for advices to seduce her. It wasn't the reason I came to see her  in the first place, and I have no illusions about it. I know it's impossible because it would be unethical for her and moreso because I didn't  see any evidence that she's attracted to me.

When I try to get an opinion from her it's always a half assed ""it's good"" or ""it's okay"" and she quickly makes her escape from the conversation. It seems like she can never focus or really get in to anything I try to show her or explain to her. I am very open around her and I have called her out on the emotional blue balls she gives me and my step dad when we see something cool that she might like and I get nowhere. I have no idea how to get her to chill out and focus on the topic and tell me her feelings and opinions. Its very frustrating dealing with this and I can't help but get mad and impatient when she misses the point. For example; I see a joke on reddit or something funny and I go to show it to her. After going through her  ""I've got 50 thousand things to do"" excuses (she'll be sitting on the couch watching tv or in her room playing Facebook games on her computer) I finally get her to sit down and look at the thing, she has next to no reaction and she will miss the entire point and promptly move on.

I don't make, write or send greeting cards in general but this season I want to. I have a general idea on how I want it to look like: I would like to craft it, be about the size of a post card and send it in an envelope.. I'm open to any other suggestions since I'm a noob


I would like to send the greeting cards to a few extended family members. But the thing is I hardly ever talk to them, I don't know them personally and only know what I am told second-handedly. My only saving grace are my parents and they are regularly in contact with most of them to this day. Some of our extended family members live in parts of the US (we also live in the US), and I'm willing to send them greeting cards by snail mail.


I was pretty asocial as a kid, and the long distance between us was a good enough reason not to make an effort to socialize with them. I'm currently in my early 20s, and I deal with social anxiety on a daily basis but I no longer believe the long distance is an issue. My goal now is to step out of my comfort zone and at least get acquainted with my extended family. They honestly seem pretty cool.

171,"So I'v stayed over my friend's for a few days. We're both guys, but I like him and he knows it (I'm gay). So, we like to watch Youtube videos every night, and that's what we did. We hopped into his bed and watched a couple of videos while lying down. I usually put my head on his arms or chest. He doesn't really mind it. 

First comes the first day, nothing really happens.

Second day, while we were lying down, I kind of felt a bit sexual and rubbed his chest, then down to his stomach, and then finally I was rubbing his penis. He didn't move away, instead, he just asked what I was doing and I said that I didn't know then quickly moved my hands away.

The third day is the day that I don't know if it really happened. I was a bit sleepy at the time, but the same thing happened as day 2 except while I was touching his penis, he was moving his thighs away to make room for my hands, but he still kept watching the video as if nothing happened. Then, I slid my hands down his pants and started jerking him off, but he still didn't budge and we kept watching the video. When the movie ended, he turned off the phone (my phone), so I took my hands out of his pants and took my phone and placed it on the nightstand. Then I went back to rubbing his penis. He moved me away and said that he doesn't want to ruin the bed and suggested we go to the bathroom. When we did, I jerked him until he came.

Now that is something I don't usually do at all, it's just not like me. And i'm pretty sure he doesn't do these kind of stuff as well. It got me confused. I don't know if I was dreaming or not. The video we were watching was indeed the last video on my Youtube history. I rewatched the video and everything matched what happened as I remembered during that night. I asked him the day after if we did something that day, first he said that he didn't know. Then I asked him again on the phone when I got home, and he said no, we didn't do anything.

This online persona extends itself not only to different verbal expression but also appearance: when taking pictures for social media i find myself wearing excessive makeup and editing my photos. this can make me rather miserable because, upon viewing the edited images i notice how much they lack resemblance to my genuine face and therefore any compliments i receive online mean nothing and overall i feel like i'm scamming anyone who finds themself attracted to me.

173,"My mental health and habits became markedly bad early last year, and it impacted greatly on my studies, so I want to get better, aka learning to have better habits, practice emotional welbeing or mindfulness etc. However I just cannot (more like will not to be honest) persist.


For example, in the past I've tried to keep a journal/diary of sorts, to detail my daily emotions, and work with myself, as well as tried an online therapy session of sorts. However, I tend to slack off things really soon: for e.g. as soon as I don't feel so down or bad, I just give up on it.


I understand this is an issue with discipline, and I do struggle with it a bit. When doing assignments, I've managed to learn to stay off distractions and not go on social media or gaming etc. but that's due to the upcoming deadline.


For these bad habits of negative thinking, constant rumination, self hate, being anxious/paranoid/over thinking (e.g. they hate me, i shouldnt have said x, dreaming up entire conversations and scenarios, and it's always the worst case scenario), anger etc. there's no exact deadline saying fix these by tomorrow, but I definitely know it's not going to be good either if I let these run too long.


I understand this relates to procrastination: usually the case is that I will start something but I just never end up persisting and continuing it fully and I hate it. I had a goal sheet/to do list for a while, except everything piled up so quickly it overwhelmed me and I couldn't continue it.

It was a bit hard at first getting used to them being around 24/7, sharing space, doing laundry for more than one person etc.. And some of these factors really makes me miss living back at 'home' so much. 

I miss having my own space. My own big bed all to myself that was always made. I miss having an organized closet and a tidy room with not much to it. I had a few decors here and there, but I loved it so much. My room was my get away space that was so peaceful to me. 

Fast-forward to now. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. The bed in our room is never made. Theres always a mess on the floor. He throws his clothes/ shoes anywhere and everywhere. And our bed is a bit smaller than the one I had back home (parent's house), a queen, and its just so hard sharing the space! I don't mind what size bed. But boy, I'm just NOT used to keeping myself on one specific side. Let alone with someone else next to me. :( The most that gets me though, is that this room doesn't feel like home to me. Most of you will probably wonder why decorating my room means so much to me, or why it would ever be a big deal. This room doesn't feel like a part of me. A sense of belonging? Ownership? I miss feeling that way so much. Hardest part though, is that I am so limited to what I want to do. Simply because I share a room with a man now who's words I have to consider, and I can't just have a girly room without some respect to him. If that makes any sense. (Not so much too girly, more like the room expressing a part of me. Who I am)

I try my hardest to keep things the way I had them back home. Well, it's impossible with him. I love him so much and have told him several times how it bothers me with the smaller things (clothing, shoes, etc.). But somehow at the end of the day, I'm struggling so much to wrap my head around the fact that things won't be the same anymore as when I had space to myself, and a room decorated to my liking. To be honest, sometimes I think twice about whether or not I want to be in a relationship. Just due to the fact I was used to being alone in my own alone space my whole life.

Please help. I need advice on anything, or how to find a way to get that feeling of ownership back. I don't know how to do it all on my own, and has been driving me nuts lately.

181,"First of all, I hope I’ve posted this in the right place.

I’m starting university/college next year and I’m lucky enough to have parents who are willing and able to pay for it. They’re even offering to help me with living expenses but I intend to pay for most (if not all) of those by working part time while studying.

My choices of jobs are somewhat limited since I don’t have much work experience. So now I’m seriously thinking about becoming a stripper – I could potentially save up a decent amount before I graduate.

At first, it looks like there’s nothing to lose. I’ll be thousands of miles away from my parents, on a different continent, so it should be easy to hide my stripping from them. I’m asexual, so taking my clothes off in front of strangers isn’t inherently sexual for me, which should help me focus on the business/performance aspects of the job.

The only problem is that there’s a possibility of running into someone that I know, which would be embarrassing at best. If the wrong person finds out, they could upload a video of me stripping – with my real name attached – to YouTube, or something like that, for future employers to see. Am I just worrying too much?

It’d be cool to hear from people who  have gone through something similar or know someone who has, but even if you haven’t, any kind of advice will be appreciated.

Oh, and just in case anyone’s wondering: I’m a girl and I’ll be 18 when I start university, although I’ve been told that I look young for my age.",21Dec2017,9

I ended up saying i wanted to “end it” and i was close to wanting to hop off a bridge because my grades had been stressing me a lot. The school counselor called my mother and told her I had sent it, i hadn’t even realized what I had done until after. They thought I was suicidal and the teacher said he knew I was stressed but not that stressed. I feel so embarrassed and I can’t stop thinking about it. My mom made me call my dad and he said that it was alright and that he understands I’ve been stressed and I was just having poor judgement at the time. But I feel so bad.

184,"Dear all, 

I am my father's only daughter, and I believe his only friend. Over the years, he has lost his friends, as they moved away or as he became more difficult to be with. This is because he has some hearing issues and alcoholic tendencies. He is aware that he sometimes can be a bit much, which has resulted in him no longer contacting his family, as he doesn't want to be a bother. I've tried to tell him that they love him and would love to hear from him, but they are a bit stand-offish in general, making being with his family not the best experience. 

At the moment, I'm basically the only one he regularly talks to, while the rest of the time he's alone in his house, drinking and walking around. I can't make him stop drinking. After all, the loneliness must even be more crushing when he's sober, so why would he try? At 60, it's difficult making new friends. 

So what can I do? I can't be with him that often, and he has basically given up on any other friendly contact. It just pains me to see him like this. ",21Dec2017,18

the days leading up to the part where we stopped talking, i realised that our conversations were getting duller, just hi's and how are you's and bits of this and that, and it would end. i miss talking to b because he was kind, smart, goofy, funny. just like, the nicest person ever.and i liked b, so much. he was there when no one else was and i could rant to him and feel like he wouldnt judge me.

im not sure if b ever liked me back or not, but i don't think he did. we'd talk about visiting each other sometimes and i think i just got my hopes too high up in dreamland.

typing this, i dont know if me liking him was me being stupid or it was just something at the time. i'd like to talk to him again, maybe start our friendship up again but i dont want to feel like im popping out of the blue or anything (because im super fucking awkward and cant talk to people for shit, probably another reason as to why we stopped talking as well).

To be able to pay my monthly bills, I let people know I'm happy to help them out with 1-2 weeks of contract work with a different skill (skill A) I have lots of experience with.

Through networking at meetups, I was able to setup a meeting with two very respected local investors/entrepreneurs that are on the lookout for people with skill A. I signed an NDA before this meeting (don't worried, I read it thoroughly).

When the meeting started they asked a few basic background questions and what I've been up to. I told them about the passion project of mine (using skill B) and they seemed to be very interested. So interested we ended up not even talking about the contract work at all. It went on for 90 minutes.

It has been 9 days and I haven't been contacted since. I started thinking about what could have gone wrong.

I recall the one man said ""Good luck with your project"", which I realized might not be a good sign. Half way through the meeting the one also told the other they will have to do a debrief afterwards.
I'm not sure if these are really bad signs?

I guess they are not interested? Which I can live with, but getting their honest feedback would mean a lot to me (because I am also looking for a business mentor). Is that a lot to ask and will it put me in a position of weakness?

I studied Software Development and worked in this area for a decade but through outsourcing and number of bad career decisions I am now working as a low level desktop tech. I hate it. I have been out of the Dev game long enough that I don't think I can get back in.

I recently had a large windfall and am considering making some significant changes, but I am having trouble committing to my final decision. I have no debt and 18 years of wages in cash and investments.

The changes are:
 - Quit my horrible brain numbing but safe and cushy job.
 - Go back to uni full time studying something I find incredibly interesting.
 - Attempt to find any part time job, anything at all. Going part time at my current work is not an option.

Risks are that I will not find another part time job or a job in my new area of study and will thus end up flitting away the windfall.

Benefits are general well being, see family more, study something I am really, really interested in, improve my health (currently spend 12 hours a day sitting down, 3 of this commuting), improve my relation with my wife and have a chance at actually studying and then working in a field that is full filling.

191,"Hello everyone. My friend and I are both from Atlanta. We've never been great friends, but he is a very open person and has confided in me/asked my advice on many, many occasions. He moved to San Francisco about a year ago and we continued texting occasionally, just as we've done for about 6 years now.

Well about 6 months ago, he jumped off of a cliff into San Francisco Bay. He absolutely intended to die and would have if a bystander hadn't rescued him. He broke dozens of bones, included both arms and legs. He spent a few months in a psyche ward and in physical therapy and is now up and about again. He shared this story publicly on Facebook, including a sentence or two about how it was his choice to make and how he intends to try again at a later date. I don't know if he's changed his mind.

I won't go into much detail here about the reasons why he did what he did except to say that he has faced an unfathomable number of intersecting challenges in his life and all of them sort of collided just prior to his attempt. He's a very good person. Intelligent, compassionate, and loving. Even though it had nothing to do with me, it took me a while to bounce back from the shock and sadness of his attempt.

Tonight will be the first time I've seen him in person since he moved. He's back in town to see his parents. I've never been in a situation even remotely like this and I really don't know what the protocol is.

196,"Hello everyone I have found myself in this situation that I can't logic out of. I'm hoping some advice can clear my thoughts and make my decision making realistic and possibly provide me insight to my own life's quarrels. Here it goes

I met a girl two years ago and there was immediate, obvious electricity in the air between the two of us. We shared so many common interests and conversation flowed on both ends.It was undeniable. We both could sense it,that feeling when you are sure. 

So she introduces me to her girlfriend! From the moment we meet you could cut the tension with a knife. And I guess I get it, I could have seemed encroaching in her eyes. So I realize we can just be friends. She's an artist, we have a lot of things in common, and I was introduced to a wide network of people who are some of my good friends now. 

Things continue like this for the next two years. We are friends. I think nothing of it. I called it what it was ya know and I was happy with that. I didn't have problems finding relationships and had a few short ones in the time passed. 

Now at the end of the two years I decide to travel from Colorado to Oregon for a small work endeavor and a coastal excursion. The trip would last roughly 6 months and it was destined to be an all out good time. So I leave.

We keep in touch because we're friends. She mentioned visiting me while I was away. I didn't expect she would. She ends up sending dates for a whole week to visit. The plan was loose, but basically to see as much of oregon as I could show her. I picked her up from the airport. We get to talking and catching up. All of a sudden she drops into a story about her and her girlfriend breaking up. No exaggeration, after this story the electricity in the air was magnified 100%. I could get this feeling by the way she was talking,acting,looking at me that this was something different than just coming to see a friend for a week.

We explore and camp a lot. The very first night we camp she completely came on to me. Now I'm a shy guy who's laying with my best friend who I once really had a crush on. She came on to me. Her shirt came off and we were making out and the next thing you know we're both naked in the forest having very passionate tent sex. This happened again on the trip. She says to me she would be straight for the right guy. She gave me solid forged indications that she wanted to be with me. Through her words and actions.

So she leaves. My trip is winding up. One last stop at Moab then I'm back in Colorado.She offers for me to stay at her place if I wanted for a bit (traveling again soon for holidays, no rent until after new year) so I agree. I get there and she's with her girlfriend. Her girlfriend leaves and she's onto me. We make out and talk. 

Now we're in real time. She just turned the switch and overnight it seems like nothing between us happened. She hides her relationship with the girl so I'm not even sure if they ever broke up, if she lied to me just to use me, or what happened, but I'm just one confused fellow. I know catharsis of travel and seeing family and home friends will be a reset that my mind needs....it's just three days until my flight and I know I need to tell her my thoughts and feelings before I go.

We’d meet up once or twice every month or so, and we wouldn’t talk in between those times. I admitted to myself earlier this year that i have feelings for him. Over the summer, I drunkenly told him how much I care about him and I think that kind of scared him away.

After a few months of not really talking to me, my FB started contacting me again, We’ve hung out a few times, and it’s like nothing has changed. The only thing that really changed is he seems to have feelings for me now. since we’ve started meeting up again, i haven’t talked to the brother. 

i’m in love with him. no one compares to him at all. i’ve tried meeting new people, but they’re just not him. i’m terrified of hurting him, but i know i can’t keep this from him. should i tell him if/when we hang out again, or should i wait until it becomes more serious — if it does? and how should i tell him?

Just before we are about to move in, the original roommate tells us that she got a new job out of state and needs to move, and we were able to find a new roommate to replace her easily. But as this happens, the other roommate who moved in with me tells me that she is having an allergic reaction to the original roommate’s cat. I had not moved my cat in yet but was about to. She tells me that I need to find another situation for my cat because she doesn’t want to be sick all the time. 

At the time I didn’t know what to do - I was furious and upset and felt duped, but I didn’t really confront her about my feelings. 

My parents are able to take care of my cat from time to time so I said I’d try out being without him and kept him at my parents. It’s been this way for a couple of months and I am just getting completely fed up. I miss him to death and I feel like it is not fair to have to not have him because it is her fault that she moved into an explicitly cat-household when she has cat allergies. I am thinking of confronting her and proposing a compromise of me getting to have him here at lease 50% of the time. I would use allergen-neutralizer sprays and an air filter and do everything in my power to make it easier on her but I just don’t think it’s fair at all for her to get her way even though this situation was her fault. 

Am I in the wrong here? Is this a reasonable course of action? I really depend on my cat for emotional support for my anxiety issues and it has been devastating not having him with me. I can barely stand it any longer. Please help!


**tl;dr:** A new acquaintance [29F] and I [27F] moved in with another girl [28F] who had a cat. I have a cat. Cats were expressly allowed. We knew each other for a few weeks, met on Craigslist. Original roommate had to move out for new job. The roommate I moved in with then told me that she actually doesn’t want me to have my cat there because she thinks she’s allergic, but she never said that before signing the lease. I don’t know what to do.",21Dec2017,4
221,"So currently I'm working as an Admin at a company with little room for advancement and am only working about 50 hours every two weeks. Even with that being said, I love my job. It's on the easier side but it's taught me a lot of valuable job skills. I love the people I work for and the people I work with, I am truly happy to come to work everyday. I (not making a lot of money or getting a lot of hours) decided to post my resume up in hopes of reeling in a part-time job. Did that, went for an interview, and was offered a full-time job with benefits and better pay. It's also in the field I was previously working in which was Medical/Dental. I make enough to pay my bills and save decently, I just don't have a lot of money to play around with. My biggest fear about going back into dental is all of my previous bosses were basket cases and borderline abusive. It's a great field but I've had a streak of bad luck and am truly scared to test the waters.

Is it better to keep the job you know you love or take a chance and take the job that will be better for you and you may grow to love?

I am not a man, and Ive known this girl since she was three. Nothing creepy here. 

Original post: 

I know a very sweet 15 year old girl who is being bullied at school. I’d like to surprise her with a gift that will put a smile on her face and maybe let her know she’s not alone in this world. Due to personal problems with a member of her family, I can’t do much more than leave a gift for her in the mailbox. Any ideas? She’s a typical teenage girl who is very sweet and, naturally, that attracts little asshats to pick on her. She lives with her grandmother who is really old-fashioned and strict, so I want to be careful not to give her anything that would ruffle feathers. I also can’t spend more than 20-30 dollars.

229,"I work in a very successful local business. I've been working here for years, starting out with summers in between college semesters. I continued working with them after college full time, because they offered me a promotion to a new position. The people are great, and us employees are basically a small family (in some cases, literally family). 

A year later, and it's killing me. I can't keep up with the work, it's just not within my capabilities nor can I handle the anxiety from the impossible expectations. So I pretty much *need* to leave, soon.

So about a month ago I started letting my superiors know that I intend on leaving after the holiday season, which was almost expected at this point due to the conversations I've had about my unstable performance (one's that I've brought up myself). Everyone was very cool about it, and we continued through our busiest season.

So now we're getting to the end of it. My entire thought process is that I want to make the transition as easy as possible for these guys. I'll train my replacement, whatever works. But they're having trouble finding anyone to replace me. It's really an impossible hire; the pay isn't great for the work and experience required. I'm not sure they'll find someone right for months.

So, given this situation, how long will I be here? How long am I expected to hang around? It's killing me. My performance is going down because I can't put my heart into the work anymore. I can't feel comfortable looking for new jobs because I 1. Don't have the time and 2. Don't know when I'll leave.

I'd appreciate the advice everyone.",21Dec2017,2
231,"Long story short, I was injured at work back in October. I was working as a dog bather at a pet store when a large dog jerked and pulled me with it by the leash, severely hurting my right wrist in the process. I went to three hospitals, but none of them took an x-ray until the third one, which was almost two hours away. This is important to note for later.

On my visit to the third hospital, it was found that I had Osteonecrosis, stage 3. My capitate bone collapsed in on itself.

I asked what he thought caused it, and how old it must've been, if it were collapsed due to the incident or not. He said it was hard to tell if it gave out at work, but that it typically starts developing into Osteonecrosis after severe trauma to the bone, causing it to die due to a lack of blood flow.

They mentioned that I would need a bone graft, which would lead to losing 30%-50% mobility, because the method they wanted to do was to fuse my bones together.

They gave me a cast and told me to wear it as much as possible for the next 6 weeks, then to come back December 21st to prevent further injury. **Today**. I assumed it was to talk about the surgery or any other options.

I arrived 15 or so minutes early to the appointment, gave my name and who I was supposed to see today. The receptionist told me that my appointment was canceled by the insurance adjustor, and that it was canceled on the 20th of November, when her and I last communicated. Two hours. Just to be told it was canceled.

No one informed me until I got to the freaking capital of this state.

What happened that day was that I called her, asking for a second opinion on another doctor, because I'm only 22. I don't need to lose mobility in my entire hand, no matter what percentage, and I wanted another doctor's opinion and other surgical options to treat it.

I was denied. *Why?* **Because of my diagnosis.** At least that's what she told me, herself.

I had been calling lawyers to see what I could do legally to combat the fact that they aren't going to help at least with the fact I was injured and have been put out of work, no worker's comp checks, no regular checks. Nothing.

I was turned away every time. I contacted upwards of 7 lawyers. I was passed off every time to someone else.

Come to find out through talking to one lawyer was that the doctor that insurance company sent me to is notorious for advising fake ""100% able to work"" releases to people who have been hurt.

Despite that, there was only so much I know they would've handled anyway. I know they're not solely responsible for the technically pre-existing condition, but Goddammit. I feel like justice has just been ripped away from me, one significant shred at a time.

What do I do from here? 

I've been told by a number of people to just apply for disability, given, the pain is far too significant to do just everyday things with. I can't pick up gallons of milk, not even a pot to wash it. It hurts just putting my arm through a shirt sleeve.

I really just don't feel like anything is turning out very well, this time of year.

232,"Ok so here's my deal.  I am a Physics major at a pretty good school.  After this last semester I should have about a 2.6 as my cumulative gpa. (one of my grades hasn't been posted yet).  My first 2 semesters I basically didn't try in my gen-eds and got a bunch of C's, so my gpa was horrible coming out of my freshman year.  I feel like I need to go to graduate school to get a decent job in my field, so I'm not really sure what I should do since I don't think I'll be able to meet the gpa requirement by the time I graduate.  

I don't want to drop out, that would be a horrible idea.  I don't want to switch majors since I do really enjoy this major.  I'm already involved in research which kind of helps.  I would need to get something like a 3.65 average in my remaining credits to graduate with a 3.2 I think.  I can't even get a 3.5 because I would have to have higher than a 4.0.  I know that is doable but given my current track record I don't have faith in myself to be able to achieve that.

I expected this year to be somewhat of a turnaround for me but my grades didn't really see much of an improvement so I'm not really sure what to do.  I still ran into the same problems that I did last semester.

239,"I (21F) have a really hard time feeling sexual/romantic attraction, but I want to find someone that I can have those feelings with. A friend of a friend asked me out and I said yes because 1) He's cute (again, doesn't turn me on but he looks very ""huggable"" I guess?) 2) I know he's nice because my friend doesn't hang out with assholes 3) We're about the same age (he's 23) 4) I don't know him very well so if I screw something up and we end up hating each other I never have to see him again and 5) He's not an international student or someone else who is about to leave at the end of the semester (we're both in college).

We went on a date and I think it went pretty well. But all of my butterflies pre-date were about me and how I've never been on a date before. Would I know how to act? What do I say? etc. I don't feel nervous around him, and I think it's because if he were to reject me I wouldn't really care. I don't know the guy, why should he find me attractive/interesting? I think on paper we get along fine, similar interests and outlooks and soforth (as much as you can assess from a first date anyway) but I am not attracted to him at all. But I want to be.

I've only ever experienced romantic/sexual attraction once before and it was under some pretty weird circumstances. My best friend and roommate at the time attempted suicide and I felt awful about the whole thing. This was also during finals so it just added a layer of suck to everything. I just hated everything and was feeling very apathetic. While this was going on I coincidentally ran into a guy I knew had a crush on me but whom I found very boring. He's way too into dinosaurs and I kept forgetting what his face looked like. I'm serious, he gave me a hug and it took me 10 minutes to remember who he was while we were talking. Anyway, he followed me back to my dorm and I let him in because my only other plan for the night was to sit in my room and cry. We ended up cuddling a bit. The next day still 0 attraction, but he kept showing up and eventually I got hit with all sorts of feelings I'd never had before. And it was really cool. But every step of the way I knew I didn't respect this guy and I didn't want to be with him (to be honest, it was mutual. He knew it wouldn't work because we have different religious and political beliefs). So at the end of the semester we went our separate ways. I'd really like to find those feeling for a guy who is worth my time, a guy I can stay with. At least, someone I respect as a person.

So what if the only way I feel attraction is if I'm in an emotionally vulnerable state to begin with? Or maybe I just need to cuddle a lot / have physical contact before feelings of intimacy kick in? This guy who I just went on a date with, I really want to like him. And given the one other guy I've been with I just feel like the bar is SO LOW. So why can I have feelings for that dumbass but not for someone I really think is kind and thoughtful? But my real question is, how do I proceed? Because maybe if he and I keep hanging out, those feelings might emerge. But I don't want to lead him on. I don't think I can just say, ""Hey, I'm not attracted to you but would you mind cuddling and making out for a few hours just to see if maybe we can spark something?"" I am genuinely interested in pursuing something with him, I'm just not attracted. I don't want to lie to him, but I also don't want to hurt his feelings or break things off too early. I've always gotten the impression that other people can experience attraction just by looking at nice-looking people. But that's not true for me. I don't know how to explain that without hurting his self esteem.

250,"Hey guys,

So I was in an accident at a 4-way stop about a week and a half ago.  A very elderly man (mid-late 80's) hit me when I was almost through the big intersection, and he admitted it was his fault and said that he didn't see me because the sun was in his eyes, although the sun was behind him.  I stopped at and entered the intersection well before him.  I did what I could to avoid it, but he accelerated right through me and didn't hit his brakes before he hit me.  The police arrived and the officer had a very hard time communicating with the man and had to ask him to do things, such as get his license, quite a few times.  The officer ended up telling me that they were probably going to need to reevaluate his license status.

I only have liability insurance, so my insurance company isn't helping me with the other guy's insurance.  They called me within an hour after the accident happened, right after I got home.  They asked me to tell them what happened, asked if anyone was hurt, if I ended up having to be towed, etc.  They then gave me a claim number and phone number, and said they will keep me updated.

I called them a couple of days ago to get a status update, and they told me that they need a recorded statement from me, and they said there's  chance that I might be partially at fault since the accident happened at a 4-way stop.  I told them that I absolutely was not at fault, and that it is obvious the other guy admitted he was at fault to them.  I am wondering if this is wise for me to go ahead and let them record my statement.  I have been told that I should not do that, because it isn't legally required and they will probably just try to use it against me.  Is this true?  I have written my statement to read to them just in case I need to, but I'm not sure if I should or not.  I have been waiting for the police report, which was supposed to be done three days ago, but the officer apparently still hasn't done it.

My friend M is visiting from Florida, he met a girl on WoW and decided to move in and have a child. Keep in mind we're all twenty, and this really made my friend V, my friend R and I (I'll go as J in third person) kind of upset with him.  V, R and M were all really close in middle school, and I was introduced to the friend group halfway through high school. I've been a great friend to these people. I've let them stay over my house three times a week to play a fighting game in my basement. We had tons of laughs, and I considered them my closest friends. I was sometimes excluded from events, and that didn't really upset me as sometimes I'd do things just with V or R. But last night was the first night M was back from Florida. We live a thousand miles away from him, so this was a huge deal. I was very excited, and was invited by V. However, V was very upset when he told me I couldn't come anymore. He wanted me to come, but M and R were pissing and moaning the whole day to him about my invitation. I actually hung out with R the night before, and he was complaining the whole time about V and M. He was upset that he wasn't invited, from what it sounded like. I was there for him, and I told him that I know exactly how he feels. 

I texted V telling him that this whole thing sucks and I'm sorry I budged in the plans. Also added how I was taking it to heart. How I was so upset that R and M didn't want me at all. People I considered my two closest friends. Who I did so much for, and have barely gotten anything in return from. Not that I'm mad about it, but still. R sent me texts saying I'm insane and unfixable. He's actually currently going crazy, but that's a whole nother can of worms. He made me force unfollow on his finsta (pretty much like a private instagram where he shares his thoughts.) I don't really know how else to word that, pretty much making me not be able to view his finsta. But he can view mine? kinda strange

Questions:

1. Should I let R be my friend again? We've got in these fights before, him cursing me out and saying I'm a fool or something stupid like that.
2. Should I visit with M this visit? Or should I just drop this friendship
3. What should I do with V? I really want to be friends with him, as I work with him and he always tells me how much he appreciates me. He was breaking down when he told me that they didn't want me, so I am pretty sure I should keep him around.

If you have been impacted by more than one of these amazing leaders please feel free to choose more than one of them, to bless them as a family, or even bless all of them! Our suggestion is to pray about who God wants you to bless, in what way &amp; to be obedient to that!

You can give your cards to either of us during any of the 6 Christmas services next week between Thursday-Sunday. Xxx will be handing out the cards. If you can’t make it to any Christmas services, but would like to participate please call XXX (123-4567) or Xxxx (123-4567). Call us also if you have any questions!

Remember, this is a surprise! Please help us guard Xxx's Christmas surprise! Get your entire family involved! Let the little ones draw pictures, ask your youth to write their own cards of appreciation &amp; multiply the blessings! Let’s work together to rally around our awesome ministry leaders &amp; show them how much we love &amp; appreciate them!

With love, XXX",21Dec2017,114

264,"Hi guys!

I'm 17 years old (18 in a month) and my family have decided to travel to another state for Christmas. Personally, I hate going there, and all we do is sit around the house with nothing to do in the middle of the 'burbs. 

I really don't want to go because I have a Christmas party planned for the day we leave (Saturday) and in all honesty, I'd rather go to the party and spend Christmas alone, rather than visit my family.

My parents are super domineering and they're 1st gen immigrants, so I just wanna know if this is okay, or even normal? I really dislike my family :/

Thanks!",21Dec2017,1
268,"This is something where I believe the perspective of anyone is helpful even if they aren’t an athlete or are familiar with the rules of transferring. 

I’m an D1 athlete in cross country and track and field. I’ve been improving and performing well, and I get most of my tuition payed for. Despite this, I don’t really like the school that I go to. Reasons for this are that the school is really small (4,000 people) and that my school’s athletic program doesn’t have very much money. 

The reason why I find it so hard to leave is that I love my teammates. I also have a coach who really cares and like I said earlier, I’ve been improving. 

The reason why I want to leave feels very selfish, and I honestly feel guilty about feeling this way. I want to go to a large state school with a large social scene. I also want to go to a big school that people recognize. Most people don’t know my small private school, and it feels conceited, but I want to go somewhere that people are impressed by. I also want to go somewhere that I can be a fan of their sports teams like football and basketball, and be proud to be an alumni when I’m a lot older.

Another reason I want to leave is that the funding at my school isn’t very good. My school struggles to provide gear to everyone. I live in a part of the country with harsh conditions and we don’t have the gear for it. I see other people from other schools with expensive backpacks, jackets, shoes, etc. and I feel down knowing that I’ve only ever gotten 2 pairs of shorts and 2 t shirts with the school name on it.

I’m good enough to transfer to a big school, and I’m fast enough to secure a scholarship. The problem is that I feel like I only want to switch because of the vanity aspect. I have 2.5 more years left of eligibility and I really think that I want to spend them at a school where I will have more fun. But I feel awful leaving a school where I have many friends and am still improving under a great coach.

Tl;dr
I go to a small underfunded school with a small social scene. I’m good enough to go to a large state school. I have a lot of friends and a great coach at my school which makes me feel guilty about wanting to leave.",21Dec2017,1

272,"I just found out that my sister (16) was cyberbullied by someone on her field hockey team (17). This person took a video of her harassing my sister at a party, then spread it around to all of my sisters friends on the team. None of them stood up for her, which I think is extremely cowardly but I can understand because high school is confusing. What I can't understand is why this girl wasn't punished more than she was. They got a 2 day suspension, and that was it.

Now I know the college this girl is trying to go to, and I know the field hockey coach to that college, and I can get the video fairly easily from a friend of mine back in the high school (apparently it floated around for a little while). What's to stop me from contacting the coach and getting her uninvited from the team? My sister wants to give this girl a second chance, and I like the sentiment, but her second chance was to not spread the video of her harassing my sister around, and she's old enough to think critically and know right from wrong, so second chances without any real consequence here just seems like getting away with murder.

Anyway, I'm just curious to know, does anyone ever have trouble sleeping because when they go to bed all they can think about is not being able to sleep? It's something that commonly bugs me, and although I do get to sleep eventually, I end up getting 4 or 5 hours when in actual fact I should been getting 7 or 8. This is only made worse when I have a big day the next day, and I know that almost all of us may lose some sleep when we've an important day the next day &amp; that's fine. I've always been conscious of how much sleep I'll get upon bedtime, and in the past I've decided not to look at my clock when its time for shut eye or if I've to go to the toilet after an hour or so. 

So what I'm seeking advice on really is 2 things, does anyone have any tips to help clear my mind at night so I drift off stress free? And does anyone else suffer from the same problem?

278,"I sweat through shirts just walking around. In winter it’s usually just my underarms but in summer I sweat down my back and beneath my boobs. Am I walking too fast?

(I live in the Midwest, usually just wearing a tshirt and in winter, a tshirt and a coat)

The second part is the smell. I like to think of myself as a relatively normal girl, and I’ve never had anyone complain or comment on it, but I just do not like the smell my sweat produces. It’s not a terrible smell (My ex liked how i smell), I just don’t like smelling like *any* sweat

They all look... normal and grown up. I'm still here coming back from school jumping onto my PC because I literally have 1 real life friend. I'm not upset, just disappointed in myself.

I feel like I've wasted the 15 years I've been here and now that I'm getting close to 16 there are people my age who have done pretty much everything. Like i haven't even gotten drunk yet. I feel as if the anxiety school has given me has made me like this, and whilst my old online friends don't seem to have this, I'm still stuck in the past doing absolutely nothing. I feel like a loser. I mean this is why I don't use Instagram, there's so many normal looking people who are socially confident and fully able to do literally anything they want in public and I'm here over complicating everything that can go wrong whilst trying to buy a fucking bus ticket. I fucking hate it. I really wish I could fit in.

When I found out, I wanted to be as supportive as I could; I tried talking to him more and seeing if he'd want to hang out in person or, really, just being there as someone close he could talk to, because I know he doesn't have a lot of people like that. He's told me before how extremely grateful he is for that, but at the same time it's hard not to take things personally sometimes, like when I want to just do one thing together before the end of the year, and when he's not busy he just doesn't want to. We haven't seen each other in person since September.

I think I should be more understanding, I keep telling myself that, but recently he'd been being especially withdrawn and untalkative, and after a bit of, prodding, for lack of a better word, I asked if I had been too much, and he said yes.

The interview I had was with another potential candidate, like me, and the hiring manger. The other person had previous experience, so she could answer the questions very well, which I took mental notes of.

&amp;nbsp;

From what I remembered, the questions asked were:

* What are your strengths and weaknesses?

* Why did you apply here?

* What do you hope to gain after a while of working here?

* Other than to gain experience and skill, what do you hope to gain after a while of working here?

* What did you gain from your previous job?

* Tell me about yourself.

* What would other people say about you?

&amp;nbsp;


I know that these are easy questions, but how would you answer them or how do you answer them?

How do you overcome nervousness when doing interviews?

How do I wow the interviewer?

For future reference, would it be helpful if I were to apply first, then call to see when I can send in my resume to make a good impression?

Is there anything else that I should know about how to get employed?

I don't mean to complain, I just want advice from people on this topic.

So I'm a highschool student taking really hard courses, have lots of exams I need to take, and lots of extra curricular activities. I also want to go to the world's best universities and be great. But, I honestly think I am not good enough or even smart enough to pursue such goals. Part of the stress is my family's financial situation. If I were to go to a top university I need a scholarship to help pay for these crazy expensive schools in the United States. Keep in mind I'm considered international, so all odds of even getting accepted(let alone the other programmes) are against me.

I know this isn't an academic subreddit, but I generally need advice to help ease the stress and chill out. I've been getting these anxiety attacks because of all this, and something needs to change. I'm sure someone was in my position where they thought they are not good enough, what should I do here? Lots of people tell me I can do it, but I honestly think they just say that to be nice. It's the holidays, and I need a way to ease off and destress.

If you're wondering, I'm doing the IBDP, SATs, and many other exams that these schools need. I run an educational website which explains random concepts and supports open-source software I make. I have to stay on top of all of that and keep up with highly demanding scholarships and applications. I'm still in junior year though.
