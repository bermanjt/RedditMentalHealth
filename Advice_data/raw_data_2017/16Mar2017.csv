2,"Hello everyone,

I know that this is probably weird thing to ask, but I honestly don't know what to do. Who knows, maybe reddit will save my life? Haha.

I'm 21, living with my mom and my doggo (who's my best friend in the whole world), and I don't go to school or work. I was unfortunate to be born very, very shy, to the point where I'm not happy when forced to talk to strangers or people I don't know very well. Or to just be around other people at work or school, or maybe somewhere else. At school I almost never talked and had very little friends. And because I was so shy and barely talked I was bullied a lot of times as well. I was so stressed out and unhappy when I attended school, I just can't imagine having normal work where I have to constantly be around other people and interact with them. Especially since work is much more serious than school since a real big responsibility with real money involved. When I have to interact with people I can't control my breathing, my voice gets stuttery, I have like a billion butterflies in my stomach, I tremble all over, and just overall feel very uncomfortable, it's really hard to describe. I tried psychiatrist and such but it didn't help. I'm simply unhappy with my life when I'm forced to be around other people I don't want to be around.

I tried Youtube, blogging, writing and some other things, but I failed at all of it. I'm a huge fan of video games and I thought about making a video game, but it's just to hard to do alone. I also I thought about Patreon a lot of times, but I can't really think of any good content I can create for people to be interested and satisfied enough to support me.

If there was a way for me to make 50$ or 100$ a month that would be a life-saver. Any kind of suggestion, no matter how small is greatly appritiated. Big thank you in advance for any help provided!

Edit: I've read all the replies and I'm taking them all to heart! Big thank you for everyone for taking their time to write a reply! :)

I forgot to mention that I'm really good with computers, and video games are the thing that I love most. And your guys suggestions gave me a boost to try it again and try harder with the creating content somewhere like Youtube. Later maybe doing a Patreon if the content will be good enough. Again, big thank you!",16Mar2017,3
5,"So I started texting this girl I really like a couple of days ago and we've been talking a lot since then.

7,"I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how I could be less sensitive. I tend to cry very easily if someone starts yelling at me, when I get disappointed or frustrated, etc. I can't seem to control bursting out into tears whenever this happens. I look ridiculous now that I'm nearing my 20s. For example today I accidentally asked the bus driver for a transfer when I had a monthly bus pass on me ( I'm accustomed to using tokens everyday but I had my mom's bus pass on me and asking for a transfer every morning became a habit) so he snatched my bus pass from me and gave me a transfer without saying anything. I realized that I made a mistake after I said it and I went to take a seat since the driver wouldn't say anything and was ignoring me so I didn't know how to get my pass back. After I sat down he loudly called me back and started yelling at me for asking him for a transfer even though I apologized. I have social anxiety so having a packed bus staring at me while this bus driver was yelling at me for a mistake that I already understood I made was too much. It didn't help that on the next couple of stops he started talking about me to other passengers getting off about how stupid I was and those passengers started looking at me too. I ended up crying in front of all those people and it sucked because I was stuck on the bus for a long time and I couldn't escape that situation. I feel like crying just made me look more like an idiot than asking that stupid question. Anyways long story short I was wondering if anyone had a solution to this.",16Mar2017,1

11,"When I was 4 my 1(Almost 2) year old brother was put up for adoption as my mom was only 21 and my Dad left my mom. We bounced from shelters here and there for awhile till my Great grandma had let my mom stay with us. She sent him away when she sent me and my brother for a summer vacation with my grandparents and when I came back I just remember not having a little brother anymore. It's weird because I still remember his face, the way he talked, the quirky things he did, the outfits he wore and even how we used to fight over my bike and I had to hand it over to him or how he made a scheduled break at 12 am every night to get cookies out the cookie jar. I'd watch but I never told on him. We still have his photos, birth certificate and everything. Sometimes it feels like he died but worse because I don't know how he is, what he's like and etc. A lot of times people think I'm evil for wishing I had closure and that something like he died was the reality but I'm not. I don't wish him dead. It's unknowing of it all. He could be dying of cancer or a really good violin player. I don't KNOW anything and he's my brother. Every now and then I looked up how to find adopted siblings but then maybe I'm selfish. What if he doesn't know? What if he doesn't want anything to do with me? What if he just doesn't even care? Am I morally even right for this? I think I'd be content with just knowing how he's doing in life and if he's being treated fairly even if he doesn't want to meet me. It's really heartbreaking to miss someone and love someone who probably doesn't even know you exist. I can honestly say even now I'd give a right arm for the kid lol. And to be quite honest I always felt like I failed him as his big sister. I was supposed to protect him and make sure he was safe and I wasn't there. And that'll will forever haunt me. I don't hate my mom for what she did either. She's not some evil wench. She's actually a really good mom especially despite being someone who never knew her Dad and mom left her for drugs. She's even got adopted herself. It just sucks that it was literally just my mom and no one else to help her out. I wonder if he'll hate her. Anyways if you've been adopted, have adopted siblings and etc. I don't want to be the long lost sister who comes in and ruins his life especially if he doesn't even know.",16Mar2017,5
12,"I know there are several articles online regarding this, but they all seem to be geared towards a formal business setting. I'm getting paid just above minimum wage (which is still great, I'm just trying to give a general gauge of the position) to be a customer service rep for Best Buy, and I start my training tomorrow. I overdressed for the interview with a white buttoned shirt, formal looking pants and a belt that I had leftover from a funeral, and one of the managers sent me an email replying to some paperwork I submitted, welcoming me to the team and reminding me of the time that everything would start, ending with ""business casual is fine"". I only have the one set of fancy clothes and then a few pairs of jeans, t-shirts and hoodies, and it's *fucking* cold outside, to the point where I've been sick for the past few days just from waiting for the bus after the interview I mentioned.

13,"Hi there,

I was hoping to get reddit’s take on this situation, and perhaps some advice if anyone has any ideas. In short, a customer of the company I work in customer service for went on to facebook and posted a negative review of the company specifically mentioning me in it, and I don’t like how my company is handling it. Here’s what happened:



Someone emailed in with complaints about our company. I called her on a Thursday to address her concerns and she didn’t answer, so I left a voicemail asking her to call me back. She called the following day when I was out of the office so another staff member told her I would be back on Monday and could call her back then. This made her angry so she went on to facebook after the call ended and posted a review of the company rating it low and mentioning my name, saying that I was intentionally avoiding her. This post prompted another rep at the company to call out to her and address her concerns and everything was resolved after that.



My concern about this is that here is now a public review about my company with my name on it. Fortunately it’s just my first name, but I worry that it could have a negative impact on me in the future when looking for other jobs. If you google my company’s name along with my name it’s the 5th result, which I feel like some employers would check. I also don’t like the idea that it’s there in a privacy sense. Because of this I emailed our communications team asking if they can pull that review. I waited all day for a response but didn’t hear back. After waiting all day I decided to call and got an aggressive response that they would look into it and get back to me. Within an hour the person in charge of that department came to my desk and said facebook won’t let them pull the review and that she thinks I’m just being paranoid. We then argued back and forth about internet privacy and the possibility of future employers seeing the review.



Now I’m actually upset because of the non-reply and the way that she handled it. I think it’s unprofessional to tell someone they are paranoid because you can’t get an easy answer for them and I also feel like they are not taking my privacy into concern. I get that facebook might be difficult to work with to remove that kind of review, but I think they should at the very least try to contact facebook explaining it’s a privacy issue. That’s my thought on it anyway. I’m waiting until my manager comes in tomorrow to talk to him about it and am considering going to HR with it.

15,"My family has decided to use one service (let's just say company B) to help with the ash scattering of a loved one. I had already acquired the service of another (company A) before they went with the second option. Although they had asked me to cancel the service of the other, I worry that something may go awry and leave us with no option. In short, I still have company A as a back-up but I have not told said company whether or not we will use their services on the planned date but I will eventually have to check in with them.

With regards to company A, I have already made an initial deposit - the money doesn't actually matter to me but there might be some that may feel it is important. I do not wish to offend them by wasting their time by not showing up (or giving the impression that we will absolutely do so). Services of this kind seems to be rather difficult to schedule with parties larger than 6 people so I do not wish to burn bridges in case we need to use their services again. Additionally, it's a jerk move to do this to people who are just trying to do their job.

At the same time, I am afraid they may try to cancel the service if we tell them we may not be there. I absolutely need them as a second option in case the first one doesn't pan out for whatever reason.

In all cases, I fully intend to pay company A the full amount for the services regardless or not we use them.

What is the best way to approach this in a professional business manner? Or from other perspectives?

Thank you very much in advance. Will also be posting this in other subreddits as well.

**edit** - I decided to call up company A and explain the situation in full detail as well as my intention to pay for their time and service, regardless if they were going to be used.  The reaction seemed more cautious and less enthused, which is understandable.  They had asked me to try to call them and update around 12 PM to 1 PM on that specified date so they can inform their people (so they do not have to stand about with nothing to do) if things all go well with company B.  It is likely they are being cautious in the case I do not follow through with payment, which is reasonable from their position.   They were very courteous and professional the entire way through.  I fully intend to follow through with reimbursement.  

Thank you for your help and advice!",16Mar2017,1
16,"First of all I'm sorry if this is very rambly and unorganized.

To start off, I have known these friends my whole life and we have been through a lot of good and bad time together. I have always had a problem with slight social anxiety, or atleast that's what I believe. Whenever I would get constant messages to come out with them I would often ignore them because I didn't fee comfortable going. I would then feel bad about ignoring them and continue to ignore them when they asked what happened. These things began to compound on themselves and make the problem worse. 

Now, I haven't spoken to either of them for 1.5 years. For the first month or 2 they would message me constantly asking how I was or where I was, but after those months of being ignored they stopped contacting me all together. They would still contact me on Christmas to wish me well but I was to ashamed to respond. Also, I had gotten a girlfriend during the initial months that I stopped replying, which may have had a very slight role in this.

I did contact one of them myself about 8 months after I lost contact. It was a normal conversation for a couple hours but then he stopped replying. I cannot blame them as I was a terrible friend.

Now I cannot stop thinking about
My friendships with them and desperately want them back even though I know I don't deserve them.

19,"I have no theories, there is nothing I did or said to upset him. We talked almost every day for years and have been on many adventures through the years, up until that day he would open up to me about everything and I would give him advice. Just a week before, he told me that I am his only real friend and he is thankful for my support when he tells me about is problems, he recently ended a long term relationship and I was there to support him through that, he seemed fine afterwards.
^^^^^
He does have issues, addiction, and is introverted most of the time, he does not get along with a lot of people, but he and I always clicked and could relate to each other. I have been along side him through the best times and darkest times, and there were no signs of any serious troubles recently, in fact things seemed to be looking up.
^^^^^
He has been going to work and doing family activities as normal, he works nearby. It infuriates me that he feels I don't even deserve an explanation, and he is aware that I was worried about him and called family members to make sure he was alright, and they didn't know of any problems at all. It is so bizarre, I just can not wrap my head around it, there are no women or mutual friends that we both communicate with, no behind the back talk.

^^^^^

Even more strange is the suddenness, literally the last conversation we had was discussing a renovation I was doing and he asked too see a few photos, I sent them over and he said it looks great and asked if I was home, maybe planning to ask to hangout later that day, and poof, goes off Facebook for 4 days before being active again but not reading my messages, and has not replied to any messages or calls since the beginning of the month.

^^^^^

The mystery is killing me, I don't know whether to have sympathy or extreme anger for abandoning me without cause or concern, I can not think of any reason for him to do this, especially after I have been his go to friend when he is in REAL trouble, I have been called when he has nowhere else to turn and I have put up with his trials and tears since we were kids never ignoring him in hard times, but now I am not worth a 5 second text just to tell me why.

22,"Quick backstory:  We somehow got onto the topic of microwave safety and whether the waves could hurt you or not.  Because I actually have a scarce amount of knowledge in the subject, I know for a fact that longer wavelengths=less harm to the body.

Anyway, through the midst of the argument, after she internally realizes that I'm making valid points on how you probably won't get brain cancer from a closed microwave, she hits me with this:

""You're a horrible example of a human being""

Those are her exact words.  No sarcasm.  No joke.  Dead serious.

She continues to ""support"" that statement that I am **very** overweight (wtf I'm a little chubby not a walrus), my diet is **completely** unhealthy (wtf as if I don't eat vegetables ever), and my room stinks (wtf that has nothing to do with this).

I'm not so much offended by that, I'm more offended that my **own sister** could even **consider** saying that to me.

Extra frustrated because my parents don't seem to give a shit, my mom is just chalking it up to her being an adolescent Virgo.  

Don't get them wrong, awesome parents, but the way they handled that just infuriates me.

I'm far from tears, just mad.

I hope you don't find this creepy or stalkerish, but I could think of no other way to get this item to you.  I honestly was thinking of trashing it since it would be to difficult to get this to you, but what I had to do to get this; I didn't want to waste. I acquired (stole) this from Home Depot after you had left. I still remember your last day, it was the second Friday of July. It was that day where we both had to face the dreaded Michelle from Fort Union for “borrowing” her super nice phones. Instead, you went home early with a headache and little did I know after walking you to your car and saying goodbye, that that would be the last time I would see you. After that, we had the casual text conversations, SnapChats, and we would talk of finally getting that drink but  like your time at Home Depot, those too had ended. I knew you were busy with your many hours of school, your many homework assignments, and your many adventures (like sky diving), and I can only blame myself for not pushing hard enough; or pushing too hard. For that I am sorry. I am sorry for those random and weird texts (sober ones and drunk ones). I am sorry for acting like an ass when we worked together and not truly trying to be your friend. I am sorry for allowing what little friendship we had to die. During my time alone, driving through those boring ass states to get to Chicago and even when I finally made it and was surrounded by my fellow friends and that big city, all I could think about was ' How great would it be if B was here to show us dumb asses around so we wouldn't get shanked'. But again, as I tried to ask you questions about that city, I still couldn't reconnect. You are funny, smart, hardworking, and have a lot ahead of you. I hope to see your name in the news winning a Nobel Prize for creating some kind of bio-mechanical implant that makes humans fly or some shit. Maybe mechanical engineer you and electrical engineer me will work on some kind of secret project one day. Like a robot to overthrow the Chinese government or something like a self fluffing pillow that also works as a microwave oven so you can wake up with a freshly made hot pocket for breakfast. Little do you know B, but in those short three months working together, you had the biggest impact on me than any co-worker, friend or girlfriend I ever had. Without you, I would still be a high school dropout working a grave shift at Home Depot. Thank you for making those three months at Home Depot, actually enjoyable. Thank you for helping me make D cry. Thank you for helping me push myself. Thank you for everything. 

Goodbye B.

Your Friend always,

47,"Hi, I'm looking for advice over me being marked tardy today. To explain this though I have to talk about the class for a sec. I am taking gymnastics in school. We first go to the gym locker room and change. 5-10 minutes after the bell rings we leave the gym and go to the gymnastics day. On that particular day we had an assignment due. I get to the locker room 2-3 minutes before the tardy bell rang, get dressed (with many people there who could verify that I was there), but I needed to use the restroom, as I did not want to have to stop in the middle of our strength (workout kind of) day to use the restroom. By the time I'm done using the restroom in the gym locker room, I head to the gymnastics room, as they have already left for it, I was probably 3-4 minutes late because I had to use the restroom. During my time before and after using the restroom, the fencing teacher and multiple students taking PE saw me. She marked me tardy sadly, my first tardy ever. All she saw was a kid late to class, claiming to have been in the restroom, with an assignment in his hand, which looks very suspicious! It seems like I had just finished it and was using the bathroom as an excuse for me to be late to class. I had completed the assignment the night before however. What do I say to her? When I told her I was in the restroom she told something along the lines of ""how do you want me to believe that"". I then asked if she could ask the fencing coach to verify I was there. She said she didn't know, because he isn't my teacher. Sorry for freaking out what is not a small deal, but I've been freaked out about this too much. I can see why it would just be a small deal to some, but it's a big deal to me, as it's my first tardy ever. What should I do?",16Mar2017,1

I'm a Grade 10 student looking for a job. 2 days ago I went down the Main Street of my small city and applied at about 9 places. Mostly fast food places.

One place (let's call it store1) called me that same day and we scheduled an interview for today.

Before going to this interview today I applied at another place (store2) which I hadn't gotten to but was closer to my home. At store2 they seemed really eager to hire me, I would've been interviewed on the spot but the interviewer was the only one on shift that could do drive thru. She said that she would call my cell and schedule an interview with me later.

So then I went to store1 and the interview went well. The guy offered me a job but gave me a day to discuss it with my parents. He told me to come by tomorrow and let him know if I'll accept.

Thing is, I'd like to work at store2 because it is closer and busier than store1 which is generally dead. My goal is to wait and see if I can get a job at store2 then reject store1, or if I don't get a job at store2 fall back on store1

Should I ask store1 for more time (they asked me to come tomorrow)? And if yes, how would I go about saying this respectfully.

Or should I just wait ~a week to see how it goes with store2 then just make up an excuse if I do need the job at store1

50,"Okay, first time posting here, and I'm really confused/scared for my future here. 

To start things off, I work for a renown computer company, and my family all buy systems from them as well. 

About 3 weeks ago, my cousin started having issues with her system: slow performance, Blue Screens, etc. We ended up reinstalling, but it didn't fix the issue after we set it back up - come to find out, the hard drive is failing. So, since we did all the setup, I order a new drive, and we set up to swap it out later. 

Here's where things go south. Apparently, shortly after she gets back home, she notices her webcam LED is ALWAYS ON, as if it was in use. I remote in, can't find any programs, no malware, nothing, but something is clearly tripping the webcam. She puts a sticker over the cam and we ignore it since we're swapping the drive soon. 

Come time to swap the drive, so I make my way over, we make an image, swap the drive, and we get it all reinstalled from the image. I went ahead and disabled her webcam physically (or so I thought), and confirmed it wasn't working since the LED no longer lit up. We make sure there's nothing strange, and I make my way back home. 

As usual, I followed up earlier today, to make sure everything was working well - want to make sure I did a good job and all. She asks if her mom had just texted me or something, because she's having an issue. I call her, and we find out, the system isn't going to Sleep Mode at all, it just idled and dies. We run through, and all the settings for Sleep we're OFF, I mention it's strange, and we go back and enable them. It's around this point I feel something may be off, and maybe doing the Image was a mistake. 

Fast forward 6 Hours, and I get a text from her: 

""So not going to make this a big deal but I know you installed a webcam app on my computer and have been watching/listening to me. Which makes sense as to why you called so quickly earlier. I've been on the phone with [COMPANY] support and they confirmed the date it was installed which is when you were here and had my computer. Just thought I had more trust for you than that [OP]""

I check the case history, since it's through my company, and it turns out, she found a 'hidden' folder that had several five minute recordings of her continuously throughout the day. It turns out, an app had been installed called ""iCam Source Pro"" around the time I was there - whether it came from the Image or not, I don't know. 

I tried calling her, texting her, everything I could, but she won't respond to me. I don't know what I can say to her, or what I can even do to prove my innocence here. None of this makes sense, there was nothing there when I left, she even checked to make sure it was set up the way she needed. 

At this point, I don't know what to do. She loves 2 Hours away, and it'd be really creepy if I keep calling/texting, or if I just made my way there. Does anybody know what I should do, or at least have some advice on what I can say?
******************

Update: After working with another support agent and Acronis, they were able to verify that the application was installed when she was back home, and that the timestamps on the old files began two days after she had left my place, not when I had access to the system. 

She has deleted all the video files &amp; removed the program from her system. 

She still seems to suspect I had something to do with this, but at this point, I know longer feel I have anything to prove. It's on her as to whether she'll trust me from here out. ",16Mar2017,1

I graduated nursing school back in December with the expectation of landing a job quickly( just based off of my friend's experiences ). By landing a job I can move back to my home town and be around my friends. Currently I am living in a town and hardly have any friends and I moved her just to go to school. 

I currently work a job I'm grateful for, but I don't enjoy anymore.

Meanwhile I am watching my friends and classmates all post on social media how happy they are to get jobs. I'm interviewing with high hopes, feeling confident, tell myself to keep trying and I get turned down. It's starting to lay into my self esteem,I think "" why are my friends with equal experience or even less get jobs but I can't?"" 

I've also been down about realizing the friend I've had feelings for for the past couple of years really only sees me as a friend. I've been single for over two years and for some reason it's been weighing at my lately

54,"-sigh- a stupid question really.. 
But still i want someone else's opinion on this one..
Let's just say I'm a person who keeps all the promises she made and will feel extremely 
bad if i fail to keep one..
But recently I've thought about this..

Well let me explain the promise i made..
I basically dated a guy.. and it went extremely well..
But unfortunately he had to leave the country.. and live their for now on..
We talked about what would happen between us.. 
He looked at me, kissed my forehead  and said.. ""Honestly, i don't think it will last.."" 
I totally agreed with what he said.. after all we were young..
I then made a promise to him..
""Even if we break up in the future, we'll still see and talk to each other every now and then.. and I'll
continue to love you... even if it's not as a romantic way.. And I'll always talk to you..
even if its just a how are you once every now and a then.. Basically we'll still keep in touch..Even if we lose
our romance..""

But.. Our predictions came true and he broke up with me because he was busy with school
and he said he's love was fading away.. 
I still loved him though, but I understood..
But after he broke up with me.. he sent me a last message saying
""I hope you'll keep the promise you told me"" 

I did just that.. i texted him every few weeks.. 
But then i noticed that he was kinda getting bored with me.. 
I decided to just stop and not talk to him anymore..
But the text he sent the one where he said ""He hopes i keep my promise"" 
just keeps replaying in my head..

This is stupid i know.. and srry ;--; 
Thoughts or opinions will be appreciated ",16Mar2017,2

Text her last week asking if she wanted to do something and she said 'yeah okay thursday' then I asked her if she was still on for it and she was like nah my coughs really bad. Asked her on Sunday if she wanted to do something this week and she said she has an assignment in for friday so she doesnt know. But hopefully we can do something next week.

61,"So I've spent almost the last 10 years in retail from the time I started college. I need to get out! I feel so trapped by the fact that my resume all points to sales experience and management, when neither are my passion!

Here's a little background: I currently hold a 4 year English degree, with original intent of becoming a teacher. In my state, a Masters in Education is required. I planned to complete all degrees consecutively, but that was inevitably halted due to my student debt ($60K) and needing to work full time through college to support myself.

I worked retail full time and became a department supervisor, before leaving for wireless sales where I was promoted to Assistant Manager. I fell into the trap that most do in wireless (earning an easy $55K and not getting much to put on my resume) but eventually began to resent the 10-12 hour days and every night and weekend away from my family. In an effort to better myself, I left to work at a bank.

This seemed like an improvement with the promise of a work/life balance. I took an $8,000 a year pay cut to trade off the nights and weekends I could hopefully start spending with my family. I am currently an Assistant Manager at a bank. Somehow I landed myself at a branch that is open 7 days a week and until 7pm some nights. I was promised that I would have a better home life balance, and while I still work 10+ hour days and weekends, I'm off Saturday OR sunday most weeks. Still, my husband and I are planning to start a family soon, and I want to be home with them on a regular schedule like the majority of the working world.

A couple of requirements:
- I need to stay in the $45,000+ range to continue the lifestyle my husband and I have currently (and pay off our mountain of student debt)

- I'd prefer not to work with the general public 100% of the time (fellow ex-retail, I know you get it!!)

- I don't mind working remotely, but I'd like to have the option of going in to the office to work most times. 

Totally appreciate any input I can get from anyone who has been there and successfully transitioned to a different career!",16Mar2017,2

Hi everyone, I've been thinking a lot lately about how to structure my thoughts and deliver it in the most honest and humble manner to justify why I gave up a chance in becoming a military pilot.

Background
I've always wanted to be a pilot, but an airline pilot over a military pilot. But from where I come from, it's common for everyone who wants to be a pilot to apply to the military first. But for me, I do love the notion of flight but my early encounters with flight were with the large jets ferrying passengers around. 

So, over a long period, I just simply desire to fly the passenger jets. I remember having the chance to fly a full motion 747 simulator at 19 years old, and when it 'lift-off'... That was pure ecstacy. It just made my desire to command one stronger by the day. With that I would work hard and save so that I could buy an air ticket to return to that country and fly the simulator every year.

Military flying is as brilliant, that's where the real flying is done. So for 3 years I had been trying to enter the military only to end up calling them up to inform them that I cannot do it. I just need to be with the passenger jets and at that point of time, I didn't want to deprive others who genuinely want to be a military pilot of a chance. I hear stories of how people my age being airline pilots and I envy them so much.

So now I grapple to seek wisdom on how best to convince and justify my reason for not pursing a military career, since most of the pilots are from the military. Sometimes I feel that I shot myself in the foot, but then again, I'm just that in a relationship with commercial aviation. 

My first part-time job was at the airport as a security screening agent, the best birthday gift when I turned 17 after being issued my screening license.  I got to see airline pilots day in day out and I loved my job. Then I moved on to intern for an airline for half a year and it brought me even closer to the passenger jets! I frequent the flight deck on the job and often get the chance to walk around the tarmac too. 

I'd love to hear your opinions on whether what I did (by closing the door to military aviation) was justified in the eyes of the veterans, and how best can one honestly express the desire to fly passenger jets over military jets, without offending the veterans? I don't want to come off as an arrogant prick who never even bothered with the military, and I experienced first hand how detrimental it was to my flying dream; I never made it through PPL interviews when I was 16 and 2 years later, I tried again but they refused no matter how hard I begged them. 

Humility surely goes a long way...

65,"My girlfriend and I started dating two months ago, we've discussed religion and our separate views on them and everything was fine until yesterday.

66,"My best friend has been in a relationship with the love of her life for about three years now and out of nowhere his feelings flipped.he used to share the same ""we are soulmates"" thoughts as her, saying I love you to her all day and being a really cute couple(they were really cute but not the gross annoying type of cute) and now he is a 22 year old man acting like a angsty teenager wrighting songs about how she is a bitch or too clingy for saying ""I love you"" every night before they go to sleep I don't know why he is acting like this but I don't care anymore, 

she saw all the things he was saying and that he started flirting with a new girl so he broke up with her flat out, didn't even try to be nice or consider her feelings. 
She tried to keep him as a friend in hopes that they could fix their relationship but her asking to call and talk for a little bit after not talking to him for two days he flipped out and was being a massive asshole and for some reason that only god knows after 2 months of being broken up with and him being a little bitch to her every single day she was still completely head over heels in love with him and in pain every single day she finally took her life.

 I don't want to say anything to him about it. she moved out of state and came back home to live with me and my boyfriend. so he has no idea and won't have any idea unless I tell him. But I don't want to tell him for the wrong reason, I don't want to say anything so he can constantly be worried and send her messages because he knew she has been suicidal for a very long time and he knew what would happen when he dumped her that hard and didn't let her try to at least talk so she can understand what went wrong. 
But she wanted me to let him know and give him her note which contained countless ""I love you"" and ""please don't blame yourself I was too broken for this world"".I really want to respect her wishes and let him know but part of me ONLY wants to let him know that she died and that it's his fault but   not show him the note, I know it's a fucked up thing to do to someone but I lost my best friend since elementary school and I blame him every single day I AM SO MAD AT HIM I want him to feel even 5% of the pain she felt what do I do?",16Mar2017,1
67,"I posted a video to reddit a few years back of me demonstrating what I thought to be a world record high frequency whistle. (if anyone here remembers that, then I'm sorry 'bout your ears) I posted it here on reddit and the next day I woke up to a shit storm of emails, and comments on the video. It was somewhere around 100k views and 100+ youtube comments

Most of the reddit comments revolved around the subject matter (the whistle and whether or not it exceeded the world record). But of course, an unsurprising number of the youtube comments were directed towards me in a negative way. It started out as a funny thing, but as time went on it started to grate on me and I couldn't get that negativity out of my head. I'd think, ""man, i'm a grown man and this is affecting me - what does it do to teenagers"". I started to FEEL like a teenager.

When I would get together with my friends for dinner or beers It without fail would come up in the conversation. ""Let's see if there's anything new on the whistle video!"" We'd all have a giggle and a laugh about it. I don't hold it against them, and I admit some of them were pretty good zingers. But sure enough in the quiet moments, around the corner that negativity would creep back into my sub-conscious and I couldn't do anything about it. Rinse. Repeat. 

I finally deleted the video. I tried to give myself a digital bath. But damn. The internet really IS forever. I've even had two people at work at different times come up to me and ask if I made a video about whistling...one of them even went as far as to find a cached thumbnail image from the video and made it the reception computer desktop....and it still is.

Since then I have been see-sawing between creatively drained and full blown depressed the past couple of years and it started to affect my marriage and everything else in my life. I saw a doctor and was prescribed and anti-depressant, but woah - I DID NOT like how that made me feel. It was the absolute worst. So I stopped taking them and it took nearly a week to feel ""normal"" again. i.e. I could actually feel things. 

I would still shoot photos when we travel or do something fun (we rock climb and paddle board a lot), and I had a few rad shots/experiences but I wasn't feeling any joy like I use to feel. My wife was my only outlet not just for my emotional struggles but for my creative ones. 

I've been shooting photos on film and developing at home since my high school photography class (13 years ago now, sheeit). And to this day, shooting on film is my preferred way to take photos. My wife and I go on walks in the evenings and, bless her heart, I can tell she is totally lost as I talk my heart out about film and cameras. She knows that even in my lowest lows when I'm mute and in the dumps that I'll always go on a walk with her and I'll always be willing to talk about film. Sometimes she'll ask me photography related questions as bait to get me to open up. She is trying to hang and repeats stuff back to me wrong and it warms my heart to feel that cared for by someone.

One particularly nice evening walk I broke the silence by saying, ""I think I want to make a youtube channel about film."" I could tell she was not keen. ""Okaaaay...."" ""I want to connect with other people online and talk about film. Maybe I can work through some issues along the way."" She told me as long as I felt good about it she would totally support me. 

So I've made almost 10 videos for the new youtube channel and have posted 2 of them. But the more they are online the more freaked out I get how ruthless people can be on the internet. I don't expect these videos to garner near the same attention, but it's in my mind. It's on my mind when I have to do 1000 takes and get tilted and have to stop for the night and I overly scrutinize every edit because someone's gonna notice some little detail that turns me into a joke again.

At this point, I am thoroughly enjoying just simply CREATING again. I've never really liked shooting video, but because I love the subject matter (film) I'm loving just getting my hands on things again. But still the hardest part is when i'm in front of the camera. I'm wholeheartedly an introvert, and I severely overcompensate with extroverted tendencies when I feel scared, threatened, out of my comfort zone etc. 

So on camera I tend to go into kind of a 'Colbert' type character, over the top, like Jim Carrey just to cope. Or as one redditor said on the whistle comments, ""Is the douche thing just part of your shtick?"" 
So i'm trying to be myself and just talk to the camera like it's my friend but it's not. Dude is not my friend. So everything i'm making is FULL of nauseating jump cuts - but it's 80% me. The real me. I'm still trying to figure out how to get to 100%. 

So I guess I just want some guidance. If I am enjoying making these videos but am to scared to face the music, should I just enjoy the process and never release them? Or should I face the music and face my fear and try to develop a thicker skin? 
Can anyone suggest any books or vids or anything specifically relating to creative confidence or something that address any of the above? I buy books on amazon that seem like a good fit but nothing seems to 'get' this type of funk. I'm also going to try and find a natural tea or something I can drink before I record any videos to help me relax and reduce the anxiety. 

Any suggestions are welcomed. I know this was long - sorry. Thank you for reading.
Clearly this is not a plug but i'm sure you guys will want to see the videos: http://bit.ly/2mR1YFJ

I have a hard time becoming attached to people , specially girls, and I honestly try to avoid it.

I also have a disability affecting the motor skills of the right side of my body, although its so minor that people cannot tell. I think one of the main reasons for my insecurities is the fear that people won't accept me because of my disability and I would rather stay detached from everyone to avoid disappointment. It honestly really sucks to feel this way because girls often express attraction and it reinforces my idea of not feeling good enough and makes me feel bad because I think of all that I am missing out on.

74,"Okay, I am going to make this as short as possible. My mind is not normal, and I've been using my abnormalities to my advantage all my life.

Essentially I constantly adopt emotions, and have never had personal emotions before. I look to others to adopt the most appropriate emotional state, if I overhear a discussion on depression I'm depressed for a long period of time, if I hear or read material on happiness I become overly happy.

Obviously this sounds ridiculous, but these are almost like triggers, alternating between periods of mania and depression upon exposure to emotions from others.

I've known about this mechanism for some time, and used it to study. Exposing myself to successful people increases my drive, makes me feel like I'm high on something.

I don't know whether this is the result of priming, or something else. I've searched around but have found details on no similar symptoms.

Obviously there is nothing ""wrong with me"" in the case that I am not going to commit suicide, but something tells me that I am still not normal, that I constantly look to others to create emotions, and without exposure am left hollow.

Can anyone help.

They all like me and we have really good times but certain ones love to mess with me too much and those certain ones egg on others . I try to act like it doesn't bother me so they will stop but they know it does.

This especially annoys me because everyone is a lot stronger than me and I'm extremely passive. Im taller than all of them but they all outweigh me by about 25-40 pounds so they think they are over me. I can't cut these certain people out of my life because they are in my friend group and i don't have any guy friends outside my group. Most of my friends in this group aren't this way but all of them have been this way a decent amount. Im not sure how to make them stop messing with me.

77,"I'm a Filmmaking major and I'm supposedly graduating this coming May. To preface, Film is an incredibly stressful major, up there with Engineering and Bio in terms of workload and commitment (if you actually give a shit). By the end of this semester I will have 136 credits (120 needed to graduate). 

My university has a World Language requirement that requires two semesters of one language, i.e. German I &amp; II. I took German I in Fall 2015 and somehow passed with an A-. Definitely did not deserve that grade, I am terrible with learning new languages... and I just don't have the time. 

I attempted to take German II in Spring 2016, but was quickly overwhelmed by the workload because I was working on my film that semester. So I dropped it. The next semester, I was banking on taking a new (easier) language such as Spanish but a friend of mine convinced me to take French I with her... turned out to be a huge mistake as French was even more difficult than German. So I dropped it after I was almost three weeks behind. Yeah, I know, I'm an idiot. 

It's now my final semester and I decided to test my luck again with German II. I didn't really have a choice-- I need this class to graduate. But I am absolutely swamped with the rest of my major requirements, my severe lack of free weekends, crazy schedule, not to mention my Senior Thesis assignments. I'm now a month behind on my German II homework with a 49%. Need a 60% to pass. I spoke to my professor, he essentially told me that there isn't anything he can do. He advised that I not worry about quizzes and tests, but instead focus on getting homework in late and trying to stay on time with it. 

I'm trying. I really am. But I just can't do the homework. It is extremely difficult. I'm balancing all this with film sets, work, outside projects, and stress from my personal life. The last time I took German was in 2015. A lot of the homework is forming sentences which is the hardest part for me. I just can't believe I have a full semester's excess of credits and I may not graduate.

Backstory. I've never stayed anywhere more than 4 years. I had a best friend in 1st grade named Luis, he and I moved apart from each other in 2nd grade and we switched schools. I made several new friends in elementary school, but I moved away in 5th grade and lost contact with them immediately, never to be seen again. I never really made friends in middle school. I get to 9th grade, freshman year of highschool in Miami. I'm basically the cool kid now because I just came back from a co-ed Navy camp in Sweden for the summer, which boosted my social skills and self-esteem. In my first day of high school I notice this girl, my now-Ex, walk into my PE class and I knew she was the baddest chick in this school. I was determined to date her. We became close friends the following week, and I was friendzoned. She was my closest friend for a little while. I talked to her daily, even as she had 3 different relationships in the meanwhile. I was just friends with her until 10th grade when we kissed for the first time. Soon enough we were dating, and she was still my only friend pretty much. I mean, I was also really close friends with one of her friends, this girl named Patricia. I had a dream one time before I kissed my now-Ex that I had had sex with Patricia, and I was disturbed by the dream and wrote it down on my phone's dream journal. My Ex saw the entry because of a mistake I made (she wasn't snooping) and read, in detail, my dream of pounding Patricia in the ass. Basically I stopped being friends with Patricia, just to keep my Ex sane. In her defense, Patricia was my neighbor and I would often spend entire days and nights at her house alone.

So my Ex was my first best friend since 1st grade, second best friend in all. She was the only person I knew of that shared my religious beliefs, my philosophical beliefs, my economic beliefs, my humanitarian beliefs, and my interest for science and knowledge. I did love her. She knew all my secrets, every single one. We did things in bed that no one knows about and probably will never know about. She loved me. We wore each other's rings.

We broke up once at the end of Junior year, and she rebounded for a couple months with a friend of mine. She didn't know we were friends, but we did go to school together. She deeply regretted it and came clean about everything. I was dating a girl she hated at the same time in retaliation at the time as well. That was dumb, but we got past it by the middle of the summer.

Senior year is college year, so I was worrying about where I wanted to go to college and where she wanted to go to college. We had been going on college tours together for several years, to Boston, to California. I had dreams of studying away from home, I was desperate to leave Miami. I didn't care where I went really, I just knew I was not going to stay in Miami. My Ex didn't have a notion of where she wanted to go, but she had the same idea as me. Of course, we both knew the chances of us going to the same school were about 0.0000001%. We were more focused on getting a good education rather than pursuing romance. So that's all I thought about, what I was going to do when I got my admissions and I had to choose where I wanted to go to college and I knew I wouldn't be near my Ex anymore. Long-Distance relationships are big NO to me, so I knew we couldn't date in that event. As the admission dates neared (March 1-31) my anxiety increased. I didn't know how to deal with my then-girlfriend.

One day we had an argument over something. It wasn't important, and I wasn't really angry at anything, but I pretended to be. She tried to solve the argument, but I refused to answer her in my half-fake half-real pettiness. She got more upset and told me ""if you don't answer me right now, we're breaking up."" I knew this was the deciding moment. I didn't respond.

From that day, we wouldn't speak to each other again. Partly because of this childish mutual friend of ours from the hood that would feed this idea into her head that ex's are mortal enemies and may never speak. One time I sat next to my ex in the library and we had a normal conversation and our mutual friend showed up and sat in front of us and stared at me ""Why are you sitting next to her?"" Fuck that bitch. I wish she never existed, I let her fuck with my friendship.
Well, a couple weeks after the breakup I heard she got accepted into UCSD (my dream school, which I wasn't admitted to) and I congratulated her promptly and that's the extent of our conversations. 

A couple months later she started dating a guy I had recently started spending my weekends with at different clubs. We went to the club and I found her grinding on him (funny that out of all the clubs in Miami, we all went to the same one on the same night). She's dating him to this day.

It hurt tremendously. Especially because she had promised me from the first time she dated my friend that she would never date one of my friends again. Still hurts actually when I really think about it.

My Ex thought that we broke up because I stopped loving her. And that's what I told her. It wasn't true though. I loved her more than anything in this world, including my own life. But I still lied, and I don't really know why.

The last day of Senior Year though, she was still dating my friend, about 3 months into their relationship, I saw her for the last time I would see her for a while, and she cried in my arms. I was leaving Miami, and she knew she might not see me again. She got in her car and I stood outside the window, and she just sat down and bawled. I hugged her through the window. I told her, out of instinct, ""I love you,"" and I meant it. She answered, maybe out of instinct, through the sobbing, ""I love you too."" And she drove off into the sunset.

I moved to Sweden a couple months later. I texted her my first month there and had a 30 minute conversation. It was kind of small talk, but it was still a little personal. She ended the conversation soon, however, with ""I won't text you again. I respect my boyfriend and I can't be texting my ex-boyfriend."" I understand where she comes from, she had the same rule when I was dating her.

After that text, my quality of life just went to shit. I cried every morning. I made good friends with my German roommate, but I hadn't really recovered yet from my torn relationship with my Ex, who was my only Best Friend in over a decade.

January of this year, I moved back to Miami temporarily. My Ex still lives here, studying at the local Uni. She's still dating the same guy. She loves him. They're flying to Italy together for a semester abroad after the summer. 

I saw her boyfriend in January, and we talked for several hours. He told me about the Italy trip and everything. It was friendly and not awkward. I smoked a blunt by myself while talking to him. I commended their decision to go to Italy, everyone should have a semester abroad at least once. 

I still think about my Ex daily. She has a predisposition to schizophrenia because of her genes, and I read a study recently that marijuana use can accelerate the symptoms of mental health illnesses to the predisposed. So I had texted her boyfriend several scientific journals and articles and a simple explanation that his girlfriend, my Ex, should not be smoking weed for caution of her own health. I went as far to explain to him that I want him to take credit for finding the research. I didn't want my Ex thinking that I was still worrying about her.

In my own life, I've been sleeping around girl to girl. I'm never satisfied, often getting limp dick halfway through, and just laying restless in bed afterwards. Recently I went on a date with a girl from middle school, Lisa, and we have a lot in common. She has a boyfriend of 3 years, however. I don't want input concerning this specifically and I will ignore you, but I'm adding it to give more context. Lisa told me she would break up with her boyfriend of 3 years to engage in a love group. In other words, she would easily break up with her lover in order to date me and any number of other people simultaneously, as lovers, not FWBs. At the moment I told her I disapprove, but honestly it doesn't sound farfetched to me. Now I'm in the process of dating a Ukrainian girl I work close to, and Lisa as well, simultaneously. I connect fairly well with Lisa, I just wish she was originally single, and I'm still getting familiar with the Ukrainian.

Now that all the story is out of the way and everything pertinent is covered I think, what do I do about my Ex? When do I talk to her again? Tomorrow? Years from now? I don't even know if I know who she is anymore, or vice versa.

All I do know is that I wouldn't be able to love her again. She betrayed a promise and left me alone to love somebody else. That's not something I can just forget. But it is something I can accept.

I think almost everyday, ""today might be the day I can talk to her"" without getting attached or falling in love or getting my feelings hurt.

To be honest with yall, I do not look forward to reading your advice. But it's necessary to have unclouded judgement, I feel.

Ask me anything if you'd like to know more.

Thank you for your time kind strangers.",16Mar2017,1

I'm living with my family and in this little house we have my mom, my 3 older brothers and my older sister. My mom and my dad divorced before I was born so I received my mothers maiden name, and because of this... The eldest of my brother had to grow up fast to help my mom raise the family. There's been a lot of stress in his life... I understand that so well... However all my other brothers have started growing up... They help pay for the house and for food and everything. I also work but I make enough to pay for my school and my own bills. I even pitch in when they don't have enough money to pay for the house. This has been been going on for 3 years. The thing is... Within this year, I dropped out of college. I just wasn't doing well because I wasn't motivated anymore. I stopped going to classes and I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and honestly... I got really scared. You can't fail if you don't try right? It was with that mentality that I decided to leave school and I see that was a stupid way to see it.. Anyways because of my brothers past, he's developed a complex where he wants to be with the family at all times and wants us to be together forever (which is really unhealthy..). Because of this, I've been wanting to move out of the house for years and be able to be my own person. The only thing holding me back are my other 2 brothers and my mom... 

The thing is through out this situation I have 2 questions:

The first being:

I'm wondering whether or not I should go back to school (college) and then head towards university. If so, what would you suggest to study? Or should I go to trade school and be able to get a job right away? 

And the second:
 
Should I move out even if my family is against it? Or should I continue staying with my family? 

On a side note: what's also motivating me to move out is that my family doesn't approve of me dating a mulato but we've been dating for almost 4 years. I lied and said I dumped him but really I've stayed with him for all these years. The reason being that they gave me so much shit for it and literally put me into tears everyday till I had to lie to them.. 

Any advice would help..
I'm at a really confusing place in my life right now and I feel completely and utterly helpless and lost..

Hi,

my issue is that i am completely unmotivated. I just finished a semester of university without taking any exams at all (i am from germany where you just get to do that) it is also my first semester. Before that i tried studying math twice only to stop drop and roll after like 3-4 weeks. This time i  tried mechanical engineering. Not taking exams isnt my issue though. Its that i didnt even go to any of the lectures. I even have a roommate who started together with me and had the same classes, hoping this would motivate me anyways. Its not even that i dont like engineering, nor am i aware of any other subject that id rather do. I am just not motivated or so it seems to me. Whenever i try to pick up a book that is on topic i delve off into the depths of internet or do essentially anything else. I am just turning my attention away from what i was initially trying to do within like 5 seconds. This is bothersome to me because it is beyond my control by now. I am really hating myself for failing university like that. It obviously is a lack of discipline as well (i never needed any for anything so i dont have any). I also have the tendencies to overthink alot which has led me to just hate myself all day, well except when i dont which are like the good 5 mins of my day where i feel like everything will be fine( not that this actually occurs daily). I never saw myself as such a failure so obviously the discrepancy between what i think of myself  and what i experience is obviously huge. Which i assume is also the cause for my distress. I also know that i spend most of time feeling sorry for myself. I frankly feel that i have reflected on a lot of this, but obviously havent found a solution. Maybe i am just a PC addict? Maybe i just need someone to talk to? My fiancé is not good at giving advice and i have never really had a bond with my parents that would be a basis for such a talk, they arent really helpful in this regard anyways.
I just want to have something i am passionate about, something i can focus on and be productive i guess. I did spend my entire life gaming alone though so i do not have the slightest clue where to go from here, like no specially affection for plants or puzzles or machines. I am actually not even good with computers. Laughable i know. I am kind of just existing. There isnt even a vision i have for my future, although i kinda like to work in science, though that is just me imaginung people in labcoats. Feel free to ask me more question, i say this because i have the constant feeling of being misunderstood in general.

95,"So I live a college apartment with three guys, two of them are fine but one is complete slob. He has ""bad adhd"" and as a result of either his adhd, his mega adderral prescription, or him just being a lazy ass, he never cleans up after himself. Constantly leaves dirty pots and pans on the stovetop, dishes in the sink, food in the fridge for months after its gone bad, and a sink covered in hairs after shaving.

Beginning of the school year I asked him multiple times to politely to clean up his dishes, or to throw away his trash and he cleaned up maybe once. After that I realized I just had to separate as much from him as possible, so my housemates and I divided up fridge space, pantry space, and split bathrooms so that the slob now has his own bathroom and the three of us share one that we keep clean. 

About two months into living with him and I had been washing some of his dishes from time to time in order to keep enough space in the sink for me to wash my own dishes. I decide to ask an uncle of mine for advice on how to get this slob to wash his dishes. Uncle tells me to put all of the slobs dirty dishes in a garbage and put it on the porch. So I proceed to do exactly that, filled up two garbage bags with dishes and such and put em out on the porch. Slob house mate doesn't say word, doesn't even touch the dishes but just starts using more of the clean dishes he has left. 

Keep in mind I have my own set of dishes pots pans so nothing is shared between us. After about a month the sink and countertops are filled with his crap again so I repeat the garbage bag deal, and this cycle repeats until he is almost completely out of all clean dishes, pots, pans, utensils and there are about 5 small bags of his crap on the porch.

After it got warm again, about two weeks ago, a clean housemate of mine wanted to start using the porch again so he told the slob house mate to clean his dishes from the porch or they would be trashed. Couple days go by, slob doesn't clean them and clean housemate tosses all of his dishes. The slob had been hanging onto one set of essentials that he was using at this point. About a week ago he used my pan, pot and plate and left them unwashed as he does everything. I told him not to use my stuff again, washed the dishes and put them away in my cabinet. He has used my dishes three times in the past week and I told him not twice, the third time I tossed all of his beans away.. what I had found in my pot when he left it unwashed a couple days ago. He proceeded to bitch about how he knew he had more beans, and started complaining about why all of his dishes were gone. I told him that our housemate had given him the option of cleaning his dishes and not just letting them rot before he threw them away, and he's all like, ""I'll let that slide but only that time""

I really don't know how to deal with him at this point. I could possibly get a lock and lock my cabinet up with my shit in it, but that would be about $30 and a hassle every time I need to eat. He also uses my hot sauce, ketchup or salad dressing and then just leaves it out of the fridge and uncapped on the counter. So I would have to buy my own fridge and lock it in order for him to stop using those things.

What can I do to get him to stop using my stuff and live like a civilized person. Any advice is appreciated.",16Mar2017,3

103,"Hello all, my name is Marco and this will be my first ever Reddit post ever. I'm new to this whole blogging/internet advice seeking but honestly I really have nowhere else to turn. Long story short I am a current freshman in college seeking a business management degree. I am 19 about to turn 20, and things have been taking a turn for the worse. 

Let's start off new and I'll bring you to the beginning of high school with a little background about myself. My name is Marco, I grew up with 3 older brothers and 2 loving parents who would do anything to see me be successful. My parents managed to put my brothers and I in one of the most prestigious high schools in my state and have blessed us with nothing but the best. I played lacrosse throughout my high school career but always wasn't the smartest in the classroom (never seemed to interest me). Coming into my senior year of high school I managed to attain over 13 D1-DIII scholarships for NCAA lacrosse and I thought nothing could stop me. When it really came down to the wire I was the only one out of my 3 brothers to play lacrosse (we were a football family) but I guess that's why I was the black sheep. My parents hated lacrosse they always thought it was too physical and never wanted to see me get injured. Anyways back to the basics, going into senior year I locked in my commitment to play D2 for the university of Tampa. The following weeks after my mother had a sit down with me and broke the news that she refused to send me somewhere far from home. Saddened I had to listen because there was no way possible I could do that so my family. I managed to change my commitment to another D3 college about an hour away from home and my mother ended up to be very happy with my choice. (I soon learned I wasn't) following the first semester at this small college I ended up realizing I had no idea what I was doing there or why I even needed to be there, my parents were struggling financially and I felt it would just be best to leave this college and attend a community college in my hometown for the sake of my family. This is my first month without touching a lacrosse stick and I sort of feel like I'm a mistake you know? I had so much riding for me in the beginning and it all fell apart really quickly before my eyes. Following joining this community college I began to sell drugs, use and eventually not really have any regard for what I was doing in my life. My mother has confronted me multiple times and I can honestly say I haven't felt like a bigger mistake in my life for making my mother cry as many times as I have and it's all sort of a rush to the head you know? But why I'm here today is to seek guidance for my situation, like what do I see in my future? I really wanted to start producing music I have a taste for it but honestly no skills to match it. I miss lacrosse but no colleges will look at me regardless anymore and my family is struggling financially as well. Like there has to be something more to my situation and I just need some advice. I stay up a lot thinking about what I could of done differently and I really don't see much of a future from here.

Long story short, I'm very concerned for both their physical and mental well-being. After nearly 18 years of fighting back and forth, I'm sure it's taken quite the toll on their system. My dad has told me multiple times he only remains in the relationship with my mother for me. He had a really shitty childhood, so I'm not surprised he'd sacrifice his happiness for mine. Thats the thing though - I'm not happy.

The only ""way out"" I see for my parents, is if I went independent. Then they wouldn't have to feel obligated to be miserable for my sake.

So that brings me to my actual question: how should I start getting ready to move out? What are my options? Im sure there's better questions to ask but I can't think of any at the moment.

To give you guys some context to work with: 

I turn 18 this July.

I have my own vehicle.

I am not currently employed (the struggle is real)

I have literally 0 irl friends to turn to. (New city)

I plan on going to a college sometime next year.

Thanks.

Concerned for parents' wellbeing; want to move so they can separate. Advice for moving out/general advice would be appreciated.

109,"On the one hand I'm thrilled to be starting my PhD in the fall. I've put a lot of thought into the decision and I know it's what I want. On the other hand, I'm 23 years old and ready to start a family with my partner, but now I have decided to put it off until I finish my degree, 5-6 years from now.

So we want to rescue a dog. 

(I'm scared to post about rescuing pets on reddit because I've seen a lot of people get chewed out by redditors who assume all OPs are assholes who have no idea what a huge responsibility pet care is. **Please take my word for it that I take pets seriously and that for my entire life I have always had pets, including dogs, that I've helped my parents care for and train.**)

So now on to what kind of advice I'm looking for.

FIRST: About the difficulties of finding pet-friendly housing. If I have to spend a summer out of state doing research at another university, will it be nearly impossible to find summer housing that will allow me to take my furry child along? My partner is a pilot that goes on trips for 2-3 days at a time, so I will be the one who's home every day. Therefore if I travel, the dog will come with me. :)

Second: About time commitment. I feel so ready to take care of a dog, but I'm curious to hear about other people's experience with it. Getting your PhD (taking classes + researching + teaching) is extremely time-consuming -- do any of you guys have stories about adopting a dog in such a busy time of your life?",16Mar2017,1
111,"Hi! First off, just wanna say, this is 100% NOT as important as some of the other threads I have read. I just need some advice on this.

A few years ago, I started working at Pizza Hut, it was my first job so of course I was excited, but after a few months (around 4-5 months) I started to absolutely dread waking up to go into work. Eventually I decided to say ""screw it"" and quit without notice. This was about 2 years ago.. I've gone through about 4-5 jobs ever since in which I've only worked a total of about 1 month combined between those jobs.

I guess my issue is that I can't keep a job that has no meaning. Pizza Hut : I worked there for six months, I learned NOTHING about sales, marketing, finance things I'd need to know in the work force. I mean I already knew about teamwork, responsibility and all that jazz, but what makes Pizza hut different from any other minimum wage fast food chain job? Same with places like stores, I can't see myself saying ""Yeah! I'd LOVE to learn how to stock shelves for 8 hours.""

I live by the quote ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."" When I say live by it.. I mean live by it.. I want to get into media. Film, Graphic Design stuff like that. But that kinda of career path doesn't do well with where I live. I've thought ""Hey, why don't I just move to California or somewhere"" but I need money for that and the only way to do that is by working. 

I'm in this giant circle of wanting to get a job, but knowing if I just go find some job that will finally decide to hire me, I'll eventually, within a short amount of time, start to hate it once again. 

Overall, I want to do bigger and better things without having to go through years of shitty work. Can you really blame me??

I'd love to hear others input and advice on this.. Thanks!",16Mar2017,2
112,"So I don't enjoy being at my girlfriends house, mainly because her step dad is in my opinion an asshole. Not to me directly but he treats her like shit when I'm not there, he says stuff to her like ""it's sad you're that size"" when she isn't even fat or chubby or anything she's perfectly normally sized. 

And when she says to him that she's staying at my house for a couple of nights he turns around and says ""Do his parents even want you there?"" or ""Are you sure you're wanted there?"". I mean like I invite her over and my parents don't mind if she's over because they absolutely love her. He criticizes her so much and sometimes when I'm around, it makes me feel uncomfortable because I want to step in and say something because I love her but it's her step-dad and I don't want to make things worse or anything like that.

He claims he wants to spend more time with her because lately she's been spending lots of time at my house but he doesn't even spend much time at home or even take her places. I do all that, I take her everywhere she needs to go 99% of the time, to work, to school, to go shopping, back home. 

I love spending time with her just not at her house if her step dad is there.

116,"So I was witnessing two thugs trying to steal a woman's purse on the street today. One pretended to hit his bike on the woman's bike while the other sneaked his hand on the space under the woman's bike and grabbed the purse. I was driving right behind them, on bike, as well. So when I saw the crime, I yelled: ""Stop!"". I don't know what was my reason to do such bold thing but that was the only thing slipped out of my mouth. What I forget to expect that these thugs turned around and cursed and yelled at me with the most threatening manner that I can imagine. One even pulled out a knife that he wrapped around with rags and pointed at me. At that point I started realizing what a huge mistake that was. So I apologize and try to pull my bike away from the scene. Luckily those thugs didn't stab me and they dropped the purse. But when I got home, I feel very frighten. I never been so close to be stabbed/physically hurt like this ever in my life. To people who have been robbed/threaten on the streets: how do you get over this horrible feeling?",16Mar2017,6
119,"My family and even other people close around me don't accept me for who I am. I'm gay, never had a problem with it, and if I'm honest I've got a few kinks of my own (have a soft spot for bears 🐻) but everyone is making my life hell because of it. 

Of course, I wish I could be that stereotypically straight son who could make his father proud and bear his grandchildren one day but it's not going to happen...as liberal as Reddit it, real life doesn't work like that; there are people who'll gladly see me dead/hurt just for who I am and if that's the way of the world I'd rather not live it.

121,"I don't see the point in living - objectively speaking. Sure I'm happy sometimes, and I acknowledge that, but there are spaces in the middle where i feel like if I weigh the happiness in my life versus the difficulties I face, I would rather die. Maybe I'm just a spoiled kid like that. 


Usually it's fine when I have people to spend my time with, but I am not exactly the best person to be friends with, erratic behaviour, tendency to be irritating and all, and my good friends have more than enough on their plate than to be dealing with me on top of all of that. I feel scared that my friends don't want to hang out with me, but I never exactly gave them a good reason to do so, and I feel like I do nothing but annoy people in most of my relationships. I would like to change, but it's easier said then done. On some level I feel like I crave the attention. 


Recently my best friend has been very stressed and she doesn't have time to talk to me anymore and I'm lonely and have no one to talk to. (kinda pathetic but yeah) I'm bad at making friends and I don't really like making friends but I like having friends. 


Philosophically speaking I feel like life has no meaning, and that's supposed to liberate me but I feel like if life has no meaning and currently if living sucks why should I live. If I live, and go through all these difficulties just for fleeting moments of happiness, it would be quite stupid right?


I did try self-harm but then I thought it was completely stupid and then I laughed at myself afterwards. I don't know what made me try it. Some people say it makes it better and I supposed I was hoping. I played it off as being clawed by a cat so that's fine. 


I guess I like reading and playing games but I get bored of things very easily. I feel like all these things are just filler, something to waste your time on, like that lousy phone game that you open when you have nothing better to do. 


Life seems kinda empty. I know some people say you make your own meaning out of life but I have so many things that I 'must' do so that I can get a good grade, a good job, live in moderate comfort until I die. Why not skip all that and just go straight to the dying part?


To be honest, I've thought of, I don't know, doing something risky, and then killing myself, so I know it's either killing myself or going to prison and it would force my hand and make me kill myself but I'm scared. I was thinking I would kill someone else and feel guilty and kill myself but I don't want to kill someone else and ruin their life too.

The issue is that we are getting paid the same no matter what we do and the people who do less than the people who go above the quota get easier jobs because it's ""harder"" for them to meet. I was wondering should I just do the minimum since I believe it's unfair that the slower people get the easier jobs. This might increase my chances of getting an easier job or hurt it by showing my manager that I'm only going to do the minimum and they may punish me by giving me a slightly harder job or leave me at my position but never give me a chance to do something else.

Recently I realised that some of my behaviour that I thought was quite normal is perhaps a problem, but that means I can work on it now so it's not all doom and gloom.

I have noticed I become very anxious about new opportunities/tasks. This shows in three major ways.

1. I find it very difficult to start work when I am unfamiliar with it, often leaving it a few days before the submission deadline.
2. I also procrastinate over Opportunities that involve a lot of change. E.g I am going on placement for my third year but because this change is very daunting I have left it incredibly late to start applying for placements.
3. I find it difficult to talk to someone and spark that initial interaction. But after this, I find it very easy to socialise.

I also suffer from Trichotillomania. Which basically means I pull my hair out when I am stressed. I use to pull my eyelashes when I was a kid but I now pull out the hairs on my neck. It feels weird to write that, but it's true and other than that I'm a very normal bloke.

What I'm trying to say is it's clear I struggle with change, and it creates a lot of anxiety for me. What can I do to overcome it? I want to be able to dive into things with drive and excitement, not shrink away from things that I know will make me grow and develop.

In fact, I am regarded as one of the happiest people at work (dubbed ""Smiley"" by a few coworkers.  If they only knew...).  While not at work I do one of two things; either I go to the gym, or I often just sit alone in my apartment, not really doing anything as I've lost interest in a lot of activities.  As I'm sure I am not the only one going through this, I ask, what do you do when you're by yourself and have no friends in the area?  How the hell does an adult make friends (I moved about 3 years ago, and haven't had any luck so far)? I'd really like to start dating again as well, but if I can't even make friends... then that seems pretty hopeless.

Last week before a big critique (I'm an art major. Critiques are art presentations of big projects) I sat in the car before class full of anger and anxiety about my critique, to the point where my mind kept thinking ""I'm gonna kill myself."" Now, I've never had suicidal thoughts before, though I have self harmed a lot. Even in that moment the thoughts kept coming, I didn't want to act on them. I didn't WANT to do it. I never have wanted to. The thoughts weren't mine. I'd talk to a friend and distract myself for a moment but then the thought would pop into my head again. It was really scary and frustrating. I even kept muttering shut up to myself. I ended up going and doing the critique and it went fine. The thoughts stopped when I got to class.  

I've been seeing a therapist for 7months and told her about this issue last week. She told me it's my anxiety disorder, and that's why I kept seeing the thoughts as not mine because they aren't. It's just anxiety, which attaches itself to things and alarms you of danger that isn't there, or gives thoughts/feelings that aren't really yours. 

I believed and understood her, I still do. And yet, the thoughts come back now and again, a week later. It's been  an especially hard time personally for me. I hate my living situation, I'm going through a rough, long process of a breakup, I feel awful when I see that partner hurt because of me needing the breakup, I feel guilt, I feel stuck in an anxiety-inducing living situation in which stress between roommates is ever increasing, I'm starting to feel the weight of taking five classes at once, I don't have a car, I can't get a job without a car really, I need to figure myself out... 

Mostly im stressed out, and stuck in a place with persons that makes my anxiety worse and restricts productivity. This is mostly due to my landlady who very much intimidates me and makes me uncomfortable and is loud and strict and rude and judgemental. I could move back with my dad, but that is a lot of stress in itself, I'd hate to offend/piss off my roommates by leaving (but oh well), I won't have my own room, and I don't want to keep my dad from moving to his girlfriend many states away which he's trying to do when he gets a job there.

It's not that I'm working too hard. I just hate the place with a fiery rage. I've been applying around but haven't heard back from anywhere, and I think it's because of my availability between school and having to share a car. I'm one of the best front-crew at the Bk and no one stays there longer than a year so they are accommodating.

I have $700 in savings I could steal from, a loving (and slightly rich) aunt who would probably pay it for me, or I could work it out. I'm about to start getting late fees which will cap at $100. I asked my dad if he could pay half, but my parents refuse to help. 

If I take from my savings, I could be done with it today, avoid late fees, and quit my job. But then I'm missing $500 I might need should something come up.

I could ask my aunt, but she has already given me so much and I'd feel guilty lol.

I really do not want to stay at Bk. It's mentally draining and many times I come home from shifts crying. There's an overpass down the road from it where I've thought about jumping off.

I emailed him and explained delicately why continuing with this extra project was now complicated and emotionally difficult for me, and suggested other people for the project, and his response was ""tough luck- you said yes"".

They have a 4 bedroom house and I was told that to make room for the nursery and home office I would have to take the smallest room in the back. I didn't fight against this since it is THEIR house. Then I was told that once the baby is born I cannot smoke outside or near their house at all anymore. I've never smoked inside, I've always smoked outside in the backyard. I was also told that the air conditioner will not be turned on this summer because it'll dry out the baby's skin. The rest of the house is tiled or has laminate flooring so it is considerably cooler than the bedrooms that have carpet. I was also told that they would be ripping out the carpet in all the bedrooms and putting tile except mine because it is too expensive. I live in southern California, in the desert area.

We all don't really like this guy but we tried to understand her because she loves him and don't want to get between them. He cheated on her once but she still went back to him (we confronted her tho). One time her boyfriend even messaged me to not go out with her until late even though it's only 7.30 pm???? DON'T even get me started talking about his family who doesn't like him dating my best friend because of something unreasonable but i can't tell you. and then she became distant like never tell us anything about him anymore only sometimes, I get the feeling because she doesn't want us to judge her boyfriend anymore. At first it was still fine but now that we're all in college (we still live in the same city) she's more distant than ever, we never really hang out anymore with her but she still sometimes reply to our group message, every time we ask her to join us hang she always have excuses.

152,"This semester I decided to study abroad in Europe till the end of may. However, before I left, I began to catch feelings for one of my closer college friends who I've known for more than 2 years. I was thinking of confessing my feelings to her before leaving but I didn't want to do that and then be away for several months without spending time together, especially considering the importance of the ""budding stages"" of a relationship.

However after being abroad for a couple months I am kind of worried that a different guy may ask her out while I am here and that I could miss my opportunity. I was thinking about calling her on the phone and just letting her know of my feelings, and see where it went from there, but again I am concerned that this would be a bit selfish on my part and I do not want it to seem like she is a prize that I have to ""lock down"" or something. Regardless it is a reason for concern on my part.

I think it is likely she would say yes should I ask her out but I'm not completely sure and for this reason I am stumped on what to do, if anything. If someone could advise me on this I would love you forever haha.

I had to apply for a new passport and decided (stupidly) to trust the website estimation for routine service (6-8 weeks, including mail time). I sent in the application in January and figured that giving myself 10 weeks would be sufficient. 

The process has been very unlucky thus far. 8 weeks later, and it still hasn't arrived, nor has the status even changed to ""shipped."" The service representatives on the phone can't really tell me anything more than the website. I'm a worrier, so I'm starting get panicky. 

I decided to pay to have it expedited earlier this week, but the payment hasn't been acknowledged/gone through yet, I think because of the storm on the east coast. Expedited service can take 2-3 weeks, according to the website, but I'm not nearly so trusting as I had been. 

I'm planning on making an appointment at my closest agency (Detroit) on Monday if the status doesn't change by this weekend. Has anyone had luck with rushing an application through an agency? The last successful story on the internet was posted ~2007.

162,"I've been married for 5 years but I still feel like a horrible person for how I treated the first girl I ever dated. This happened a long time ago but I still feel pretty terrible about it. When I was in college I met a girl and hit it off with her immediately. We dated for close to a year, and I loved her more then anything in the world. The reason we broke up isn't related to this story at all. She ended our relationship months after any of this happened because she felt depressed and refused to let me help her. It killed me, but I still tried to be there for her afterwards, and she still wanted nothing to do with me.

Without avoiding the purpose of this confession any longer, My girlfriend and I used to sleep in the same bed every night and I'd touch her while she was asleep. She used to take sleeping pills so she never really woke up while I was doing it. We were sexually active, but sometimes when we were laying together I'd just get the urge to touch her and try to turn her on. I never inserted myself into her, but I'd rub up against her, I'd touch her everywhere, and I'd play with her hair. If she woke up I'd pretend to be asleep, I'm not really sure why though because I doubt she would have really been angry if she'd found out I was doing it. I always felt bad about doing it, but I'd always find an excuse to do it again too. I'm also not sure she ever found out I did this to her. This went on for a while but I eventually stopped doing it because I was worried I might hurt her feelings if she ever found out. The thought of losing her scared the shit out of me back then.

I'm not sure if I acted this way because of immaturity, or if it was some kind of weird kink I had, but as I've gotten older I've realized how truly disgusting these actions were. I honestly hate who I was, and I wish I could go back in time and beat the shit out of myself until I understood what I do now. My therapist seems to think this was do to immaturity considering I have not done anything like this since, but I still have the urge to, so I'm not entirely sure that's it. Regardless, I really hope I didn't hurt her in anyway, and that's the real reason I feel horrible about my past actions. The thought of me hurting her saddens me greatly, and I hope to god I didn't.

167,"Hi, here is some context to the story I'm gonna share (before asking for some advice on how to deal with the issues). I'm a male student in Singapore, had dealt with depression and self-esteem issues before, have family issues. I am fairly decent at studies so I tend to offer help to my friends.


Here's the story:

**2016 Jan - March:**

I've just entered a new school after secondary school/grades 7 to 10. I was starting afresh, and I was appointed class rep by my classmates because I seemed the most responsible. After seeing that the class was getting fragmented slowly, I tried to get the class together to bond and be united. But it only made me the one being left out. Luckily, a girl (lets call her Jo), came to help me and comforted me a lot. She made me feel less lonely and left out. Soon, we managed to ""integrate"" ourselves into a pre-existing clique with 4 girls. Everything was fine here.


**2016 April** 

We have received our groupings for a year-long coursework project. I was grouped with Jo, and two other girls from our clique. At the start of the coursework, the 2 girls had not been very cooperative so I tried to make them do their part for the group work. One of those girls (lets call her Le), had been most uncooperative. She would speak over whoever was speaking, pry for everyone's undivided attention but would not contribute useful ideas most of the time. As group leader(appointed by them too), I tried to solve the issue and talk to her about it. She acknowledged but did not change in any way afterwards. I would often complain to Jo about it and she would talk to her about it but to no avail. Also, I overheard that the 2 girls had said that because me and Jo are so hardworking, they can slack more and let us 'carry' them.


**2016 May - June**

My family issues were starting to increase much more again, and I was left mostly angsty, irritated or depressed. Furthermore, I found out that the clique was starting to leave me out of things. (Of course I don't expect them to invite me to everything, but even simple things like talking to me in class/breaks was absent). I talked to them about it and things improved slightly. In the times where things were worsening again, I would tell Jo about it. Because of my family issues, Jo tried to help me a lot too, but she could not and she only offered very general advice/solutions. As a result, I got angry at her and told her that I felt that she was not there for me. She cried afterwards and i swore to myself not to say things that would hurt people (esp girls) again.


**2016 June - Aug**

For the most part, things were improving clique-wise. However, for the groupwork project, the other 2 girls (esp Le) started to do less than their part again. They were also often late/absent from group meetings that everyone agreed to and did not contribute much. Basically, Jo and I tanked most of the group work. I was really fed up and complained to Jo because of how irresponsible the 2 of them are, and she told me that she would talk to them about it. I'm not sure if she did, but things did not improve much afterwards. There were tensions between everyone in the group. I heard from the rest of the clique that the 2 girls are afraid of me, but because of the past experience of hurting Jo, I did not talk to them about it. Afterwards, my friendship with the clique was deteriorating once again but this time, my friendship with Jo was worsening as well.


**2016 Sept**

This month was my birthday, but was also the month right before some major examinations. Nevertheless, Jo and the clique (minus Le) got me presents. I was happy. Really happy. But it was short-lived. Because after giving me the presents, the rest of the clique went back to leaving me out again. Keep in mind that all these while I've been complaining to Jo about how they are leaving me out, hoping that she would help me mediate things without hurting the feelings of the clique. In addition, 3 more girls were invited into the clique (which i was okay with and did not object). However, they were added to a separate group in a messaging app without me in it. I did not find this out yet.


**2016 Late Sept - Oct**

In this examination period, most of the class was studying, including the clique. But things were not improving family wise or friendship wise, and so I became more and more depressed over time. Even Jo had to part herself from me because she wanted to do well. (I do not blame anyone in this period but it just feels really bad). Because of how everyone was treating me coldly in this period, be it intentional or not, there was this one week where i was really so sad that I pushed away everyone (mostly Jo because shes the only one who came). This worsened our friendship even more.


**2016 Nov**

After the examinations, the year-long coursework was approaching its final submissions soon too. Luckily for me, everyone in the group work pulled their own weight for this last part, but the wound that was made from the months of tension was still there. It was this period that because of the past tensions over the months, I almost commited suicide (I'm not sucidial now). It became so bad that the rest of my clique  went to tell the school counsellor, who forced me to skip lectures. I was particularly angry about this incident not because they had reported my case to the counsellor, but because i was forced to skip lessons, which I valued a lot. I managed to calm down and not feel suicidal because of Jo. Keep in mind that my family issues are still ongoing.


**2016 Dec - 2017 Jan**

This period was where we had our holidays. This was when i found out that the clique had made a group without me, and i asked them about it. They said that they were scared that I was not welcoming, which i denied, saying that I was okay with them joining. They acknowledged it but did not add me to the new group. In fact, they started using the new group more instead of our old group, which made me feel left out even more. Not much else negative things happened this holidays, and our friendships were healing slowly (to me). The only other thing that happened was that Jo told me that she had enough and left me for the clique, which shattered me.


**2017 Late Jan - Feb**

This was when I decided that I had enough of my family issues and decided to cut them off emotionally. As a result, I sought solace in my clique more. But what i found out after school had started was that the 8 girls were still ignoring me and leaving me out. I made one last attempt to ask them why, which they did reply positively (once again) and tried to include me in lunch breaks. However, it only happened once. The second time i tried to join them for lunch breaks, they ignored me again, even if i was the one who started the conversation. This felt like an insult to me so I decided to take a break from them for a week to think about what to do. I decided that I would try for one last month before deciding what to do again.


**2017 March (so far)**

After taking my time to think and joining them for lunch more, i realised that they were not willing to talk to me. Especially with Le and one other girl around, all the attention would be dragged to them, and no one else. I'm not sure if they realise it, even though i did tell some of the clique members in the suicidal period. I tried to talk to one of them about how I felt left out once more. She told me that ""the clique feels that we cant clique anymore"" and that they would like me to go away. This made my heart hurt (literally and metaphorically).


**Situation Right Now**

They would reply with one word answers/texts when they do, otherwise they would ignore me.


**TL:DR**

Clique of girls used to be welcoming to me, but for reasons that I'm not sure of, they decided to leave me out and cut me off completely.


**Acknowledgement of mistakes**

I will admit that I had made these mistakes:
* Allowed my emotions get the better of me, especially when in times of family issues
* I had hurt Jo by saying that she was not there for me, even though she was, just that her help was not effective.
* I probably had not communicated enough with the clique (partially because of my personality, partially because of past experiences)
* I got really angry at the clique for indirectly forcing me to skip lessons
* The clique mentioned that I was really negative as well, which I will admit I was, because of my lack of emotional contorl.

**Question/Help**

1. What should I do? I feel really helpless and sad. It feels like all the hard work I've put in into the relationships just got ruined because of me/some reason unknown. I'm effectively alone in my class now as I have nowhere to turn to. (The other cliques have already been long solidified and are not willing to accept anyone)

2. Also, can I ask if it is okay to expect your group of friends to invite you to stuff, or not leaving you out in general?

3. Is this a case of sexism? Is it because I'm the only guy in the clique that they decided to leave me out of stuff?

4. What could be the cause of the downfall of this relationship? (So that i can learn and improve on myself, maybe others could learn from me too idk)

**Disclaimer**

* I'm still okay with only one of the girls there. It maintained like this throughout because she was there for me, and her help was the most effective of them all. (Shes not Jo).
* I'm also okay with some of the guys in my class, but not to the level where I would sit next to them everyday and join their clique.
* As with friends outside of my class, I have a friends in my CCA as well as from my secondary school, but I can't be seeing them everyday either.

If I go for an interview and this company wants me then I have to go with the first company that offers me the job.

174,"So how do I start. I am currently in 10th grade and live with my dad. I've been living (at least I thought it is/was) depression  for about 2 years. I told some friends about it but that didn't help. In my the last half of my school year I've skipped school at least 45 times. I've gotten rid of that habit and I'm trying to keep it up but I've done the same for 2 weeks now. Today my dad got an e-mail from my teacher saying that I've not been at school for 2 weeks. My dad got mad took away my pc and told me I won't see it for a long time. He also told me that I won't make this year that I will repeat or that I should just give up school and work or that i should just move and work at a part time company(He's been doing this for months now). Him saying that made my depression become worse again and I'm starting to lose hope. I've been starting to have suicidal thoughts since at the moment life is just shit. I moved to my dad's place 3 years ago my grades went down and I did not make a single friend till now(I did but that only held for 6 months and we didn't meet very often and my old friends live too far away for me to easily visit them so i talk to them over pc). I've been going to school coming back home using my pc and waiting for friends to come online play with them and then sleep for the last 3 years. I have no social life and my only hobbys are gaming and going to the gym since nothing seems appealing. Not even gaming by itself only when i'm with my old friends.

176,"So I live in a moderately bigger city in Ontario, Canada (not Toronto or Ottawa). I rent the main floor of a 2 unit house that's locked by a main entry door and my own personal door that has a deadbolt. THREE times now in the past 4-5 weeks, I've come home to find my doors wide open randomly. The first time I thought I maybe somehow forgot to lock it. But the second and third times, I found snow tracked in and a couple drawers open AND my door was bashed up including a boot print at the bottom. NOTHING was visibly moved, broken, or missing.. but someone has been in. Other problem is neighbour leaves the main door unlocked ALL the time despite the landlord asking her not to.

I am concerned someone could be messing with my food so I tossed some stuff in my fridge but can't afford to throw out everything based on paranoia but it's freaking me out because I have a kid. It seems doubtful but... it's just so weird.

My camera, laptop, TVs... all still there. 

I'm a single mom, not involved with any sketchy people, never done drugs, don't have any flashy stuff that would suggest I am wealthy to random people passing my house (because I'm not lol). The ONLY hunch I have is that for the past 7 months I've had major issues with my neighbour upstairs and her neurotic dogs, noisy night escapades, purposely waking my kid up at 3 AM, leaving dog poop everywhere, and after dealing with her directly failed, finally have been working with my landlord who offered her eviction or to give notice (she took notice and moves the end of April supposedly). She has some questionable looking company so I wouldn't be shocked if it wasn't related.

But why would someone even do this? Any ideas?? Maybe just to be intimidating?? 

Should I even bother calling police? I hate wasting their time and I feel like they'll laugh at me or think I'm silly because nothing was stolen or destroyed and there's no real proof. I can't even prove the door wasn't already like that (but I know it wasn't and landlord confirmed).",16Mar2017,1

178,"Within the past couple of months, I moved to a new desk that is essentially a reception desk out in the open. I am not an administrative assistant but I have many people stopping by to either chat or ask work-related questions. My previous desk was in an office with two other cubicles and I could shut my door when I didn't want to be interrupted. My job consists of data analyzation and a lot of concentration so naturally when I get interrupted, it breaks my concentration. I'm an introvert so the interruptions are not exactly welcomed. Unfortunately, I've been talked to about these ""issues"" because I ""chat too much"" and it's been affecting my work quality. I expressed these concerns before our team moved in that I'm not going to be not as friendly and my work quality will go down. Luckily I've been thanked for my flexibility in this situation.

I purchased bright purple Beats headphones to wear when I don't want to be disturbed but it's entirely ineffective and doesn't look professional when my desk is right next to my VP and CEO. Oftentimes board members and other high-level community members are passing by. 

Example: two colleagues (not in my department) are having an unrelated (to my job) conversation right now at my reception counter. *sigh*

My question: how can I professionally put up a sign or an indicator to show people to not disturb me? What should the sign say? What other tips can you give me that would politely discourage interruptions and tell people to fuck off when I'm concentrating? 

TL;DR: my desk is in the open and I don't want to be interrupted. How can I tell/show people to leave me alone?",16Mar2017,1
179,"Long story short there's this guy with no friends in my class, and out of pity me and my best friend ""befriended"" him last year. Actually he was the one to start talking with us, but we got along with it cause we had same interests. 

This year he started talking and trying to fit in with me and my best friend even more. We didn't want to get close to him, but again out of pity we talked to him sometimes. But we realized he started getting slightly attached to us, and that is when the weird stuff started happening. The first thing was the sexual innuendos he did, but we kind of overlooked that one. Next and the creepiest of everything he did, he confessed to my friend he has been following her to see where he lives, which is very creepy. I confronted him and told him this isn't going anywhere, it is genuinely disgusting and we don't want to be his friends anymore, but he just keeps talking. Cause we stopped giving him attention, he started doing other kinds of weird shit as taking my phone from me and hiding it when i wasn't looking, following us to the bathrooms and waiting for us in front of it. We ignored him for the longest time, but that didn't really stop the creepy stuff from happening. Since me and my friend always insult and are ironic at each other, and he is in some fantasy we are his friends, i assume that's the reason he's not taking us seriously.
Now what do we do? How to we make it clear to him we REALLY don't want to be his friends anymore, but not make him snap?? I feel like cutting him off will lead to him doing something even creepier.",16Mar2017,2
183,"I spent a bunch of money on front row/pit floor Greenday tickets. They've been one of my favorite bands, and I've listened to them since I was like 12 and I really want to see them live. I'm a huge music fan and I play music myself a bit. I bought tickets to a show half way across the country as i was planning to move around there anyway, around this time but unfortuantely due to this huge storm that happened all over the world, I got stranded and all my plans got side tracked. Anyway, it's like around 500 for bus tickets to get to the area and then I'd still have to take the bus back again (well price is a round trip, to go there and come back) I also like traveling. But I don't know, is this kind of crazy to do? it's a long bus ride as well. I live in Canada btw. 

I like Greenday a lot, but I'm not obsessed or anything. Should I still go? I saw Muse at the front row as well, another one of my favorite bands. I sort of feel like greenday is the Beatles of my generation.  I want to see them while they still have energy and are young, not old or something reliving the glory days...their music has sort of been the ""soundtrack"" to my life in a way and has become a part of who I am. I know they are not like some indie/hard metal ""hipster"" kind of band, but I still like them. I am not a groupie though and I am a male. Music has been like my life, and I really grew up that way. They are one of the bands that had a big influence on the person I am.

I'm not in the worst position right now. Ages 15-24 was just pretty much a steady stream of shittiness, lots of it my fault. Now I'm kind of stabilising financially and mentally. I have a full time job, no debts, and bills low enough that I can save a good chunk of my wages. 

What I really need to do is get out of my current town. It is my hometown, and it is a backwater. Also, unfortunately for me, I have earned a somewhat bad reputation in this town, a reputation I probably deserved honestly. But I'm not the same person I was when I was 17. I need to move on.

I need to get out this town and go live in a city. I need to learn how to develop social skills because I've become a bit of a shut-in and I wasn't exactly the most socially skilled person in the first place. 

I apply for jobs in other cities regularly, never hear back. I put my current address in my CV and mention that I'm definitely moving to this place soon. I have it all planned out in my head what I'd do if I got a job offer. I'd move to the city immediately, stay in a hostel or something first of all, get settled in at the job, and then look for a place to rent. 

How much money should I have in the first place before doing this? I was thinking at least 3 months wages saved up. It's so dire here, and I'm sure everyone at my job dislikes me. 

Thanks for reading my lame story. If you have any advice or questions please fire away.

186,"Hello all,
I really need to get this off my chest and if someone can give me any type of advice, I'd be happy to hear it. In short, I have two very different sides of me - the professional side of me: I know who I am, I know what I'm capable of and in all fairness - my current success has exceeded my expectations by a factor of a 1000. I moved back to my home country in eastern Europe when I graduated from university because I wanted to forget a woman I was in love with. For the most part, it worked - I had a little more than 500 euros and a couch to sleep at my grandmother's house. At 29, I am the lead software engineer for a huge multinational corporation and my team is in charge of the project that generates around 70% of the company's revenue. In my free time I work on my own startup which is proving to be extremely successful to say the least. Funny thing is few people from my current workplace know any of that. At the same time I am currently acquiring one of the most spectacular flats I've ever seen, not only in real life but in magazines as well - location, views, interior, everything is mind boggling(I'm buying it from the architect who built it for herself so it should be). In short, I am successful and I know it. I've never been smug about it, and in fact I've always tried to hide all that and I have been exceptionally good at keeping this a secret. If you see me walking down the street, you’d never be able to guess any of that.

Then there's the other side of me: I did mention that I moved back home after graduation because I wanted to forget a woman I was in love with. Before that happened I was very different. I used to be an idealist with no notion of practicality, punctuality, pedantism, all of which is now an integral part of my character. I gave everything I had for this girl and after two years I knew it was hopeless. And the second I found out she was in love with a guy, despite the fact that I did not approve him and he did not deserve her in any way, I figured that her happiness was far more important to me then my own. So I set them up together while I turned my head the other way and tried to regain my composure. On a personal level, I messed that one up massively. I completely shut myself away from everything and everyone. The feeling of love was something very foreign to me for a good 9 years. Until a friend's girlfriend introduced me to her sister. Late last summer I went on a short summer holiday with the three of them, we went on New Years abroad in a gorgeous city and while I was deeply in love with her, the words ""you remember what happened last time"" resonated through my head in each of the languages I speak. So I did nothing about it - I was extremely polite the entire time but stood at a distance. My feelings did not go away when we came back and they stuck, even though we've seen each other once or twice after that. There's a lot of difference between us - she's still studying in university, whereas I am way past that point, she is insecure about some things about herself, while I take those exact things for granted in me. Last night I learned that she has started dating some guy. And I am not sure why or how but instead of feeling disappointed and miserable, I feel... Relieved. I have this ""well that's over at least"" type of feeling in me. Of course, it's far better to feel this way then feeling miserable and depressed. Does any of this make sense? Is that normal?",16Mar2017,2

I started to see the reality of his passing when my mom said that we should ask him certain questions before he passes. 

I've never been to a funeral before bc most of my family passed before I was born and many are overseas. 

I am an emotional person, but i never show it. Idk if it's a pride thing, but I can't cry in front of people. I also have difficulties being in emotionally sad situations, so going to a funeral scares me.

199,"I applied to a rescue squad that I really wanted to be a part of but a few days ago I got an email from them saying that I was not accepted. But they really didnt tell me why. Before you can apply you have to do one observation shift with them. 
I did 4 and I thought they and the interview I had with them went well. So I am pretty confused why they told me I was not accepted. 

This was their email to me: 
""The Board of Directors has decided to deny your request for membership at X Rescue Squad. If you would like to reapply for membership, you are welcome to do so in six months’ time. To potentially bolster your application for XRS in the future we would recommend additional observer shifts with attention to expectations of all agency personnel.""  
That last sentence leaves me with the impression that they thought I was off screwing around in the corner the whole time which I wasn't.

So this is the email I want to respond with:  
""Dear Ms. X,
I want to Thank you and the members of the XRS for taking the time to interview me and letting me observe XRS through ride alongs. I was impressed with XRS from what I witnessed and experienced in my observation shifts. I would like to become a better candidate in the future; But I admit I dont know what I did or did not do that would leave anyone with the impression that I did not meet the expectations of all agency personal.
Please tell me what I did or need to do so I can work on those issues in the future.
Sincerely,

206,"Hello,
I'm 23-years-old and I recently moved back in with my parents. I suffer from anxiety (panic attacks) and depression. I hold a ton of resentment towards my parents because I felt like they made me this way by sheltering me as a child. I wanted to share my story, and see if anyone can offer any advice.

As I child, I got straight A's and was very well-behaved. But my parents treated me as if I were perpetually grounded. I was not allowed to play (or go) outside unless my parents were outside until I was around 15. I was not allowed to ride my bike except for in the driveway. I couldn't watch PG-13 movies until adulthood. I came directly home from school every single day. I wasn't allowed to use the stove until I was 16, and never learned how to cook. When I got my learner's permit, my dad wouldn't teach me how to drive except around our little cul-de-sac, so I never drove around other cars, traffic signals, or on the highway. I had a boyfriend for all of high school, but I never saw the inside of his house. I only saw him in school, or a few times when he came to my house. They treated my rather serious relationship like it was not serious at all. My parents did everything for me, like my laundry, cleaning my room, etc because they figured it was just faster and easier if they did it themselves, rather than teaching me to do it.

When it came time to apply for college, I applied exclusively to colleges that were far away. I got a full scholarship to a great college on the other side of the country. My parents' first reaction was to to tell me to return it. Eventually, they let me go. Of course, I partied extremely hard. This has led to me struggle with substance abuse and alcoholism. I passed the first five semesters, but then I had to move off-campus and manage my food and money. Having never done this before, I began to fail my classes. I struggled for five more semesters, failing every single one, before moving back in with my parents. My parents never gave me any money when I was in college. They constantly told me that I shouldn't be going to that school, that I should move back home to allow them to take care of me. And here we are today. 

I just moved back about a week ago. They are still controlling my life in every way possible. They won't let me get a job or use the car, and insist that I'm ""sick"" and need to be in intensive outpatient therapy. I've held multiple jobs in college, and I've never been fired from one. They see me moving back home as proving them right, that I am a child and need to be treated like one. What's truly making me depressed is that my parents have never treated me like an adult, and have never taken me seriously. Am I wrong for resenting them so much? I think they are bad for my mental health, but I don't have anywhere else to go. 

What really hurts me the most is that they don't treat my younger sisters like this. They're allowed to have jobs and go to their boyfriends houses and watch whatever they want on TV and they know how to cook. I'm the only one struggling so much with anxiety and depression. My parents see this like there's just something wrong with me, but I know that they've be made me this way. 

I don't even know where to start talking to them. They're so patronizing and condescending. What should I do? How should I talk to them? Should I just move out again and continue to struggle on my own? ",16Mar2017,1

I started college in fall 2013 as a Biology major while receiving a scholarship for Football at a small school. At the beginning of my sophomore year, I decided to tack on a secondary education major along with Biology. Around that same time, I was diagnosed and medicated for ADHD (I had known for awhile but never did anything about it). Up until this semester, I thought everything was going somewhat smoothly. I didn't have a 4.0 GPA, but I felt like I was making progress. Then this semester happened. Organic chemistry II, Cellular Biology and Genetics, Analytical Chemistry, and Physics II. All 4 classes have labs. Coincidentally, the first two classes are regarded as the most rigorous classes at my institution. It feels as if I could study for 12 hours a day and make zero progress on anything, which I have done on several occasions. Between Football workouts and these classes, I have broken down emotionally on several occasions, and at this point I have no idea what to do. I have spoken with the head of the science department, also the ochem professor, and he suggested that I drop football and focus on graduating, but I feel that if I drop it, I won't have any outlet for this stress.

So, ever since I was a child (6 years old) I've lived in Canada. I went to school here, learned english, etc with my siblings while my parents had a working visa. However, since high school I became very lazy and unmotivated to study. I just played video games every day, learning very little. Eventually I made too much trouble and my parents sent me to Korea (I was never a Canadian citizen, I was only there with a student visa). I went to high school there and graduated.

The problem is, I was never fluent in Korean enough to understand any of the classes that well. I never did any homework, I learned basically zero things while I was there, even worse than how I did in Canada, and for some reason, they still let you pass high school like that in Korea.

Now I'm 20 years old and my parents don't have as much money as they did before, they don't want to send me to college in Canada again. They don't have a problem with me visiting Canada once a year though, for a couple months at a time.

Obviously I regret so much of how lazy I've been, I really wish I could've studied harder and worked hard enough to become a Canadian citizen, eventually going to college here and living here permanently..

My question is, is there anything I can still do to go to college in Canada or the US?

I'm not going to bore you with the things I like about her though. When I've had previous crushes, I never considered acting on my feelings, but I am this time. Clob is really cool and there are two reasons (more than two, but again, I'm not going to bore you with a shitload of useless information) that make me think that she (at least) likes me more than average. 

One is that she invited me to hang out. It wasn't one on one but still, it was just me, her, and another very good friend of mine. (Alas, the weather had to cockblocked me and there was a blizzard the day of the plans... but that's not important). She hangs out with a few people outside of school but it's really only those people. She is the type of person to decline an invite from someone she hates, and not invite someone that she just met over to her house. So the fact that she invited me over was quite a shock. 

The other reason I think she may like me is because of a snapchat she sent me. I haven't noticed much flirting going on besides playful teasing and a bit of nudging but that's also just part of her personality. Let me provide you with some context...

Context: there's a girl that who isn't that good at playing piano, which is totally fine, but she's very arrogant about it, and she's generally just mean. All around she's a not nice person. (Note: I have been playing piano for 11+ years)

So basically, I sent her a snapchat of me slamming my face into my piano. The caption read ""hey, it's me, [insert name of mean person here]"" 
Her reply was just a black picture with text saying ""Identical. Except you're way more attractive"". 

Anyways, this all leads me to my final point. I'm thinking of being more casually flirty so she notices that I like her. I don't know if this is a good idea. Should I just go for it? 

Thanks for all the help :^)

240,"Little backstory before I dive into the advice itself. First off, I am a guy in my mid 20s. I have learned a lot from these experiences, and just need to cover them at the very least to get them off my chest. 

I grew up in a very sheltered home. It was part of what I now view as a cult, with a very structured lifestyle forced upon the members, myself included. This led to a poor life choices after I moved away from my parents. The major piece of which was a very abusive and controlling scenario with a room mate. 

I had known him for several years, throughout highschool, before considering moving out and had received advice against doing so, of which I ignored at the time. Unbeknownst to me at the time, my social life, and work life were being undermined so that I could remain under his control. About two years ago the results of that undermining took effect, I lost my job, my apartment, and communication with anyone that could be considered a friend at the time. I traveled with the guy for a few months by car until his mental problems hit a crux and I had to take him in to a psyche ward. 

After he left there was a noticeable improvement in my ability to do activities, meet people, and form healthy relationships. The major side effect has been a lack of trust in relationships that I form with people. I find it alarmingly easy to form temporary bonds with people and use that to control their actions. I can normally read out what a person will do in a general sense, and predict with accuracy about two weeks out. It is easy to slip in comments and actions that can alter that to whatever I want them to do. 

Starting a few months ago I have been trying to rebuild connections with people that I lost before I had the freedom I do now. Because of my choices to move out and leave my hometown, familial reactions have been, well, unfavorable. Although I am a part of a large extended family I am mostly an outcast, welcome only during holidays, and that is only because its a general invite. 

Of all the people I have met, only one answered the call for re connection. This was in part because this friend was in a particular bind, and I did my best to support them through it. I keep finding myself playing mind games with them. Its an almost automatic reaction to whatever scenario is happening. I know that the games are not appreciated, and I have been working on cutting back on the games that I play. 

Over the past couple of weeks there has been one major change. I have led most of my life in relative isolation, and sexual relations have been minor to non-existent during that time. Any attempts at fixing that while back in my hometown were thwarted quickly. I recently have had a change for the better in that regards, but its left a voice in the back of my head. This new relationship has a near zero chance of becoming a long term one past friendship. 

Although battling my own demons isn't new to me, I know I have anxiety, and PTSD from a serious car crash a few years ago. I rarely if ever drive, and do not feel comfortable in that position of control if anyone is in the vehicle, despite driving enough to know that I am safe about it. This voice is new though. I have never had people around me long enough to be concerned that the actions that I do will force them away. 

Up until the car accident I was being taken to a psychologist. The general consensus that that I was on some spectrum, most likely a variation of sociopathy. It isn't a born with it style of sociopathy, but a learned one. Emotions were negligible to non-existent, so living in relative isolation wasn't mentally taxing. This was altered after the car accident I got into. I do not know the extent of the brain trauma that I received, only that I was unconscious for a week and that I needed extensive surgery to replace, and fuse bone sections in my neck and spine. After the accident, my emotional spectrum seems to be here, although it plays a minor role in decision making. 

For the first time in my life, I feel in general content and happy. This doesn't stop me from regularly feeling like nothing I do will matter and everything will just vanish. It is hard to isolate individual actions that play a major part in the mind games I play, and I am genuinely afraid that it will crash and burn around me.

Final note as throw away accounts allow more freedom in expression. I enjoy taking psychedelics, namely mushrooms. These are taken rarely, and only if I am comfortable enough in my mental state to allow distractions. Advice will not change my stance on taking these, as the research I have found points towards a solution for the mental issues I have been working through. Although infrequent in use they play a major part of my life as a whole host of mental issues level out for the following few weeks after taking a dose. 

TL;DR: Grew up in a cult, sheltered, moved into an abusive household after leaving home, and ended up leaving my hometown. Found out how to build a life, but am worried that playing games with the minds of people I would consider friends will drive them away. Its almost a defensive mechanism at this point, and I would like that aspect of myself silenced. I do not wish to control people, and feel like I am. 

How would I go about noticing these, and what would be the best way to make the changes to stop? I can provide more details as needed. ",16Mar2017,1
242,"Hey guys, 

Around about three weeks ago I shifted cities to attend college, leaving behind my family, friends, and girlfriend (have decided to try a long-distance relationship). 

I'm staying in a Hall of Residence, and my floor consists of 30 members, three of whom are studying the same thing as me. It's a pretty tight-knit community already, and I enjoy hanging out with the people on my floor, but I never feel like I have anything to say, and so end up trying to make awkward small talk or be completely mute. 

One example of this was last night when we went out to get dessert as a group, everyone split up into smaller groups and talked throughout the half-hour walk to the dessert restaurant. I, however, joined a group of three people who were happily talking away, and didn't say a thing for a solid twenty minutes. I didn't mean to be mute, but I felt like I could never contribute to the conversation. 

Another example was this morning on my way to a lecture with two other guys, both chatting and cracking jokes while I failed to make a sound. If anything, I felt like I was making the situation pretty damn awkward. 

I could go on and on with examples of this from the last three weeks, but barely any from beforehand. Back in my hometown, I had a very tight knit group of mates, and was never at a loss for words when speaking to them. This is still evident whenever I call my girlfriend, or friends from back home - suddenly my voice box springs to life and I'm conversing like a politician trying to win votes, yet the moment I hang up the phone, I am once again mute. 

It's not just the people on my floor either, it's pretty much everyone here. I can't find words, and so I result to small talk... ""this mac and cheese is pretty decent for the cooking here"", ""how are your lectures going?"", ""what are you up to this weekend?"", etc.



I have no idea what to do, and frankly, that's leading to a lot of stress now weighing down on me. I desperately want to get along with these people, but how can I do that if my conversation is dead before it begins?",16Mar2017,2
249,"For one of our experiments, we were tasked by a client to take certain images. These include top, left, and right views (priority) and other cool features. We get 4 hours of lab time per week (2 blocks/week) and when we created the schedule, we started in Feb 16 and it is ""supposed"" to end on the 23rd. 

Originally, we were going to swap operators so that everyone gets experience using the machine we use. Right now, there have only been the same 2 people using it. Right now, we have only managed to take one side view of one sample, one top view of the other, and the rest are supposed to be finished next week.

My issue is, we have been VERY inefficient with out lab times. The first week we did run into an issue where we weren't sure how to take the images due to the size of the sample, but myself and another person figured it out (this is why we have one sample with top views). Their side views are iffy. One is good, the other is not. Yet I cannot bring this up as they will take it as a personal attack against them, and then claim I am controlling and want them out of the project.

One excuse they used is that the total hours worked by each person is skewed (they have less than half of the hours I have worked) and they want to bring it closer to be ""fair"".

The other excuse, which they used today, was that they didn't get experience on the other two experiments (one of them was a main operator on the first one, the other one REFUSED to be an operator on that experiment). Our second experiment was performed by 1 person and didn't even take that long.

I do not know how to approach the situation where we are crunched for time and I'd like other people to operate, who are more efficient and know how to take the images that we need. Our ""group leader"" doesn't want to deal with it, even though he shares similar concerns. I am thinking of going to our instructor with my concerns, because this is something I am worried about. Especially because we have another experiment planned after this with only 6 blocks left to use for lab work (2 of which are for the one we are crunching). 

How can I tell my group members that the issue I don't have is personal, it's how to make sure the GROUP finishes stuff on time and under budget?",16Mar2017,1
250,"I finished school 1 year ago and are still living at home, mainly because I've figured out what to study and worked for the time being here for being able to finance myself. 

September I'm moving out to study journalism and until about 2 weeks ago I've had it all planned out to move together with one of my best friends. Then she kind of canceled it and ever since tries to reinsure me that I'll be just fine by myself, that I don't have to worry and should hold onto it. 

Here is the thing, and why I need advice, I am just not sure if I can do it. With her in the picture I imagined everything so easy, all the things we could do, how she is never gonna regret it because I'll be a great roommate, the activities we could do, how we could spend nights, have a party here and there, etc. 

I thought life is going to be great and wonderful because she is and I adore her as a friend and how she lifts me up to being the very best version of myself. 

So now there are two options: 
1) trying to convince her to move with me 

I don't know if I can actually do it and this scares me because I've made horrible experience with my former abusive gf, for whom I always tried my hardest and always ended up with nothing. That's why I am afraid of trying to convince her because I could, again, end up failing / or being rejected and then my self confidence would take a major hit and I'd fall back into my patterns of doubting myself. 

So I don't know if that's a good idea 

2) telling her that if she is not sure I'm probably better off alone. 

This would mean I would definitely move out alone and there are other problems to that. I don't know if I would be happy all by myself. I don't know if I am ready to fully grow up yet and take the responsibilities for everything in my life (I'm 20 now). Meaning that I would have a flat all to myself, having to cook, clean, work, pay, study and keep myself happy and in a healthy condition. 

I am just not sure if I would be able to discipline myself enough to reach all the goals, learning hard for university, keeping everything clean, cooking good things for myself, washing my clothes regularly, etc. All the things a single healthy adult does, but can I do it? So far I am making my own money and doing mostly whatever I want else. 

I do dishes and some cleaning at home regularly but that's about it and I don't know if I could take the major step into being on my feet by myself. 

So there are 2 endings I can imagine of which I don't know which is more likely: 

1) everything works out fine and I take great care of everything and am growing up / growing with the new challenge.. (add I find friends there against the loneliness) 

2) I lose myself because it's too much and fall into depression. I stop taking care of my space and all the stuff around me. Like cleaning up, studying, etc. (presumably I don't find good friends there, this is likely, because loneliness gets me pretty fast and depresses me.) 

TL;DR: need advice if I should fight for my roommate to come with me or try going alone. 

Further: need advice if living alone is somewhat bearable or if it's really hard to achieve happiness and control everything as an adult. ",16Mar2017,2
251,"I know this may sound like I'm asking for medical advice but I'm not asking for anything physical.  

Here's my story in short.  I went through basic training and AIT for the national guard and I loved how I felt when I got out.  I was skinnier than I've ever been (I'm 6'2 and used to be 260 but when I got out I was at 190).  Even when I was in, waking up before 8-10 hours of sleep left my eyes burning and my stomach cramped up.  I was always farting and feeling like I was about to crap my pants because my stomach was in so much pain for some reason.  However the military didn't give me time to moan and bitch and I pushed through.

Fast forward a few years later after I got out and I would run 5 days a week around 8 in the morning.  But then my truck broke down.  I don't make much and have horrible credit so my father co-signed for a 2k loan from the bank and I bought a bitchin' Salsa Vaya for 1100.  So I was biking 10 miles to work and 10 miles back, and I reached an all time low of 178 pounds.  Felt fantastic.

Then circumstances changed.  For some reason, I didn't even break a sweat biking to and from work and after a while, I just started gaining massive amounts of pudge in my belly and am at 215 now.  It's depressing me beyond belief.  

So I told myself alright, that's it.  I'm changing.  I'm going to eat chicken rice, vegetables, juice vegies in the morning with dry whole wheat toast and a hard boiled egg or two.  Gonna drink nothing but water, coffee, and tea, daily dose of vitamins as well.  I'm going to rise at 7 am sharp, military routine of making my bed, brushing teeth, shaving, and stretching, then cardio for an hour with a little bit of weights and stretching.  Yoga and meditation on my days off.  

Going to save all extra money that won't go towards bills and car payments, insurance, etc... and build my life back up from my rock bottom I hit after the army.  

So here's where I'm asking for any advice.  I just keep bailing out.  Some times I'll write out on a sheet of paper or in a journal all the things I'm going to accomplish in the morning.  I even ask my mother to call me at 7 am and talk me into making coffee.  That worked twice, but simultaneously failed as I fell back asleep while stretching.  I feel defeated that I failed to rise and work out and the rest of the day I spend promising myself I'll do it tomorrow.  

I have other things I'm trying to give up, vaping, pornography, netflix, online poker (I don't spend money I play free games), this site.  

I guess my question is, what can I do to get rid of this paralyzing fear I have every morning.  This strange fear washes over me that if I wake up and start my routine, I'll either fail, or get sick.  I feel like maybe even if I do succeed, it won't change and I'll remain fat and out of shape.  I feel like I always see a problem (excuse) to what I want to do and I have to solve it before I begin changing my ways.  I can't tell if it's something psychological or traumatic that's keeping me from making changes or if I just don't want it enough.  I really feel like I do want it.  It's all I think about all day.  

My best guess is maybe I just want the end results and not the work.  I don't know how to convince my mind and body that it's the work that I need to learn to desire and love.  I know this sounds odd but I greatly admire the first few minutes of 'Cape Fear' when the shot pans over Robert Deniro's cell and he has all these political and inspirational figures on his wall, down to his stack of books he's been studying and reading, and to him, perfect form, working out.  I want to be that.  Stack of books I'm educating myself with, weight set in my room.  I sleep, eat properly, and study and work out.  

For those who live a life like this, what kind of self talk or thought process do you have?  How do you overcome your obstacles?  What do you think I should do/try?  

Thanks for your time. ",16Mar2017,1
