0,"I just turned 23 last Saturday. Still a virgin and never had a girlfriend. I just can't seem to attract anyone. I talk to a ton of girls Facebook trying to set something up. But they just never really reach out to me. No girl asks when I'm available or anything. College was a nightmare. Tons of beautiful women and I couldn't talk to a single one. Nobody approaches me or anything. Whenever I go on dates, they just never reach out to me again. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I keep fit and good hygiene. I dress in designer clothing. I don't know what to do, getting desperate. 

Online dating hasn't been really great. Haven't been on a date in months. Okcupid is garbage, no attractive women in my area. Not even kidding and not even being picky. Tinder sucks cause I get no matches. ",02Jul2017,1
1,"Hello reddit, last week I took my car in for an appraisal.  I was happy with the offer, and while driving home with my wife discussing our options, we were rear ended. Nothing major, small cut on the plastic part of the rear bumper. Insurance info exchanged claim filed, etc. The other drivers’ insurance company contacted me with an estimate, approximately $800. We made an appointment for a body shop to get the bumper fixed. 

Cut to today, the dealership contacted us asking if we were still interested in selling. We told them about the accident, they said it didn’t matter, so we took the car in and sold it for the previously discussed offer. Great. 

We are still going to get an $800 check from the insurance company for the repair. What are we supposed to do with that? Do we contact the other driver’s insurance company and tell them we sold the car? Are we able to keep the money?

My justification on keeping the money is this-if we decided to not get the car fixed, we could have kept the insurance money anyway right? Or we could have kept the insurance check and attempted to fix the car ourselves. But I want to make sure keeping the insurance check isn’t sketchy/illegal since we no longer own the car. 

Thanks reddit. ",02Jul2017,1
3,"I started workinga boring ass job payed minimum wage for the summer, and while I don't particularly mind it, I'm finding working this job 35+ hours a week extremely daunting. It's basically a job in retail, and I can literally count the differeny tasks we have on one hand. In other words it's extremely boring and mind numbing, yet I'm on me feet all day moving around so I finish my days exhausted as fuckkkk... I finished my second week, and while it's extremely satisfying to get money in the bank, I'm dreading my upcoming weeks of 35+ hours... The only thing is I feel like a wimp for wanting to ask for less hours... People have worked way harder jobs for way less money, and I can't even deal with a summer of this?

5,"Hello, I'm a dropout high school student and I need tips to what to do, bucs right now I'm just lost. 

I have grew up in a ""strange"" family, there have been a lot of suesides on my moms side of the family and my dad side is just weird. 

My dad is a period alcoholic and are a really mean person when he drinks. He does regret it afterwards and he hate himself for drinking but can't stop bcus it Helps his depression. 

My mom doesn't pretend she hears or sees anything, so when my dad is angry she doesn't say anything. 

My sister have been a really big part of my depression, she have always called me ugly and fat and always looked down on me, always blaming me for anything bad that happens. Literally used me as a punching bag.

Every class I have been in have ended with me being all alone, the first class I was in bullied me and I was often in fights. 
My second class started to ignore me after my sister ruined my reputation, for them I didn't exist so my teachers sent me to another class and then my friend started to lie about me and her being criminal and stuff so my hole new class was scared of me. Finally I dropped out bcus I couldn't handle it anymore and because I had dropped out I couldn't live where I was living and where forced to move home. 

Throw all this I have always smiled but I'm literally dying on the inside. I have a deep depression and I have had it for about 8 years now. I have tried to get help but nothing works, I have taken medication but it doesn't work. My family knows about my situation but doesn't care, they think I'm hopeless.

So now I'm basically afraid to get to know new people, I'm crying myself to sleep every night, I have no place to go, I don't have anyone I can talk to, and I don't have any money to move away, I can't get a job because no one will hire me bcus of my depression.   

Anyone with tips?

Hi all,

I'm using a throwaway because family and friends have stumbled across my main account in the past and this isn't something I want them to know about. I'm currently three months pregnant and things are going great.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time, since about 11 years old, but never engaged in self-harm. Last night I had the realization that the only two times I've ever tried to physically hurt myself were in the early weeks of pregnancy, before it was even possible to know I was pregnant.  Both times happened after a night of drinking and an argument with my husband (not blaming him at all, just adding context).

The first baby miscarried at 7 weeks. I had another pregnancy a year after that where I didn't experience that deep level of depression, although she was born early at 25 weeks and she's a healthy, happy three year old now.

With the first and current pregnancy I never had the urge to cut again after the initial go, but I also don't drink much so I wonder if that exacerbated the hormonal changes?

I don't know. I'm rambling at this point. The realization bothered me and I'm seeking advice from anybody that might know about this sort of thing. I have definitely not had the urge to do it again, and in each of my pregnancies my depression leveled out and I feel more in control and calm than I do when not pregnant.

Thanks for reading. ",02Jul2017,2

10,"My girlfriend was aggressively raped by her flatmate on the first week of university, September 2016. Her friends called the police and they collected some evidence, but she chose not to take it forward due to the fact she was alone and afraid.



We recently found out via her rape counsellor that the police hold the evidence for a year before disposal. I was over the moon, we were provided with an opportunity to get closure and justice. She then changed her mind about going through with the process, reason being that she is ""almost through recovery"" despite having frequent night terrors, flashbacks and hallucinations. We have until September until we can take it forward with the police but she refuses to.



My reasons for her to go forward with it:

Closure

Justice

He'll be off the streets, preventing him from doing it again

Safety in the knowledge that he's unable to harm her again

11,"TLDR: I was standing next to my creepy neighbor when he told some teenage girls wearing bikinis that they have ""Nice cheeks"". I'm worried that they might think I'm a creeper too. What do I do?



So I've got a neighbor who's probably in his late 50s or early 60s. I'm just going to call him Ed. But he's extremely creepy around women. Ed is a functioning alcoholic and his behavior gets worse when he drinks. This is a well known fact to the neighborhood. If it matters, I'm a college student in his late 20s.

Recently, Ed left town for about 6 weeks and allowed my room-mates and I to use his driveway to park our cars. He came back into town yesterday and asked that I move the cars from his driveway. After moving the cars, I stayed to have a casual chat with him while standing on the sidewalk. 

There are two high-school aged girls who live a few houses down the street. They were also outside with a bunch of their friends standing in their driveway. The girls were all wearing bikinis and shorts, so I'm assuming they had been swimming or were going to the beach. Ed was looking at them and said, ""Jeez, what are they doing?"" As I turned around to see what he was talking about he shouts ""NICE CHEEKS!!!"" The girls were all clearly  uncomfortable and were very purposefully ignoring what he said. They didn't react, but they soon got in a car and left.

I stood there feeling embarrassed to even be seen with him. I was trying to explain to him how terrible of an idea it was to yell sexually charged comments at teenagers. He just brushed off anything I said as if everyone knew he was just joking. 

Besides for the complete humiliation, I'm afraid that the neighbors might think I'm a creep because I was standing right there when this happened. I'm new to the area and they don't know me. 

How can I reconcile the situation? I was thinking of just walking over to their home and giving them a quick apology and telling my side of the story. I don't want the neighbors to start avoiding me like they do with Ed.

20,"So im something of a social loser, dont have many friends, have a hard time making new ones.

Also think im a little ugly but this isnt the sub for that.

Anyways

I somehow managed to land this job as a camp consular for the summer. There's no real time to do anything other than work during the whole day, and I get home pretty late

In my division, we have multiple consulars, and I got to meet this specific one (let's call her Stacy) on the first day. I didnt think too much of it, as we were both occupied, but I made a mental note that she seemed easy to work with.

Flash Forward 2 days later to a staff meeting later in the day, with our division head/other consulars. 

Something to note is that we are all very close in age (17-24) division head is early 20's.

Anyways, so we're sitting there talking about the kids, Stacy mentions:

""He (kid) seems to like cartoons so I talked to him for a bit about Avatar.""

*DING*

Avatar happens to be my favorite show, period. So that caught my attention.

Next day we took the kids on a field trip. They were all chilling so I got to sit with Stacy (she asked if she could sit with me)

Feeling mildly confident, I mention Avatar and we start a really nice conversation: Comic-Con, Stan Lee, and the likes all came up. 

Felt really great about it, it was natural and she seemed to enjoy it.

Feel like she warmed up to me a bit too. Every now and again after that she would come up to me when the kids were occupied and just sorta talk about stuff that might frustrate her. Granted she does the same for the other consulars but we only have one other guy consular and they hardly ever talk. It also feels like it's me specifically, so it's pretty comforting.

we're now off until Monday (we work weekdays) and im mulling it over. So far things are looking really good.

We have a group chat so I do have her #, but I dont think I should send anything, it's too soon.

Any suggestions on where to go from here? We dont get to talk much during work but idk, I can make something happen.

It's been on my mind for a while. She's super pretty and chill and we're working together for the rest of the summer.

I work from home on my computer most days, in a room upstairs above my porch.

About a week later, yesterday,  this same man came to my door at night time around 8pm, and knocked on it while he was on his cell phone.   I answered the door, and he looked really surprised when I was looking at him, and he started to say ""hey, is uhmmm...."" then he looked up and to the left, directly  at my window while taking a long pause in his speech and then finished the sentence by asking if ""____"" was home.  He said a name that sounds like my 2 letter name backwards so this was really strange to me.   I replied ""youve got the wrong place"" very sternly and he just rested his beanie down on the gate and stood there looking really confused and then I closed the door and he left.    I have never seen this man before he started investigating my porch.   

The only thing I can think of is that was a thief trying to phish and see what times I am home or not, but it was strange to me that he did not knock on my door the first 2 times he was at my porch if this was the case, and also the time he came to knock on my door was at 8pm at night time so this just doesn't add up, and I cant stop thinking about it.

I met a guy at a music festival a few months ago and was chatting him up. I gave him my contact info before I'd had a chance to look at his left hand (I'm visually impaired and it was dark). Once I saw the ring though, I figured ""eh, we'll just be friendly"". We chatted through the show and I ended up getting a lift home with a different person (longtime friend). The married guy sent me an FB friend request right away which I thought was strange. I accepted because I've made friends with lots of people of both sexes at festivals and events without incident and I told the guy to keep in touch before I knew he was married.

Over the next weeks, he asked me if I was going to this LARP or that film screening and I kept telling him I wasn't. I kept the conversation casual and kept asking him about his wife and he  spoke nicely of her but still said things to me like ""I adore you ;) "". He's from a rural area (VT) and having lived there as a child I know people there are a little more friendly and a little more liberal with the casual touching.

Fast forward to last weekend and he was in town for a karaoke contest (he said in the days leading up to it he wanted to hang out with me). I kept trying to say I'm busy during the day on weekends but I eventually agreed to meet up and hang out a bit during the day because he had driven a while to get here (NH). So while we were walking around, he didn't say or do anything inappropriate--even told me cute stories about him and his wife. I ended up relaxing and thinking all was fine and my friends who had seen the messages were misreading him.

We met up with a few of my friends that night for the contest at a large bar. They observed and told me later his mannerisms toward me made them think he was up to something despite what he says about his wife. Trying to put an arm around my arm in the crowd, ""cozying up"" to me, leading me through the crowd by the hand while I was just trying to hold on to his shirt (as I would with anyone). Be all that as it may, he walked me back to my apt and left without incident. After the contest, I posted about it on FB and tagged everyone saying I'd had a great time.

What's bothering me is not knowing his motives. Not knowing if he's just really friendly but awkward (he doesn't have many friends who still go out doing things where he lives) or whether he's actually hitting on me. I told him the other day that I wanted to make sure his wife knew about me and was fine with everything. I also said that I always make sure to keep respectful of guy friends' significant others and he said something along the lines of ""of course"". Something else is that he added friends of mine from the contest on FB, and is RSVPing to events I'm RSPVing to. I've hidden a few sections of my profile. If he just wants to be friends, I'd be okay with him wanting to hang out a bit with full transparency toward his wife--though not nearly as often as he seems to want to since I want to meet guys who are...you know...actually single. 

What do you all think? And what should I do? I am uncomfortable with the level of involvement he's having with my FB and with him trying to spend so much time with me one-on-one and get into my life. But I don't want to yell at him or block him if he's actually innocent. What do you think his motives are, and how do I go about this without hurting any feelings?

EDIT: To clarify, I've always been able to maintain friendships with married or attached men with appropriate boundaries. So when I got into this situation I thought it would be like any other. I'm something of a ""guys' girl"" because of my hobbies. ",02Jul2017,3
49,"So I play soccer for a big D1 school, and my life's goal is to go pro and play in Europe. I have the work ethic and experience from playing overseas when I was younger and throughout my teenage career, I don't take my time lightly, and I recognize you have to be a little crazy and driven to get there, which fortunately and unfortunately I am. My problem is a couple buddies on the team who play in pro development leagues with me in the summer also say they want to go pro, and talk with me about it all the time, and yet come summer, spring, fall, whatever, they aren't putting in any work. Summer offseason is where you kill yourself going really hard 6-8 hours a day with adequate recovery and nutrition. It's the perfect time to hone your individual skills and fitness to get to the level you want to be at, and you have to do it every day getting better each session. It really irks me that they always talk about going pro, and yet come training time it's me out there for hours putting in incredibly hard work and getting better for it, and they are taking a nap after a part time job or watching netflix with their friends. Then they come out one or two days a week and just want to shoot or juggle and not actually focus on their weaknesses to improve upon them. Once again, I realize it takes a crazy person (in one way or another) to put in the hours and care enough to get to the level, but more and more they'll tell me they'll come out and practice with me and I'll set my schedule accordingly, and they just no show or come for 30 minutes and go home. I'd be totally fine if they didn't always tell me they want to play pro and massage their egos all the time doing so, and were just there for the fun of it when they can get out, but that's not the case.

On top of all this, the ones who have a little more skill than others (small group of 4-5 people) cant see past their pride to develop the habits of a pro. learn from professional players, etc. One of my friends who is the most talented (and vocal about going pro) of the bunch but also the most prideful and lazy tried to tell me he didn't need to be on his toes during warmup because that was his time to relax before practice, and doesn't come out for technical work because he thinks he's above it( spoiler, I'm way more technically sound than him and get way more minutes (90 vs 0) in the pro dev. leagues and it's not because I was born with some innate incredible ability). What the utter fuck. Warmup is where you get your whole body prepared and tuned in to playing, and the habit to doing so is partly being on your toes. It's fucking taught to 3 year olds in Europe that being mentally sharp always is the trademark tool of a pro(or really anyone fucking successful) I try not to be too douchey or demanding of them because I'm really losing faith but the continued flippance with my time as an extension of their own and the ego-massaging comments about making it as a professional when they are not serious is driving me crazy. I really mean it when I say I'm trying to get there, and they don't yet parrot it at me when I'm busting my ass all day and managing almost every minute of my time to be it. Again, crazy is as crazy does, but I know that's what gets you there, I've seen it and trained with it before my own eyes. 

I kinda decided to treat them as an afterthought for now and solely focus on my summer strength and conditioning (as well as ball work regimen) and if they want to be out there they can, but I'm having a hard time fighting my personality which wants me to drive the people I care about to greater heights. I also really don't want to be a self-righteous uppity friend that is condescending to them, but I need them to see that it's really fucking with me. The problem is if I tell them I know them well enough to know it'll just hurt their pride and elicit and angry response not a response to change. What do i Do? Sorry for the long rant, r/vent is leaking.

52,"I was depressed for a number of years so I basically had a disclaimer to everyone if you want something text if you need something call. So I pretty much never make calls or receive them just for chit chat.

I've been on antideppressants for some months now and my life has improved greatly. I think I'd like to start calling people again but do people even do that anymore? Has text completely replaced regular communication or would my friends be thrilled to see me finally join the rest of the world in calling people?

54,"I have a roommate who is significantly older than most people at my apartment complex, I live in what is essentially student living except they allowed him to live here (and apparently this apartment isn't sponsored by my University, so I guess this apartment is anything 18+).
I'll try to keep this brief even though it probably won't be. My roommate has professed to me multiple times that he is an alcoholic, and sometimes in the evenings he sounds very violent and angry. I don't ever leave my room because I don't feel safe. He yells extremely loud and curses, and slams doors and punches the furniture and walls. This happens every so often and I just can't handle it anymore. I don't know what to do. I lose so much sleep over this when this happens and I'm just done. I don't feel safe and I can't face him because I'm afraid he'll slit my throat or something.

62,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I have a relatively small social circle that only recently began to include boys, and even before then, I didn't usually go over to friends' houses. 

I recently started making a video game for a school club project thing with several classmates in my grade. We were working at one of our members' houses. There was another girl on the team before, but now she dropped out, and now my mom won't let me go to any of the guys' houses. 

My mom thinks that being in a non-public space with three boys will be dangerous for me. I have never felt anything from any of them that makes me think anything would happen. I live in an extremely safe neighborhood and don't have much of a social circle, so I'm not the best judge, but to the best of my judgement, I think I'm safe.

64,"So my cousin is getting married the first week of August and I won't be going. I wasnt planning on not going until last week, knew about the wedding for a year. My family is from abroad and my dad will be going back to our native country and he invited me along two weeks ago. It's the first time I'm going in 20 years so I was excited but it's really far so tickets are kind of expensive. I just graduated from my masters and am working on my job search so it's unlikely that I'll have an extended period of time to go again anytime soon. My dad and I are traveling through mid August about 10 days past the wedding. He just retired from work and wants to take a decent vacation (which he definitely earned). I didn't feel comfortable going without him (aka 2 weeks ahead alone) because of language barriers outside of our region and lack of familiarity with my relatives, geography, customs finances, etc. 

Now I could have gone for three and a half weeks but I was worried that was too short, although I don't know what to expect when I arrive. I feel like it would have meant a lot to my cousin if  a lot of us were there, and most people will. I thought it would be okay until I spoke to my mom today who said she spoke with my aunt and said that I'm going now because I am afraid to go alone (which is true) but my mom was saying how I was trying to make the trip work without cutting it too short, but couldn't leave to travel  earlier because my dad couldn't get approval to go until a few days before the trip (also true but I didnt tell my aunt this since I didn't think I needed do fully explain myself to every relative sounded automatically defensive). My mom was upset with me that I didn't say that part which made me think it's actually a big deal that I'm not going to be there so I feel pretty crap. I fly out in about ten hours and will have a 18 hour flight. I called my cousin and her family and spoke with them directly so there will be no surprises and they said they understand but I'm thinking that they may be annoyed without saying the way my aunt seemed. She seemed to think I didn't care much for the wedding which isn't true, I just won't get a chance to go back once I start working. 

I'm an adult, 26 years old, so I definitely accept the consequences to my actions but I feel like the right thing to have done now would have been to take a short trip and make it back for the wedding. Wanted to see what others would say or have done. Am I reading into it too much? Also want to apologize in advance for the writing, wanted to get it out at once.",02Jul2017,3
65,"I recently purchased a ""custom"" MacBook Pro from one of Apple's verified satellite stores (note an Apple Store but a tech store that sells Apple products that is directly connected to Apple and verified by them, etc). I put custom in quotations because they just didn't have the model I was looking to purchase in stock (even though it's one of the newest ones). The manager of the store guaranteed that the laptop would arrive at the store within 3-5 business days of it being ordered, maximum. This fact was emphasized multiple times, especially because I was concerned that I wouldn't get my laptop in time for an important work commitment. Anyways, it got to the point of 7 business days and I called the store to see why I hadn't received notification as to the laptop arriving. They told me they could track the laptop and casually said that the laptop wouldn't be arriving for another 2 weeks. I was absolutely speechless. Honestly, if I knew it would take this long I would've spent the extra couple hundred dollars on a model they had in stock (even though I'm tight on money). Without my laptop and access to software I can lose job opportunities and miss deadlines for other things. It's extremely frustrating. I want to complain but I don't know what complaining would do. I wouldn't get my laptop any faster. By the way, the company is Jump Plus. Any advice? I paid thousands of dollars upfront and was assured that it would arrive within a week and it's nearing 3 now.

66,"There's this girl (let's call her Sara) text me (also a girl - I'll be anon ofc) out of the blue asking if me and guy (Jack) still talked. I text her back saying I know she is acting as a proxy for Jack. Regardless, I think it's super invasive and not her business to ask that question. She sends a long paragraph length text back on Snapchat saying I'm being rude and she is only asking because she asked Jack if we still talked and he said nothing. She basically confirmed what I had told her and she gets mad. I leave the conversation at that. Next she sends another message via Snapchat saying she doesn't care about me, I'm rude, and how she is ""too grown to deal with pettyness"" I leave her message on read because I'm at work and don't care. She sends me another message, but via SMS of a screenshot between her and Jack and it is her saying Happy Eid. She sends another message telling me ""u act like the world owes you everything!"", ""u are soooo rude"", ""u dont even knoe me like that"" ""i don't care for u much at all, but i still think u are cool and want to hang out with u and say hi to u if i see u and I think u're a good person"" (She's basically gaslighting/ trying to get a raise of out me me and I'm not complying to this behavior.) I text back with ""ok"" (at this point I wanted to take a nap as I had left work). She then texts me back ""lol what does that even mean?""

Background info: Jack was into me. I am not into him for many reasons, mainly because he is from a Muslim-majority country (we are in the USA) and expects women to act a certain way and be subservient to men. Sara is from a Muslim majority country but was raised to be Christian and is suddenly a Muslim (I suspect that Sara is into Jack and Jack doesn't care for her at all.) Over the past year I had lost a ton of weight via weightlifting and Jack didn't like that at all. Jack had made many attempts to hint that he didn't approve of that at all. I ignored the remarks each time because who is he to me but what I thought was a friend. Finally one day, Jack tried to tell me that lifting is going to make me bulky like She-Hulk (this is the worst example ever) and therefore make his penis sad. I didn't think much about it until I noticed that he had also unfriended me on Facebook and I thought ""Oh, ok whatever. Don't care."" A few months after that, Jack texted me a week after I graduated college with a text saying congrats, but I just deleted it because of his actions, I don't feel like I owe him the time of my day, and I don't really need that in my life. A week after that, Sara texted me.

67,"I'm a 20 year old male living in Melbourne, Australia so firstly I'd like to mention most people I know and Australian's these days in general stay at home until around 22-25 years of age (when they finish their uni degree and have a job).

My family has always argued a lot, mainly between my mother and brother which eventually leads to my dad getting involved and losing his temper (in a verbal almost never physical way). This always took a toll on me when I was younger, I'd be the kid sitting in his room told to close his door and just listening to this non stop shouting and constant threats being made relating to my bro being thrown out. To note, he isn't into drugs or anything illegal at all - they more argue about menial things like swearing, respect etc. nothing 'dangerous'.

I know some people can just go to bed and the next day wake up and have 'gotten over' it, but that has never been me. They really do take a toll on my mental health and just general motivation in life to the point where I think living at home is holding me back. Unfortunately the family dog also died unexpectedly, and I always had him as an escape, they could argue or be moody and I could go chill outside with my best buddy scenario - which is no longer an option and the parents have shot down the idea of a new one.

So I'm 20, have a few thousand dollars to my name from selling the majority of my belongings and I have two jobs but neither would really be described as stable (tutoring kids english and the odd website development gig).

68,"Pretty much I have trouble putting my thoughts and emotions into words with regards to talking to people whether it be my friends or just strangers that I have yet to meet. 

Pretty much social anxiety but with this, I spoke to my psychologist last Monday and based off of all the other sessions we've had, she pretty much summarized that I am constantly in my head when I'm speaking to people as she believes I'm constantly being flooded with input that it affects my output. 

She has mentioned that she suspects that I might be on a spectrum but I don't entirely believe that as the only issue I ever have with this is with specifically holding a conversation and not reading and understanding visual cues or any other social thing. Outside of face to face talk I'm totally fine as I have time to piece my thoughts together.

She went on about how I'd need to dull that conscious part of my mind in order to be more free with how I speak like drinking alcohol to for that liquid courage as opposed to not saying anything because my mind holds me back. And one of those ways was to have a separate personality apart from my own so anything negative won't be tied to me but to that personality instead. Fake it till you make it.

i've made a few online friends here and there, and i'm pretty close with another friend, we watch movies online, play games together, and talk all the time.  
it's awkward because at school or work everyone is always older than me.  my coworkers are in the mid-late 20s and i can joke with them but it's just weird hanging out with them.  there's another 16 year old there but i think we'd just clash.  
the only place i could make friend would be at my school, where there are some 17/18 y/os.  when people find out i'm 16 they usually are like oh! that's cool, and then proceed to barely talk to me anymore.  i don't get why people don't like me.  i make a lot of jokes with people and they seem to like them.  
i don't even know what i can do to meet people. please help. 
i should also mention that's it's really hard for me to talk to other people when in groups.  i'm best and getting to know people one on one, otherwise i'm really shy and barely involved in a conversation. ",02Jul2017,1

97,"So I need some advice because I am at my wits end with my neighbor and unfortunately there are kids involved (both our daughters play together and I don't want it to affect them) 
He moved in about two years ago and our kids have been pretty inseparable since (his daughter comes every weekend) and we kept in regular contact with each other and were friends for the most part. Well about a year ago me being the dog person I am suggested he should get a dog because you know how dog lovers are.. we must inflict our love for dogs upon everyone. He agreed and said he would need my help because he works a lot, to which I flashed him that money sign that you make with your fingers and he laughed. That was our whole conversation on the matter (this is what ended up screwing me over, remember to communicate always and stick up for yourself!) So he found a puppy and his girlfriend decided to get one as well because decisions like getting a new dog apparently don't require much thought. Well stupid me for assuming he would come home from work on his breaks to let the dog out and I ended up going over 2-3 times a day (for free) to let his dog out, when his girlfriend came over she would also leave hers there while she went to work and just assumed cause I was taking the one out I would do it for her too, no thanks or anything. I was cleaning up shit and piss off the floor because the guy is never home to train the dog, when the two were there it was a nightmare getting them both outside to pee because they were never trained properly and I just felt like a big doormat. I took his dog for a walk once and he was terrified of cars because he never takes him out so I texted him ""you should take your dog for walks so he's not scared of everything"" to which he replied ""that's your job lol"" He should have said internship because when you have a job you get paid. Two weeks ago him and his gf went to Jamaica for a week.. he asked if I could go over there and let his dog out while he left him home all week alone so I told him no because I don't have that kind of time (my dog also wouldn't let me keep him here because he's been attacked a few times and won't let another dog go near him) Anyway he found someone to watch him for the week but my final straw was a couple days before he left he texted me ""Can you let Norman (his dogs name) out tonight? A couple more days and you'll be relieved of YOUR DUTIES for awhile"" I just said ""yeah"" because I was ready to snap. I've been doing this for a year now, I appreciate he says please and thank you for it but if it were the other way around I would be paying him or coming home on breaks to let him out myself. I was tired of feeling walked on and I have my own shit going on I don't have a lot of time to go over there, I feel awful for the dog because he doesn't get enough attention but I finally stuck up for myself and told him I have a busy summer with my daughter and won't be able to watch his dog anymore so I'm going to have to retire. He did not take this lightly, this weekend was the first weekend his kid hasn't come over to play with my daughter, he ended up taking his kid and another girl that lives in our complex to the fire works last night, leaving my daughter out when I know if I hadn't stuck up for myself they all would have gone together. I feel like he's coming after her to punish me and I don't know what to do, she was pretty upset about it yesterday.. you could tell he said something to his kid because the way she was treating my daughter was not the same. I don't know what to do? I don't want my daughter being punished for this and he lives too close to avoid him. It's taking everything inside of me not to go over there and punch him in the face.

99,"Hi,

throwaway for obvious reasons.

My mothers husband hit her in the face breaking her nose, he has hit her before around 5~7 years ago - I believe its happened at least 4 times over the last 20 years.

Police arrested him last night after the emergency services called the police (she didnt call the police) and hes still in the police station.

I don't live with her - but my brother does, either she or both of them told the police it was an accident... if they believe that or not I dont know.

I don't know if the crown prosecution services plan on prosecuting him - but I know she wont and also wont break up with him.

Obviously I'm concerned for the safety of both her and my brother - she said on the phone to me that it wasnt an accident (and I have call recording).

He was also arrested before so there is history... but he wasnt prosecuted before.

Should I inform the police that it wasnt an accident? How could I do that anonymously when my mum would obviously know it was me ?

105,"Hello Reddit.

It wasn't until recently that I am unable to purely focus on my textbooks for more than 7 minutes.
Currently I am a college student, but my inability to concentrate for extensive period of time
prevents me from thinking deeply, and thus hinders my ability to learn abstract and difficult concepts
from the textbook.
I was a straight A's student during Secondary School. But as a Freshman in College, I am already faced with 
a C+, a D+, and even an F in my 1st Semester.
Although I am feeling a bit down lately from my poor grades, I am not clinically depressed; it is not the negative emotions
that are preventing me from focusing.  
In fact, it may be that the depth of knowledge the College-level textbook provides is simply one I am not accustomed
to yet. 
But the truth is that I don't know exact reason as to why I am suddenly facing difficulties
focusing when learning new concepts, especially abstract ones. 
Of course, I don't expect people who read this to provide me with magical solutions; we, humans, are all
different from each other who follow different biological patterns as well as experience.
Strategies that work for certain people may not work with others. Or even what might be
ineffective for other people might be effective for still other people.
However, I do like to hear collection of suggestions from people who at some point have faced similar difficulties
but have overcome it. 
That way I feel like I could at least draw out a 'map' that may not give me instant results, but gives me 
a sense of direction as to where I should be heading towards to arrive at the 'destination'.
I do expect that I will have to put in the effort, and without effort these suggestions are meaningless. 
But at least with a sense of direction, I know my efforts will not go into waste.

113,"An old school friend has asked me to be a godfather to her unborn daughter (due September). To put things into context, I can count on one hand the number of times i've seen this girl since finishing secondary school 7 years ago, and we very rarely chat. We had been fairly good friends whilst at school however, and she considered me as one of her best friends.

She asked to meet me fairly out of the blue for a catch up, which I did, and then she informed me that she was pregnant (although it was pretty obvious!) and that she'd like me to be the godfather. Rather taken aback, and feeling like I couldn't say no, I accepted.

However, now i'm home and thinking about this, I can't see how I'd be of great use as a godfather to this child. I'm about to move away from the area and so can't see how i'd see the child very often, and having had a godparent move away when I was young and haven't seen them since, I wouldn't want the child to feel neglected. Add to the fact I don't see myself as close enough with the mother to want to see her on a regular basis over potential other social engagements, meaning it would be rare for me to make the trip to visit.

What do I do? Bite the buck and maintain my acceptance and see the child as I can, or should I go back and say that I don't think i'd be best for the role. Is it a thing to reject an offer of being a godparent?",02Jul2017,1
114,"""Can I ask you a question without you getting shitty?"" Is how I was welcomed by my mother after having not seen her in 3 days.

This lead up to a question makes me more #triggered than any sensitive or purposefully triggering question and the fact that I get so annoyed by it makes me respond probably in a shitty way.

I don't know how to explain why that makes me annoyed and I feel like I cannot respond to that question with a simple ""yes"" or else I seem 'shitty', so I become passive aggressive in future responses which is not good for anyone.

Another example is this;

""You are always so argumentative, you will argue with anyone about anything""

I sit there thinking 'well If I think something is worth disputing then I will do so'. But wait, this is a trap! If I say yes then I am indeed that asshole arguer, and if I say no, then I am indeed that asshole arguer!!!

119,"I used to have this close group of friends and I've known them for 6-9 years until something that I did broke up this entire friendship thing. 

It's somewhat a typical ""hoe before bros"" kind of thing. Because of this girl that I met and got together in 2015-2016, I've been neglecting these group of people for a long time, and choosing ""girl-friend time"" over ""friend time"". And as such, I think I might have unknowingly hurt some of them. 

I have been ""bestie"" with one particular friend, let's call him K. So for most of the time before I met that girl, we were hanging out most of the time (though there were minor-major conflicts between us) and so I believed that he was hurt the most as the time we hang out has dropped dramatically, from ""almost daily"" to ""almost never"". 

So at the start of the 2017, he decided to ""publicly ostracise"" me (by somehow hinting that he did not consider me as part of the clique on Instagram) and I took it as a sign of betrayal, especially since almost all of the other friends did nothing/tried to mediate things. Hence, I let anger take over me, and I left the whatsapp groups that we used to communicate, thus overall breaking most contact and we never talked again since January. 

And as a result of the ""break up of friendship"" with him, I cut all ties with the other members of the group. 

After almost 6 months since that incident, I think I might have calmed down a bit (though still feeling hurt and betrayed) and started thinking about what happened. I realised that it's actually reasonable for him to be hurt and angry, and thus resulting in his actions, because of his past experiences. 

As it turns out, he told me previously that he had similar experiences with other good friends whereby his ex-friends basically ""neglected"" and left him and this especially seen in the case of his classmates at school who all, to him, ostracised him. And as such, he had a bad experience with friends and even back then he was afraid I might do the same to him. Initially I brushed it as paranoia but now I understood how he must have felt in the past. 

What had happened was a result of years of minor ""cracks"" that eventually collapsed. 

(Alternatively I'm not sure if he had blamed himself as he was the one who actually encouraged me to woo the girl that started this whole shit)

-- 


I know this is entirely my fault but I am serious in trying to regain these lost friendships and make amends for what I've done. 

I tried to wish him a happy birthday a few weeks back as an attempt to catch up but it failed after a few lines. As such I am unsure if he is willing to want to even talk to me before I could even start making amends. 

I've also thought about contacting a neutral, mutual friend from the group as a middleperson. She was the one person who tried to mediate things at the start but as I was being controlled by my emotions I told her it's impossible. 

What should I do?

Or should I just give up?

• Me and the group of friends are all 22 years old and consist of a mix of male and female friends. 

• Out of the members, me and K are both serving National Service in the army, though different units and vocations, so weekdays are taken up by training and as such both of us would be busy with the military stuff.

133,"For background, I've known this man casually for years, and am friends with him on Facebook. Recently, perhaps not to my best judgment, I've opened up about some personal issues on there. He commented, telling me he'd like to get to know me and that he's always there as a friend. 

However, I've noticed that he's been liking a lot of...questionable posts by what seem to be Christian hate pages. Now, I should clarify two things: 1) I know that a lot of religious people are against the gay lifestyle for religious reasons, and I don't necessarily think that makes them a bad person or anything. There are still a lot of folks in this country who believe in traditional marriage and that gay sex can be damaging – I get it. However, these posts were much more on the bigoted side, calling them ""freaks"" and ""weirdos"", and also claiming that LGBT people are not born that way, which is clearly untrue. My friend often makes comments agreeing with other comments stating things like, ""God condemns these filthy people!"" I'm serious. It isn't just stuff like, ""We believe that marriage is between a man and a woman."" If my friend, we'll call him Jon, likes this page, what does it say about him? 2) I am NOT gay. However, I definitely have made some lifestyle choices that vary from the traditional Christian life script, and that they would probably consider a sin, or at least not what God would want for me.

Here's the thing. I'm tempted to reach out to Jon for help, as he's always seemed like a nice man to me, but after noticing some of his recent Facebook comments, I'm having second thoughts. I'm afraid that if I opened up to him more about the issues I'm facing, he would judge me. He's very religious, if you couldn't infer.

What should I do? Would you trust this man? I guess I'm just disappointed to see that a man who I once thought was  caring, compassionate, and couldn't hurt a fly would be so judgmental towards gay people.",02Jul2017,2

138,"If it makes any difference, I am a girl and this started around 2008. So when I was around 12 I found a flash games website with chat rooms with quite a few regular users. You had to be 13 to be on the site so I made an account pretending to be 14 with a different name, let's say my name was Lucy, and it kind of spiralled from there as I made new friends and chatted all day every day. 

I became part of a pretty big friend group on there and would stay up all night speaking to all these people and playing games, and it became so addictive I even started creating other accounts for Lucy's friends and family.. I used photos of people I went to school with and their friends too. I now know how awful and shitty that is to do that to people, and I knew to a certain extent back then too, I guess I just did it because I liked the attention? It was addictive I suppose? 

Anyway, I had an ""online boyfriend"" who I'd speak to over MSN, and I obviously know now I didn't love him but we definitely had feelings for each other. He was 16 when I (in real life) was 14 so it wasn't a huge difference. Nothing sexual ever happened, no need to worry about that

It all fizzled out around 2013 when I started coming out of my shell and being a more confident person with a social life. It's been so long but I still think about it almost every day, not in an obsessive way, but there's a tiny part of me that wishes I was still friends with all the people there. A couple times in the last 5 years it's really eaten me up inside and I'd spend a few hours using the wayback machine looking at my and my friend's profiles and trying to find them on facebook.

I managed to find my ""boyfriend"" and my best friend from the site on facebook, and I now have this feeling like I should say something and apologise? Apologise for lying to them for 5 years, and maybe I can get some closure?

Do you think it's a good idea to message them to apologise, or just explain? Will they even care? What should I say, if anything at all? I'd love to know how they are now and what they're up to.

I got addicted to video games like Minecraft and League Of Legends and from that formed depression. I didn't really care for grades anymore and so my math grades suffered. 

I dropped out of a high school 3 months ago, I live in Europe, but I got controll of my life again and live pretty healthy.

140,"This is more for snapchat than anything else. If I get a picture of me taken at a venue or something I'm ok with that and I look good but when it comes to snapchat I look like absolute shit and it makes it difficult when I talk to girls. 

This one girl I like says she hates it when people don't show their face in a snapchat and I don't normally show my full face I'll usually show half or no face at all. I don't want her to get annoyed with me because I don't show my face in our snapchats. 

Whenever I show my face in a snapchat I don't know what to do, I'm not going to pose because I'm not a 15 year old girl (I'm a 17 year old male). Every ""selfie"" I take looks horrible and my face for some reason looks totally different in the snapchat camera than either in real life or different pictures.

143,"I'm not even thinking of learning to sing or playing an instrument. But I'd really like to learn dancing. The problem is I absolutely don't feel the rhythm. I'm not really well coordinated too, but I'm certain I can overcome that. Rhythm is more of the problem, to give you an example of how bad it is, I barely can clap with a crowd simultaneously. Like if I'm looking at someone's hands and can see the exact moment they clap, I can totally repeat the rhythm (given that it's just a simple clap). But the moment I look away my clapping is out of timing with the crowd.

145,"I just turned 20 and I just finished my first year in college.
I have 3 exams to repeat in the upcoming months.
I recently got summer work after a long time looking.
The reason I managed to get it is because nobody wanted the job, they have had 6 people leave in the past 3 weeks.

I spend the majority of my time working, I have had no training, I have no set ours other than 'be in as early as you can' and my job consists of me loading shrink wrap bundles of cartons (2 litres, 2 by 3) onto pallets. 
So my back is killing me (you spend a lot of time lifting off of  a conveyor belt and you can't lift properly).

My friends never want to do anything other than go out to clubs that seem to be notorious for letting in underage people.
They also have no interest spending money on anything other than alcohol.

I haven't talked to my college friends since finishing up, they live a bit away and I don't feel very close with any of them.

The girl I was 'with' for the better part of a year has stopped, she wants nothing to do with me.

I'm basically just waiting to get back to college, pending whether or not I pass my exams, and besides the fact that I couldn't wait to be finished when I was in college. I don't enjoy my course.
This has been in most ways one of the worst years of my life, when in school I could not wait to be older, be in college and have control over my life.
The reality of the situation is there is nothing I enjoy in my life at the moment, I try to distract myself only to be annoyed, I just want to sleep all day because I can't get up and lounge around my house listening to my parents complain over something again.

The convenience just sells a few toys, movies, and condoms(no lottery or cigs). Some girls at our school work as clerks or waiters in the restaurant. Every time the girl rings up a 5 pack, she gives me a wink or says something like ""good luck!"", ""keep it hard til you finish"", ""on the house today"", ""damn you guys ran out again?"" the waiters do something along those lines as well. I get really embarrassed at times because I don't know what to say to theses same girls I will see on the streets every single day(while my gf gets a good laugh out of it).

156,"Ok, so let me try to make this simple.

I lived with my dad from age 8-19. Mom was mentally ill. Parents are divorced.

Dad remarried. They started getting hateful towards me, drinking/pills, etc. being sarcastic towards me, and then kicked me out at age 19.

They stopped with the drinking, but kept coming up with reasons to kick me out when I would come back from college on the holidays, eventually making it impossible to stay there anymore. Once was because I was a Christian (which made my Dad mad), once was because his wife just started saying mean things about my relationship with my mom (who's mentally ill), once was because I expressed frustration at not being hired by women when they'd be my interviewers/managers (which disagreed with their political views). They also had cancelled family holidays/get togethers on Christmas at the last minute a couple of times which seemed... off. Like... ""anti-family"". Just... completely dropping the ball. Last minute.

When I went off the first time, I did very well. I graduated from a top 20 school and went to medical school for a while. I didn't make it through medical school.

Since then, I have fallen through the cracks. I have had a *really* hard time keeping work. Either from bad luck, emotions, overqualification, lack of support, or a mixture of the above.

I have been living in my car for 15 months now, living in the same city as my folks. Dad would meet with me for lunch but we'd never really... hang out, do things, or anything like that. They still wouldn't let me stay there, even though I had been trying to build up a positive relationship with Dad. Which I've really been trying to do this whole time.

I am sensing he is an emotional abuser. Recently. But I want to ask you all: Is it normal parenting behavior to prevent your son from staying with you if he's older (I'm 29 now), even when he's having a *really* hard time finding work? Like I said... I've literally been living in my car for 15 months now, in the same *city* as the guy. Sleeping in parking lots and under bridges. I've applied for 38 jobs this week. Mostly full applications with cover letters.

He's given me lots of completely different reasons for why I can't stay, and made up some.

I just don't understand what's happening, or how to move on, really. It's hard. I sense that some part of him believes this is ""tough love"". I also sense some kind of sadistic vibe about him. He's just a little weirder than he used to be these days. Ever since he got married to the woman.

The main reason it's so hard is because he's also rhetorically very smart. I don't know how to win in a conversation with him. He just doesn't listen. It's like he's always attacking me, no matter what.",02Jul2017,2

All I'm saying is at one point in time they said homosexuality was a perversion. Now it's more socially acceptable and many people are speaking up for people to be allowed to love who they want. (""Love is love"") and not even just homosexuality but if a young man falls in love with an older woman it's empowering and beautiful and whatnot but when a young girl falls in love with an older man she is either a gold digger or has daddy issues. I'm genuinely confused by this hypocrisy and double standard. You can't boast broad statements like love is love when you're not willing to accept more variants and forms of it and outcast others at that.

We went to three marriage counseling sessions, the first was him talking to her while I listened. The next was him talking to me while she listened. The last one, was where I had learned that not only had my wife been planning on getting a divorce for quite some time now, but she was actually dating someone behind my back.

Before I learned this I was devastated that she was gonna leave. Now, honestly I don't care. I'm not sure if that's an appropriate response to this but quite frankly I'm glad she's gone.

The divorce went through without a hitch. I have custody of our kids and since the kids are both over 16 they can see her whenever they want if they choose to. The only real fight I had was over a car I bought her but, her new boyfriend actually paid me the price I paid for it so I guess I didn't lose anything beyond a car that would have just sat in the driveway.

I dunno, I feel like I'm finally ""free"" now. No work responsibilities, no wife nagging at me about everything and being useless doing house work, kids are legally mine so I don't have to worry about them being in the area she moved to which is a terrible part of town.

192,"Hey I've never felt the need to crowd-source advice, but for the first time, I have no idea what to do or say in a situation that has this much gravity.

My father's mother is dying. My grandmother is 95 years old and suffered a major stroke on Monday and has been in the ICU since then. Her condition has been erratic, but we think it is improving.
The most important thing to my dad is that his family is functional, despite the fact that we are far from that. I am seeing the disillusionment occur in front of him in a time of intense vulnerability. I think he's realized that he hadn't spent as much time as he wanted with his mother, and now he feels like he is losing the opportunity to try and make it up. On Saturday morning, my uncle and aunt decided to take my grandmother off of her breathing tube and take the chance that if she could breathe on her own, we would continue treatment, and if she could not, she would pass (they signed a DNR). My father disagreed, and I did as well. My grandma is continuing to breathe on her own, thankfully. But my father is broken by the disagreement with his brother and sister. He has other siblings overseas, but he doesn't feel they care much, so it is more disheartening that the family he has here in the States is divided.

In light of the realization he had about his mother, he is realizing that he never spent much time with me or my brother growing up (he's admitting it all to me and it's hard to know what to say back). We had just flown in from out of state (different states). And when we got home from the hospital last night, my brother and I got into a fist fight. He had been upset about something trivial (internet speed) and was taking it out on my mom, and I had no patience for it so I told him to 'Stop being shitty' and before I knew it we were fighting. (I think we've only ever physically fought twice ever). I think seeing my grandma on her potential deathbed, made it all the more important for me to be there for my own mother. I didn't want to have regrets like my dad was having, maybe I was being rash and petty. It was an emotional day.

For context, I am 25, my brother is 29 (so basically we are supposed to be grown-ass men, but we're acting like boys). There are a whole host of things I don't want to tell everyone about where we are in our lives. But when I left him up off his back, he grabbed a pair of scissors and said he was prepared to gut me. We exchanged more words, and he eventually said, ""I let him down when I wouldn't reciprocate the same brand of loyalty"" that he gives me. There's a lot of shit that is one-side in my brotherhood that I don't need to get into, but he just claims to be prepared to 'take the wrap' for me if I ever did anything that would land me in jail (I don't intend to be going anytime soon.) To which, I told him, I would not 'take the wrap' for him, he hasn't earned that from me.
I've apologized to my brother, and he's said sorry to me, but that he doesn't see me the same way anymore. I don't know that I can change that, or really care to for my sake. I don't think that my opinion of him has changed much. I've always accepted that he is a bit crazy and let it be. Forgive and forget. But for the sake of my dad, I want it to be better.

And when my dad had seen the whole thing unfold, he really broke, he realized that his nuclear family was broken as well. We went for a drive after, and he sounded really suicidal. He said ""I can't continue life like this. I hope I pass before my mother."" I've never seen him like this, it's hard to watch your dad unravel like this. My dad has been crying his heart out all week, and I thought I came to support him through this more than just see my grandmother for the potentially the last time, hopefully not. But I feel like I've only made it worse. I want to see my dad through all this, and I know there's no immediate fix, but what can I say or do?




**TL;DR: My grandma is dying, my aunt, uncle, and dad can agree on what to do. I came home to try and support him, but made it worse because of my relationship with my brother. My dad is realizing that life is short, regretting a lot of decisions, and that he is powerless in all consequences of all of them at this point.

Now, I do need to fix my stupid hair and in a way I'm grateful for the kid's uncensored honesty. But I was mocked a lot growing up, dealt with a lot of shit, and can't get the thought of that little fucker continuing to do that to other people. I would have never done anything, I resisted the urge to say something fucked up at him... but how do I get this out of my system? How do I let it go?

Oh yeah, I'm bipolar manic depressive, was severely suicidal but have good meds, and can't afford counselling. I overall loathe myself, feel like a 40 year old failure with a stupid haircut, and my night was just ruined by some wise cracking kid.

How should I get over this? :/",02Jul2017,2
195,"I'm looking to create a sub where anyone can come, and post the stories they've been writing. I know there are similar subs out there. But I've never seen one that allows you to submit any story you want, without any regulations. Well, outside of common decency. 
A lot of people like to write stories, and have no where to share them. So, this could be the place to do that. I'm looking for tips on what to do, and how I should go about this. 

Thanks a lot in advance!

*Edit* I've gotten the subreddit up and running. I still need to add a banner, and touch up a few things. But the barebones idea is in place. Forgive me if plugging my own Sub is against the rules. If so, I will remove it. 

But if anyone is interested. The sub is, /r/StoryCafe",02Jul2017,4
196,"So applied for a new job in December. In February I interviewed, and in April after all my testing and physicals and stuff were done they said I'd receive and email shortly with a start date. 

Well late June cones around and no word from the new job after multiple emails and calls. So I make a deal with my boss and he agrees to match the pay and transfer me to a different department if I stay because I was  fearing I didn't actually get the job. Well I got a call yesterday with a start date and I wanna leave but I already made this deal with my boss. I don't k is what I should do. This new job has way better pay and way more hours.

My current boss has not totally held up his end of the deal so I'm debating on leaving my job now to go to the new one even though we made a deal. Any advice?",02Jul2017,1
200,"I'm reposting this because I deleted the other thread as I was being bullied and the report function didn't seem to do any good, and neither did contacting a moderator.

So, the backstory is long, but basically, I went to a small, private, catholic college in the Northeast. I developed a really close relationship with someone who ended up being my mentor. A professor in my department. We were really similar and I had a rough home life. She was the first stable adult I ever knew. She always fought for me, and she spent a lot of time talking to me about conspiracy theories, thinking critically, fighting for the little guy and change in a sick society, etc. Something happened to me at school and I asked for some help and my professors and administrators ended up doing some super illegal and unethical stuff. The story is pretty unbelievable. So she gave me some information that I could've potentially used and kind of tried to help me out. The school responded by basically shutting down. I didn't hear from her for months and was super confused since I didn't do anything wrong. I found out that my dean threatened to fire her if she spoke to me again. Despite knowing this, it really broke my heart and I felt abandoned by her. I still feel this way. I know it's irrational (what was she supposed to do?), but she was such a huge influence in my life, that this really hurts. She ended up in some ways being the type of person she ended up cautioning me against becoming. It's been really hard. I've never met anyone that quite understood me like that and never anyone who protected me. How can I bury this feeling? I feel like it shouldn’t bother me given the circumstances, but I looked up to her so much and really saw her as a protector and the only consistent, stable influence I knew. It was also really confusing. She spent a lot of time when I was in her office telling me how much she did not like her job and that she was looking for other jobs because things had gotten so bad, etc. I tried to be sympathetic but it’s been hard. The events that caused this were in and of themselves traumatic. I'm tough, but I've been pretty broken ever since. I was once a bright student with a promising future, who now struggles to get out of bed. I don't have any other support system. I try to be strong, but it is really hard. I cannot describe how abandoned and hurt I feel. I don't know why, but I do. I think it was because she lied to save herself, and wasn't honest, and I didn't expect that from her.

201,"Hi, so through some means I've been upjumped to a supervisor position at my store. The only problem is I am having trouble getting the hang of the responsibilities that come with it. I am used to working as a stocker and do not know much about the Register/POS or how to merchandise. I've been a cashier before but that was it. I am not the best at disputing coupons and so forth. The biggest issue though is being a leader. It's hard for me to be a leader and expect people to respect me when they can do the job better than I can. Again, I was only upjumped to this position by my store manager after I asked for a raise, his response being ""well if you want a raise you're gonna work more"" which is fine! and I totally accept that! Again that's not the issue, the issue mainly being people are noticing that I am not the best at this and once they start complaining I might be demoted. I have a gf I want to propose too and this could be the stepping stone to a career but I do not know the best course of action. Any advice would be grateful, thank you.",02Jul2017,1
204,"And maybe I am. My family situation is complicated. I haven't spoken to my father in over ten years. I've maintained a relationship with my mom. It's just gotten hard. She HAS gotten somewhat better since I've grown up. Sometimes she'll say things to me that are just terrible. She'll never apologize on her own. If I ask her to apologize, it's usually ""I'm sorry I upset you."" as opposed to ""I'm sorry I did or said *thing*."" I finally snapped and told my mother and sister that I won't be in contact with them for a week because I need to think. My sister is lumped in because she tried to defend my mother's behavior and tell me how **I** hurt my *mother's* feelings. The rub is, they're the only family I have. My husband hates that I can't just swallow this and move on. (We have a vacation coming up. My mom was supposed to watch our dogs. Now it looks like I'll be staying home even though we already paid for plane tickets.) Here're the basics of what happened this time. My mother knows I want to adopt instead of having my own bio kids. She HATES this. She'll bring up grandkids, and I'll say ""Hubs and I aren't planning to ADOPT for a while."" Most recently, she responded with ""If you adopt, you'll just be nasty to them. You won't love them and *I'll* have to end up taking care of them."" I freaked and said some things I'm not proud of (for which I genuinely apologized). Even my husband recognizes that my mother says things like this semi-regularly that reduce me to tears. Am I crazy for potentially sacrificing a vacation for my sanity? Is this just normal family stuff that I'm blowing out of proportion? What should I do?",02Jul2017,1
