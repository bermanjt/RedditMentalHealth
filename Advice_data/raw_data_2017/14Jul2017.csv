His dad text him asking why he clocked in but wasn't at work, and they threatened not to write his paycheck until they all had a talk. All of his work was done, he worked his hours too. What legal actions can be done if his parents refuse him a paycheck? Can anything be done at all? He is 20 and we are trying to move, so we desperately need our money. Please help.",14Jul2017,1
2,"I'm male, late 40s. I'm about 60lbs overweight and totally out of shape. I eat junk food, like cake and cookies, all the time. I also probably drink more than I should. 

Many years ago, I successfully lost a lot of weight doing keto. But, one year I totally lost all my motivation and have since put on a bunch of weight. 

I hate exercising, but my least hated exercise is walking/running. 

I have tried a few times over the past few years, to eat better and exercise, but I can never make it stick for more than a couple of weeks. Something always knocks me off course and I never get back on course. 

I want to get back on course, but sometimes I think what's the point, I'll just stop again in a week or two. 

Anyone have any advice for staying motivated past the 1 or 2 week point?",14Jul2017,1

10,"So earlier today I got an email saying someone was trying to change the email account on one of the gaming services I use (don't want to say which one, but one of the big ones). I quickly used the link to change it back, and got customer service to help me recover and secure my account.

The interesting bit, however, is that the original notification also includes the email account the hacker was trying to change it to. My question is, should I send the would-be account thief an email telling them to basically go fuck themselves, or just let it go? I'm kind of pissed at them and want the satisfaction of being able to gloat about defeating their hacking attempts, but I also don't want to provoke them into trying to hack anything else (even if they are unsuccessful).",14Jul2017,3

Is this a good sign that my application and resume were very well-received, or maybe a sign that they're looking to hire quickly (which would be great, because the sooner I can get a job, the better)

Anyway I've done some manual labor-esque jobs in the past for family friends but nothing corporate/official, and I'm going in for my first retail job interview tomorrow. I know the basic protocol for dress and how to carry myself before/after the interview, but are there any common questions among retail positions (such as ""sell me this pen"") that I should have a heads-up about?

And any advice in general about interviewing, and what's expected from me and what retail employers look for aside from friendly sales technique and such?

Appreciate any and all advice here. Thanks!",14Jul2017,2

24,"There's been a lot of tension at home recently and not sure how I can relieve it. 

I come from a pretty average household where my parents hold pretty high standards for my brother and I, but nothing overly demanding. My mom holds a lot of power in our family and had both my brother and I start playing instruments from a young age. My mom is strict on us practicing our instruments and due to the her high expectations my brother often lies about how long he practices (he has to practice 2 hrs a day). This causes my mom to get into a fowl mood creating tension at home often. I know if my brother hadn't lied there wouldn't be this tension at home but on the other hand my mom is also very overbearing and rarely expresses any satisfaction even when he practices the full 2 hrs. I'm not sure what to do besides trying my best to ignore all of this.

32,"I went out with a friend last night and may have been drugged or just drunk idk. Here's a rough outline of the night:

We pregamed starting around 8 and left her apartment around 10:30. At this point I had three to four drinks. 

We got to the first bar, I did not want much of the wine we bought so had maybe a glass total out of the bottle. 

The second bar I drank a 32oz mixed drink and this was around 12 or 12:30. We were getting chatted up by two older men. I was definitely drunk but not  near blackout based on my usual drinking habits. 

She told me we left around 1:30 to walk back to her apartment. The man was visibly angry we were leaving and acted ""sketchy"" according to her. She stopped by her car and I went ahead up to her apartment but apparently never got there. My friends searched for me for an hour and then found me laying in the hallway staring blankly at the ceiling. I asked them ""who are you?"" And could explain nothing about my whereabouts. 

I do not remember finishing the last drink, the walk home, or being lost for an hour. About 2.5 hours total. I came to when they were putting me in the car and was coherent but extremely confused and angry. It felt like I was coming down from a trip. 

This morning I was not hungover (which I would have if I had drank past my limits). I have no bruises or scrapes. 

I truly don't think I could snap out of a blackout like that and I'm just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience. I'm grateful nothing bad happened to me but this situation was bizarre and my friends said they'd never seen me like that. 

Should I get my urine tested or is it too late for that? Or just pointless idk help",14Jul2017,9

35,"I have the symptoms of epididymitis, which is an infection of the epididymis near the testicles. All other possible/likely conditions have been ruled out, including cancer. 

I am going out of my mind trying to get a diagnosis. This has been going on for a month. I've been to the ER, been to my family doctor, and been to four clinics. 

No GP will prescribe me antibiotics because my urinalysis has come back negative, even though you can have epididymitis with a negative urinalysis or without a UTI. This is something I suspect a urologist would know, but the GPs don't. 

I live in Canada, so it will take me another three weeks minimum to see a urologist. I don't want to wait that long with an active infection that could lead to infertility. 

I have a sudden lump in my testicle (ruled out cancer with an ultrasound), stinging on the tip of my urethra, sore testicles, and all the other symptoms. This all comes after four days of poor hygiene last month when dealing with a family emergency, so it makes sense that I would get an infection. 

I resorted to trying to get the necessary antibiotics from fish/pet stores, but unfortunately, it seems like only the powder form (which cannot be taken by humans) are available for fish in Canada now, so I can't even get the antibiotics without a prescription. 

I'm running out of options. I don't know what I can do besides going to another clinic and yelling at the doctor to give me antibiotics. I feel like that's the only option left at this point, but it probably wouldn't work either. 

I think I'm going to try going to a new clinic tomorrow and demanding antibiotics, but I will most likely be turned down/kicked out. ",14Jul2017,2

40,"Hey , I am a 17 year old male going to junior year of high school and I could use some advice.

My whole life I've had the ""natural talent"" to draw. My mother and father are both artistically inclined, so naturally I received their gift. I use to love drawing so much and it was one of the only things I ever did until I got into gaming at a young age. I continued to draw and improve until around the end of middle school where I became depressed for various reasons. During this time I got sick of drawing; the activity became boring and I felt like I stopped improving. The more I tried to draw the more I got sick of the way I drew and how my drawings looked, almost like I hated my style. Ever since then I've considered drawing a side activity I'll sometimes do during class but it's always just simple doodles. 

Since then I've picked up programming as a hobby but I have a different issue with this. I'll run into tasks I can't solve and have no motivation to try to get it done with. I'll stop coding for months until I finally decide to get it done and then just rinse and repeat. I just feel like I lack motivation to push through these hobbies which I hope to go to college for. 

Ultimately I just feel like I lack the motivation to progress in these hobbies, and it saddens me why I randomly started hating to draw. It's at a point where I wonder why am I like the way I am, where I can't get anything done or progress. Also I want to say, I'll become ""motivated"" in the way of I feel the urge to do something amazing but I just sit and think on what I could do, but when coding or drawing comes up I'll just feel ill to the thought and leave it alone. Please give me advice on anything I've mentioned it would be much appreciated.

47,"Today I was cutting through a parking lot on the way to get lunch.  A guy walking toward the shopping center through the parking lot apparently thought I was speeding (I probably was but it was on the mostly abandoned side of the center) - he acted like a fool and tried to block me.  After a moment I went around the guy and as I did, he banged on my window as I passed and was yelling making monkey motions, etc.  I flipped him the bird and went on to the drive-through for a fast food restaurant on the other side of the parking lot.  

As I approach where you make the order, guess who I see walking toward me.  I'm looking for a path to drive off if he goes too far off the deep end...  He goes behind the car and takes a picture of my license plate and then walks to the driver-side window.  For the next 2-3 minutes he proceeds to try to get me out of the car so he can ""kick my ass.""  This whole time he's standing in between me and where you place your order.  I tell him he's on camera and everyone can hear what he says and to stop harassing and threatening me.  For 2-3 minutes that's all I say, ""Stop harassing me.  Go away.  Stop threatening me!""

49,"Hey everyone. I'm new to this community so forgive me if I don't know the parlance.
I'm an 18 year old guy. I had a weird adolescence. My dad walked out on us and I had to become the man of the house. I got a job, attended school, and acted as a father to my little brother while my mom worked. It was rough for a while and I didn't really have a traditional teenage life. Everything worked out really well though- I got a full ride and then some to my favorite school (William and Mary), which solidified my family's finances and ensured everything will be alright.

So here's my problem. I'm going to college not really knowing anything about myself. I don't know what I like to do; all my time has been spent doing things I have to do and eliminating wasteful activities. I dated a few people in high school but I don't know really how long-term relationships work. I can't make up my mind about what to do with my life and I'm afraid I'll squander my opportunity by being indecisive and ""finding myself"", whatever that means.

52,"So I had an old Reddit account for two years. Didn't do anything crazy on it, made a few comments that were downvoted (nothing really past -20, and that was SUPER rare), and eventually made a stupid joke that was downvoted a little over 100 times. It wasn't rascist or anything crazy, just a really shitty joke in the wrong sub. I then posted pics of myself, and a few days later, noticed I was downvoted hard from the previous comment so I deleted both the comment and the pictures of me from both Reddit and Imgur, then deleted my account. I worry that in those few days (maybe 2-4) someone (out of the over 100 people) that downvoted that comment or other comments I made looked through my post history and found the pictures of me (they were at the top) and made the pictures into a meme with the comments I made, like how in some memes you see today its a selfie with a dumb internet comment on it. I'm just worrying they found my easily accessible pictures through one of my comments and turned it into a meme.

I've decided to go to a music festival to see one of my all time favorite bands rather than go to the engagement dinner of one of my girlfriend's friends/my new friend.

To say the is one of my favorite bands is selling them short because they have sentimental value to me also because of how frequently my dad used to play them in the car when I was a kid (he's not dead, just kind of a scumbag and I don't have too many good memories about him). They released an album early last year followed by an announcement that this would most likely be their last time touring ever. I followed any news about them weekly regarding tour date announcements and it just so happened one day in my city worked out for me! My GF doesn't care for them but that didn't matter because she knew how much this meant to me. We both got tickets immediately.

Fast forward to last night and she gets a text from one of her best friend's boyfriend  (her friend too and has since become my friend) telling my GF that he's going to propose to her friend (also my friend recently). He wants us to come to this after party thing, once he's proposed, which happens to be the same day (Saturday) and time as my concert.

Of course my GF has to go, that's not where the dilemma lays. Initially I said of course we'd both go to this dinner instead but I've since changed my mind and am now going with a friend and hopefully I can meet up for some of the party after the concert.

This choice felt morally wrong. I'm the most unselfish person you'll ever meet and it's for that reason I both feel like I deserve to have this and like I've betrayed my own concept of self. I've committed to my choice. GF is disappointed/agitated and I totally get that, if roles were reversed it would bum me out that she didn't pick to go to my buddies party thing but at the same time how could I be too upset for something she had planned for so long?

They don't even mask it anymore, and they've taken to just telling me they don't believe in me to my face.

My cousin/best friend is dating a guy who I used to party with in high school. I knew he did coke and pills and wherever, but casually. She is super straight laced. They broke up a few times, not due to drug use, just relationship fights. Mind you, she has never even smoked weed and she made him quit.

A year or so ago, they had just gotten back together and I heard that he was doing some hardcore drugs. It made sense coming from who it was coming from because I knew they ran in drug circles. One of my high school friends. I mentioned it to her casually... Meaning she told me that he had been hanging out with so-and-so, and I said I heard so-and -so was into drugs. She fucking freaked out.

Fast forward and they are broken up again. They reconcile for reasons unknown to me. One of my good friends just broke up with his girlfriend for doing H and lying repeatedly about it. He told me that he knows ""for sure"" that her SO is ""strung out on dope.""

72,"In my post history there is a long post with more backstory. The abridged version is that I fell hard for a boy as a teenager, we became close friends but he died from a car accident when we were both 18. He was a catalyst for a lot of good things in my life before and after his death. I don't consider myself a very emotional person but I cry over it every few weeks, sometimes more. No one knows this, and I honestly don't like talking about it to family and friends. The only person I can talk to even a little bit about it is my husband, but admittedly I hold back 99% of the time. I know he would be incredibly supportive and I'm actually going to try to open up to him about this tomorrow, but I also feel guilty being so emotional over a guy who I once had romantic feelings for. I guess I wouldn't want to make him jealous of a dead guy if that makes sense - my husband is amazingly rational and not the jealous type but I feel like, how could it not hurt in a way to know that someone you love has so many emotions about someone else? I say this with the complete honesty that the anonymity of the internet allows - I am not mourning the loss of him romantically, but the loss of him. I hope that makes sense of my feelings about this. The fact that we had a romantic history makes me feel wrong about mourning this long. 

It's been so long since he died, so much longer than I even knew him. I've done everything i can to heal - staying healthy and busy, designing shirts for his memorial, giving and receiving support from his friends and family, going on medication, read and followed a million articles on dealing with grief... and nothing really helps. It took me around six months to really accept that he was gone forever and honestly I feel like the scar hasn't, maybe even can't, close any more than it already has. I realized recently that if I live to be eighty I will cry the same for him then. My only other option I can see would be to disconnect from it completely and I just can't. I'm already angry at myself for having no control over my emotions with this. 

Please, any advice or stories would be so appreciated. I have little access to physical resources so anything online is extra helpful. Even if it's just telling me the harsh reality that I will always miss him this much ... I am desperately trying to close this wound, even a little bit. ",14Jul2017,4
75,"So my parents just got me my first ""phone"" today. Has no service. It has all of their info on it (passcode, appstore credentials etc) and they just have complete control. I have to ask before I download anything, which they HATE social media, but social media is the reason I would want a phone to communicate with friends. They got it for me as a surprise but at this point I really dont want it. They spent a lot of money on something that I dont really need/cant really use. I could listen to music on it but some music I listen to has some strong language/subjects that they may not like. Im kind of screwed over. Any advice, or anything? Id appreciate it.",14Jul2017,1
77,"I'm in my late 20's and recently got an email informing me that I'm excluded from university for a year due to bad (awful) grades. I'm not surprised. I'm not sure how to get all my thoughts down, so I guess I'll just dot point it. :\

- I thought the course I was doing was something I really wanted to do, but apparently not enough to actually go to lectures or study or actually do anything productive.

- I might be dealing with social anxiety? I don't have any friends out here and basically the only people I talk to (very, very briefly) are the the lady who works the kitchen, and the cleaner for this floor of the dorm. I could just be pathetically complacent and lazy, really. 

- I like to think I enjoy drawing, making music, being creative overall, but it's not like I put any actual effort into anything I do. I can't remember the last *anything* I actually completed. I give up very, very easily.

- I've been drinking a lot every weekend. I don't want to. I regret it every time. I've been spending 60-70%ish of my money on alcohol. I am dealing with this one (getting someone to hold my money so I can't possibly by any alcohol), but I figured i'd put it in anyway.

- A lot of the left over money goes to energy drinks. Go figure.

- Nobody knows how poorly I'm doing in my life. I go with the usual ""things are fine"" for people who know me, and then head online to vent about how shit I am without doing anything to change myself.

Basically I'm a huge mess of a person. I don't know exactly where I went wrong in life. I don't know exactly what's wrong with me. And I don't know how to get help. I'm tired of being such a useless, massive disappointment.",14Jul2017,1

I know he has a somewhat bad relationship with my mom (she keeps losing jobs, heavyset, not too bright, argues with him constantly, not engaging with him sexually I'm pretty sure). But he's insistent on never divorcing her because of his beliefs or whatever. 

So lately he's been flashing his penis towards my boyfriend, implying that my boyfriend wants a secret sexual relationship with him because he's still hormonal and happens to get boners randomly. He even told my boyfriend that he knows he's interested in him and my boyfriend tried to tell him no and that he sees him as a father figure to try to get him to see how wrong it is and get him to stop by it hasn't. My boyfriend said my dad came downstairs one time (my boyfriend sleeps in a separate bed than me) and laid in bed with him and tried touching him down there. 

My boyfriend told me he's sick of it and said he's gonna move out the next time it happens. I really hate that it's come to that and I don't know what to do. My boyfriend said he'd never leave me but that he can't deal with this anymore. What do I do to get my dad to stop so my boyfriend doesn't have to move out/what do I do?

The first I found dead on my bed! and the other I found tonight running across my carpet while I was watching anime.

I keep my Apartment moderately clean tidy with the exception of my room ( I will get to that later) I take the trash out about every 1-3 days and rarely leave dishes in the sink over night (if I do it's mainly cups and plates with no food still on them) 

My room is always junky but Never the empty food container dirty dishes junky but the organized clutter never fold clothes type of clutter I will leave dirty clothes/towels on the floor for days (never more than a week) and have tons of cardboard boxes and empty boxes (I collect anime/video games and have alot of boxes from them) . I never had serious bug issue (beside a small wasp issue) and the area I renting have a guy that comes by everyone in a while to spray.

Well this guy threatens her often and bullys her and I even put his hands on her. The last time he grabbed her by the shirt and pressed against a wall calling her a bitch and doing that, I tried to stop him and he beat my ass. I told her to run so I did.

And now maybe a week later, today she was with her friend in the supermarket, I saw them pass by and greeted them so I left. And when I saw that guy later, I sort of followed him to see if he would mess with her. And again he starts theatning her and getting closely aggressive so I pushed him and he pulled out a knife, I sort of kicked his hand and it made him scream and drop it, then I punched him as hard as I could and he went down. After that, I kicked him repeatedly in the ribs telling him not to mess with her again and grabbed him by the shirt and started punching him repeatedly on the floor.
I watched as his face went from red, to black and blue, to bleeding and finally I stopped when he started crying and begged me to please stop. 

I looked at my friend and she was backed away with her mouth covered as if she was horrified... After that the police had me answer questions so we split up.

88,"I'm still conscious and sane, don't worry. But I've been beginning to question my sanity lately. The first month of school just finished and I haven't gotten the better.

I've been wondering what my future would go. In two years I'd have to move to the big city, from the fishing shores of my hometown, and continue with college there. I'll be staying at my grandparents' place where my father had already prepared a room for me to accommodate in. Two years. Two fucking years. It's like being diagnosed with cancer and having two weeks left to live.

I've grown up as the big brother. My two younger siblings always look up to me and love me by heart. I'm always there to end their rough housing; there to finish arguments; there to support them; and just basically accompanying their lives with my love. But in two years they're just going to disappear into the corner of my thoughts as I grow into maturity. Fuck, I don't want to grow a bigger penis or get attracted to girls this quick.

What's worse is I suffer from short term memory loss and, God forbid I say this, I am diagnosed with ADHD. Well I used to be, but only the hyperactivity aspect was pulled out (puberty did it), so that leaves with Attention Deficit Disorder. I personally think I have; my condition (the ADD one, short term is a definite yes) isn't official. But I remember this conversation I have overheard from my parents while I was a kid. Something about me being a ""special"" child, A.K.A an abnormal ADHD little shit. Skip to a few years, today. I tried recalling how I was before. My personality. And holy hell. I was stubborn; hyperactive; barely able to concentrate; always demanding; bla bla bla. God thank puberty and maturity had screwed me over and turned me into a ""gentleman"", as a girl once said. Haha, all of this coming from a guy who's depressed of having to leave his little siblings. I honestly see myself as a father for them, even if our real dad is actually much more supportive and cooler than I. Still.

As far as conditions go, I can't make decisions right,relying heavily on what my parents decide. ""Yes, you can hang with your friends, son"". ""Sure som, go play on your PC"". ""Nah, chicken tastes better, son"". I want to decide for myself. It's what I'll be doing after two fucking years, but no. I just am too dependent. It's affecting my studies even.

So yeah, I figured out I probably am diagnosed with ADD and just suck in general.

I am am an antisocial introvert. I don't know how to speak our native language - put me in a kindergarten and I wouldn't be able to answer our dialect's questions or even construct sentences. Thank God I know English. People treat me differently, like I'm some fucking alien. Worse is it's blatant, and everyone is involved.

I don't hang out with boys and when I do they go from ""stereotypical roughhousing mischiefs"" to ""yo dude, what's up?"" As an example, whenever they're conversing with one another they do it the ""manly"" way of our hometown - slapping hands, name calling, shoves, taunts, harasses. But when any or all of them talk to me they treat me like I'm a fucking daisy who'll cringe if they go balls with me. Like, they're too serene and ""positive vibes"" stuff. It's like they're afraid that whatever they do might upset or irritate me. I know why. My dad. His job is... Well I won't tell, but basically he's greatly respected by everyone and is the best at helping with community services. Great guy. Are they just afraid I might tell dad about them? Are they trying to get my respect? Wtf I am not a high class, I am trying to be average, ""normal"".

Girls on the other hand. They confuse me. I hang out with them as a desperate socialising last resort. Doesn't work, almost same results with the boys. Might as well try to adapt love relationships. Fucking doesn't work. Not because something is wrong with me, but because I'm actually to much of a girl myself. I was raised with cousins of the female gender. And it's just ugggh. I'm in between a boy and a girl, great. But I'm not gay, nor bi, great. I don't fall in love, I don't even know what a crush is, great. My mother expects me to fall in love and marry someone and continue our family heritage and blah blah. I don't want to disappoint her, and that's why I'm still trying to define love here and there.

I never bother to go outside and hang out and walk in the park or whatever. Although I have already convinced myself to do that for future's sake.

In terms of school life: I'm in grade 10 at the moment, situated in the highest curriculum (STE). As expected from us we go about with a buttload of homework and projects, so of course that's equals to tremendous stress and all. My family has a considerable amount of wealth (people often call me a ""rich kid""). I don't wear fancy clothes; casual is best. 

Although I seldom do, I never study. I rely too much on my stock knowledge, which ends up helping me substantially than I anticipated honestly. Homework is a pain, but I manage. Everyday at school I feel so down. I have to remind myself to smile and never twitch up a frown. I don't want to screw up others just because of my sadness or dismay bullshit.

I've been fed up with all these depressing angst that I've recently realised. I try to cope up. How? I should try writing stories, I say. That worked. I kept writing. Okay that's great, I managed alleviate myself that's good. Nope, it's still there uuuuuggghhhg. It's lingering in my head 24/7.

I don't want them there not because personal problems are a pain, but because I don't want others to be affected. I've read stories where a brother had gone psychopathic over the fact that his sister died, and he turned to murder everyone. Yes I know, it's an exaggeration. Even so, shit happens. What if I snap and end up hurting someone, worse yet, my family? What if I cry and go in a downfall of depression that my family and friends have to tend to me for their lives? Fucking stop, I want to see you guys happy. Don't mind me, you've already done enough; that to my family. I was afraid my sudden rise of angst would have screwed my face over so I've been trying to practice to hide bad expressions and keep up a smiling face (not too much or I'll probably look like Joker). Got the help from internet. 

It's not enough. Help me. I need to lock up all these bad sentiments and stay serene and happy for everyone.

109,"Hi all,
Please help with any advice you might have, to cop/remedy these problems, no matter how minute it might be.

(If you don't like to read a lot or want a summarized version, please skip to the TL;DR section at the end)

I don't really know where to begin, so please bare with me.

Me: At birth, I had numerous medical conditions that have left me with partial sightedness and stunted growth to the extent that I was the size of a 3 year old at the age of 9.
As a result, I've shied away from society as a whole because of all of the jokes, comments and torment I had to go through in my early youth. Fortunately, I received growth hormones from the age of !4, to encourage my body growth to a reasonable size, however, the distrust in society lingered.

Because of my impaired sight, the whole family had to pack up and move just so could attend a specialized school (a decision they regret, not openly, but I can see it in their eyes).
My dad had to take up working for my uncle, driving mining equipment all over the country just to support us. My mother, who was working in the army worked a 7 to 6 job.
So, with absent parents and no one to socialize with, I turned to all forms of media especially gaming as a coping mechanism.

I consider myself highly intelligent, I taught myself to read and speak English by age 6, but I can see within myself that I am socially and emotionally adolescent due to the factors mentioned above. As can be expected, I grew more and more absent from reality, quieter and isolated, avoiding people in general. Depression also dropped in 
from time to time to scramble my brain too.

I don't like going to religious institutions (for being called spiritually blind one too many times), but don't consider myself atheist.

I am 21 now and I still feel the need to be alone, but this usually gets accompanied by loneliness.
I work as an IT technician, from 7AM to 5PM, as can be expected, I still live with my parents, as I only earn R5 500 after all deductions (Tax, medical, etc).

My parents:

My father is a kind loving man for the most part, but can be beyond unreasonable, dominating and belittling if he doesn't get his way. Has no respect for privacy.

My mother: the stereotypical helicopter parent, always watching over my shoulder, obsessive over my sister, reckless. Has no respect for privacy.

My stepsister (24: the beloved black sheep of the family, has a 2 year old son (with a bum, who doesn't pay child support, because he lives off other people) whom she cannot take care of and relies on my parents to care for him and by extension, me. She lives with a 42 Year old man (chef who is a compulsive gambler, divorced and has 4 kids with his ex). she also on occasion lives off of my parents.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
TLDR: I am emotionally F***ed and living with people I cannot stand, but I don't earn enough to live on my own. I work a long shift and am addicted to gaming for the escapism it delivers. I often get nightmares, so I avoid going to bed, but when I wake up, I struggle getting out of bed due to fatigue. Because of my sight, I cannot drive and I cannot afford a car, I cannot get to or afford a mental health practitioner.

114,"I have a bachelor in business marketing and currently doing a 2-year master in business research. Thing is, it was not what I wanted to take from the beginning. After high school I wanted to study information technology, computer science, programming and those of the same sorts, because I love computers and are quite good at working with them. Dad's a businessman and he thought it was cooler to do business and tried his best to convince me about a bright future in that field. Well he succeeded.

I never thought about it much in the last 6 years. After college I worked for 18 months before currently taking my master's degree. But not until just recently I got an internship in data engineering at an app development company. I was very lucky to get this job, I can code in statistics programming language, and I study business. For this job they're looking for someone who can help write up programs and provide insights for business decision making. They were willing to take me in despite knowing I would require lots of training cuz I knew nothing about computer systems, I just knew how to code.

And this is my very first exposure to working as a programmer, I first had to learn a few new programming languages, which was an ease. The colleagues here help train me as well. With that knowledge I've been building up a program that does sophisticated customer targeting, and it's been just over a month. I learned how computer works, how to design a complete working system, how to make subsystems communicate with each other, how to run a local server to test my system and everything. Everyday going to work I know I will learn lots of new things about computers and I am sooo eager in the way that I never felt before on any day going to college.

I know how hard and how impractical it is to start all over at this age (24) and pursue what I should have had 6 years ago. But the more I am at this job, the more surreal the prospect is becoming and overwhelming my mind. Maybe if I continue on with this job for a few years, I could get a scholarship somewhere to start new? I would be 30 by the time I finish college (again), that might be quite bad?

She then says that she has a pos test for pregnancy which she took yesterday morning.  I called her to ask why she would wait all day to tell me and she got pissed and hung up on me.. She said in a shortly following text she would take more this morning. Now she is saying that she said Tuesday. She won't go to a doctor and get an official test because she has no insurance. I said I would pay for it. She rejects this offer. And I told her I wanted to pay for another stick test. She said she will let me know Tuesday.

125,"Hello. 

I have recently rented a cheap room in an ex-hostel (not exactly the Ritz, but I'm 22, I'm on my way). Now every time I come home, I walk up the creaky stairs, it's all good, I'm about to reach my own floor of four abandoned rooms where I am building my nest. Anyway, there's a window I come to face righr before I turn to continue up the stairs to reach home sweet paradise. 

Now the thing is, a wire square mesh protects the window from the outside, about two inches away from it. The window opens for air, but not enough for me to get my hand through it (by all accounts I have smaller-than-average hands). 

And the charming past residents of my haunted 'mansion' have filled the space between the mesh and my window with cigarette packs, sweets and cigarette butts. 

I see this every day. And it's just beyond my reach to clean it out. 

Advice for me please, Reddit?!

129,"I'm trying to start a youtube channel amongst other things, but I need to make decisions like name, color scheme, logo...

I want to make reviews on things like anime, kpop, and fanfiction. (I'm starting a blog to do all of these in text, but I'm only doing fanfiction on the blog, while I'll do the other two on both my channel and my blog). I also want to make EDM, remixes, AMVs, and another thing that I made up called Moodtracks.

BUT my current username-- Otakubeats-- sounds like I only make music. I want to change it to  FandomHaven. Which is better?

Also, how do I choose a color? What are the best colors for an anime/kpop brand? 

And most importantly-- should I even combine kpop and anime and EDM and AMVs/Moodtracks? If so, which ones should be under which channels?

He's even offered to teach me Warhammer 40k, a game I've been wanting to learn for awhile now. However, he wanted to take my daughter, she's 14, to the mall and got upset when I said no. (He says he wants to show her something in one of the stores) My wife is instead going with them. Also last weekend he was hanging out in her room (door open) playing VGs and watching a movie.

137,"Despite my title I'm not expressing imminent suicidal ideation. But I  need some guidance or tips or perspective.  My husband is out of work, and without my job we'd lose our home and our healthcare.  However, I work about fifteen hours a day, in a very stressful environment where I am regularly berated. A couple of weeks ago I was summoned to the office without warning at 2:45am to perform a task that wasn't even time-sensitive, I thikn as a sadistic power play by my boss.  I am expected to answer emails 24/7 and sometimes, even though I am sleep deprived, I have trouble falling asleep because my phone is next to me and I dread it will go off.  One employee and one recent ex-employee of the firm committed suicide this year, which is telling because this isn't a very large firm. 

I've sent my resume to headhunters but gotten no bites.  I got a cold a few months ago that still hasn't gone away and I think there is also something wrong with me gastrointestinally.  I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and in rare moments when I have quiet time to myself I sometimes find that I  just stare at the wall or cry.  

I already see a psychiatrist who has prescribed me antidepressants and amphetamines, both of which have helped majorly but aren't always enough.  Also, if I pull off an important project I am now working on, my boss says he will promote me and give me a large salary increase that would enable me to retire after a couple more years.  I'm unsure whether to trust him.  But right now it feels like I have no other options. Note, I have considered complaining to regulators about our working conditions, but my boss is very litigious (on par with scientology) and I am  concerned about retaliation.  Also, I'm a professional, not a wage-earner, so I'm not covered by many wages/hours regs.  

If I can hang on for a few more months I think I will be in a better place.  Maybe my husband will get a job, maybe I'll get my promotion.  I would appreciate any tips or counseling to help me do that.

139,"So, I'm the youngest of three brothers and particularly following recent events, I feel like my parents (especially my mum) are trying to dictate my life choices. Over the years I've been the victim of their essentially emotional blackmail, making me feel guilty and/or selfish for doing or not doing things I want or don't want to do and preventing me from doing some things. I've been told on multiple occasions that I shouldn't bother pursuing interests or I should give up on things and they basically frown on my interests that they don't think worthwhile. About two years ago I came out as bi and as fairly liberal but traditional Christians it's never really sat well with them and yesterday I brought up to my mum that I'm distance dating a guy I met at university and it did not go down well. I don't understand. I can't seem to do anything right in their eyes. I try to do right but why should I have to live to make them happy? Additionally, suffer from anxiety issues. When I tried to bring them up and the episodes of depression I'd been through, I was made to feel guilty because my mum took it as me blaming them for not raising me well. If I have any sort of argument with my mum, she will cry, pretty much without fail so it's like I'm not allowed to express my own opinions. Meanwhile she keeps telling me I need to be more self-confident and assertive, but I can't help feeling it's no wonder I have anxiety and self-esteem issues when I've been told to give up on my ambitions pretty much my whole life.

142,"Summer has ended and School starts very soon, I want to focus on myself more because life will get much more complicated since I'm a SchoolYear away from Senior High School. 

For the past School Years my Grades have been very good, well at least in my standards. I am not a very smart person that you will see in a Top 10 list, but I'm just an average student with Grades that are not too low and not too high. I am satisfied with my Grades and will continue to do better. However, that's not my main concern, the thing I lack the most, is RESPONSIBILITY. It's the only thing I can't seem to do and be consistent on as a 16 year old teenager. Ofcourse I am not irresponsible 100% of the time, there are times I am responsible, but I tend to lose it overtime, like I've said I'm inconsistent at it.

Here are things that I do that isn't right:

-I cram, A LOT, as for most of the teenagers out there. I am also very easy to distract, once I lose track it's hard to get back. I sometimes also treat things as if it was nothing, like homeworks, projects, etc. My mind is focused on things that are unnecessary, when I have to do something more important.


If you still need more explanations for you to understand me more, I'll give you some scenarios:

-There's a homework due tomorrow, I decide to just do it tomorrow morning in school instead of doing it tonight. 

-There are required things to bring for a project next week, I don't take note of it for I think I'll remember it but eventually I won't.

-I'm studying a powerpoint for a quiz tomorrow. A message pops up from my Social Media and my focus shifts through my Social Medias and not to the powerpoint which I should be focusing on.

-Finals starts tomorrow but I'm more worried about a video game I've been playing rather than the finals itself.

Now there are very few games that make me actually happy, and I feel like all the time I spent on video games was more of a waste than I previously thought.

I feel as if I should cut my losses and sell off all my equipment, but there's a small portion of me that still loves playing games, what should I do?

A while ago my ex gf moved back to my city, our break up was as tame as possible and a long time ago, we had remained friends up until she moved across the country. When she let me know she was coming back for a bit I was happy to get together with her. we started talking and I knew I was in trouble, she had the most amazing story's and had done the most amazing things, things I've wanted to do my entire life.  We talked for hours barely stopping for breath, it got dark out and I took her home with a smile on my face that felt permanent. The next couple days were more of the same I'd wake up, pick her up and chat for hours doing whatever we felt like. Friday rolled around and I ended up on a spontaneous camping trip with her and many of her friends, in some ways I wish I hadn't gone because I likely wouldn't be in the spot I am. She let me know that she had a bf who she hadn't seen in months but was moving to another country to be with, they both agreed that it would be fine to be with other people as long as it was only physical and at the time I was cool with that, only physical it was not however. I can easily say it was the best four days I've had since I can remember, we click on a level that I never thought possible. She's a crazy solid person, and had no regrets  but felt that she was pushing the limits of their agreement and knew he was going to be upset, she told me we weren't going to see each other again on the drive home and it was like a stab wound . I didn't say two words the rest of the trip just got her home and tried to sleep. When I woke up it was even worse, every part of me ached to call her, but instead I drove around aimlessly ripping darts like they were going out of style. Everything sucked I couldn't sit still but I didn't want to be around people, I couldn't watch tv or read so I just drove. I eventually ended up at my favourite forest and just sat there. Then she text me saying she was feeling the same way and that she still wanted to hang out and talk to me but couldn't do any more physical stuff, I was so incredible down for that, it was immediate relief I just fell asleep exhausted  sitting in my car. The next week was incredible, we traveled to random far away places going on hikes drinking and getting foods I never would have eaten if not for her, she pulls me out of my comfort zone and pushes me to do new things and I love it. The physical stuff definitely did not stop and I was not the least bit upset about it. So fast forward to yesterday, after an afternoon of crazy food and amazing conversation I dropped her off at the place she's staying feeling really confused about how I felt, this girl, this amazing girl is changing me, before she came I was consigned to just stay in the city I was born, work my boring job and live a what now seems and incredibly lame life , she's literally opened my eyes to a world I didn't no existed. She pushes me to do the things I want and to try new things. I'd literally follower her to the ends of the earth... so I told her.. I told her I'd go with her anywhere if she wanted me.

My dilemma is I have received an offer to join the team that I've dreamed of joining since I started here. It is 25k (50k vs 75k)more than I make now, two extra hours of PTO per pay period, salaried, 5-8k yearly bonuses, 10k raises each year with good performance. Currently I get no bonuses at all, and usually get a 20 cent raise (hourly) each year. The catch is that I would be travelling weekly in this new position. Anywhere from 1-5 days per week. Some weeks no travel at all, but for the most part every week. When I am not travelling, I am working completely from home. The thing is, I have a 7 year old son. His father has never been much help.

180,"What approaches would you take when a business owner making up story on social media that is harmful to your business' reputation?

In my situation, my mom owns a deli shop in a small shopping centre. Next to us is an Italian restaurant. They were closed for 2 months by local council because of violating certain rules. They reopened in early this June.

Initially, they starts at 3pm and close at 10pm/11pm. My mom's shop is a deli that has been running for more than 10 years, and the opening hour is 8am to 7pm. The restaurant is new, just more 1 year old. 

Needless to say, we are not on good terms with the restaurant. A lot of conflicts between two shops occurred in the past and we thought things would change after the quiet period when the restaurant was forced to close. 

But guess not, the restaurant just started spreading the news that they have to open at 3pm because they are forced to by the agency on their facebook page. The announcement mentions that there is a trading restriction placed on them because of the deli (us), which is not true. 

My mom probably hasn't seen their post because she doesn't use facebook and has no time for social media. The restaurant has made multiple bad claims about us in the past but they never mention us directly like this time. Well, and unfortunately, his followers on facebook blindly agree to everything he told them, which is sad. 

My side of thinking: I know the restaurant owner is not a good person so everything is possible. He opens the shop at 3pm for a period of time so he can make this claim which seems to be his scheme because in the past, his shop opened from 8am, then changed to 12pm.

186,"Hello /r/Advice. I'm in a bad situation right now and I'm stuck on what to do.

I'm a British 14 year old and I've fucked up really bad. 

So, my lifelong friend who I've known since birth started being a dick to me. He has been expelled from 3 high schools over the past 2 years. This caused him to join the only school available in my local area (which is basically a school for expelled kids). He then proceeds to start smoking weed and tobacco with a ""hard"" kid from his new school and we didn't speak for multiple months until June when he joins my discord server. He then says how ""he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore and won't meet up with me anymore due to his new friends.

I then banned him from the server and I was really pissed off at him and didn't talk for another month. The time is now July (this month) and I decided to speak to him at the start of the month. He told me how much better his friend was and how we shouldn't be friends anymore. At this point, I was furious at him and wanted to do something which will fuck him up and show how his new 'hard' friend isn't a real friend and is just using him for money.

This is when I mess things up.

13th of July 2017 I had his password to his social media accounts and after some persuasion by his ex-girlfriend, I logged onto his snap chat and Instagram. I then got a 'dick pic' of the internet and sent it to all of the people on his contacts, posted on his snap chat story and posted it on Instagram. The caption on the picture says ""Don't save your nudes in your cloud"" even though they weren't his. This destroyed his reputation and his ""hard"" friend said he was weird and told him to fuck off.

He instantly comes to me and blames me. I deny it all and he calls the police to find out who it is. The police say that his report is ""filed"" but no action was instantly taken. The same night he calls me and tells me to ""own up to it if it was me"" I then say it wasn't and I hung up.

14th July (the next day) he texts me saying "" Your friend (not naming) said you did it"", ""stop fucking lying to me."" To which I then reply, ""It wasn't me, I told you I didn't do it so leave me the fuck alone."" He hasn't replied since then and I'm left in a fucked up state. I can't speak to people or I get paranoid (not even my parents), I feel I shouldn't exist and that I'm the evilest person existing, I can't sleep and keep getting depersonalization, I'm constantly feeling guilty paranoid about what is going to happen next. 

Sorry if this text wasn't well written but I'm not feeling too good as stated. I haven't been happy since I sent the picture to which I've learned my lesson but I'm still feeling shit. I want to tell my mum so badly but I feel like she will get really stressed and angry since she has a number of mental illnesses such as bipolar. Thank you for reading and please. Help me. 


Update: I told my mum and brother and they reassured me I will be okay, I have learned my lesson and i will be wiser with my decisions. Thank you Reddit. Honestly.

187,"I'm 18 years old, and in April, I finished my first year of university. Unfortunately I did not make it into my program because my GPA was too low. I applied for a business program at another university, but I am stuck on the wait list (it's been over a month now). I don't have many program options at my current university due to my crappy GPA, so now I don't know what to do. I really don't know what I want to do with my life at all in terms of my career, and I don't know if I should even go back to school because whats the point? Should I, 

1) just take some easy courses at my current university to raise my GPA, and then re-apply to the other university later? Or 

2)should I just get an art degree at my current uni

3) Should I just quit school and work minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life

189,"I want to preface this by saying it's mostly my own fault and I'm definitely feeling the consequences. 

I work full time for an insurance company, my pay is slightly above minimum wage. 
I've had migraines for three years and am ashamed to admit I've missed a lot of work.   

I'm on FMLA for the missed work, all time off I take is unpaid. In the last month and a half, I've made less and less per paycheck because the migraines are getting worse. I can't see a neurologist because it costs me $300 out of pocket, I can't afford that because I'm missing work because I can't get adequate treatment. 

Last month I didn't work many days, I spent a lot of time laying in bed, writhing in pain and throwing up. I am ashamed but it is what it is. 

Now my paychecks have clearly reflected my lost time. I usually get around $800 after taxes twice per month but now they're around $200-$500.

My fault, I know this. I should just work with them but it feels impossible...

On 06/30 I didn't get a paycheck. I checked the pay stub and it showed something like -$400. I just figured they might have overpaid me the month before and deducted it from this one. 

This paycheck I worked July 4th, and actually have been here most days, though the mornings are still really bad. I figured since I got holiday pay and haven't missed as much, I should make enough to get paid... 

Well today I haven't been paid. Everyone else has. I talked to my HR and they said it was retroactively deducted for lost time and that I would be getting nothing. I tried talking to my manager  it couldn't do it without bursting into tears, so today is going great. She said she'd look into it though I haven't heard anything yet. 

I live with my boyfriend who got laid off recently. His unemployment won't kick in for another 15 days. We had to borrow money just to make rent. 

Can they take two whole paychecks? I thought they had to at least pay me something. I can't make ends meet with no money whatsoever, bills are due and I owe back for the rent we borrowed. 

Again I realise I'm at fault and I'm to blame. Short of budgeting better in the future I have no idea what to do now... ",14Jul2017,2

I called in and as you all suspected, it was esier done than planned, the Manager in charge for the night cut off my explanation and asked if I needed to call out.

 Should I focus on myself and get over her and let her have her own time? 

Or be a friend too her throughout the hard time she has and maybe when her depression is fixed she might want to get back together.

We were a perfect match together and we've been so happy this summer. She is also going to college this fall, but in a different state. We've already talked about what we want to do when college comes, and we've decided to try to keep our relationship and stay together throughout college. As much as I'd love it to work perfectly, im scared of the doubts that will come in to play. What if I meet someone else, what if our relationship falls apart and leaves us both hurt. I'm terrified of hurting her because I feel so strongly for her and I genuinely love her. When we talked about what we wanted to do, I think I sugar coated the idea of dating throughout college and I failed to mention that we can't guarantee anything. We're both young stupid kids in love, and it seems as if everything I see says this won't ever work out. In a perfect world to me we take a break and grow ourselves as people and see where life takes us. And in 4 years, if we still feel the same way, we get back together and pick back off where we left off. But I feel extremely selfish thinking about that. I don't want to hurt her and I wish that everything would just work out. I'm not sure what to do right now and I'm afraid that if I talk to her about this again it will damage our relationship.

My brother moved backed to my parents' home a few months ago and since I just graduated college, I am living with them again as well. Living with my brother is a nightmare. He is constantly angry 100% of the time, and not simply 'annoyed' but full rage mode steam-coming-out-of-the-ears angry. He definitely has anger issues and has always been this way as long as I can remember. It's just that it's gotten to its worst right now. Anytime we are in the same area together, I can feel the tension and extreme agitation in the air. I try my best to stay away from him, but it's inevitable that at times we will end up in the kitchen or living room together. My brother blows up at the smallest things like leaving the sponge accidentally in the sink or when my parents have guests over. Since it's my parents' house, they should have all say over who they would like over, but nope not on my brother's command. Those are just a couple of things we have to go through living with him. As far as I know, my parents will never kick him out. Moving out is definitely an option but before making that decision, I'd like to hear thoughts from you guys. Any advice?

We're currently living with my in laws and there's nothing wrong there, I love them and they love helping us out. My wife currently isn't working but recently went through a phlebotomy course to get certified and get a job in that field, with ambitions to be a nurse practitioner eventually. 

She as I said hasn't gotten a job yet, and it's just me working and it's stressing me out because I always feel like I'm not bringing in enough money to save up for our own place.

208,"I am trying to stay grounded and keep busy but every day I am sinking into pockets of depression and questioning how long I can live like this. I have a legit rare issue. I have been diagnosed with AFP -atypical facial pain and many people with TN - trigeminal neuralgia have similar symptoms. I've had lots of dental work done but recently after having some root canal work I have been plagued with this. I have been to the ER 3 times in a short period of time and crying almost daily with severe pain that cannot be relieved. Some teeth feel like I have severe sharp surface pains (almost like my tooth enamel is being peeled off and air is being forced in (sometimes it hits in shocks)-it doesn't feel like it hits the nerve of the tooth but almost like tons of tiny nerves on the outside of the tooth are being skinned alive) I know... it is bizarre and I cannot explain it. The pain hits different teeth-mostly canines only and jumps around all day. I have one section that has throbbed and felt tight pressure (under about 3 teeth) for about 3 months now. When I exhale, the hot air on the back of those teeth generate a weird sensation below the teeth. I also have a molar with a root canal done in April-it looks fine on all X-rays taken but is sore to touch and hurts to floss between. I figure this is where it all started. I am afraid to pull the tooth as it may make it worse)
I have been prescribed trilpetal. Today was the first day I had several hours of dulled pain and relief. My dose was doubled on monday and I take 600 mg. I have been on this pill in pediatric doses since the end of June. The nights are the worst for me for some reason. So, to put it simply I am scared to death. I am scared I will always have this pain or it will get worse. I am scared to ever have dental work again. I am scared to the point that I am afraid of living my entire life out. I would not kill myself-I am not brave enough to and I am afraid of where I would go after I die if I do such a terrible act. I am afraid I will still be able to miss my loved ones and don't want them to be pained from missing me. It is not a realistic action-BUT I am terrified to the point of a dark depression.
It feels like I have cement in my soul-and the way I perceive my life is dark and heavy. I never had this before. For example: If I am sitting in a room filled with people I love and we are out having a good time I feel like the room around me is going in slow motion (not for real) and all my emotions are forced to perceive it as sad. I feel like a stranger to all those people and they feel like strangers to me. I cannot determine if this is a side effect of the pill (trileptal) or if this is a result of being in terrible pain all the time. Please understand that this pain cannot be easily managed and there is no ""cure"" for it. You just have to hope it goes away eventually.
It is super weird. I feel like I am mourning my future. I do not like this feeling. I miss who I used to be. Please advice!?",14Jul2017,1
209,"The way I'm feeling is a bit complicated but I'm going to put it into words anyway. I am 18, I have a super high self esteem (I'm fed with compliments by strangers/friends on the daily) and my social life is full of options. I also do vlogs and live streams that people LOVE and I love doing it with them. I also have a job so im always doing something. But lately I've noticed that my chest feels empty... some sort of numbness and I don't know what it is. What I do know is attachments are out of the question by now and I find it hard to get emotionally attached to anyone. I never get offended if anyone says anything rather rude, which isn't regular but it's something else I've noticed. I feel inhuman honestly and it feels so wrong. I feel very happy at times and the other times it's not a sad feeling... just nothing. It's hard to cope with nothing. I feel no direction even though I have many opportunities at my fingertips. I used to be emotional last year when I went through a very painful off and on break up and ever since I decided I'm done for good with that (beginning of this year) I feel that numbness at times, and when I try to feel i feel a very mild tingle. It's made me unreliable for friendships and potential relationships. I'm well liked and pretty popular and I want to be very successful but something's holding me down and it's my feelings. Maybe it's tied to the rejection I faced in my childhood, with being unpopular with other kids  and always felt like the odd man out in everything including family events, and that breakup was the last straw. But I have gotten it together and totally changed who I am and how I touch people's lives. I want a relationship but I don't even chase anymore I just play with what comes to me so I do have options but I don't FEEL the desire nor do I feel anything else at the moment. Maybe it's the shift and the fact I'm the complete opposite of who I was, because when I'm with people I was the ""old me"" with I feel that numbness. I want to fix there and I know there's someone out there who maybe has something similar that was overcome or someone can tell me if I have symptoms of some disorder. The only person who can fix this is ME and I'm aware of that. Change can only work if the person changing changes inside. Love to hear what you all have to say. Thanks. ",14Jul2017,1

214,"I am employed by a consulting firm that does a lot of government contract work. We have several meetings daily both internally and with our government leads/clients. In order to do my work, I have to remotely connect to a virtual server where I can access the websites and materials I need. Due to information sensitivity issues, we are forbidden from transferring certain content (which is the majority of what we're working on) to our corporate accounts. The virtual server is notoriously unreliable. I've had issues for the last 3 weeks accessing the server, so my workflow has been seriously impacted. I had to call the IT help desk 8 times total and 4 days in a row this week because I couldn't get in. 

A couple days ago, I had been on the phone with the IT guys for over an hour already, but had a meeting on my calendar that was starting. It was too late to ditch the meeting, but I didn't want to start all over again with the IT guys by having to hang up. I had sent an email stating I was on the phone with the help desk due to access issues, but didn't anticipate that I wouldn't be able to fully participate in the meeting because the help desk was taking longer than I thought it would. But this also meant I had no access to my work items and notes anyway. So I'm on the meeting and they get to me for my updates. This is a big meeting (~60 people) with our federal leads and other organizational representatives. I briefly explained the situation and apologized. Almost immediately after that, my workstream lead sent a lengthy email about meeting expectations, that essentially what I did was unprofessional and inappropriate, working with the help desk shouldn't impede my participation, and my full attention should be on these meetings so I can positively contribute. He also said we all need to be on our best behavior to secure current and future work. He CC'd my manager and our contract lead, which means this is a serious fuck up on my part and there will likely be repercussions. I sent a response explaining just how diligently I've been working to resolve the technical issues and that I understood my fault.

In hindsight, i can see painfully clearly how and why it was such a huge mistake. I looked completely unprofessional and like I wasn't taking my work priorities seriously. Which in turn reflected poorly on me and the rest of my team. I felt like my hands were tied because I was at the point of panic due to falling behind with my work tasks with the technical issues. But I understand now that I needed to communicate better and should have just hung up with the IT guys while the meeting was going on and returned to that later. 

My manager is out of town until Monday, so I'm sure we'll be setting up a meeting to discuss the situation, and I'm seriously afraid of what will come of it. I plan to send another follow up email prior to Monday to acknowledge my faults specific to this situation, let them know that I take this very seriously, and provide an outline of what I'm doing to make sure this never happens again. This includes having backup notes that I can access regardless of server issues prepared for every meeting, sharpening communication to stay well ahead of potential issues so other team members can provide coverage, checking in more regularly through email and IM for more accountability to the team, and make more effort to positively contribute to all meetings. 

I'd really appreciate advice on what more I can do or say to turn this around and demonstrate my value as an employee. Particularly from those who've been in this kind of situation before, either as the employee who made a mistake or manager/supervisor who dealt with it from the disciplinary side.

224,"I am from Michigan and I have swam my entire life in the Lakes and I am thinking of taking up lifeguard lessons to get a job at my university rec center. I don't have a lot of experience with the professional ""breaststoke"" or ""butterfly"" stroke- I swim with a hybrid of strokes that works best for me. I don't mind opening my eyes underwater or diving for retrievals. I struggle with breath-management and knowing when to breathe during a stroke. Have you met any lifeguards that did not take part in swim teams/sports and just joined from personal swimming experience? Are my skills in an area that can be acceptable/improvable for lifeguard entrance lessons?",14Jul2017,1
226,"I have a strict budget for either a desktop or laptop for university, but I may not be able to afford Microsoft Office. Then I found out about google docs, which is free.

227,"I've been told a lot that I'm awkward, but I have no idea what that means. People don't take me seriously at all, and just thinking about it is giving me anxiety.

It could be people saying I walk funny, it could be just little things. Sometimes people just say ""I don't know, you're awkward"". Its not something like being an asshole where someone is eventually going to call you on your shit; it doesn't work like that.

I'm just so tired of being awkward. I want to be calm and respectable, not awkward. Worse still, in a few weeks, when I move into my job, I'm gonna have to stand up in front of 100 people every day, enforce policy, and have my every move judged. I want to be able to handle it, but people not taking me seriously makes me so freaking angry. 

Please help.",14Jul2017,2
228,"I work as a registered nurse. I was hired on full-time nights. Three weeks ago I had an in-person meeting with my nurse manager and assistant nurse manager. I told them that full-time nights wasn't working, and I was interested in cutting back hours to part-time or PRN (as needed). Nurse manager said she would contact HR, and copy me on the e-mail (I never got an e-mail from her, or HR), but they were going to do everything possible to keep me employed.

Fast forward a week, nurse manager texts me that there is no possibility of cutting back hours. (I called HR myself and asked if said manager had contacted them. They said no.) I gave my two-week notice over e-mail, AND a hard copy.

I never heard a word from my nurse manager, or the assistant nurse manager. Today was my last day employed, and I had an exit interview. HR wasn't aware that today was my last day.

I told the lady in HR that my boss never acknowledged my two-week notice (I have a 'read receipt' on e-mail). The other way I know they got the notice is because they crossed me off the remaining schedule.

Not sure if I'm looking for actual advice, or just venting. If I were in her shoes, I would think it's not only unprofessional, but rude that she never even acknowledged me leaving.",14Jul2017,1
230,"The manager is willing to hire me (and I so desperately need a job right now) but only under the assumption that I come back on weekends (2 hr drive) to work. I've known some friends who lied and said they're going to a school nearby but actually don't just so they could get the job and quit later on.

Should I accept the offer and tell them later that I just want to quit? I was also thinking I could ask the manager that when it is my time to go back to school I transfer to another store near my uni, but I just now realized that there's a big chance there's a minimum amount of days worked before I can transfer to different locations 

I really need a job atm and I've literally looked around to about 10 fast food places and retail but I'm not sure how badly this could be if I lied.",14Jul2017,1
233," Hi reddit, so I'm in a very interesting situation right now because I have been working  in a corporate laboratory for  over a year while achieving my undergraduate degree. The problem is my boss doesn't like how my schedule changes every semester. However they've invested a lot of time into me as an employee and they have trained me on a lot of tests.  I enjoy my job for the most part but I feel somewhat indifferent about working at the company.  To elaborate some days I wish I worked a more basic job and other days I appreciate being a scientist. 

 The situation that I'm in right now is that they need me to work there because they don't want to hire a new person and have to train them all over again. And my schedule  isn't the most ideal for them. But it works! 

 Here is my proposal:  I only have one year of school left and then I graduate with my degree. After that I'm getting my Masters degree.  My masters degree will require me to travel a bit due to field collections in other countries so I need a new job anyway that is way more flexible than the one I have now. I have a couple online jobs that I might stick to for that reason.  I also just want a fucking break because I have been killing myself for the last five years of my college career. Plus the time spent in high school was a total hell hole.  So! Should I quit my  Job after my last spring semester or should I keep it and continue during the summer after my last semester... and possibly stay for another year.  sure I can use vacation time to leave for Field collections during my masters but do I want to do that?  Not really. 


 Anyway, my fate is now in your hands do as you will. ",14Jul2017,1
234,"I have a job that requires lots of reporting with number and excel. The industry I has always been reliant on numbers tying out, but for the most part I have always worked with systems that automatically uploaded large volumes of numbers and auto-generated reports with those numbers. If I didn't understand a concept I could usually find someone to to verbally explain it and then I ""got it"" and could execute my work without issue. Within the last year, I took a new role at a start-up firm. They have no systems in place for automatically scraping data and tying out numbers.  Everything  is copy and pasted into spreadsheets. I am don't have an alternate back up or anyone else on my team to double check me. As a dyslexic I could usually find someway of working around my issues, but I'm at a loss. I can only enter in data, check it and recheck it and hope it doesn't go out to customers wrong. I could really use advice from others with dyslexia on a new way to work around these challenges.

235,"It pains me to say it, but I just don't think this is possible for me.

Secondly, I always try to be cool/confident around women and it just doesn't work.

I just get nervous (sometimes a bit sweaty) when I talk to them, they're just people like you and me, they poop, throw up too and I still get awkward around the pretty ones all the time.

Maybe going to college and eventually finding a career might help me with this problem, because I heard you're forced to socialize and network at college and your field of work.

Guys my age (23) aren't suppose to be nervous around attractive women.

I never know what to say to them nor get them interested, I get rejected frequently.

I've even started to think that I might be ugly and chose to go to the gym (on and off for 5 months now).

The only times I feel confident is when I talk to other people who don't attract me.

For example: I've chosen to quit my current job, because it seriously sucks and the pay per hour is low. 

So, I chose to look for a better job that is a bit more stressful, but I'll be able to talk/socialize much more and earn more money per hour.

Talking to those employers wasn't that hard because I really want a better job and more money.

Lastly, I know this sounds defeatist but I think I'm just one of those guys who isn't meant to be in a relationship.",14Jul2017,1
236,"I like this guy at work, we get on really well but he recently broke up with his girlfriend and is a bit heartbroken. I'm not mentally all that stable myself at the moment but we've just been there for each other. I stayed over at his house one night and it was nice to share a bed with him and just cuddle. I thought we were both on the same page until he kissed me. We've been back and forth sexting since and I just don't know if I'm degrade myself or coming across as easy.. Im endlessly trying to fight between wanting to be with him and not wanting to be seen as an object. This would be an ideal time to be able to read someone's mind. I just don't know what to do. I know he's vulnerable at the moment and I don't want anyone to think I'm taking advantage of that, then again I'm vulnerable and don't know if he's trying to take advantage of that. We're not at that level where we can talk about this sort of thing. I mean I don't know whether to suggest a sort of friends with benefits thing. But then feelings usually always get involved. Or maybe I'd just end up riddled with guilt and disgust in myself. I just don't know what I'm doing",14Jul2017,1
239,My father gave me an old car when I was 16-ish. Had different issues where I couldn't drive it. Father gave me a different car that was drivable and I signed the title back over to the one I had no use of. Now 10 years down the Rd my sister's moved my dad to a senior care center in Miami and his old house was foreclosed on by the bank and purchased by someone else. The new owner of the home reported several abandoned vehicles on the property to the police department. One of them being the one I signed over to my father but he never changed the title. The police department then contacted me to notify me. What should I do? I don't live near there and the car isn't really mine.,14Jul2017,1
