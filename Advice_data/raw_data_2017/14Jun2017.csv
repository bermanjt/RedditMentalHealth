0,"my ex and I met around this time one year ago and I fell deeply in love with him and we had amazing chemistry. In late October he got fired from his job and had to move back home 5 hours away because of his work visa. Both him and I were devastated. We were looking at houses to rent together the day before. We tried making long distance work, when I visited him two months ago he broke things off and told me I should start seeing other people. Since then I haven't been able to cope very well at all. I tried seeing one therapist for a month but it didn't turn out too well. I thought I'd be fine without it but for the past couple of weeks I've been slipping and clearly need it again. I just found out today he found a new job, so he isnt moving back here. I had slight false hope that he'd get back together with me but now that's gone too. I just want him to be happy. I still love him dearly. But Oh my God this is so fucking hard to deal with. I don't know how I'm going to get through it and its already been two months. I miss you so much and I hate that things did not work out. They were supposed to work out and they didn't. ",14Jun2017,2

Some extra information:

I go to highschool and I am a competitive swimmer.... 
I have a lot of extra curriculars but I still study and do my homework.... but still no results",14Jun2017,1
3,"Here's what I know:

I am moving with my wife to a new city (USA) July 1st and she is starting a new job a week later. We are seriously close to splitting up. She wanted me to not move there at all and take time apart, but I didn't want that. With some negotiating, I am helping her move, sticking around to help unpack and get settled during her first week, and then staying with my Mom 4 hours away to give her the space she wanted. I'll probably lie to non-close friends and say I'm helping my Mom through a tough time. We both feel good about this plan as a solid compromise. We are going to start couple's therapy that first week when we move. There is no set date for my return to her city, but we have agreed to stay together at least until October when we can re-assess.

The way this separation was framed is that I need some time to figure my shit out. I've been moving frequently and following her dreams and helping her achieve career goals for most of our 7 years together, and I also know that after only two years of teaching Elementary school, I need to find something new. I might want to teach high school or college Psychology still, but I'm not sure and have no job lined up right now. Our vision for me returning to her city is when I've got a solid job lined up there. She needs some space and doesn't want to deal with me loafing around the couch unemployed for who knows how long. To be clear though, I had success in finishing the year teaching, have NEVER been fired, and am completely financially independent (she actually owes ME some money). I know this narrative makes her seem like a huge bitch, but she's only a little bit of a bitch, haha. I haven't been an attentive husband and have been depressed and I can understand why she is unhappy.

Here's where I'm really struggling with what to specifically do: I have almost exactly one month from now before I'll be staying with my Mom and figuring shit out, with a city move right in the middle. I don't want to wait that long to start figuring things out nor do I want to wait that long to begin working or professionally developing. What can I do in the mean-time?

I was super lost after college so following this girl around and helping her was great for awhile and she appreciated it at first. Then it grew tiresome for her and she wanted me to grow up. I got my Masters in Teaching and thought everything was great until I became completely miserable in my job. I now have to figure out what I want to do yet again and I'm not feeling confident after my last failed choice, so I'm seriously considering seeing a career counselor. Only problem is, I'm living in three different cities in the next month and a half. Therefore, I'm thinking about making a trip home and starting my relationship with a career counselor there ASAP. Does that sound smart? I also need general life counseling but will be seeing this couples therapist too, so I'm hoping the combination will be enough to help.

Some careers I'm considering right now are sales, marketing, restaurant management, financial planning, teaching, accounting, customer service. I have a B.S. in Psychology, a Masters in Teaching, and lots of experience serving/bartending. I am really good at customer service and faking being nice. I am good at following detailed instructions, but struggle to come up with new ideas (hence I can't decide what to do!).

In the face of potentially losing this relationship and being fed up with waiting for opportunity to come by, I've never felt so awake and scared in my life. I feel sick to my stomach all day, and I am usually the most relaxed person I know (too relaxed, obviously). I need to turn things around QUICK and this month that could so easily be wasted would accomplish nothing other than extending my unemployment gap. What can I do with this time? Please give me any advice at all. ",14Jun2017,1

7,"Last summer I was asked last minute to fill a summer school assistant position at the school I had just finished student teaching at. I had already worked for a week before they had me fill out all of the paperwork and take my pre-employment physical. I ended up failing the drug test for marijuana and was told that I was not being hired because of this. Cut to this summer...

I have been long term subbing at a district in various positions all year. I applied for a summer school teacher position and did not include anything about the previous summer because as far as I was told I was not hired. I got the current summer school teacher position which requires me to fill out a new teacher retirement plan election. But...

Because I did work for a week I was paid and the school set up a retirement plan for me. My question is if I resubmit the new teacher retirement paper work am I committing a crime or will my current school find out about the previous school and fire me for not disclosing that I worked there?

I spoke with the HR rep at the school from last year and she said that technically they had to hire me to pay me but I should not have been working before the pre-employment paper work was cleared and they only hired me to pay me and then my employment was terminated. What should I do????",14Jun2017,1
8,"I will try to give background without giving away my employer. I am in need of advice concerning and incident and subsequent HR investigation. Recently, I returned to work from a few work related errands. Afterward I was asked to visit the break room with my store manager (SM) and district manage (DM). Immediately I get asked ""where were you?"" by the DM. I started to reply and was interrupted with him screaming at me, making false accusations, and silencing all attempts to defend myself for about 15 minutes. I am female, DM is male and roughly 80 pounds heavier and 6 inches taller than me. While all this was going on I was forced to sit while they stood. I have since spoken to HR, submitted relevant information and proof against the accusations. To me, the behavior he exhibited was verbally and emotionally abusive, as well as physically threatening. I have asked for all communication about the issue to be e-mailed so I would have a record of what has been said. Today, I received two e-mails from the Director of Human Resources. Within the first he stated that I would be required to continue working while the investigation proceeded and would be contacted by my Regional manager ""soon"" and the second (I had replied to the first with questions regarding the work arrangements) he stated that my Regional manager would contact me soon with the alternate location and time I would be required to report to work. About 30 minutes later I received a call from a number I did not recognize, answered said phone call, and was greeted by my DM, saying that the regional manager had asked him to call me regarding the time and location I was to report. I told him that I require all communication in writing. When I hung up the phone I promptly had a panic attack. It was some time before I was able to e-mail the Director of HR to let him know what had happened and that I didn't not feel safe around the DM (which I had said numerous times before). My question is can they fire me for refusing to work with someone that is now under investigation for threatening and abusive behavior against me? And if I am let go from my position, can they stop me from being able to draw unemployment? Do I have any power in this situation? I don't feel as though I am being taken seriously.

9,"For a long time, I've loved Science. I love to know about the world around me, and I love to have a grasp on the universe's mechanisms. I find that it is really humbling and puts me in awe at times on how complex and amazing the universe is. I'm 15 years old, and I haven't done much on terms of science. I see people like Michio Kaku, who built an atom smasher in high school, and I think that I should've done something, even if it's not on level with an atom smasher. The most advanced thing I've ever done was building a computer, and I feel that that's not enough if I want to be a physicist. 

So, I recently began to begin to do things differently. Fixing drones, taking apart barometers, fixing laptops, and things like that. Albeit, it's nothing on the scale of atom smasher, it's a start. I feel like it's more of a thing I'm making myself do to reach my goal of becoming a physicist. So, it dawned on me yesterday: I'm driving myself by myself wanting to become a physicist, and not by my drive to be curious.

Now, I know I love physics and science, and it's what I want to do when I'm older. But how do I turn myself to be driven by curiosity?",14Jun2017,3
10,"Hello ! I'm hoping to buy a phone tomorrow from a guy I've messaged through a Facebook group. I do have 3 mutual friends with him. £325 for iPhone 7 plus. What precautions can I take now before I meet him and then when I'm there with him? 

My worries are that it is fake ,stolen, or has something wrong with it. 
 
I have researched a little and I know there is a code called IMEI that should match on the back and on the software. And that I should check the serial number into Apple.com to see if it's reported stolen. Is there anything else I can ask before I meet him or I can do when I'm there. How would you suggest paying for it? Cash seems very risky, possibly PayPal or bank transfer.

I know his older brother very well (as we're almost the same age), but him only a little bit.
As I lost my father with 18, I can relate how he feels right now - but for a child, this is even harder to handle..

That's why I thought I should write him a letter of condolence, telling him ""I know it doesn't change the situation, but in a situation like this, a little bit of disctraction and fun, especially with friends, helps a lot""  with a gift like money or a gift card.

We've had a few conversations since, and we agreed to be friends. Last night he texted me while I was in the middle of a date, and asked me to call him because he was afraid he was going to do something stupid ie. commit suicide. I called him up and talked him down, and also sent his brother to go and talk to him.
My ex keeps saying that the reason he's depressed is that he hates himself because he threw away our relationship by kissing that girl and he still loves me etc
I guess my question is what should I do in this situation? I think the same sort of thing might happen again. I still care about him, but I don't think I should be the one who is guiding him through his depression especially when he's supposed to moving on from me.

All of our extended families live elsewhere and we only get to see each other about once a year.

We would like someway of being able to stay in contact but with the progression of social media beyond any type of real privacy that doesn't seem to be an option. Our case worker informed us that the birth family has been looking for our children on Facebook so we deactivated our account.

17,"Too much info for the title alone, unfortunately. Here is the breakdown:

* She was the victim of attempted identity theft, and therfore had to put holds on her credit scores (Transunion, etc.)
* She tried to put the electricity for her new apartment into her own name (National Grid Electric Company), but they need to verify her identity. It specifically requires *them* to call *her*, and not the other way around.
* They called her parents house and not her cell phone. She wasn't there to talk because she doesn't live there anymore. Okay, no big deal, mistakes happen. She gave them her cell and they said they would call her cell soon.
* Repeat the last step literally four more times. In other words, four times they said they updated her information with her cell number and removed her parents number, but ended up calling her parents again anyway. Since she doesn't live at her parents (and they call when the parents are at work, anyway), she can't get the electricity in her name.

Basically, I'm asking for advice on her behalf on how to get through to them. What can she do to actually get them to call her cell and not her parent's? The logical step of asking them to do so over the phone has failed four times in a row. Insight much appreciated.

18,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I am just lost. I will start with some background to explain my problem.

I grew up relatively happy and comfortable. Even when my family was struggling, we were never worried about where our next meal would come from, or whether we could afford to live in our home.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost three years now. We live in a small apartment together and though we don't have a lot, I couldn't imagine myself with anyone else.

I have known his mother was struggling with money for awhile now. I don't want to give away a lot of personal details, but basically she kept paying her rent late and last month the apartments she lives in evicted her.

Now this is where things get hairy for me. I have been on vacation the past week, and my boyfriend called me to tell me the situation has gotten worse since I have been gone. Her last day to get out is tomorrow, and she has no place to live. She is going to a homeless shelter.

There are small children who are also in the house, and we have said that we can help babysit them sometimes so they are not staying with their borderline abusive father all the time, but we don't have the resources to keep them all the time. She says she has to keep the kids at the homeless shelter sometimes to maintain custody, which upsets me.

His mother seems to think that she is only going to be at the homeless shelter for a month while she gets things together, and I suppose that could be true. But what if the situation only gets worse? My boyfriend doesn't seem that worried, and neither does she, but this situation is beyond foreign to me.

Basically, what the hell is there to do in this situation? I feel so lost in how to provide comfort or help.

23,"So this all started a few years back - I graduated high school and got admitted to a college. However it ended up being WAY too expensive and I had to leave. 
Luckily no debt or anything.
Parents were understanding and I opted to go to a local college instead of the fancy expensive out of state school I was told to go to.

However my complete lack of social skills and fear of asking for things made it so I put off applying because I needed to ask for my transcript from my old HS.

Missed out on a year of school
Parents understood and I managed to get enrolled for the following term.

Alas, my utter incompetence at this whole college thing made it so that somehow my forms for residency never got to the school in time and I was told I would have to pay for out of state tuition , which I could not afford.
My family is poor and I can't ask them for money and I had no way to get the money I needed in time so I just left school and didnt go back.

However since I already told my parents that I had my college finances and studies figured out, I didnt tell them about any of this and decided to lie to them and tell them I was still going to school.

Since then I leave the house and hope they dont find me sneaking about the town during school hours.

Tried to fin a job to get back to school but I can't seem to get ANY responses or anything at all from entry level positions. 
Spend my ""school days"" in local libraries using the computers to self study web development but I want to earn money to help pay rent or something at home since financial situation has gotten worse.

But as I said I can't get any sort of responses and if I do my utter lack of speaking skills make me fail the interviews.

Needless to say Im very discouraged and unsure of my future.

Hoping you all have some good advice to help calm my nerves.  Last weekend, I met a cute girl on Tinder and invited her over last night with the intention of hooking up.  I've never done anything like this before, so I was nervous from the get-go.  She seemed very intelligent, clean, and friendly which helped a lot to calm my initial nerves.  Before she came over I asked her if she was on the pill (She said yes, and that she takes it religiously), we used a condom, and I pulled out...yet for some reason I'm terrified of her getting pregnant? Before she left I even asked her about what we'd do in a situation where she got pregnant, and she said 100% she'd get an abortion because she just graduated college and wants to focus on her career.

I don't know why I feel this way, but it's consuming me and I want it to stop.  I think it's because I hear the horror stories of pregnancies/child custody/support battles and it's freaking me out.

I am in a real bind.

I work in Los Angeles in film for with a reputable small business that is relatively difficult to get into. I've been with them for over a year and things have been really great. I've built strong relationships, learned plenty of new skills, and enjoy coming into work.
My position is an assistant position and I work with one other person to tackle assignments throughout the day. At the beginning of the year we replaced the other person on this team because they were moving onto another job, and unfortunately the switch is seriously making me consider leaving to find another job. I'm torn because the owner of the company, as well as the people who recommended me to work for this company really enjoy having me around and want to train me to move up the ladder -- which of course we know in film years could be an eternity -- and I don't know how much longer I can stand working with this new co-worker.

Why?

-She asks me millions of questions about things she can either Google or, based on herschooling, should already know. (""How do I import this file into this program?"" Are you kidding? You are ""certified"" in this program according to your resume…I had to learn it from scratch.)
-She interrupts me when I'm in the middle of doing my portion of the job do tell me something beyond dumb. (""Haha…it looks like the guy in the video is just stoned the whole time."" That's what you came over here to tell me?)
-She is beyond socially awkward (i.e.: she walked into the middle of a conversation that she wasn't a part of between two other co-workers, realized this, and then just stood in my room leaning with her head on my wall, and then left after what felt like a century).
-I will ask her if there are any tasks we can split up. She will say that she can handle it. Then at the end of the day she will leave me with everything she didn't finish. Why didn't we just split it up in the first place? Now you have to explain to me where you left off while I'm still doing my own work.

These are just a few of the daily occurrences. For the record, this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she is a girl. I'm a guy and the person that she replaced was also a girl and I loved working with her. I've talked with her about these things before. I've stood up for myself, stood up for the company, taught her ""the way we do things"" and she's been able to grasp some of it…but most times…

Example: One day a few weeks ago I got into work and right away was drilled with a million questions. I kindly but firmly responded, ""Hey, good morning. Let me get settled and then we'll talk"". Her response? ""I'll let you get settled but…(insert 1 million comments about things that are irrelevant to what I need to do when I get in and pertain to other jobs)"". Our boss had to jump in and interrupt her for blabbing to me.

As much as I'd like to lay down the hammer and nip this in the bud once and for all, we work in close quarters…sometimes there's only 3 of us in the office. I've also talked to my boss about it and he's really only suggested that I talk with her on my own, which I've done, and he and I agree that it would be lame to have him complain to her on my behalf.
This person has been on our team for almost 6 months now. Probably 200-300 people applied for her position and I feel bummed when I think about how hard people work to get work, and this is who we hired.

What else can I do to help with this situation? Do I stick it out and try to take control of the situation with hopes of moving up the ladder?
Or do I jump ship and find a new team and new management that actually has the guts to fire someone when the time is right?

I have aspergers syndrome(i'm fairly high functioning) so i don't know what to do in these situations. Examples of him being annoying is him constantly messaging me on facebook and asking me for pictures of homework(i blocked him) and staring at my face for an uncomfortable amount of time pointing out the flaws on my face like saying ""it's fascinating how your nose is so pointy."" another thing that is annoying is that he keeps. He also threatens me and other people if they don't do something he wants.another thing is he follows me and sits near me in classes what advice can you give me so that he stops talking to me because at this point i can't see myself being his friend as  he comes off as manipulative and annoying. thank you for reading this i really appreciate any advice",14Jun2017,2

I was at work today and I struggle with making friends. I kind of gave up on that endeavour but today at work I was taking a smoke break and I mentioned to the lady next to me ""I think the team next to mine hates me""

and she straight up replied ""that's because you're an asshole""

I don't feel like an asshole I honestly don't. I perceive myself as a very boring person actually. when I hear coworkers talking about things I sincerely try to show that I care. But for the last month or so, people just haven't been talking to me anymore. I've been in quite a regress of my depression just after thinking I finally conquored it this year.

it's been really bringing me down.

so I guess my question is... how do I stop being an asshole if im not an asshole?

or

maybe I just say things that if someone said them to me it would be fine but other people perceive it as asshole words?

it's really bringing me down and any advice would be great.

I have nightmares about it constantly. I live wth my parents still and I'm always afraid of running into him and my parents even threaten me with him sometimes because they are sick fucks. After everything happened he just kinda treated me like shit and ignored me and acted like I didn't exist and then he would take his anger out on me and chase me around the house and beat me while I was defenseless and my parents did nothing about it 

The issues are getting deep because i feel like I'm worth nothing because of it like I don't deserve success and evencit I did he would just rip it away somehow.

66,"Something just hit me real hard in my mind, so I will just cut right into the middle. I have no idea how long this is going to be, or how shitty it is going to be, but I just feel like I need to write. 

I'm 17 year old guy who lives in Korea at the moment, and right now, I have all sorts of problem. 

Born and raised in Cali, I wasn't a typical 'asian kid' at the school. I DID jump 3~4 grades for math, and when I was in 6th grade, I would go to local high school every morning to take 1st period Pre-calc and would return to my elementary school to continue on rest of my day. I didn't really excel in classes, but when I tried, I would get results that even I was surprised of. Accepted to Mensa when I was 9, I was surrounded by parents&amp;grandparents with high expectations. 


But, unlike other 'typical asian' you might think of, I was more of a jock. Running back for the school football team, hockey player, and a wrestler. Went to skate after school, while watching my friends smoke weed. I never actually did my homework, just copied all the answers during whatever free period I had. Got answers for a test from someone who had the test few periods before me. 

Always, my focus was on 'having fun' with whatever knowledge I had. For example, we had this mandatory writing class in 4th grade, and we were on a lesson on doing Bibliography(I still have hard time spelling this) through a website named bibme.com (I think) and literally everybody was bored. So I decided to mess with the school's network and anyone who would try to access a website through the school's network would be redirected to pornhub.com. Seriously, I do realize now that it is a messed up shit to do, but everybody, except the teacher of course, had a good laugh for it. I always got in trouble for 'cursing', 'being loud in lunch room', 'making inappropriate remarks' and such. 

My times during Junior High was worse. Basically, I really enjoyed school overall, but not the classes. I intentionally ditched other asian kids and ignored them to act I was 'different' and 'cool'. None of my friends were asian, and soon, the whole 'asian community' was against me. During 7th grade, I got access to the school's ""Powerschool"" system, a program that was used in my district to track attendance and grade for students. I ran a small 'business' inside the school, getting paid to delete the 'tardy' mark or the 'absence' mark, or to bump some grades up. I still did quite well on extra curricular and classes though. Still got straight-As without changing my grade (copied homework but did well on tests). Also became one of the three people to be in 8th grade Varsity Football while being in 7th Grade. I would sometimes miss football practices to go to a ""Mathcounts"" meeting. Something that is completely opposite. While dealing with all that, I still got 47th place in National Mathcounts Competition in 7th grade, and slightly better in my 8th.

Anyways, I moved to Korea at the end of the 8th grade, and I basically went to three schools in the course of less than three years. I really just didn't fit in. Currently, I took the korean equivalent to GED and I have a highschool diploma, and currently studying for korean equivalent to SAT. Basically, this test defines your whole life in Korea. 45Q test on Korean, 30Q on Math, 45Q on English, 20Q Korean History, 20Q each for two 'extra' subjects you choose. (I chose Biology and Earth Science). This, literally controls your whole life in Korea. That is basically the part I'm stressed about. I haven't really studied. Like ever. I seriously don't know how to concentrate and stuff. And this is the part that gets worse.

After dropping out several schools in Korea, I went to a hospital to diagnose if I have any mental-problems. I do have depression, and the typical stuff. I also have a SLIGHT ADHD according to the diagnosis test, but I am pretty sure it is off. By a lot. I don't have a SLIGHT case of ADHD, instead, I feel like it is serious, like 'I don't know if I should continue studying' serious. But the problem is, I did so great on the 'concentration' part of the test, that nobody thinks it is serious at all. But I know by heart, I really, stress out to max to do well on tests if it has the name 'test' in it.  I feel like dying, but I'm still that scared 7th grader who wouldn't smoke weed when your skater friends offered you some. 

The point is I really want to be successful in life, go to a decent college, have a decent job, live a decent life in California. But as time passes, living normally is getting harder and harder for me. My parents and grandparents, have real high expectations as I mentioned before. My grandfather, was the president of a company that probably all of you heard about. I lived in the best houses, went to best schools, got the best car when I became 16, and got anything that I can think of. I really want to do the same for my kids if I get married some day. To do this, I feel like I need to step up my game. 

How do I restart? or at least reboot myself to get started? Also..if any of you are familiar with ADHD, I seriously fall asleep ANYTIME of the day, ANYWHERE. Like the environment doesn't matter at all. I tend to fall asleep during tests too. And I feel the same sleeping three hours or sleeping 10 hours. I am afraid to tell my parents about it, since they are going to think I am making excuses to not study.. I told them I might have dyslexia, but they didn't seem to get it. (or believe me).

Sorry for this shitty piece of writing. I got really emotional and just blurted out some random memories from my head. ANY form of tips or advices would be appreciated. Thank you Reddit!",14Jun2017,1

78,"so..
my long time friend and former SO is currently struggling with mental illness lets call her Sandy, and her mother and sister are failing to support her the way she needs to be supported. 

A little context...we live on a not so developed country, and her family has always had financial issues,  most of her treatment comes from the government, Sandy has been in a somewhat critical condition for 8 months now and was forced to temporarily drop out of college. With her health condition she is unable to get a job or go back to school.

Anyway, her mother has become overtime really toxic, projecting her issues with her ex-husband on her, also she won't let her see or go out with anybody and  if she does let Sandy go out, she wont stop texting her demanding her to come back home. It's like she wants to keep her locked in the house all the time, for no good reason, with the excuse that she has to do domestic chores. Her older sister, disappointingly,  usually concurs with her mother, or turns a blind eye on this obsessive behavior.

I'm really concerned that she won't be able to overcome her condition living in such a hostile environment and under constant pressure when she needs the exact opposite to battle her illness, which isn't exactly easy to deal with even in the best possible environment. She has considered taking her own life before, even if she hasn't acted on it, its a factor. Also her situation has left her hopeless about her future, which isn't a good sign. 


What I'm asking here is, what can she do to get out or change the situation in her favor, I've tried suggesting her to have a serious adult talk with her mom, but she says it's beyond talking by now, she has reached a point where she doesn't listen to anything Sandy says. 

Also, as a person who loves and cares about her, what can I do to help? I have a nice stable job but I still live with my parents.

He's like ""oh this kitty litter can go out what are you, stupid? Leave the pallet my men will put it all away."" So not wanting to have them over filling the shelves I took those kitty litters off and then still took the pallet to the back. 

Then today he sees me splitting our assorted pallet and says ""my guys were able to get your 4 overstock pallets into one cart, what do you think happened there?"" I said without hesitation ""my guess? Your guys ignored the shelf caps and mods and stuffed the shelves to their brim. See if a shelf has a cap of 5 I tend to put 5 in there. Someone has been putting 15 in instead then day and evening crew has to clean it up."" Then he asks why pets hasn't been done tonight, once again not backing down I said ""could be that no one was assigned there tonight. I was pulling skids and working backroom. You did see all the tills [workers name] and i ripped out today, right?"" 

He's like ""You better start doing things my way or I'm gonna have a little conversation with the evening manager and see who he'd rather lose, you or me.""

I spent 8 months under his tutelage. My whole crew and I applied, got promoted without him getting a say in it so he's been bitter ever since. His punishment for anything, any slight he thinks you did is to set up a chair in your department and force you to watch one of his thugs destroy your department. Then with an hour and a half left to go in the day he tells you to get to work so it's clean for morning shift.

Anyway, like I said, have had this friend for 25 years. Throughout the years I've helped her with somewhere to live, I've helped pay her bills, I've bought Christmas for her kids. I've done a lot for her. She was in an abusive relationship a few years back and finally got out. She's still not really financially able to take care of herself. She says she's got fibromyalgia. How true that is I don't know. She's always taken pills, she grew up around that sort of lifestyle. But I think she's stopped doing as many as she used to. She lives in public housing, her kids are doing pretty good. They all have good grades, are nice, etc.

I live in Texas now, so we don't hang out, we don't talk much in person anymore and to be honest we don't really speak on the phone much. Up until I moved 1k miles away, we spoke every single day from when we were 3 years old until we were 30.

She tells me that my friend talks about me all of the time, she calls me names. She also told me that my friend (who is also my step cousin btw), cares more about doing drugs than she does her own children.

Because I'd imagine things would get awkward real fast if she declined. I'm thinking maybe I could ask her if she wants to get a drink sometime after work in maybe a more 'friends' type of situation. She's a server so she leaves long before my shift ends, but on slow nights we tend to pop over to the bar next door for a beer so if I just said ""Hey, want to go over and get a beer after you clock out? I could use a break"" maybe that would be a good next step.

I'm just really trying to do this the right way. I'm okay with rejection, I just don't want to make a move that would mess with my work life or hers, or that would be disrespectful to her.

Thanks in advance for any advice, I'd really appreciate it.",14Jun2017,10
100,"Hi reddit, this is probably quite silly but I figured I would give it a shot anyway because I would do absolutely anything. 

Relevant back story:

Until a few weeks ago me and my girlfriend had been dating (long distance, Internet) since July and I truly believe she is the one. Some mistakes were made on both sides and a lack of communication due to her being very down at the time but refusing to talk made us drift apart a little. She broke it off and I hsve seriously been unable to function since. 

There is nothing more I want in my life than her and believe me I have tried everything to try again with her but she doesn't want to go back despite how amazing everything was really except the end. Very shortly after we were separated another guy and her got very close and only continue to get closer where at this point they are on the verge of dating. 

This only causes my anxiety and depression to get worse but she doesn't believe she is doing anything wrong (it started very quickly after we separated). 

What I am praying to get advice on however is how I can get the love of my life back. I will literally do anything imaginable but I don't know what else I can do, I just can't lose her and a life without her is nothing for me. 

I've done an incredible amount of self reflecting and I've talked to her about this multiple times but she just doesn't want to give it a second try, but I would do absolutely anything for a second chance 

If anybody even got this far through the post and you have any advice, I beg you ",14Jun2017,1
101,"I know this is a HUGE submission, but if you’re into cheesy angsty forbidden love stories then this is for you… I think…

A year and a half ago during my senior year in high school I had a huge crush on a girl who was a grade below me after kissing her during a game of truth or dare. I’m pretty sure the feeling might’ve been mutual but it didn’t happen at the right time and we didn’t hang out that much by the end of the year.

Now a year since I’ve graduated, she recently texted me and we met up to catch up on everything. She and I both are in a much better place than we were a year and a half ago when we first hung out. 

I somehow didn’t even struggle coming up with the courage to tell her about my feelings. She said she liked me too, although she would like to end any relationship before she leaves for college in a few months because she’s afraid of commitment. Knowing that we would live hours away from each other, I agreed that I too was just looking to have a fun summer with her. At the time, I really didn't think this was a big deal.

However, by the end of the date, I realized it was the best date I’ve ever been on. We had actual deep and insightful conversations. We didn’t talk about the weather or any redundant nonsense. Our interest and curiosity for each other was very apparent. Our chemistry mixed so well together it felt like we were made for each other as I flirted and joked with her throughout the night.

We adventured around town, went mini-golfing, and talked about fun things we should do together over the summer. For some reason, I was extremely confident in being myself around her, and she reciprocated. We kissed and it felt amazing. She is super fun to be around and I’m sure she had a great time as well. We wanted to keep the night going even though we had already been together for almost 5 hours before going home.

Now she has finals in school this week so I’m waiting to spend more time with her, but I can’t help but think about her.

From thinking about her so much, all the feelings I had for her when I had a crush on her a year and half ago are starting to come back. I’ll re-iterate: In senior year, I had the HUGEST crush on this girl. My “spidey-senses” were tingling for lack of a better term. I’ve known her for so long and I really can’t think of any girl I’ve ever liked more. We’re simply just on the same exact page.

But now I look at the future - an approaching end date to whatever comes out of our relationship over the summer. I figure it can go either one of four ways:

-Our relationship goes as planned and we break up right before she leaves for college and end it there.

-Our relationship goes as planned and we break up temporarily with the intention of possibly seeing each other when she’s back from school

-We break up way before she leaves so we don’t grow too attached

-We grow too attached to each other over summer and we decide to try to keep a long distance relationship going

When I look at all the above options, I realize that no matter what happens, in a couple of months I’m going to be living in an angsty forbidden teen love story set to “Wouldn’t it Be Nice” by the Beach Boys. I know it will be hard and I hate thinking so far in the future, but I know it’s inevitable. 

But for some reason, even though I know how it’s going to end, I feel a need to get to know her better anyway. I figure that if I don’t go for it, I’ll end up regretting it. Even though I know how it might end, I for some reason want to experience it: every moment shared together, every laugh, cry, sigh, and kiss. 

Of course this all makes me wish I had told her how I felt about her a long time ago, but I can only look forward.

It almost feels like a “If you could see your own future would you change it” kind of question, but for some reason I want to embrace the future, despite all my possible fears. In the long run, I’ll learn something from it right?",14Jun2017,1

104,"Hi people. I'm Caine, I'm 17 years old, and I'm lonely..

Pretty much my whole life has been like this, ever since early on in school. People always made up rumours about me and didn't want to hang around with me. When it came to secondary school, these rumours spread to the rest of the people that were previously at different schools, it became cool to make fun of me, tease me, mock me, make me angry, especially make me angry. It got so bad that I slowly stopped going to school completely. At the present day I'm 17 years old and I don't have a single grade or qualification to my name. But, the grades thing isn't what I really care about. The one thing I've always wanted..is to just not be alone anymore..

I never leave my house..I barely talk to anyone..all I do every day is just sit, play games and watch stuff. Every night I reflect on what I do every day and ask..""Why is it like this..I don't deserve it...why me..why do I have to be so alone..?"". My family members never see that side of me, I don't let them, they can't help me. I cry alot..almost every day..you'd think after dealing with something for so long you'd eventually get used to it, but no..not loneliness...it just gets worse and worse..I can't talk to people, my social anxiety is so bad that I can't be in a room with multiple people I don't know without feeling imprisoned, unable to move. I haven't been outside of my house or a relative's house for more than an hour in the past 2 years..hard to believe right? The other day I did literally a 2 minute walk to a shop and back to my house and my legs were sore for almost 2 days after it..it's like the outside is foreign to my body. 

The loneliness is just getting too much...I'm so tired of being alone..I've contemplated suicide multiple times..though truthfully I'm also scared of it....The thing I wish I had most is someone that loves me..I just want someone to love me..someone I can cuddle with at night and go out and do stuff with...someone I can tell how beautiful they look every day and be so grateful that I have them..but I don't think I'll ever have that...when I see couples in public or even just on the TV it makes me feel sick..and horrible..that so many people have the one thing I desperately want..that I'll never have...I also find myself to be almost addicted to sympathy..it's like it's a drug...I want people to feel sorry for me because it makes me feel good..but only very temporarily...I guess that's only the real reason I'm posting this...because in truth I don't really believe anyone can help me...I really think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life...and it hurts..it hurts so much..",14Jun2017,1

Socially, I want to be able to completely separate work and school. I want to be friends with people, date, etc. But everyone knows I work for the school, even though it isn't something I flaunt.

112,"I work and teach children. You know sometimes, a kid is a tough one to deal with. It really depends, but it's enjoyable because we get to build things from play-do (for example). 

I have two shift options for the summer and imagine it's hot too. The schedule goes from early morning 7:30 AM to noon, about 2:30 PM. A total of 7-8 hours.

- Option A - Monday, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Nice break on Wednesday, you're only part-time too, so you could use that to go to the park, gym, refresh.

- Option B - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Three straight days. I am not an experienced teacher and I no one really likes children. Just there for the bill's support. Don't want to lose my mind. However, it does justice by making me not think of an oncoming workday. I can get a 4 day weekend but at the expense of succumbing to summer sloth and coming on Monday for the whole 3-day deal again. Saturday should be the day off here.

115,"So it's happening this coming weekend. A couple of friends are having a party to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. The party is fancy dress, in that all the people coming are to dress like they would on their wedding day - all the women in white dresses, and their partners all in suits. 

I am in the middle of a divorce. She is going to be there, which I can handle, but it really feels terrible thinking that we're going to see each other at this party for the first time since splitting up, and we're gonna be dressed in such a way. It hurts just thinking of it.

Not going isn't an option. I thought perhaps I could wear something else, or do some subtle costume changes that would be in keeping with the theme of the party, but also be in keeping in theme with what's going on in my own life without being overly dramatic or drawing all the attention to myself. 

I had thought of going as a priest, but then somebody pointed out that all of the couples in their wedding clothes would want me to pose for pictures with them and I'd hardly have a moment's peace all night.

Any ideas or help here would be much appreciated.

118,"Suicidal temptations come and go, though that's not exactly what I'm seeking advice for. In general, having dealt with nearly debilitating depression for, gosh, almost four-and-a-half years, it's sometimes very easy to question my own sanity.

The most severe triggers for depressive crises for me have been feelings of rejection, stemming from having been ostracized from multiple peer groups within the past couple years. I'm not totally friendless, thank God, but it's usually easier to focus on who I've lost than on who I have. Thinking of why and how I became ostracized leads me to question my own thoughts and behavior. Depression itself, usually coupled with anxiety, already makes me ""quirky,"" for lack of a better term. It's been quite awhile since I've looked at myself and felt normal, and analyzing failed relationships tends to make it worse.

I guess a fair summary of my mental health issues would include suicidal depression, anxiety, and slight obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I've had these afflictions for so long, and from such a developmentally important part of life (they started in adolescence), that it becomes increasingly difficult to determine what ""normal"" even is for me.

With my closes friends, I can be myself. With everyone else, I feel like I walk a thin line between acting genuinely and concealing my true character because I just don't know if I'm doing this whole existence thing correctly. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out, which doesn't do well for my anxious paranoia that my friends all secretly detest me for being a freak.

A large part of coping with anxiety and depression, as I've been taught, is to counter negative and irrational thoughts. Fair enough, but it doesn't seem to do well for my psyche to have one thought and then concertedly squash it down because it's bad. There's a point where ""I need to adjust my thinking"" blurs very heavily with ""my mind does not work correctly.""

In addition, my grandfather is currently in the midst of cognitive deterioration due to Alzheimer's, and drawing parallels between us is too easy. He suffers from delusions, for example. Isn't that what my anxiety does to me? How can I claim to have a greater grasp on reality than my insane grandfather when maintaining the very will to live is something that doesn't come naturally? I have to fight my own mind to cope with depression, so how am I any less crazy?

Once the whole issue of sanity comes into question, it all falls apart. Am I normal, or crazy? If I can't trust myself to even desire remaining alive most of the time, who am I to declare my own sanity?

I read a thread somewhere about how parents deal with children who are heavily autistic. Some came out and confessed the hard truth that raising someone with a cognitive disability is really freakin' hard to do, let alone with a positive attitude toward that someone. Now, my psychiatrist has ruled out autism for me, but the more I question my sanity, the more I wonder how much of a burden I pose to my friends. I really, really don't want to be the guy whose friends stick around out of obligation. I guess I shouldn't worry about that, because of how many ""friends"" have abandoned me recently, but thinking ""I'm too inept to make someone feel obligated to tolerate me"" isn't exactly a very heartwarming feeling in itself.

I don't know. The idea that I'm just sitting here, floating in my own little world disconnected from everyone else, is terrifying. I think this why I get so anxious and jealous when my close friends interact with their other friends around me. Does that even make sense? Is it normal to feel like you have to compete for people's attention? Is it okay that I'm totally sure that without social contacts, my mental state would deteriorate drastically? Heck, being away from the university for the summer is already beginning to unravel me from lack of social interaction. Do regular people ever feel ""unraveled,"" or is that just more evidence that I'm a crazy piece of garbage?

My depression is the most manageable when I feel confident enough to step back and assess that indeed, I am sufficiently mentally equipped to do this ""adult life"" thing. When the doubt creeps in, I feel more like a small, helpless child who needs reassurance for everything I do.

I'll be honest, times like these make me feel like I should be able to gracefully bow out of this existence thing if I feel it appropriate. If I'm crazy, I don't want to live. If I'm *not* crazy, I'm still obviously very bad at it.

122,"So I'm in a seriously horrible situation, I have missed the final exams of two subjects (one of them was a french exam and the other was 1/2 of an english exam) and, consequently, failed both. 
The exam I missed today was my final exam of french and the timetable just says ""French I - 14 of June"". Because it doesn't specify an hour, I assumed that the exam would take place at the same hour that normal lectures do (11:00), but apparently, the teacher had send an email through moodle saying that the exam would take place at 10:00, an email that never reached me. So after studying for days I arrive at class just to find it completely empty and while I'm leaving the premises everyone is looking at me confused and you could tell just by looking at them that they were laughing at me on the inside, and I was feeling more stressed and humilliated than I've ever been before. 
People have always seen me as a clumsy scatterbrain, but I'm not, it's just that I'm terribly unlucky and everything in my life goes wrong for the stupidest reasons. So my parents think that I either skipped the exams because I hadn't studied or I missed it because I'm stupid, and that is really frustrating.
To sum up, the (shitty) website of my university has screwed me over twice and I don't know what to do anymore, I can't handle this situation. They were both exams that I would have easily passed and I had good marks at both subjects. This is the first time something like this happens to me and, in the previous semester, all the exams took place at the hour they were supposed to.
I'm on the fourth stage of grief and loss at this point... 
To add insult to injury I failed another subject with a mark of 4.9/10, which is ridiculous, not only that but the teacher had repeatedly told us throughout the semester that any mark lower than ""3"" would instantly become a 0/10. Color me surprised when he told us that when he said ""3"" he meant ""3/6"", not ""3/10"" (which is retarded because 3/6 is the same thing as 5/10), trolling all the students in the process and demonstrating how dumb spanish teachers can be...",14Jun2017,1
124,"Hey guys, recently I've stopped studying (I failed like 2 subjects and to be honest my mental health wasn't right at all). The exams are on this week and I didn't even bother going so I will confirm my de-enrolment with my university soon.

Now, I feel like I've wasted my life away, i'm 22, I really haven't had anything going for myself except for shitty security jobs which had companies having contracts that never lasted. I also have a history of depression, an annoying habit of being lazy and not accepting reality at all.. well, until now.

I don't want to screw myself up anymore.. Due to depression etc I've gained around 20 kilos and maintained it for a while and I decided that despite not being a ""hands-on"" type of person, I want to get into a trade, regardless of not liking that type of work.

Now, my father's company had offered to pay for my apprenticeship tuition fees due to the owner of the company and my dad being close, I think the company deals with domestic jobs and sometimes commercial and he told me to pick a trade.. There were 3 options but I narrowed it down to 2, reason will be explained.

There is carpenting, electrical and plumbing.
I ruled out carpenting due to the fact of having a fear of heights which for me will paralyze me the moment i look down from a certain height (A double storey house is more than enough to make me shit myself). I decided that I would either pick between electrical or plumbing.

With Electrical, there is a lot of physics and maths involved (which i am not good at, i've never done physics either) and with plumbing, well, the only downside i see is you have to deal with faeces on a regular occasion unless your specialisation with the trade is something else. I really like the idea of plumbing, I know that people need to have a strong stomach but it's not like I've seen fucked up shit before so I reckon i can handle it.

But the problem is, one trade has more job security than the other and the other has more money than the other, reason's being very obvious.

An obvious reply may be ""Well why don't you do plumbing if you like the idea of it alot?"" I just want to be sure that I can provide for myself and for my family now and my family in the future with a secure trade.

I am well aware of how much each trade pays, I just want advice from fellow tradies (especially plumbers and electricians) and some guidance to make sure I'm making the right choice for myself and my future.

129,"So let me just start off by saying that a couple of nights ago I had what felt like a mini heart attack. I had one close call before which was really bad, then another one recently which scared me because I was in so much pain all over and it lasted about 5 min, and just last night I felt the same feeling again in my chest but this time it was enough to wake me up but not like the last time. Lately I've been feeling like the big one is around the corner. 

I'm not sure if going to work would be the healthiest choice as I also had a mini attack at work the other day and it's a lot of manual labor. Trouble breathing, chest pains, heart was beating irregularly, body pains, weird sensations in my nervous system when I sleep. The smallest thing like my alarm vibrating and making noises when I'm asleep is enough to send my heart into survival mode (irregular/fast heartbeat)

 I'm not exactly in the best position to go to a doctor at this moment &amp; I don't have much of an income right now as I was already hospitalized for a week last week and missed some work. 
I'm just worried this might be it for me, I just get this ""feeling"" like I don't have much time left. I don't know what to do except vent here on r/advice. Family has been supportive of me lately but I can't explain to them that I think I might pass away soon without being scolded or criticized. 

I know it's not anxiety because my heart has felt very heavy lately, like there's something stuck inside it. I'm trying to eat as healthy as I can to buy myself some time (drinking a lot of green/herbal teas, as much fruits and vegetables as I can, but like I said I don't have much income. 

TL;DR: I've had 3 recent mini heart attacks this past year, feeling like the last one is right around the corner. I don't have much income as I was hospitalized last week. Feel lost. I'm not afraid of death ,being a Buddhist,  so much as I'm just afraid of leaving behind the people I care about.

I didnt learn from my mistakes of retaking. I should have dropped out then but I didnt Im too scared of my parents they are both top university graduates and hard working theyve spent so much money on me and ive let them down and im in so much debt. 

I really struggled throughout the year with anxiety and depression and I tried to run from my problems as they all stacked up drowning me. I was too scared to tell anyone about how i felt and im going to have tell everyone when i get home.

I failed the year again. Im getting kicked out. I don't know what to do how to tell them or what im gonna do as a job with no qualifications. Im 21 so i guess too old for apprenticeships. Im tempted to join the army as an officer if possible as ive always been interested in it and i think i'd enjoy it. 

After a few years of that though could i go back to uni would anyone let me in with bad grades would it be worth it? 

Don't know what to do next year either. Would be depressing being at home with parents constantly on my case with no friends around but equally so being at my house lined up for uni next year with all my best mates the only one not in the uni.

I need to face up to everything and could do with advice on what I can do as a job with my current situation. 

It feels horrible being kicked out but also like  burden has been lifted as I hated my course so much. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2017,9

140,"Hello lovely people of Reddit. I'm sorry if this is on the wrong thread but I would like some advice. 

I made some couscous last night for my partners lunch, and as I made quite a lot popped it in a plastic tub in the fridge. For a change I added some onion, tomato and peppers (I wonder if these were the issue?). All very normal. I've gone to have some of the leftover couscous for lunch and found it to be mouldy! My partner has never told me his lunch has been mouldy so I don't understand what I've done. Do any of you know why, or have any advice on how to stop my couscous becoming mouldy overnight, it would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: freshly made couscous because mouldy overnight in the fridge! ",14Jun2017,1

Hi Folks,

I'm a tad overwhelmed here, any input would be appreciated. A year ago I had a terrible falling out with my then partner I was living with, it resulted in being almost homeless and my sister, Kate, and her partner, Pete,  offered to let me stay at their home until I was back on my feet.

I took them up on the offer, 99% of my belongings were in storage and I kept the bare minimum at there house. I kept out of their way as much as possible, paid rent on time and always went out of my way to buy shared things such as toilet paper etc. Three months turned into six, which turned into ten. For my entire stay they both constantly mentioned they loved having me there and did not want me to leave. I stupidly believed this.

My sister and I have never been close. She is not someone to ask about my day, or want to know anything about my life. I've often tried to include her in what I do, but no matter how often I might explain an aspect of my life (career, friends,  etc) she would never listen. It's very odd to say, however we are close in the sense that we are blood family....but if we were not then we would not be friends at all.

She is very, very verbally abusive to her partner and also has dependancies on alcohol. My family (brother, mother) have often tried to help and she has also been to many therapists however is in clear denial about her addiction. This is important to mention as every weekend she would become very sullen and drunk, she would then verbally abuse her partner. I was often home when this occurred and would be locked away not wanting to get involved.

Often times I would be involved. She would barge into my room and demand I talk to her, or corner me as I come home from work and not allow me to take a break talking at me to even put my purse down.  I say talking at me as that's what it was, always very one sided rants about arts and politics as if I were her personal counsellor. If I tried to imitate a two way conversation, or even attempt to change the subject  to something less confronting, she would become visibly agitated. It got to a point where I felt like she only liked having me around because I was someone who would sit and listen to her.

By the tenth month mark of living there I had been drunkenly confronted at least once per month, and overheard many fights. I had my own personal issues to work through, namely I had many anxiety attacks over my job at the time - this was never evident to my family and not something I'd speak about to my sister, it was my excuse at the time for distracting myself from looking for other places to live.

The final breaking point was almost a month ago. My sister barrelled into my room in the middle of the night while I was asleep. She was drunk and clearly erratic. I spent close to four or five hours listening to her tell me things she hated about me as a person, claims that I was embarrassed of living with her in their suburb, and countless rants about how pathetic her partner was. She spent the night going back and forth between abusing the two of us. He was there and trying to stop her, calm her down. They have been together for nearly 20 years. The point where I  burst into tears was when she pointed her finger at me and screamed 'congratulations, you're the reason Peter and I are breaking up!'. This is simply beyond absurd and was one Of The most heart wrenching things I have ever heard.

That night I said I was moving out and would begin packing the next day. And I did. I spent the next few days packing before and after work. I had not seen my sister since that night. She walked out and stayed at a hotel the next few days. Peter asked how I was and gave me updates on her. It's now three days later and I am purposely coming back very late go avoid seeing them because I just don't know what to do. I Am home when they're asleep, gone before they're awake. 

Five days later I'm moving my final boxes into my car and my sister storms into the house. I'm terrified. I don't know how to talk about this. I was also a little annoyed that she hasn't wanted to talk to me considering what had been said and how she acted. I walk out of my room and see her and say Hi. She rolls her eyes and groans. I just stood there stupidly not knowing How To react.

Several minutes later she screams out that I Am being passive aggressive by my actions. By moving my things. By how I said hi. Peter comes in and questions what I'm doing, If I'm moving and when I was going to tell them. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. I explained how on that night it was agreed that I would be leaving by the end Of The week. My sister then went on an aggressive rant telling me how emotionally stunted I am as I don't have the ability to show emotions. She kept trying to pressure me to become angry. I asked if she was going to talk about what had happened, however she said that she had a mental break down and that's what I needed to accept by living there.

There was one thing that really stood out for me. Im really not one to sit there and argue pointlessly, she wanted her way and I had no energy to argue otherwise. She mentioned she didn't want me to leave her house and then for the next family Christmas to be an awkward event for her the next time we see eachother. She has an immense hatred for family occasions, clearly due to the resentment she brings, but it really drilled home for me how she doesn't see us as being sisters. Or friends. Or any aspect of a family other than the label. To see eachother once a year, when you're obliged to. There was also no concern for how I felt.

It's been almost a month now. I'm in a new home by myself. My brother and mother know the truth, however have not said anything to her. They have both been very supportive. They're aware of what she is like....just...i don't think they knew how full on it was.

I've not heard from my sister once. Granted I have also not messaged her. Today Peter messaged me and asked for the final month of rent, that was all.

I'm trying hard not to be angry, because I can't control any of this, but it's hard to not be resentful toward them for what has happened and how it's been handled. It makes me feel like they don't even consider me to be a person. And to be honest, I do not want anything more to do with either of them however it would make it impossible at family things as my extended family is tiny. It would crush my mum.

I really don't know how to approach this, or even if I should. I just feel really lost.

143,"Good day. 
Precursor: my girlfriend, her sister and I, we run a small rescue center for dogs in South East Asia, dogs here are sold for meat on a daily basis. About one year ago, we rescued a female dog without knowing that she was pregnant. She gave birth to 5 puppies and then one day she got out of the house and never came back although we tried our best to find her. We assumed that she was abducted and killed for meat so we set up a grave and promised her that we will take care of her pups. 
Yesterday, on a daily routine, my girlfriend and her sister took one of the five pups out for a ride on her small scooter. On the way back, they were hit by a drunk bastard and that pup got scared and ran away. She tried her best to go after him but words on the street say the dog has been abducted by 2 guys as well. 
Today we took a leave from our job, my girl teaches English, her sister and I both work as office clerk, to go find our dog. We tried everything, we go to each slaughterhouse and ask. Nothing came up. I was able to hold it together pretty well at first but as nothing turns up I was visibly shaken and I was out of focus very fast. Needless to say my girlfriend cried like there is no tomorrow. 
What makes me so shaken is why both times we lost our dogs I always have the impression that everything has been set in place, they were abducted so fast we could not react at all. One blink of an eye and they are gone. 
The other thing that shakes me so much is the fact that I as a firm believer in Cause and Effect do not understand why we have to endure this much accidents when all we try to do is help make this world a better place. I know life is not fair but I am out of breath over the fact that we, whom I can assume are in a common sense, good people, must endure that much. 
I really need some help to get me calm again, I am seriously considering going on a killing spree with my gun at every slaughterhouse I know. The feeling of useless is killing me. ",14Jun2017,3
144,"Okay so i've been working under him for 6ish months. I hate my job, but i've never told anyone that. I'm not going to lie, i'm young (20) and the best he's had in this position in two years. I've fixed months of issues in a month or two from the last girl who was in my position (he fired her cus she sucked at the job). He's an older guy (in his early 40s, but looks like he's 50). With in the first few months he's managed to get with my sister (she's in her late 20s) they are dating now. Btw he's going through the early stages of a nasty divorce. I've lost a lot of respect for him since he's been with my sister, living with us and from some of the acting out i've seen him do, especially the way he'a handled drunk arguments with my sister (she once crawled into bed with me and started crying cus she though they where over). that night i sent him a text saying she loved him and that she was only trying to be there for him, and he sent me nasty texts back telling me to stay in my place, don't ""mix work with personal"" and that he demanded respect (he was a real douche). 

Anyway today he asked me to do something this morning, and than a co-worker asked me to do something right after, so i was a bit confused. I came back and my boss was like ""no thats not what i wanted"" and i looked at him and then looked at my  co-worker across the table they where at (there was about 6 or so guys at that table) and than back at my boss and said i'm sorry and i was confused with what my co-worker ask me to do and left to fix it.  My boss walked up to me at my desk and was like ""insert my name"" and i was like ""what?"" (Definitely not in a rude tone, more like if i was to say ""yes?"") and turned to look at him and before i could he was like ""NO TURN AND LOOK AT ME"" he didn't yell, just said it real rude. he was totally irritated and i was caught off guard and looked at him anyway. He than said something about this not like being at home and that this is work and to ""NEVER ROLL MY EYES AT ME AGAIN.""   i was all like ??????? ""I'm sorry that was not my intention"".  

I know i didn't roll my eyes at him and i'm too tired in the morning to have energy to argue with anyone especially my boss. 

Was it my fault? Was it a miscommunication? I know i didn't roll my eyes at him.  ",14Jun2017,2
146,"Hi Advice,

I have a roommate whom is behind in bills (£400 Roughly) i have covered these bills that include council tax, electricity and utilities like internet. And I keep records of all payments I and he have made.

I am unhappy with the time it is taking for him to repay this bill and have given him 6 months to pay this back. 4 months have past and yet the bill remains hardly touched.

My roommate is currently unemployed and by my records for the last few months has not paid that months bills let alone the debt.

electricity £20 each
his council tax £13 (Water and sewerage)
Internet £20
Phone £10

£63 per months 

Not including food he buys this himself. He is currently claiming dole not sure as to how much this is per week

I have offered to help him budget and understand if he has to miss a payment due to emergency's but nothing has happened to this effect

I have taken steps to persuade him to take this debt more seriously by restricting internet access stopping access from 12am to 12pm. due to his reduced time allotted for internet to half I have said I will be reducing his bill to half so it will be £10 per month.

Is this a crappy thing to do is it unreasonable?
I just feel like i am the bad guy for having to do all this.

148,"So, I'm turning 27 in a few weeks, and a lot of certainty I had about the world when I was younger is going away.

-I used to dream about creating tech startups and getting rich. Later this evolved into getting rich so that I could get girls to date me. Now I realize that the startup environment tends to be quite superficial and extremely predatory.

-I used to believe that a perfect political system could be achieved. Now I'm a cranky cynic.

-I used to believe that you could follow your dreams and you'd do fine. Then the Recession intervened.

-I used to believe in true love. Recent events of a romantic nature, one of which involved a woman choosing a more traditionally masculine man over me, have persuaded me otherwise.

I've become progressively more disillusioned with stuff that I used to hold dear, especially as I've marched toward 30. I really can't tell myself that I'm the same person I was when I was 20, when I actually thought the aforementioned bullshit was true or worthwhile.

I have been working for a company nearly 10 years now. I have a great relationship with the owner, and am currently running operations for his original business in a separate location from him. Over the last year or so, we have been discussing a joint venture between myself, him, and one other person. As of three weeks ago, we were in the ""lets look into this"" stage, and nothing was concrete yet. 

Last Monday my family and I returned from a two week vacation, where we had discussed how things were going, and the possibility of moving closer to my wife's family. At the end of those two weeks, we decided it was best for us to make the change. When I returned to work on Monday, I found out my boss had signed a lease on a space for the above mentioned joint venture, and among other things, had essentially given the go ahead on quite a bit of equipment without any real research into the business and it's viability.

Here is my question. I have a meeting with him today, and at this point, I know my family and I are moving, but I don't know if it will be in a month or three months. Do I tell my boss I am planning on leaving, or do I keep it to myself until details are more concrete and keep going with work like everything is normal?

Since this is a group interview (with several HR non-experts), I need to ask some non-technical, ""friendly"" questions that have no safe answer.

My girlfriend says she is completely okay with me playing games, but every time I even go anywhere near one, she acts as if she is mad.

One time it was a snow storm in the middle of winter. We couldn't leave the house, all the stores were closed, and we couldn't drive anywhere. So, staying home, I decided to just play a game that I hadn't played yet. Not more than five minutes in, I receive a text from her. She's sitting on the bed behind me and the text says ""are you done yet?"", and she appeared to be extremely unhappy about me playing a game.

I ask if I was doing something wrong, or if I shouldn't be playing games. She has a very passive aggressive attitude about it. She would say ""it's fine, if you _want_ to play games go ahead"". After probing about what's wrong, she seems to resent that I am paying attention to the game and not her. I did not even get past the opening cinematic, or even start playing for that matter. 

This continued to happen. I would be in a overwatch ranked match and not want to leave. She would call and I would text her that I will call her back in 10 minutes because I am busy. I would then see her log on to battlenet and log off a second after. When I called back in 10 minutes, she still had that passive aggressive vibe like she was angry that I wanted to do something more than pay attention to her.

Recently, I've been getting more uncomfortable with the idea that I'm living in a 1950's movie.

EDIT: Some additional info:

- I have hobbies of my own and have reiterated as such to him. I'd appreciate it if people stop telling me to get a hobby--that's not the issue here

186,"As I've been unemployed with pretty much no savings and about $30 total left in my account, this was a predicament I thought I would dream of having, but I'm feeling really stressed and conflicted right now. I am waiting on one of the offers, but I'm pretty sure I'll get it as I think i'm one of the only ones interviewing and my interviews went fairly well, although now I'm almost hoping I won't get it just so I don't have to make this decision.

If it helps, I'm 24, currently trying to decide what I really want my career path to be, and considering going back to grad school in the near future for a language that I studied in undergrad and looking into going into translation. But unsure as of now.

Job 1: administrative role within an architectural firm. I would take care of some basic admin stuff but they want the role to have plenty of room to grow (it's a new role). I would be able to learn about other aspects of the firm if I want to; marketing, software development, etc. If I can find a niche and there's a need, I'll be able to move up; all of their admins in other offices have gone on to work in different areas of the firm. $40k salary, decent benefits, I liked the people I interviewed with, seems like a creative culture (they loved my creative background). Flex hours and once a month company ""outings."" They loved me, and I received an offer as soon as I returned from my second interview with them today.

Job 2: paid internship, would only be about $14.50 an hour, so I would probably work a weekend job as well to pay my loans and rent. Fun office culture (one of my friends interns there), I liked the women I interviewed with. Internship lasts until December. I would get to practice French, another language I have learned and used to be fluent in (I now consider myself professionally proficient). I would love to practice my translation. It's a small non-profit with a mission I am fairly passionate about and I would be helping people around the world. Because it's small there's not much room for advancement so I would probably be searching for another job again come December. This job falls more into my predicted career path. Would sound more prestigious while looking for future jobs, most likely. 

I'm still waiting on the internship offer but now I'm almost hoping they don't offer it to me so that I don't have to make this decision even though it was the position I really wanted in the first place!

I hate saying no to things and I hate making decisions so this decision is stressing me out to the point of feeling sick. I'm so desperate for money that I'm leaning towards job 1 but I want to finally have something on my resume that's relevant to what I want to do in the future. ",14Jun2017,1

191,"I'm three semesters away from graduating with a BS in Chemistry, but I'm interested in switching over to a field in engineering (either Biomedical or Mechanical). In that time, I can take additional courses towards engineering while completing my BS in Chemistry, such as Statics, Dynamics, Differential Equations, and a couple more. 

I'm very unsure about the course of my future, but the more time I put into researching engineering the more I feel like that will be my ultimate goal. It might sound dumb (and I might need somebody to tell me it's dumb), but should I stop my current degree plan now and jump into engineering or should I finish my BS in Chem and pursue engineering afterwards? I'll be roughly 22 by the time I finish my BS in Chem, and based on what I'll have done by the time I graduate, I don't see my pursuit of a BS in engineering (Biomed or Mechanical) taking beyond 4 semesters.

I suck at small talk, and I constantly feel pressured. I feel like I'm not doing my job very well.

201,"I'm nearing the end of my degree and am due to graduate in December but I'm thinking of splitting the two units I have left over two semesters and graduating in August instead. The only real reason I want to do this is so I can stay on my uni's cheerleading team for an extra year. I've made up a lot of excuses as to why I want to do it, mainly that the career I want to go into requires that I have my full licence and a car, and it would take me about a year and a half to get a full licence so the extra semester wouldn't have an impact of me getting a job. It also won't cost me any money to do, and splitting the workload would also be nice, even if I am easily able to manage taking both unit at once.

The only problem I'm really having is it seems silly to extend my degree just because I want to keep doing cheer, and due to my university messing up my enrolment last year if I do graduate in December I'm already graduating a year late.

207,"Hello, and thank you for reading. I'd like to warn that this post may be triggering to some.

I (26F) made a new friend (29M) back in March of this year, and we get along really well. He reminds me of a friend I lost a couple years back, so we've been hanging out about once a week. We talk often as well. I have a boyfriend (30M) of 4 years who knows all about our friendship.

One of my close girlfriends (26F) saw a tweet this weekend that she decided to investigate, and the woman who posted it implies that my new friend seriously violated her in the past. I am not sure when this happened or what any of the details are. I don't know this girl very well, but I have seen her around a couple of times before, and we are always cordial to one another. My girlfriend who investigated, while I love her to death, has been known to involve herself in the business of others. So when she asked the girl about her post, that girl confirmed that she was talking about my friend, and that what she posted was absolutely true.

I feel torn because of course I do not want to believe that someone I call a friend could be capable of such a thing. However I also don't want to do or say anything that could be perceived as me trying to discredit this girl for coming forward about such a serious and traumatic experience. I know how rare false accusations really are. My bf suggested that I ""ghost"" my new friend, but he and I have talked about how much it sucks to get ghosted, so I feel that I'd be confronted for even trying, and I'm not the most confrontational person. 

Of course my girlfriend and my bf don't want me to hang out with my new friend anymore, and I understand that. They both say it's early enough in the friendship that I can cut ties easily. It's just hard for me to determine if I should confront my friend and let him say his side, and how to even go about doing that. I feel totally out of my element with this, and I want to be fair but also respect the girl who made the claim.

209,"A couple weeks ago, I had friends over to my apartment to pregame before going out to the bars. I live with one roommate, who I met through the friends I was having over. They have known each other for years, as they all went to college together and are all very close friends. I have known these people for a little over a year now, but not nearly as long as my roommate has known them. So, back to the situation. They came over and wanted to smoke, they had something to smoke, but didn't have anything to smoke out of. I don't smoke so I didn't have anything to offer them, my roommate however, does smoke. So these friends decided they would enter her room to look, but her bedroom door was locked. I stated I wasn't comfortable with the situation and wasn't getting involved. My roommates best friend was there and I asked her what to do and she stated let them go, you're not doing anything wrong and I can vouch if something happens. So they proceed to go into her room, look around, but found nothing. They ended up not smoking, and the situation was forgotten about. Fast forward about two weeks later, my roommate is acting very strange around me, doing super petty things, and I finally confront her and ask her what is going on. She proceeds to tell me that she knows two of our friends went into her room without her permission, unlocking the door, and going through her things and she doesn't feel safe living with me any longer since I can't control people when they come over to our apartment. I also lied to her by omission of not telling her about the situation. I explained I had nothing to do with the situation, I didn't feel comfortable with them doing it, but I also didn't go into her room and go through her things. I even stated that her best friend was there, and she didn't say anything to her about the situation, but the roommate responded by saying her best friend doesn't live there and it wasn't her responsibility to stop her other friends from going into her room. I apologized, stating I should have handled the situation differently and I'm sorry. I also kept reminding her that I didn't go into her room and go through her stuff, not invading her privacy, but that didn't seem to matter. I am now untrustworthy, a liar, a liability to live with, and she feels unsafe living with me since I cannot be trusted. It has made our already uncomfortable living situation with one another even worse. I understand she feels like her private space was invaded, but she still continues to hang out and be friends with all the people who were at the apartment that night, including the two friends who went into her room, but I'm the one in the wrong in this situation and she is no longer nice or civil to me. She's rude, has made my life a living hell, and I literally can't live with her anymore because it has gotten so bad. She doesn’t clean up the kitchen when she’s done cooking, the stove top is always greasy and disgusting when I go to use it. I literally need to clean before I start cooking and then clean after. I’m living in a city where were are currently going through a heat wave and she continues to turn the air off or up whenever I turn it on (we are talking 90+ degree days here). It’s literally a constant battle trying to keep the AC on in our third floor apartment. She continues to lock my cat in my bedroom when she is at the apartment, even though the cat roaming around never bothered her before this incident. She started using my food, trash bags, and drink ware, which we agreed to keep separate since that’s how she prefers to live, and comes up with shitty excuses for why she couldn’t use her own. However, her things are still off limit for me to use. She won’t clean the apartment since the swifter and vacuum are both mine, and she won’t touch them. She wont use the dishwasher, and leaves her dishes piled in the sink and when she washes them, she won’t use the dish drainer (which as you can guess is mine), she puts her wet dishes on the bare counter, getting water everywhere, taking up counter space she doesn’t really need to take up in the first place. One day I came into the kitchen to make coffee and the coffee makers were gone, both the regular and Keurig, since they are hers and off limits to me to use, even though I supplied my own coffee and k-cups. We no longer have a TV in the living room, because it came from her and I am no longer able to use it. There’s many more things I could list, but the cherry on top of the pie is that she suspended the Comcast account for our apartment, but since it’s only suspended and not canceled, I cannot make another account for the address of the apartment, leaving the apartment without internet or cable. I am apartment hunting as I write this, because my willingness to not give a fuck has been broken. 

So I’ve done a lot of thinking about this situation and I understand that if the tables were turned, I might be upset too. However, if it was two of my best friends who went into my room, looking for something, I wouldn't be too pissed off. As long as they didn't break anything, steal anything, etc., they are ultimately my best friends and I would just laugh it off and be like next time just let me know. I wouldn't freak out at my roommate, putting the blame of my friends going into my room on her. So I guess what I'm asking is that am I the minority in feeling that my roommate shouldn't be putting all the blame of this situation on me, especially since I didn't go into her room or open her door, go through her things, etc.? Or is she totally valid in blaming me for letting this happen, and not put the blame on her friends. Should be treating me like the scum of the earth, and treat the people who went into her room no differently than she had before? Thanks in advance for your opinions. 

TLDR; Best friends of my current roommate went into her room looking for something while she wasn't home, but I was at the apartment. Roommate is putting all the blame of this situation on me, instead of the people who went into her room, since I am the one who lives there and they don't. She is still friends with the people who went into her room, but no longer wants to be friends with me since I can't be trusted and ""I am a liar"".",14Jun2017,2

My mother was a narcissist, and I still hold ill feelings towards her for the awfully neglectful and abusive physically/mentally childhood she put me though. I was also exposed to sexual abuse, due to her actions, on more than one occasion. However, I am working on building up my spirituality, and as such reducing my karma and forgiving, and seeking forgiveness so that I may grow and move on within my life. I may not have completely forgiven her yet, but that is beside that case. Anyway, for two and a half years she kicked me out over and over, until finally i decided to stay with my grandmother. I kept going back as I felt indebted to care for my sisters, among many other reasons, but as a young adult I am now striving to create a life for myself. I cannot say I was a perfect daughter, I was very good though we did argue often because she had a lot of negative feelings toward me, for what I assume was telling her what I thought was wrong about her actions, and among other things like my feelings of needing to protect my siblings. Anyways, this thursday she wants me to come with her to sign some papers for her section 8 and food stamp people, to move myself out. However, she had been reaping the advantages of this government funding and not helping me for almost 2 years, even when i was at the point of starvation (Until I found a job, and even then supporting myself on almost nothing was very difficult.)

&gt; Dude is still a virgin, not just this but, while observing his activity on YT, he bashed like 6 girls calling them whores. 

&gt; He no joke talks like Hannibal Lector, 

&gt; I follow him on Instagram, and all of his posts are self depricating posts, he talks abour how his life sucks, and many of them have suicidal undertones 

Anyone wanna contribute some dank ass questions?

225,"My grandparents have a lot of issues. For one they have cut themselves away from friends and relatives due to my grandmother's superiority complex. There is also the issue that they care a lot of what neighbors and the ""people"" will think of our actions and subsequently their actions.

My grandparents are my father's parents. My parents have been divorced for about 10 years. My mother's parents live in a different country. My father rarely sees us except when we are at our grandparents' . 

Even then, he doesn't *really* treat us as his children. There is some psychological abuse, especially during exams and the beginning of a new year. He also barely pays alimony. He ought to pay 300eu for each child ( we are 3 ) that gets increased by 10% every 2 years. This amounts to 1500eu monthly, he pays 600eu.

My grandparents know that he doesn't pay, they know that he cheated on my mother 3 times and had 2 babies. 

My grandparents, despite the way my father has treated my mother, my siblings and i , still give excuses for his behavior and become blind anytime the subject of his abuse comes up. It is understandable though, he is their child after all, 1 of the 2 that are alive. My grandparents like to think that they help us. 

In all of that ""help"" there is a lot of yelling, shouting, lack of basic privacy. They need to know everything that is going on, otherwise, all hell breaks lose. 

My mother is always on the receiving end of all this chaos. They either indirectly or through us.

My brother was almost beat because he replied ""I dont know so i can't answer"" on something my grandfather asked trying to find dirt to shit talk my mother.

I mentioned that there is lack of privacy, when i was working out, i had bought creatine which i left at a room in my grandparents', i was to start working out again and when i looked for my stuff, they were all gone. Somebody emptied them into the trash for whatever reason they justified. When i was dating my ex, they found the condoms i had stashed inside bags inside other bags and trashed them. There were times they tried to spy on me to see where i was going out for coffee. My grandfather was complaining that i shouldn't go to the gym because i will get raped (I am a 2m tall dude).

I am a university undergraduate. I am on my second year. I found an internship in a university institution with a manager that finished the university i am attending with a gpa of 3.9 and has a lot of publications and is working with the professor i want to supervise my thesis. The manager said that the internship might end up as permanent job while i am doing my studies. I am working on machine learning and cognitive software.My manager said that i could work anywhere i desired and at the times i desired as long as i met the deadlines.

My grandparents have issues with my work and were arguing with my mother about what kind of job is that and why am i going to the mall or anywhere to work besides an office or my home.

My grandparents find the tiniest thing to lash onto my mother and my siblings.

What can i do to deal with this?What can i do so that my grandparents don't lash onto my mother and siblings and start giving me and my mother some respect - which we have rightfully earned? My mother is finishing her second phd in machine learning and i am one of the most distinguished students in my class. My grandparents have highschool education and my grandfather was a teacher that got to a Principal 20 years ago.

For  clarification, we don't live with my grandparents, we live with mom.

I want to own my own business, not work a meaningless job that i don't even care about in a cubical for my whole life. I don't want to go to college and spend my life paying back debt.

I want to be like liz in eat pray love and just travel for a while, and relax for a second and figure myself out. I just want to enjoy life for once and do the things i like! Like learning a new language. Does this sound ridiculous? 

I want to move to British Columbia where people i care about are and buy a tiny home on the beach, my forever home and just feel settled for once! 

Idk what i'm asking, all i want is advice. Have you ever tried following your dreams? What happens when you do? what do you want to do? what do you think i should do? all i want to do is just go even tho i have only a little bit of money. i'll be never be able to do it unless i at least try right?

229,"I'm a 17 year old girl and all throughout school I've been made to feel like an outsider. Sometimes it's because of how I look, because I'm not photogenic, because sometimes I'm too loud, because I've never had a boyfriend, because I'm a virgin, because I dress weirdly/unfashionably or because I'm bi. 

It's gotten to points where once on a school trip all the girls in my room spread a rumour that I fingered myself. Obviously not true, but people believed them anyway and it took months for them to forget.

In a years time I'll be leaving school. I feel like I want to die. I am scared to hurt myself- but I'm terrified life will always be lonely for me.

238,"I feel like I'm abusing this subreddit, but this advice isn't a huge deal.

Matched with a girl on Tinder. We talk a bit, she tells me to add her on Facebook if I want to keep chatting. Chat a bit, she reveals the swipe was a mistake but she kept talking because it would have been rude not to or something. She's already planning on going away with a potential boyfriend*, and I'm happy for her.

If I decide to keep talking to her on Facebook it would just be as friends. That's cool, we have similar music tastes. But honestly, I'm just very physically attracted to her. I'm not going to say I'm in love with her, because that's clearly not true. But I did swipe right on her for a reason, and now I'm not sure if I should remove her. I just feel like this physical attraction is a bit bad for a common friendship, especially if she has a boyfriend on the way.

What do I do? If I remove her, do I explain why or do I just do it? If I explain why, how do I do that without coming off as creepy or mean? I can't tell her it's because I'm attracted to her. I don't know her, that would just seem really weird to say to a stranger.

It's also just a Tinder match, so it's not like I have to respect this friendship an unnatural amount.
 
* Edit: She's already from another country, she's going to yet another one. 

Edit 2: I already pointed out to her that I'd not joke about dating, because obviously that's not going to happen. I feel weird sending a second or third message, it feels way too serious and needy.

Me and a bunch of friends are going on a vacation, was a nice plan.
Suddenly my friends invite a person i am (mediocar) friends with, the problem is is that he is EXTREMELY pressing and can be a very tiring person to be around.
I asked one of my friends (the main organiser) why they didn't ask me if i agreed with this, they said they forgot to and apologised.
I then ask if he was already 100% in, luckily he wasn't.
So my friend told him that there was no room for him anymore.
My friend couldn't hold that fact to himself so he told another friend, that friend got really mad at me and said i was a bitch for talking to the organiser behind their backs. (while they invited the other guy without consulting me in any way)

248,"Title says it all. I was the kid who had EVERYTHING going for him growing up. Literally had it all. The best mates, the confidence, everything. 
Then I had a 4 year relationship as a teen which in hindsight clearly was a lie to both of us. She decides to end it 2 weeks after saying how she wants to be with me forever. It then all clicked how she never really gave a fuck about me to begin with and how much of a fool I had just been taken for. 
This hit me like an absolute bombshell and I realised I was not happy with any other aspect of my life. I realised I shot my entire life in the foot going out with her - as I said I had everything going for me before that relationship. - Either that Or I just sucked at being a boyfriend as I was young. 

I just start getting myself together and I fail to get into uni. 
Then the next year my parents are in and out of hospital and the year another uncle died - The third to die in 4 years. 

My life is hitting me hard how it is not going anywhere - My parents are old as fuck. Im getting shit job after shit job and before I know it my social life has fallen apart. I can't afford to move out no matter what job I get and I have lost my mind living at home. 

Having old parents conflicted the fuck out of me and I would of lived 100%  differently if they were younger. 

I realise now most of this last 10 years I have been living out of fear of my dad dying and that fear has influenced my decisions more then I like to admit. 

Im 100% nothing like myself these days and felt more like a man when I was 13-14 

I've gone from being the guy who had it all and influencing everyone around me for the better - someone others looked to - to quite honestly a fucking mess. 

I stay in my home all day because I have lost direction with everything, I have lost purpose. I feel I have slowly gone off track with myself but no matter what I do I can't find my way back and I am just looking for myself in everyone and everything else. 

Its honestly a scary place to be in. I used to be so grounded. So secure. So confident. But bit by bit it has all fallen apart this last 10 years - I know I fucked up but I don't know what to do. I can't turn the clocks back and I can't seem to go forward - I have become the toxic person who is a drain to be around - the kind I used to avoid. 

I hate being this way as I know I'm having a negative affect on everyone I come in contact with. I just don't know what to do about it.

Alright, cool, I'm hired as a chatty waitress right? Wrong. 
This is a fast food restaurant, but not burger king trashy. Think chik fil a or Zaxbys and whatnot. No waitresses, you order at a cash register. 

All I can imagine is being sent out to talk to guests who ordered fast food Not to be talked to. If a staff member of Mcdonalds came up and said hey, most people would nudge em away with small talk.

251,"I have a not terribly close friend whom I used to work with who has been on the verge of eviction for a year. He is an engineer (has the degree) who has been out of work for a decade. In the past few years he has applied for dozens of jobs and landed none of them. I haven't actually talked to him years, but email him a couple times a month and it seems like he is coming a bit unhinged and maybe this is why he can't get work. He's about 55 years old...

I have sent him money on occasion, though never been asked even once. Just trying to make sure he can eat and get by. 
But now the problem is more serious as he is gonna be without a roof here soon. He lives in Hells Acres. Muy Caliente!

I could set him up with a one time hand up - I mean, if he had a job and needed first/last months rent I could hook it up. But it is not feasible for me to support him full time. And I guess I could have him live with us, but that seems like a really shitty idea. Of course, him being homeless is a shitty idea too.

The idea I like the best, and I have mentioned this to him, is for him to sell his ~10K SUV and get an RV or van and live in it. Not in a campground, but like stealth urban living. He could probably scrape by on less than a grand a month that way and I know that a few of us who care about him would be fine with kicking him down enough to keep that lifestyle afloat, esp if he could do some off jobs and such to help.

I am seriously worried about him being exposed to hot and cold and dry and wet and not having phone/internet/basic $/BP meds/etc.

It is basically customer support but I do other stuff as well such as handling US customer financial requests, external tickets booking, transportation issues consulting, as well as aiding them should any unpredictable situation occur (e.g.: if their client doesn't like a hotel we have booked for them, and would like to book another one, etc.). Primary part of my duties is going to be assisting them with processing advance payments from their clients for arranging a tour. The last part is what is concerning me.

255,"So this started last week. Lets call this girl... Taylor. Taylor and I have been dating for 2 and a half years. Basically everyone has told me to dump her for the longest time. Everyone says that she takes advantage of me.

&amp;nbsp;

I can really agree with everybody. She lives with me rent free, I always buy everything, I always cook, I always clean. It's not that I am wanting Taylor to do everything, but something would be nice. Recently she started cleaning. She did some dishes. That is all she has done for these last 2 and a half years. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been happy taking care of her these last few years. I don't really mind doing everything, but the fact is when I get done working a super long shift I want to be able to come home and talk to someone who is going to listen to me. Someone who I can fucking talk to. She doesn't even listen. She doesn't even really fucking talk. 

&amp;nbsp;

We used to be really close. We did everything together and we ALWAYS wanted to be together. We met at a pizza place, and afterwards we would just clock off, get in my car, but the top down, and listen to music and just stare at the stars. I still try to do that with her, but she always seems to be preoccupied.

&amp;nbsp;

Well with any relationship we fight and everything. I get angry but she does to. We both pull our shit but always come back to each other. I am not sure that it is going to go that way anymore. She stopped taking photos with me and even mentioning that she is in a relationship. She has been hanging out with her friend (girl) that she is so close to. 

&amp;nbsp;

I let her have her space with her friend, but as always she has me drive her everywhere. Thing is, my car is not what it used to be. It is falling apart. Her car is fine, and she has a shit load of money, but never spends any of it on me. She does... but rarely. Again recently, she has been on summer break. Taylor wants to have fun. I understand that. What she is doing though... I think is wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we smoke weed. Mostly we do it together. Lately she has been smoking a shit load of weed. Usually we just smoke once or twice a week. Then we watch something funny. Its become routine... and I guess that is the problem. Anyway her and her friend have been going to the skate park and hanging out with a really uncomfortable amount of guys. They would never tell me where they were at, and it would freak me out. Theres been a lot of shit going on in our city, and I just want to make sure that she is safe, and not cheating on me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I finally had enough last week and decided to go for a bike ride and see what was going on. The skate park is right next to my house so its not really like I was spying. Well she was as I imagined, the most popular girl at the skate park. Then it started happening. She was staying out till 7 in the morning when she works at 8. She would come home smelling like booze and pot but would never tell me how her night was or who she was with or what she was doing. 

&amp;nsbp;

She assured me that she is not cheating... and I can believe her. I know her disposition on people that cheat... and its not really that good. She almost disowned her dad earlier this year because he was caught going out to bars and staying in hotel rooms with one of his coworkers and making his wife worry sick. 

&amp;nbsp;

We finally talked about it. She told me that she just needs her space and she is not seeing anyone else and that she is safe but she just needs space. Okay... I can understand that. Then it got worse. She started hiding her phone from me. If I even remotely touch her phone she freaks the fuck out. She then started sitting across the room so I couldn't see what she was doing on her phone. 

&amp;nbsp;

One day I had enough. This was Saturday.  She came home from work and I asked if she had any plans. She told me no. Then we were very minimal about talking. She went to the bathroom to take a shower and closed and locked the door. She never does that. She never even closes the bathroom door no matter what she is doing. Its kind of gross but funny and cute. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know it sounds like we have a really bad relationship, but we have amazing moments that I would not trade for anything in the world. Getting back to what I was saying. She gets out of the shower and I ask... ""Hey can I see your phone?"". She freaks out and starts yelling at me immediately about how she doesnt need to show me her phone and that she already told me she just needs her space. I tried telling her ""Well you live in my apartment and you are being sketchy and not showing me your phone... I mean I literally never in our two years of dating have asked to see your phone"". Well she ignored me and went back to the bathroom and locked herself in there again. 

&amp;nbsp;

I went to the bathroom door after 30 minutes and apologized and told her that I just want to make sure that we are good and that she was not seeing anybody else. She told me that that wouldnt be fair to me and I do so much for her and she would never string me along like that. She also said that she was venting about me to her friend and thats why she wanted to not give me her phone. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can understand that. I had to get out of the house tho. So later that day I come home after being with my parents (I was sick all week and couldnt even eat food without losing it) and she is on the porch with her girlfriend. I asked to talk to her. Long story short we talked and she said that its her summer and she just needs to have fun. She also told me that she never got to date anybody before me and that she just needs to talk to other people before going further in this relationship. I can respect that. At least she was being honest.

&amp;nbsp;

So we decided that we need our space... and that we were going to take a break. We needed to talk to other people and keep our distance instead of fighting all the time and arguing. Well I thought that was a good idea. Its been so fucking off and on. Shes been hanging out with her friend... doing a shit load of weed that I PAID FOR... and doing whatever she wants. We agreed on one thing though. The break was going to be two weeks long, we were going to talk to other people, but there was to be no intimacy... no sex or anything like that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well we both have been following the rules... However she still lives here. It just sucks... we are busy... I dont want to kick her out... and we dont want to have to pack shit on our days off. So we still live together, but still give space. Well we started hanging out again (only because her friend is busy at work and couldnt hang out). 

&amp;nbsp;

Well we started hanging out again and kind of talking. She had to take a test at the local community college, and didnt know how to get here, and was out of data... So I agreed to take her (after spending 150 bucks on her the day before). I had to stop and get gas on the way there... so I did. Well when I was pumping my gas and watching her in the passenger seat... I noticed that she was holding my phone and reading my messages. Now I was talking to other people, but that was the whole fucking agreement. She cant have her space from me but still have me on a leash. That is not fucking fair. 

&amp;nbsp;

She said that she was pissed that I was talking to someone else and talking shit about her. I was, but there is no way she read that in the 15 seconds that she had my phone. After that I took her to breakfast and coffee before her class started and we talked. She passed her test and I was so proud of her. She cant stop looking at her CNA certificate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Skipping ahead... Ive been really depressed before this even happened. This shit was just making everything worse. Going to last night. I got off work and was texting some girls, while she has been asleep since 3. She woke up and started talking to me. She started getting playful. This shit keeps happening too. She will get really playful and fun and then switch and hate me again for no fucking reason. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well her friend calls her up and she invites her over without even asking me. She was laughing and talking on the phone about the people she has been texting... right in front of me. She hangs up and leans over like she is going to kiss me, and then punched me all cute like. It was confusing. I dont get it. So its hot as fuck and I am just in my underwear, and her friend starts knocking on the door. Then Taylor says ""Oh you better get dressed *name* is here! Then she throws on cloths and answers the door. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now her and her friend go into the bathroom and Taylor starts doing her make up to go hang out with people. Taylor then starts talking about all the guys she has been talking to again and how cool this guy is and how they have been talking about music and shit. This next paragraph is just going to be quotes that I heard. My apartment is a studio and the bathroom is close and she is practically yelling. I eventually turned the tv up to drown them out. Heres some quotes. They are not in order FYI.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh my god so I was talking to *muffled* and we were talking about Cigarettes after sex (a band) and he was telling me this was his favorite song. Oh my god so yeah Sam (me) took me for breakfast and coffee and to my test yesterday and *whispering*... (friend butts in and says yeah yeah i know anyway you were saying) and thats when I passed my class (blah blah blah). Yeah I dont even recognize myself anymore its fucking hilarious. Yeah summer has been treating me great. Yeah they are so fucking hilarious I cant fucking wait. Yeah Im so fucking confused right now I cant even eat anything. Like its depressing being seperated, but I feel like I am doing something right ya know?

&amp;nbsp;

Thats where I stopped listening. I cant fucking take it anymore. It fucking hurts. Just throwing everything that we have done together for the past 2 years away for no fucking reason. She came into the room to get her shoes and he friend waited in the hall. Thats when I told her ""hey that wasnt really fair for me to have to fucking listen to. I know we are supposed to be talking to other people but you dont have to rub some cute guy in my face that likes the same music as you"". She said that she was not doing anything wrong and wasnt even talking loud. I told her that wasnt the fucking point. Anyway she came home at 7 am this morning and started finishing the bong that I left out last night. My stomach was upset so I had to join her in the bathroom to... use the bathroom. Meanwhile I talked to her and packed the bong more for her and cleaned it all out and everything for her, but then I started telling her ""like hey you understood me last night right? That wasnt fair to listen to. If you are going to leave me then I need you to fucking do it or stop doing whatever you are doing because this really isnt fair to me."" and she apologized as best as her stoned ass could, then we went back to bed and slept in. All morning though she was cuddling me and everything after she tried sneaking in after being at god knows whose house and god knows who brought her home. Anyway she had  job interview and had to leave, but she was going to her moms to get some cloths, but started posting shit on Tumblr about bands she likes.

It looks like she took a photo of herself at someones house, but she is wearing an outfit that I have never seen before. Its like a baggy shirt. It doesnt even look like she is wearing pants in the photo. Its rediculous.

Any way. Please tell me someone read that entire thing and tell me what you think. Please be positive. I cant really take much anymore. I have been trying to contact suicide hotlines but I have been waiting in queue for 3 fucking hours. I really just need some fucking advice on what the fuck is going on. Do you think after these two weeks he is going to come back to me? Should I just find someone else? I cant kick her out or dump her at the moment... Im just so confused I cant do this anymore.

I've been wanting to say something to her for a while, but I didn't think she could get pregnant until she posted a faint test strip on fb. 
We are both in our 20s, and I knew her from residential treatment. She is psycho and still behaves terribly. Fighting people, doing drugs, and general unhealthy behaviors like attention seeking and co-dependency.
It's so bad, that she is actually in an assisted living facility. It's basically a nursing home(and yes, she tries to fight the old people there who ""give her attitude"")
She can not hold a job, and for the last 3 years can not get one because locals know her criminal background (Fighting/assault) and know she still fights people.
She already has a child, who lives with her very old and aging mother, and the child is special needs. She spends all her money on tattoos and weed and gourmet vegan foods, and only posts about her kid when she wants attention.
I don't think it's fair to try for another kid when she has her own(hes like 2) that needs her love. The guy she's trying to have a baby with is like 70, and very sickly.

Who she dates is her business, and what she does with her body is her business too, but growing up in residential treatment I personally knew girls who were abandoned, abused, or had shitty homes.

I don't feel right sitting back and not reminding her she should at least have a plan, and that children are not accessories. I want to remind her that so many of our classmates that passed away/killed themselves are in a situation shes *trying* to create for her kid.

The consequences of me saying something will probably have her block me, possibly post mean stuff about me, and she's possibly petty enough to post my fb for others to harass, but she only has my fb. We have a few mutual friends, and if they remove me too that would be fine with me.

I'm wondering if I should sit back, or say something(even in a private message). It just eats away at me that she's not even trying to change or prepare for this kid. I'm fine if you say it's none of my business, but please be kind. It is not easy to seek out advice and stand up.",14Jun2017,1
261,"I have been working since I was 14. The longest stint where I wasn't employed was about a month, maybe a little less, but I was in Police Training so it was for a job but I wasn't getting paid.

Today I woke up and I just felt like ""Why am I still doing this, I feel like I'm walking in circles everyday going nowhere.""

Now I love my job do not get me wrong, there are very few jobs where I get could get paid $37 an hour to watch water meters and do what I want on a computer.

But the problem is I just... I feel like I need more, I want to be able to relax, to be able to do what I want just not on weekends.

During the week, I have to sacrifice sleep sometimes just to make time for me where it's just about me and no one else, family, friends, ect..

I have a little over $300,000 saved in a savings account that cannot be touched unless I sign off on it. Money isn't an issue so I'm not concerned about that at all.

My kids needing expenses isn't an issue, my oldest goes off to college in August, and my youngest goes next year. So it's not like I""m raising young kids here they are about to spread their wings and fly.

I've talk with my wife about it and she said ""Do what you feel is best"". The problem is, when she says that, which she has alot, she means ""I don't think you should do it but you're probably gonna do it anyway"".

I just... I can't make time for me, unless it's weekends and I've been working for 22 years now and it's not like I have nothing to show for it, I have a beautiful house, 3 cars, and alot of nice things, I just feel like I'm stuck and it's really bumming me out.

My future sister in law has just found out she's has a high risk pregnancy, making it not possible for her to make our out-of-country wedding in September.  Dress/suits have been bought, deposits paid, plane tickets purchased etc.  Obviously my fiancee and I are upset she won't be able to make it, because she's an important person in our lives.  My future mother in law, is now saying that my fiancee and I should be postponing our wedding until May, to accommodate her.  

I'm unsure why she's suggested May, considering the baby will be born in January - but when we were first planning our wedding, she was stuck on May as well.  My future sister in law is saying that we need to move forward with our plans, but my mother in law is ambushing us with her desires of a May wedding.  I can tell my fiancee is torn, and I don't know what to do.  I don't think it's fair to ask us to postpone our desire to start a family by 8 months, so his sister can have hers.

265,"These feelings arise from general helplessness and defeatism. I don't feel like my votes even count with the way that United States elections are and my geographical location. Many have stressed the importance of the 2018 midterms to me, but I don't have the mental energy to research candidates. And I don't want to fall into the trap that got us into this mess, that is, voting indiscriminately along party lines.

Something that would help would be some sort of online map-calendar - You select your city and it brings up a schedule of all elections that you are eligible to participate in as a legal citizen of that city, what the candidates for each one is (even the most obscure), what their opinions are, what sort of preparations you would need to take such as registration, and where you could go to do the actual voting.

277,"Last year I was in a 4 month relationship with a guy. Let's call him O. It started late April 2016, ended late July 2016. At first O was really sweet. Complimenting me a lot and such. Then as the relationship continued he started becoming a bit of an asshole. He started constantly picking on my friends even when I told him to knock it off, as well as saying anything he could to get on my nerves. Like that I was a bitch and the dog I was gonna get looked retarded. Generally immature things like that. When I didn't react the way he wanted to him picking on me he would continue to do it to try to get that reaction. He also seemed to a bit sexist. He said that doing the dishes and the laundry is women's work. Whenever he did those things though I brushed it off and minimized it. You know that whole ""blinded by love"" thing. Then one day I was hanging out with him and this other guy (I'll call him K) who I was talking to more than him and I guess he got jealous or something because then he started saying I should date K instead of him and kept telling me to kiss him which of course I didn't do. Then he started completely ignoring me altogether and went off K and wouldn't respond when I asked him why he was acting like that. It made me quite stressed out so I started crying. Later on O started talking to me again and said he was thinking of breaking up with me and that his reaction to me talking to K was my fault. Then K started defending me. K told O that he was making me upset and to stop threatening to break up with me. So O did and me and him stayed together. In the time that followed I even met O's family who were all a far cry from how he was. Very nice people (save for his brother who acted just like him).

Now onto the day before the breakup. I hadn't seen O in two weeks and I had planned to see him the following day. I missed him very much since I hadn't seen him in a while and texted him saying so. He didn't respond. He also had unfriended me on Facebook (which was the only social media we were friends on). I decided to just see how things went when I saw him the next day. Well, when I saw him he was with his brother and the first thing he said to me after I hugged him and said hi was ""I don't want to be together anymore. We can still be friends."" As soon as I heard that I felt sick to my stomach. Like I was gonna throw up. Within minutes I just started crying. He knew I was too but he didn't care he was having fun with his brother. Everyone was on my side though, thank god. The reason for that is because he has quite the reputation of being an asshole and most of the people he knows hate him save for his group of 3 or 4 friends. I cried for 2 days over that breakup though despite the support I got. He refused to talk about it. He refused to even say why he broke up with me. 

I got over it fairly quickly though. Thinking about his shitty behaviour from when we were together and realising just how much of an asshole he really is only made it easier to get over him. 

Then November 2017 (I think) I met a guy (I'll call him L) who asked me out on a date, I said yes, and that's how our relationship started. I considered him a definite step up from who I was with previously. Much more affectionate and much more polite and not one to talk shit or be rude. 

Then one day, he texts me saying it's over. I ask why. He says ""because I've been hearing things about you"". He refuses to tell me who said that stuff to him about me. A while after that breakup I find out he's best buddies with O. I guess O talked shit about me to him and because they were friends, he bought it. 

Then a few months after the breakup with L, K comes to me one day asking if I tried to come on to O when O didn't want it. I told him I didn't (which was the truth). Then K says ""Well, that's what O's been saying about you."" I was so pissed of after I found out that he'd been telling lies to people about me. But it was only one incident so I let it slide. Then over the months I hear he is still continuing to say that I came on to him. Even telling L's sister about it making her not want her brother to date me because she thought I was gonna do the same to him. 

Again, I kept letting it slide. I hoped it would all go away. Then 2 days ago I was hanging out with a friend (I'll call him B). B says he saw O the day before. O knew I had been hanging out with B lately so he told B to send me a text message saying that he was hanging out with my ex boyfriend and to send a picture of them together. B wouldn't do it. Then O went on to tell B that I was a psychotic bitch. B asked him why he thought this. O wouldn't say why. He just said ""she's crazy."" 

Anyway that's what B told me happened between them a couple days ago. It really pisses me off. I'm afraid I'm making this out to be a bigger deal then it really is but I want some input. Should I talk to O about this and tell him to stop? Or just not do anything and not give a shit? It bothers me even more that his friends (including L) think all that he has said about me is gospel truth which hurts to think that there's people who actually believe what he has said. I left what happened between us behind me and I don't talk shit about him unless I hear he's been talking shit about me to which I'm more than willing to say he's a fucking asshole, so why can't he knock it off? I know you can't control what a person does or says about you. I just need want to know how to make the trash talking bother me less or if possible, get him to stop the trash talking and grow the fuck up.

278,"Hello! I'm new to this feed simply to ask one question. 
A little backstory: My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half now. Soon after we got together his grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and it happened to be a few years after she beat breast cancer. She tried chemo, experimental treatments, &amp; surgery, so she's been through the works. She was given a few weeks and has turned that into months but she is going downhill fast. My boyfriend's mother told us last night that she was calling all of her children to say her goodbyes and was ready to meet with hospice. I think she was putting it off because it felt as though, in her condition, she was giving up. We are planning a family trip to see her this weekend which brings me to my question: When everyone is together, how can I bring the family closer without overstepping my bounds? I've been in the family for a hot minute and I get along with everyone tremendously, but the family as a whole is not very close nor are they open in terms of expressing emotions. My boyfriend's mother is taking this especially hard as she is very close with her mother. My boyfriend and his brother are pretty distant from their mother (and they're dudes) so they aren't being open with their emotions nor are they offering her comfort. Is their something I can do besides showing up to the family get together and sitting with her? I want to do more but I truly can't think of anything. Thanks in advance! ",14Jun2017,1
279,"Hi guys,
I've met this girl on a closed group on Facebook some months ago. We got on pretty well.
We had lots in common and quickly created a good connection. She told me about some of her personal problems and so did I. Both of us have depression, but her condition is way worse. 

Basically,we would share our problems and comfort each other and I think we were started getting closer, as we would comment on our stuff , like post , tag in interesting posts, etc, etc

Then, things went downhill. After some weeks I noticed that she stopped messaging me. She was almost the one who initiated the conversation. But after that there would be no sort of interaction. Even if I commented on her posts, there would be no interaction. If pm her, she'll respond but won't talk much.

I don't think I have done anything wrong and I'm aware of her grave depression, but still. Even when things are alright, no contact.

To top it off, I've started catching feelings for her and I know there's no chance because, not only does she live far away from me, but she also seems to want to cut me off for good. Like she's grown tired of me, despite the fact that she answers back so friendly. Also, she's 5 years older than me ( I'm 20 and she's 25)

Today I sent her a message, after not talking to her for a month. She said things aren't holding up and then I sent another message saying if she needs me, I'll be there, waiting for her to get better and/or to listen to her problems. She has left it unseen.

I don't know what to do.
I really hope she doesn't see this post, otherwise I know things will get bad.

What should I do? She treats me so nicely that it's hard to believe that she no longer wants me in her life.

Also, some details: like I've said before, after months of not talking to her, I saw a post that said to tell someone anything without mention the person's name. I wrote: ""bye"" and she liked it. I'm not sure what that meant

Anyways,
Thank you for your attention and I hope you could give me some piece of advice here. I'm pretty devastated at the moment.

I try to keep my room clean so I can stay in here and not get yelled at (the logic is that if my room is clean she wont have anything to yell at me about), but it happens anyway... staying in here just makes it less frequent so that's what I do. 

Should I need to go out, she yells at me for even wanting to. I wanna go drinking with friends once a week or so, she yells at me because I'm ""alcoholic"". Should I wanna spend a bit of money to get some fast food delivered to treat myself for doing good on my exercise regime, she yells at me for spending money stupidly. Today, my boyfriend (who lives with me) didnt want to get a hair cut, so she yelled at me because he didnt wanna go do it, like she expects me to force him or something. If I wanna go to the toilet during the night I need the light on because I'm scared of the dark (she knows this, I explain this to her every other day), she yells at me for having the light on (COME ON. IT'S ONLY ON FOR ONE MINUTE WHILE I'M IN THE BATHROOM.) She yells at me for not going to the doctor with her because it's not my appointment, but she wants some advice about me (I really dont have to be there for that...)
She yells at me because the fridge is empty even though SHE was the one who ate all the food (she's like 300 pounds and not dropping at all while I'm losing weight... how could I eat ALL the food? She sits there snacking for hours every night). In fact, she pretty much yells at me whenever I eat any food at all. I pay the bills too. Most of my money goes to her, its my food too...

She finds any reason to get mad at me she can, even if it's not justified or its just downright stupid. And now, it makes me feel suicidal every time it happens. I've put up with this for years. I'm not sure if it's getting worse now, or it just feels worse because I'm fed up, but it's happening, and happening way too often, regardless.

Oh, and I've already tried explaining to her that she makes me feel suicidal sometimes. Her response: ""do it"". Which makes me think she doesnt expect me to do it and she's just challenging me, but I've attempted suicide before and ended up in hospital for it, and she knows this. ??? Does she want me dead? it certainly feels like it.

The situation:

My parents are seperated, and both of them live in different towns, which are an hour away. Dad made me get my current job that is near his house. Both mom and dad agreed that they will have to compromise when which parent has to pick me up on certain days that I work. 

   Dad sees me on Mondays, Thursdays, and every second Friday and every second weekend. My mom sees me on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and every other Friday and every other weekend. Now when I get booked shifts after school on dad's days, I used to just bike to and from work and spend the nights at his place, because picking me up at ludicrous times like 10, 11, or 12 pm. If they weren't too late, she would pick me up. Just not on nights that I work at or past 10 pm. 

  I'm  not allowed to stay at dad's house after work on my mom's days anymore, because dad thinks that mom not picking me up on her nights was bull crap. So now if I get booked on anyone of my mom's days after school, I would have nowhere to go afterwards.

Anyway, he generally works until 5 but sometimes leaves a few minutes early so today I shot him a text and asked when he was getting off of work (I ask because he picks our daughter up from me and he keeps her over night). He promptly texted back ""5"". Ok cool, I decided to run to our apt at 430 to get some clean clothes , and to help so he didn't have to come pick her up. I tried calling and texting him to let him know not to pick her up, but no response. 


As I pull up to my apartment, I see his car. ""Odd"" I think. I go in and he's asleep in bed. In a nice calm worried tone I ask ""Hey, you said you were working until 5, what happened? Is everything ok?"" ""It was easier than explaining."" He said. ""Explaining what?"" I asked. ""If I would have told you I left because of my headache,"" he replied, ""you would have been all 'What's wrong are you ok is everything alright' and I didn't want to deal with that.""


I was confused. ""But of course I would ask those things, it's strange for you to  leave *this* early when you need the hours. I love you and care about you, so I want to make sure you're ok"". 


He instantly got angry and said that me asking all those questions makes me a controlling person. It also makes me annoying, he said. 


He turned it around on me and started pointing out my flaws. I explained that I was fine with him leaving work, just that I was worried about him and also I was upset that he blatantly lied to be. (Remember when I asked him what time he was getting off work? He was already home at that time). 


He said ""You've lied about things on the past"" and continued to bash me with things I do and have done wrong in our relationship. He called me annoying again and said I was just bitching and nagging and to go away. 


Was I really in the wrong? Am I a controlling person for expressing concern for why he was home early? Am I an annoying nag for after all of this I got really heated and started pointing out his flaws (bad idea I know).

291,"I have a friend I've known for 25 years. He has been in a relationship for the past few years, and is completely infatuated. There is a difference between love and infatuation and he is definitely the latter, but doesn't seem to be aware of it and I'm not sure there's much I can do to align him with reality and the consequences of the path he is on.

I started to notice it in conversations a few years ago, his behavior was really erratic - the things he wanted kept changing on a dime, and every conversation seemed to contradict the last. He was willing to give up everything for this person on a whim per whatever his partner's mood is - from moving to another country and leaving everything behind to being willing to change his personality and hobbies to accommodate this person and be whatever his partner wants him to be, instead of himself.

He's really distanced himself from friends and family and is in a really selfish space, only concerned about his partner's needs and his own and really seems to be divorced from who and what he's always been. His partner seems to play a role in this and doesn't like his friends (I haven't met him) and discourages him from seeing family and friends and it's worked. It's been really hard to relate to and if I'm honest, my friend is acting like an ass to the rest of us who know him. I thought it was a honeymoon phase but it's lasted a few years now and he's really sabotaging good friends, family relationships, and likely many other things in the name of infatuation. Nonetheless for a person 'between jobs' who has been taking his money and robbing him of his social circle.

Is there any way to raise concern without him getting upset or defensive? I think he's so far gone, I feel hopeless as a friend that I can do much. He doesn't seem to want the reality check and seeing the great guy he was fade away is hard, as is not having him in my life which hurts like hell.  I'm genuinely worried about him, and think he's setting himself up for a huge fall. I probably shouldn't care with how I've been treated, but at the end of the day, he was my closest friend before all of this and I love him, even if he sucks and hasn't been one to me in a long time.

293,"Hey Reddit. I got sexually assaulted at work. I had a male coworker grab my crotch. Problem was it happened during thanksgiving so the cameras apparently didn't catch it. Additionally the coworker claimed it was an accident. However, a couple weeks later they sent me some pretty sexually charged messages and I gave like 7 reasons why I didn't want anything to do with them romantically or sexually and they replied with ""I've heard better reasons not to have sex with me."" So clearly crotch grabbing was not an accident. What should I do? My work did an ""investigation"" and it took about 3 months. 3 damn months to tell me they wanted a statement letter. I wrote the letter, and all they did was have him sign a piece of paper saying he won't do it again. then that same month my workplace gave him employee of the month. Should I say something or do something? I'm kind of at a loss. I really only want to do something now that I'm leaving for a new job and I think what they did it bullshit. ",14Jun2017,1

297,"As the title says, sister has friend who is suicidal and vents/complains to her.  He doesn't seem to complain about anything particularly unusual for a teenager, just that those issues make him want to kill himself.  Girl drama/parents not paying attention to him enough(2 other siblings) are his biggest complaints.

My sister has already gotten my mother involved including the school counselor and the boys parents, but the complaining and suicidal talk persist.

I'm a good bit older than my sister, so my advice to her was that I would suggest being supportive but not feeding his suicidal thoughts, but also if needed tell him you need a break and can't talk to him if the suicidal talk is too much for her.  I'm looking to protect my sister here as much as I want the kid to not kill himself.

We are somewhere between pretty sure and entirely confident the boy isn't injuring himself, he just is dealing with normal teenage emotions and his solution is suicide.  

What kind of advice would be best not only for my sister but also what steps should we take towards helping this kid?  We have a strong support group, so I don't think any avenue of action is off limits.

Thanks ahead of time!",14Jun2017,1
298,"     Hey guys, so today I was at a barbeque and one of my girlfriends brought her gang full of handsome guys. One of them was wearing a red baseball hat and he looked so cute, as the time passed we would frequently make eye contact and he would sometimes flirt. When it was time to leave he told my girlfriend to tell me that I was cute and that he would like to get to know me better, at that moment my inner goddes made a front flip. I really want to get to know him but im about to move away from the city and it's probably to late what should I do?",14Jun2017,1
299,"So in my years of working in different fields I've learned that the first 3-6 months are usually a struggle when entering a new position. I expect a learning curve and take it in stride. 

However, this time thing are very different. Im entering an unfamiliar field (travel) in a leadership position with staff looking at me for support. The turn around for my staff is very quick: two quit in the month that Ive been in the role. Im so new to the role and now I'm also having to hire staff and train them in what Im not well versed at all. 

Luckily, i've been shadowing the person in my position for a month, but things have been so hectic that I haven't learned all that much, besides the basic stuff. 

Also, the dynamic of the organization is super fast-paced. I come from a small team that when compared with the current environment seems snail paced. 

Any advice would be much valued, as my brain has pretty much shut down from all of the information coming my way. Perhaps I should have mentioned that we are in the busiest time of the season, which makes me feel super overwhelmed. 

I think I just have to push through the tough times and keep taking it one step at the time. Logically this makes sense, while emotionally I am a complete mess due to the amount of information I have to retain. 

I don't really have a choice at this time, but to persevere, nonetheless I would appreciate any support.

300,I have a lot of african clothing that no longer fit me but I do not know where I can give them without them being trashed. Goodwill will definitely trash them. Any ideas?,14Jun2017,1
302,"So me and my S/O just bought our first home, (row townhouse) and the next door neighbours had just sold theirs. So we got about a month of living next to them which was fine. And now the new owners have moved in. 

They seem really nice, but they both smoke. One of them particularly, sits on the back steps and smokes and the air flows right into our kitchen window, and back door. This makes warm days less enjoyable, as you can imagine, enjoying the fresh air flowing through the house, and suddenly, cigarette smoke. 

Obviously it's their own property, and I don't really feel comfortable with straight up voicing my disgust for their habit. 

Any advice? ",14Jun2017,1
