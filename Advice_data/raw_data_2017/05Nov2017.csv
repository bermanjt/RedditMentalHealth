0,"Any advice? I'm very confused. I've been single but desperate for a boyfriend for years, to the point where I have had very few boundaries until now and I have fantasies of being abused verbally which are slowly going away. In short, any relationships I have had with males were abusive and each guy played mind games with me. Despite that, I do think I may be attracted to girls, but I am just not sure. I do know I need to find my own identity either way but do you have any advice for me? I feel like I act a bit more like a guy than a girl sometimes, and I've gotten aggressive when pursuing boys before, but I often want to protect and provide for females and have sort of had feelings for some before I think, although I've never dated a woman or a girl.

1,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes nothing.

I'm an 18 year old guy and my friend/neighbor just killed himself on Thursday. Before he did it id have described our friendship as the kind that we could go months without seeing each other but when we meet up its like we see each other every single day. I thought we could tell each other anything that was worrying us, and quite often we would however that clearly wasn't the case on Thursday. I was even discussing our girlfriends and the stresses with college and exams we were going through only a week ago and he was the last person I expected to even contemplate suicide.

But now im lost. Was there something I should have noticed when we were talking last week? Did he see me the same way I saw him or was I not supportive enough? Or worse did he see me that way go through with it anyway meaning I'm virtually powerless to even attempt to be supportive if any of my other friends somehow think suicide is the only option.

To make matters worse the funeral is going to be a private affair entirely. I was not invited. I won't get any chance to properly say goodbye. A small part of me really deep down just refuses to acknowledge that he's gone. I find myself constantly reminiscing over memories and supporting the absolutely absurd concept that this is some big elaborate prank.

Im broken even though I shouldn't be, he wasn't my brother, or even my best friend but he's still gone. I can't sleep if I don't have a light on I start to have a minor panic attack and even if I do fall asleep I battle nightmares. What can I do? If anything?

4,"I'm almost 19 and a female. My dad died extremely suddenly on Wednesday (we found out he was terminally ill just the day before) and the funeral was today. Up until now I have had some waves of grief, but other than that I've been numb/in denial. I plan on going back to uni tomorrow, but I live quite near the city so I'm going to come home every weekend at least for a little while. Hopefully it will help me to try and establish some kind of routine again and keep busy.

The thing is, before this I was very good at living independently eg. With cooking. However, for the past few days I have been on autopilot, and unless someone has offered/made me food (and on one occasion when friends took me out for dinner to clear my mind), I have simply not been eating. I don't have the energy to make anything, I'm just hollow.

I know this is probably quite a normal symptom of grief, but I also know it could very easily lead to have debilitating effects. How can I ensure that once back at uni, I actually look after myself properly? I'm sorting out counselling in my uni city and I have a supportive group of friends but I have visions of letting myself go further down.

TL;DR - dad died, first year at uni, not sure how I'm going to successfully get back into living independently. ",05Nov2017,5

Currently studying in a new city, I'm in my first year. I have met quite a few new people already but have had since the beginning a friend group of 3 international students who are only staying for the year or for a semester, and 2 new comers like me who will be staying for the duration of their degree. 

Since the beginning of the semester I've had a sexual relationship with an international student, let's call her L. She's really great, I've got to know her quite well and she is a really good friend of mine. A bit about her, she is the type to let me make all the decisions, and I know if I asked to stop this relationship we have, she would be okay with it. She's going back to her country in 2 months from now. 

Everything was going fine until another one of our international friends, J, had a party and I got really drunk and slept in her bed. I woke up to her cuddling with me, then I found out she has strong love-type feelings for me. I told her right away that I had a thing with L, and she said she had already guessed there was something going on. I said fuck it, I cuddled her back. Two days later we hung out and she cuddled and kissed me. We talked about my thing with L and she said she was okay with it, as long as she didn't see it and I didn't talk about it. A few days later, I talked to L about what had happened with J and although she felt very bad, since she hadn't exactly told J the truth and since it's her friend she didn't want any conflict, we talked and L promised me she didn't care about what I do with my life, and it was fine to see them both at the same time. (she's very chill as you can see)

Everything was going smoothly until just an hour ago. They both went on a day trip together and talked about things with each other for the first time. I get a text from L who says she feels very bad doing things with me because she can see that J really has strong feelings for me, so she thinks we should stop seeing each other. I can see she really doesn't want to hurt J.

The thing is, L has become a really really good friend of mine. When we talk about things I feel so close with her, because she is always showing me different perspectives and helping me with everything and anything. We have very similar senses of humor and we both like to explore and try new things. J on the other hand is very affectionate and I can tell she has very strong feelings for me. The reality is J and I are very different, and I find myself relating much more to L than I do to J. J is staying for a whole year so I can tell there will be a high possibility for her to develop a very strong attachment to me during the next few months, which I am afraid of. 

I am worried whatever I do, I will hurt the other, and I know I am stupid for getting myself into this situation in the first place, but I'm in it now, and I don't know what to do.


TL;DR One girl who I think of as a great friend that I relate a lot to, leaving in 2 months to her home country; versus another girl who has very strong feelings for me, very affectionate, who is leaving in 6 months, however I don't relate to her as much. How do I resolve this without a fight, or a ruined friendship?

Weekdays I have classes and homework, but weekends have become very tedious. I used to play a competitive sport at the national level so my life was dedicated to studying and that sport. My social life was also rooted in that sport, and I had a lot of fun practicing with my friends/entering competitions. However, due to an injury, I had to give up that sport. Now, I noticed I literally don't have any friends outside of that sport -- other than Netflix it's like what should I do?

13,"Hello there.

I'm a 23 year old male from Croatia. I'm here because I'm rather desperate. There is a buttload of things to say, and I have many specific questions that I just need advice and answer for, but I will try to generalize it without stretching it out too much, apologies in advance if I

Basically, I am stuck in life, I don't know how to live it, and I don't know how to do anything meaningful or craft long term goals for myself that I can maintain. 

So here is a little backstory that may be relevant without going too much into detail:

I am, and share many woes and shortcomings of a typical millenial. I do not have an extensive skillset, besides my ability to speak English fluently, which isn't saying much in this day and age. Be it determinism, be it my own fault, I screwed up my education and now that I in fact have found a field I would like to pursue; psychology - I find myself unable to do it unless I suffer through a lot of years of monotonous work, which due to my faulty willpower and my substantial OCD that interferes work presents a problem.

I have gone to England this year with the intent to do just that, with the intend to live on my own and work. I found my way there well enough. I intended to stay there for at least for a year, but have spent a little more than two months during which I have changed two jobs, one that was exploitative and the other I got fired from, because apparently I did not learn things fast enough. This latter workplace is ironically the only one I ever somewhat liked as far as laborous work goes. I worked as a care assistant.

Why I got fired is definitely affected by my obsessive-compulsive disorder, which above all gives me crippling anxiety and worsens my ability to focus and pay attention, as i have to make room for(and conceal as much as possible) visual and even vocal ticks, especially during work, which seemingly stresses me disproportionately. Nonetheless, this is probably not the whole story and it is perfectly possible that I lack intellect or ability, or may just have learning difficulties, even though in all sincerity I do not think it is either of those things, but something is off.

Either way, I do think I need therapy and need to fix myself before undertaking anything further such as a job, though I think receiving it would be a long, arduous process with an uncertain result.

I have a worldview that is leaning towards nihilism and I am desperately trying to keep it away from that, as it is not helping my situation. It is destroying a lot of my motivation to strive for or do much of anything. I don't aspire for greatness, nor am I motivated by things like money or success, both of which I'm aware are probably detrimental to me. 

I don't identify with a lot of people, and am leaning towards the socially awkward side, though I am not socially inept nor terrified or people. I am not misanthropic, although I am not terribly fond of humans either. Its hard to make friends when your town is small and doesn't have many places that offer opportunities to meet any sort of people or do anything. In any case, I have a difficulty making friends or even liking people. All the friends that I have ever had are gone, each having their own lives that I am not a part of now. I have but lost all my social circles and do not go out.

I'm trying to learn how to play the guitar, which I've paradoxically lost motivation for when I succeeded in playing my favorite song. I am not trying to get back into it. I am also trying to read and learn French, but my entire being resists all of this, and it brings me less satisfaction than ever.

Like most millenials, I am struggling with this new age of devices and digital addictions. I have been addicted to gaming for a long time now, with videogames being my main way of structuring time. I have realized that they bring me very little fulfillment and mostly give me anxiety, so I have successfully culled them to a few, though I still play a few on occassion, and they are, I'm ashamed to say, still one of the most pleasurable experiences in my life.

I have struggled with petty pleasures for a long time and it has kept me away from truly living. I do not in all honesty want to do a mundane job that will wreck my psyche and make me a tired, nervous, agitated and unhappy wreck, though I am prepared to compromise and do this, on paper anyway, but it has seldom worked out for one reason or another.

The job that I have done in England meant working 12 hours a day, being on duty for 15. I cannot find much joy or contentment outside of work as it is, let alone when I work for so long. I become zombified.

I long to be outside and in nature, but the area where I live has nothing but a highway with some houses and open plains. I am planning to enlist in a hiking club and infrequently go on a hike far in the country for a day or two, though this is pricey.

Be it internet or something else, my attention span is extremely low and to this day I still struggle with, if not videogames, then general procrastination and I waste my time on the internet. I know I could do this less if I had a reason to go outside of the house.

I have a hard time, or have never had the sufficient time and means to, develop intimate relationships with people that I knew. Some girls fancied me, but I was frankly never interested in them. The only place I ever managed to build substantial relationship was the internet.

Fully aware of how dangerous and perhaps desperate it was, I have made my first girlfriend on the internet, and we have been together for 9 months now, and are both very serious about each other. She's from the Philippines, and my single definitely tangible goal in life is to live with her one day. You need not tell me how big a longshot and risk that is, but when you're dying of loneliness and click with virtually nobody, would you yourself pass a girl you deem logically compatible and the kind you always wanted?

Still, I would like to meet people in some fashion. I am at this point so cynical and generally unambitious that I am freed of strong desire of any particular form of life. I just want it to be as eventful, fullfiling and meaningful as it was in childhood. I had lost my place in this world and have a hard time forging a new one.

Lastly, I'm not into sports, though I would do like to do things such as HEMA or even fencing, but such things are nowhere to be found where I live. Archery, maybe. The problem is that all these things cost time and money, the former which I do have, the latter which I do not. If I can have the latter, I will not have the former.

P.S.
I know my message was not crafted most eloquently nor have I really outlined any specific question, for that I apologize right away.



TL:DR
I just want some advice on what somebody stuck in society and life can do to get it back on track and eventually and presently achieve at least some reasonable goals in life common to us all; progress, family, friends, passion and a place in the world. I'd like to hear the experiences of those who had been stuck much like I and found what they consider to be the way out. I simply want to change my sedentary un-life into something meaningful.

I struggle with depression and anxiety and this situation really hasn’t been well for me because I’ve slept my days away and I’ve been so upset ever since.
There is a friend I really care about named David. David is the only person in my life currently who’s willing to listen to my problems and not judge me and give me helpful advice and such. He hasn’t given up on me no matter how stubborn and depressed I’ve been and I really appreciate that.
In my life, I’ve been abandoned so many times and it’s just refreshing.
But here’s the problem,
There’s a girl he has a crush on and he often times ignores me for her, even when I have something I need to talk about and get off my chest. It’s happened multiple times where I’ll talk about something serious and then suddenly get ignored for this girl.
He gets angry a lot. He’s stubborn as well but he also gets snappy with me sometimes and it just kills me because I’m really trying my best.

Now, onto what happened recently:
This girl he likes is in a relationship that is somewhat verbally abusive and mentally abusive. 
He’s been trying to get them to break up because he cares about Her a lot (I mean I would too) and she’s been stubborn with him as well.
It’s been taking a toll on him and I started getting worried for him.
So Friday, (they were going to hang out today) he was talking about how much he doesn’t want to see her and such and he kept talking about her relationship over and over and I just felt bad (I’ve been through this situation many times before with multiple different people, so I know what to do in situations like this).
He kept talking about not wanting to hang out with her, but he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say, so I started yelling.
But the thing is, I wasn’t yelling at him, I was mad about the situation and I felt bad that something like this was happening to him because I love him to death.
He got mad and he’s been ignoring me ever since.
I just need advice on what to do from here.
I’ve left him alone, but it’s really killing me. With my anxiety ridden mind and my over thinking personality, I’m thinking about all the possibilities that could happen and (if he is) all the mean things he’s saying about me.
It’s really upsetting me, and I’m just scared.
I’m sorry this ask thing is so long, I just don’t know what to do.
Thank you ",05Nov2017,0

When I was a teenager, we had the computer in the living room along with the TV and I would often stay up late on the weekends on the internet (this was back before smart phones and even wifi) while my dad watched porn on the TV after my mom had gone to bed. I hated it but I didn't confront him about it. At some point I confronted my mom about it, but my dad denied it and it never came up again. 

It was always something I was too embarrassed to talk about with my friends, though it was a running joke among me and my sisters. Now as I'm getting older, I'm wondering how damaging it was.  I can go into more details, but I'd rather keep it short for now.",05Nov2017,1
21,"First post here, lmk if I’m doing it wrong. Also on mobile so format may be weird, sorry!

Long story short, I’ve been dating the same guy for three years. My first serious relationship. I’ve got a lot of milestones with this guy and we’ve definitely been through the ringer. I have to give him credit for helping me develop a lot as a person and figure out who I am and where I want to be going in life. 

Only problem is, he doesn’t quite fit into that plan. Though he’s overall a nice guy, he can be clingy, overbearing, codependent, and not very emotionally supportive. He went through group homes and foster care growing up so he didn’t learn to do a lot of basic things and isn’t very self-sufficient. Basically, he doesn’t have a lot going for him right now. 

On the other hand, he’s not judgmental at all and is really open-minded, and is pretty much down to do whatever I am. But we definitely want different things. He’s expressed in the past that he doesn’t want to just “get dragged around while I do things with my life,” but that’s kind of what’s happening here. 

ON TOP OF IT ALL, I have this friend. She’s a girl my age (bf is 3 years older), we have very similar interests, upbringings and goals. We have started spending more time together and it’s hard for me to ignore how attracted I am to her. I feel like she’s giving me signals too but I’m not 100% sure and don’t want to read too much into it (although other people have noticed too). 

I’m not saying that I want to break up with my bf for her, but my interest in her has forced me to confront some things about my relationship. I don’t feel like we’re dating. I love him, but I’m not attracted to him. I feel like we’re not on the same page and staying with him would be out of complacency rather than out of want. I also feel like, since he’s my first “real” partner, I’d be missing out on a lot of experiences if I stayed. I don’t think he’s “the one” (not that I agree with that term). 

I’m feeling so lost and conflicted. I think I’m ready for change but I’m too scared to. I’ll definitely be having a talk with him about how I’m feeling, but I’d love to hear all your input as well. Thanks!",05Nov2017,1

So....to even begin this, I must first present the facts. My main issue is my last relationship: the girl I was with fucked me over big time, but I was in love with her (madly). She acted as if she loved me back, and was the first to say I love you, but completely disregarded this through her actions. I haven’t had a relationship since. This is mainly due to the fact that I have become emotionally/romantically detached now: I just don’t want to feel love again. The last time it turned out horribly and I still can’t get her out of my head. Then this new girl comes around...lets call her K. So K is one of my relatives coworkers daughter. I met her through said relative when I went to the workplace to volunteer, we hit it off and started chatting regularly. At the time she had a boyfriend (who is/was a complete douche), so I never would have tried romantically engaging with her. At this point I was starting to get feelings for her, but I kept trying to suppress them, as I knew that I would grow attached and then would be let down. Eventually we stop talking as regularly as school started (mainly just because we both are busy when school hits). A couple weeks ago we got back in random contact, and I invited her to a Halloween thing. She was ecstatic about going, and was very excited leading up to it. She loved it. At this event I wanted to make a move (I know she isn’t with that asshole boyfriend anymore) but kept second guessing my self because of A. Trying to suppress feelings cuz I’m scared of being hurt.

40,"ugh this is a long-winded post. I'm sorry. Basically I got dumped in April and stupidly tried to go back into the dating world. By that, I mean I set up profiles on dating sites and did not look at them for several months, would check in periodically to see what kinds of crazy messages I could get, and that was about it. This guy sent me close to 100 messages on Okcupid over the summer, despite me not responding to him at all. The messages were usually something like this (there were so many of them. It was comical that he was messaging me over and over despite me not responding)

""Hello miss""
""Hello miss lady"" 
""Hellooooo??????? lady??? r u there?""
and variations of such over and over and over. 

I guess I became so lonely and desperate over the summer that I decided to respond to this weirdo and give him my number and to go on a coffee date. MISTAKE. BIG, BIG, MISTAKE. 

so sometime in June we go out for coffee. He is nervous but all over me at the same time. His English is really bad (he's a PhD student at my alma mater, originally from Iran and here on a green card) and he smells like mothballs. He tried to hold my hand and kiss me even though he was all sweaty. The date was just awkward, awkward, awkward. I was asking him all the questions. He brought me flowers and pottery from his home country. Although I accepted the gifts, I did not plan for a second date with him. I so regret ever giving him my number. I could not walk back to my car fast enough after that date.

Right after the date I get a million text messages from him professing his love for me, how I was his first date and love ever (he is 29 and had never been on a date) and how we are perfect for each other. I tell him that I still really miss my ex and I'm not ready to date for a very long time, this is not going to work, he's a nice person, go see other people, good luck, etc. He then says he will wait for me. I tell him no and the same thing over and over. I do not hear from him for three weeks. I then get several paragraphs of him professing his love for me again, to give him another chance, that he needs me, and that can we start out as friends. I ignore him. A few more days go by and I get the same number of paragraphs with more begging and pleading for me to go out with him. I tell him to leave me alone, I am not interested. I attempt blocking his number but I guess imessage is being a bitch because it won't fucking work. He then finds my facebook and messages me there. I block him. For the next four months he is making new facebook profiles and texting me to take him back at least once a week. Despite my best efforts of blocking, my iphone will not block his number and he continues to make new facebook accounts just to message me.

On my birthday he sent me a text at midnight saying happy birthday and how much he loves me. I ask ""who's this?"" he says his name, I say idk who this is and how do you know it's my birthday. Apparently I did tell him when we went on that one date and he remembered. He then asked me to give him another chance and to meet up with him one more time, texting me the same thing again exactly one week after my birthday. Attempted to block, have not succeeded in doing so yet. The last string of texts i got from him were yesterday on a new facebook account after I've blocked at least 5 other accounts he has made.

""I'm so so sorry for disturbing you again, but please read this message. Please don't feel Im a kind of person who is super persistent. Im just inviting you to reconsider this and give us a chance to know more about each other. Dear lady, we can start with a friendly conversation. There is no harm. I dont want to say ""please dont break my heart"" because probably you dont like such a phrase. There is no liability for you. I kindly ask you let us have a text conversation. (my name), having a girlfriend like you means a lot to me! I know what has been my mistakes. Let me have this opportunity. I think I am continuing in spite of your opposition. I know it isnt right. Im sorry! I love you, lady! Please!!! Wish you best!!""

EDIT 11/5/17 he messaged me AGAIN at around 4 AM before I could even change my facebook info, he made another account just to message me again, FFS.  

""Im so sorry that i am still persisting. On one hand I dont want to bother you and on the other hand I believe that your issues disappear if we start talking with each other. I really really promise i dont take your time very often. I think you are worried about something that can be solved through talking. (my name), again I really really promise I do my best to make you happy and together can sex ok. I do my best to see you enjoying your life. I beg you to let this relationship happen. I promise I will support you romantically and sexually!! Please, Lady!1 I love you!""

43,"This is so messed up. 

My older sister (in her 40s) is adopted. I am not adopted. She doesn't know anything about her birth family and never really seemed to care. But recently she got a DNA test to find out her ancestry (like the regions she's from), which was fun and interesting. 

But then, someone contacted her on the site because their DNA match indicates they are cousins or maybe even half-siblings (and they are also adopted!). This is the first person ever in her life that's related to her.

The messed up part is this....I discovered a few months ago from my mom that my sister was a product of a rape....and that's why her birth mother gave her up for adoption. Apparently my mom was told this when she adopted her. *My sister does not know this.* And the MOST fucked up part is this: apparently, before my sister got married 20 years ago, my parents *told her husband*. (I was furious when I learned this because it is so stupid that they told him and not her.)

But anyway, now that my sister is getting in touch with a potentially close relative, it seems clear that my mom must tell her the truth. I am so ticked that everyone else knows this info about my sister except her. It's SO messed up, and she deserves to be very angry when she learns it.

So my question is this: what is the best thing I can do for her? Should I wait for my parents/her husband to tell her? And then--how do I explain away the fact that *I* knew for a few months and didn't tell her??? I didn't feel like it was my place to tell her. It is difficult for me to put myself in her shoes because I have no idea how she feels. I just want the best for her. Thank you!",05Nov2017,2
44,"So I’m a dude 18 yr, and I’m pretty average, but the thing that bothers me is that my name is Brie (that’s it, nothin else). It sounds like a girl name, like short for “Brianna”. So when I meet people I always feel not-confident about saying my name since most people say “huh?”, “what?” Or they’ll just correct me and say “hi Brian”. This gets me aggravated becuz I have to repeat my self saying Brie, and they give me this “oh...” like I said something wrong. This happens like 80% of the time, and this only happened when I first meet people. All of my friends didn’t really bother me about it (surprisingly), the only thing they said was that my name was a cheese, which didn’t bother me. It’s the initial thing that always feels awkward. So here’s some background info, ur probably wondering “why did they name me this??” And I’ll tell u and it’s kinda stupid. So my dad had a friend from Europe who was called Bree, but Bree was really just short for Breian, (which they now later found out lol). Also my mom  found out Brie was a region in France (which no one fucking knows) and she “why not”. So there u go. I just don’t know how to deal with it, it’s like whenever I meet people I’m literally afraid to say my name. Lol I feel like a bitch saying it because since I’m mix (Hispanic-white) I look somewhat light skin (lol how tf does biology work?) so I end up looking like a “sort of” light skin guy who has a girl name. Like after I meet people it’s not a problem i just get on with life but as I said just introducing myself is a pain in the ass. And one thing I’ll say now, I’m not doing a name change, I’ve grown up my whole life with this name and I’m to used to it to change it to a more “male” name.

49,"I graduated from a predominately asian high-school. I've been overseas and am well-versed in issues the asian-american community faces. Yet, I'm continuously blocked from identifying as asian in both social and romantic circles.



Social: I just started school and have joined a korean-themed dance group. Most of us aren't even korean, but it seems like a lot of the social gatherings and interactions are planned without trying to include me (it's not because I'm new, they've vigorously included the chinese/korean/viet freshmen. Just not the halfie). I get a lot of off-hand comments about my being studious and even my figure (long limbs, slender) being a fault, even though both of these characteristics are typical of asian women. I stay in dance because I love it, but feeling like an outsider sucks.



Dating: I can't tell you how many asian guys have rejected me without really giving me a fair chance. A little bit of it is due to not being in the aforementioned friend groups, but not even on dating apps like tinder do I get any kind of enthusiasm when I initiate conversation, take interest in what's in their bio, etc. Physically, I don't think I'm bad. I workout often and frequently receive compliments from girls and guys that are not asian.



How can I still engage in korean dance, which I love, without harboring this resentment of the asian american community? What am I possibly doing that's offputting to people? :(",05Nov2017,7

53,"I live in an apartment style dorm room with three guys I considered good friends when this started. I also live down the hall from a guy I dislike, because he consistently ""pranks"" me. These pranks range from unplugging my game system or stealing my name tag (on the door) all the way to writing a letter detailing how i am gay and putting it on the fridge in my room.

Now, about three weeks ago this guy became good friends with all of my roommates seemingly over a week. That is fine. I have no issues with that, but I do have an issue with him constantly being in my room and trying to talk to or mess with me. An example of this is I was trying to sleep the night before I took the GRE and around midnight and A walks in drunk and starts talking to my roommates at a volume just below shouting. They were all very annoyed when I asked them several times to quiet down. 

Last week it came to a head. He kept trying to touch me after I repeatedly told him not to and he eventually started humping me, fully clothed, so I punched him in the face. The RA'S in my building banned him from my room after this. 

My roommates then took me to a fraternity honor board, think trial to see who is at fault and hand out fines or other punishments. And they lied. They lied about the event to my face. Luckily I had proof that they were lying and the honor board found me guilty of striking him, but I was not punished because they saw it as a reasonable response to what was, by our school's definition, sexual harassment.

Now my roommates are pissed. They are angry that I called the letter about my sexuality and his humping sexual harassment. They are also angry that I did not, in their words, take responsibility for my actions and that I ""see myself as the victim"". 

I don't understand what they want. I admitted that i lost it, that I hit him. I just don't know what to do and I need advice.

It has gotten to the point where I don't want to enter the same room as him because I get anxiety for him being unhappy about something and having to deal with his rage. I will get attacked (verbally) for very mundane things. When I try to bring this stuff up, he is so unaware of that he just says it's how he is, he is so blind by his own ego that he is oblivious the constant mental wear and tear he is putting on my sanity. I do whatever I can for him, and then I hear that he says I'm leeching off him! 

It didn't always used to be like this. Before we got along great, he would have these ""tantrums"" I called them, some times. But it wasn't often. I offered to become roommates and he accepted. It was fine at first, but he would start to get angry over very simple things. Now he acts like he's privilliged for me to bring him where he needs to go or do whatever he says. 

He is bringing me allot of depression and dare I say to the brink of insanity. I want him to leave, but I don't know how to go about it.

64,"I’m a senior in high school, I do decently academically, I have a 3.6 unweighted Gpa, but I don’t have many AP or honors classes. I’m going to graduate soon and I’m not to sure what I’m going to due in the future, I’ve decided that I’d like a STEM area career, mainly more of the Technology and engineering part. If you were to ask me what I want to do in the future specifically, I have no idea. 

My interests are technology, but that’s because I use technology everyday, I’m not real good with circuit boards, I’m terrible at soldering, I’m really not interested in how they work, I did take a “electronics” class in my sophomore year of high school and physics so I’m familiar with how circuit boards work, schematics/circuit diagrams, and how to solder, I thought having the knowledge of circuit boards and the skill of soldering was cool but I really wasn’t that interested 

In my junior year, I took a “intermediate” Engineering class (in my school if you took 3 of the same series of engineering classes in a row, you’d be eligible to take a engineering accreditation test to get certified in cad software) We did stuff like build robots from vex kits, I thought it was cool but my robot was terrible. We also had to build balsa wood towers that weighed no more than 20 grams (Yes Grams) and were supposed to support 200lbs weights for a grade of 100, we designed the towers on CAD software, I thought it was cool even though the CAD drawings I drew were real basic 2d drawings. My tower was crap it broke. I like the idea of engineering, being able to design and make stuff, but math is not my forte and there’s so many different types of engineering that I have no clue which one I’d pick 

Now, currently I’m in a aviation class. We fly flight simulators and learn the fundamentals of aviation, VFR and IFR flight, aerodynamics, aerospace and all that, its about becoming a pilot and preparing us for the FAA written and oral exams to pass the private pilots test, I think planes are cool but I don’t think I’d enjoy flying aircraft as a job and the aircraft licensing and training is expensive. being a pilot sounds like a good job, my teacher who’s a retired airline captain showed us that there’s a demand of 600k pilots in the coming future, but I don’t think a pilots life is for me 

I’ve always wanted to be in the military, but I don’t think I would be able to cut it in the military, I live a sedentary lifestyle majority of my whole life, not very physically capable and I’m overweight. I plan on trying AFROTC when I go to college and see how that works out for me

Let me explain. When you're around your friend's parents you tend to try and act extra polite, being appropriate and respectable. Em just doesn't get that apparently. She acts the same around everyone, namely loud and annoying. For instance me her my family was hosting a little get together on Halloween, my parents, and a couple friends parents were there. She was, the entire time, if not singing loudly at the top of her lungs (even when we all told her to stop) making terrible sex jokes, talking about buying her friend a buttplug, cursing every other word and just being a general nuisance. Now this doesn't bother me usually, but when its around not only my parents but other friend's parents, it's extremely embarrassing. She seems to never actually be aware of her surroundings, to the point where she revealed our friend's carefully hidden sexuality to a group of teachers and other students. I've snapped at her before for acting this way, but she always laughs it off and never takes it seriously, or when I try to approach her one-on-one about it, she immediately says she will change, yet nothing has. I can't get anyone else to talk to her about it, they just all endure the awkwardness when it comes up.

Still, that small detail didn't stop me from approaching her in our history class.


We became friends quickly and began talking almost every day. When summer arrived, we grew even closer. She made every day a thousand times better by simply allowing me to hear her voice. At one point she had to leave to China for a month, and so I'd stay awake until around 6 AM to talk to her. Needless to say, we were close and I became very attached to her.

I don't know what I was thinking. All I know is that my feelings for her were starting to overwhelm me. About a month ago, I gathered the courage to confess to her. When I did, her response was ""I don't know what to say."" To which I replied, ""You don't have to say anything."" This is where everything went to shit.

After my confession, she became indifferent. She began avoiding me and stopped going to our usual lunch spot. I decided to write her a letter apologizing for dropping something like that without warning, and asking to forget about it all and be just friends again. She never responded.  I've been trying to forget about her, but I just can't seem to get her out of my head. She never leaves my thoughts, and even my dreams aren't a safe space anymore.

 I've tried telling myself that I'm making her uncomfortable and should just move on to stop being such a nuisance to her. I've tried telling myself that I should be mad at her for not caring about my feelings and ignoring everything. Nothing works. I'm not even sure if I'm just obsessed at this point.

How do I move on?",05Nov2017,1

Anyways I recently noticed I’m not emotional over anything, I mean sure everyone has there bad days but I tend to feel nothing really like I do get excited over fun stuff and events like I’m a happy girl. But I noticed I don’t cry ever and this is coming from someone who would cry if I saw a homeless person or a sad commercial. Maybe I’m reading into this too deeply but I just  wanna known if it’s normal not to cry for over like a year or feel any sort of sadness or anger for any reason even when I should feel it.

98,"So I recently moved into an apartment with my long time friend right off campus of our college in a small town. Everything was all fine and dandy until the roomie's friend, lets call him Jeff, starts to come over uninvited more and more. He and my roommate are lifetime friends, and they even consider each other family, so I've been finding it difficult to get my roommate to take my side. Jeff is a particularly dirty, clumsy, disgusting and unreliable person, which you'll definitely come to see in this post. 

To start off, whenever he invites himself over, he opens our fridge and helps himself to whatever he sees. Whether it be food I've prepared for myself and have purchased with my own money, or leftovers from restaurants. We moved in only about 2 months ago, and I've lost track of how much food I've lost because of him. He also eats like a complete pig, with his mouth open, dropping crumbs and sauce everywhere and would not even think to clean up after himself.

Secondly, Jeff is the definition of a weed-head and will smoke any time and any place. I've asked on numerous occasions that weed not be smoked inside, outside, or anywhere near my apartment, however he hasn't listened and gotten high on our front and back balconies where many neighbors could have seen. 

Lastly he's ruined numerous things around the apartment. He completely shattered an ice tray trying to remove the ice. Completely stretched out my size 10 sandals with his size 13 feet, leaving them ruined and unwearable by me. And lastly worst of all, he dropped a hookah coal on the carpet, which burned a hole completely through in several spots. This will absolutely, without a doubt stop us from getting our security deposit returned. He claims he'll buy replacements for the things he's broken, and pay for the security deposit which we are absolutely going to lose. But he's a very unreliable person to say the least, and I find it very hard to believe I'll find any retribution here. 

I've tried talking to my roommate, but he usually tries to stay what he calls ""neutral"" by not taking my side or Jeff's. I really don't see a solution here that wouldn't put my friendship with my roommate in jeopardy. Please, help me out Reddit.",05Nov2017,1

However, I believe my oldest friend (30 years of friendship) is not speaking to me and I think it's because I didn't want to/couldn't afford to go to the pool one night. I've been dealing with a lot in my personal life (spouse is suicidal, finances are shit, working two jobs to make ends meet) and I feel like we've always been the type of friends who could go months without contact and pick up where we left off.

We talk for an hour and she buys me a drink we still talk for awhile and then we all head to go eat. (One of her friends and one of mine so 4 of use) I get her number and leave. So we start texting the next day a lot and then continued so for a few more days. We then decide to go to a bar with just each other and we talk for hours again until the bar closers. She says let's head to my apartment and chill. So we do and watch a movie. The whole time we start getting close and closer to each other. After awhile she has her legs on mine then I start having my hands over her legs. Then after a little while we are holding hand and such. Then after the movie we just talk for awhile and then she says she is tired and I should go. It was 4 am. She texts me later saying she had fun and we should do it again sometime. A few more days go by then I ask her to go out again and she says she would love to then I say ""I suggest like the bar again or dinner or a movie at her place or something. Then I also said do you want this to be a date? "" If it were up to me I would and no response for like 6 hours now and we were talking decently before this so now I'm worried.

Update: Yea I see now I was an absolute idiot and she still never replied to it. She did reply to my Snapchat though but that was of me saying late night at work sucks and such. So what now?

I was going to sneak out the gate leading to the parking lot, but stupidly didn't bother to check if anyone was on the other side of the wall.

116,"I kinda ran out of ideas of what to do with my life since yesterday. I had a plan that more or less had been working, not exactly as planned but still. 

I left Brazil on February to come to Russia and work as a ""volunteer"", teaching English and Portuguese in a city south of Moscow. It work out at first, but soon the cultural differences regarding the educational process and methodology became apparent to the point where I decided to leave the school (not gonna go into details about that unless necessary for comprehension and advice).

Back in Brazil I had a pretty good career prospect at a law firm, translating patents, and also as a conference interpreter - things that I had to stop doing once I arrived. The time difference and workload took care of that.

Not long ago I was offered a position at another language institute in the Siberia region, paid, work paper provided and they would also provide an apartment for no cost at all. It seemed simply perfect, and I embraced this opportunity.

However, in order to make any changes to one visa status one must leave the country and request the new visa elsewhere. I talked to the folks at the institute and we agreed that they would sent my invitation letter to Moldova, where I would apply at the Russian embassy for the work visa. Why Moldova? Well, my girlfriend has been living there, so it just seemed easier, pleasant and cheap. 

I applied for the Moldovan visa, got it in one or two days and went there with no further delays at the beginning of October. The invitation was supposed to arrive by the 10th - but it didn't until the 25th, which was the last available I had in the country before my visa expires (I tried to extent it but they didn't accept it for ""lack of reason""). 

I left Moldova with my invitation and no time to go to the Russian embassy and apply for the visa. As a Brazilian, I can enter Russia and stay here for 90 days without any problems, and that's what I did. I planned to stay here for about 3 days, apply for the Moldovan visa again, go there and get my shit done in a week-ish time period. 

As it is now, they have not issued the visa yet, they haven't answered any of my emails (which they did within hours of difference at the end of September), the Russian embassy doesn't pick up the phone when I call or reply emails, my budget is reaching it's limit and I have no way of getting an income without this freaking work visa.

I emailed the institute explaining the situation and asking if it would be okay to go there and just do some work as a ""volunteer"" for this period, thing that was suggested, in the first place, by them, and received the following answer: I have to talk to the director (which for me at least implies that they are probably gonna deny this request).

Now I'm in Moscow feeling pretty much like Ton Hanks in the movie ""The Terminal"". Any suggestions/advice? Anyone based in Moscow with a cheaper-than-my-current-hostel place to stay or a ""volunteer"" job that could give me something to do and an income for the time being? 

I'd like to say that I'm calm and can see a light at the end of this, but I'm not, I don't and I won't until (if) I have a positive answer about the job over there or any other doable possibility.

Thanks for reading, it definitely went longer than I expected.

117,"Two years ago, I broke up with someone I was with with for 8 years. At the time, I was about to finish university and I was going through a strange time. I thought our relationship had run its course, that it was over because we weren't having much sex, and that we had grown apart. I look back now and I see that so much of that relationship would have been better if I had made more of an effort and communicated my needs rather than just bailing on it. I see now that what I had with him was extremely rare, irreplaceable, and I'll never meet somebody so well matched with me.

Over the last two years, I have been periodically homeless, abused by a subsequent boyfriend, I picked up a drug habit, I was sexually propositioned by my mothers husband, my grandfather passed away and I have had a mental breakdown. I am now 28 years old and living with my mother, awaiting psychiatric treatment. 

I feel utterly hopeless and unlovable. I've lost the love of my life, I'll never find anything even close to that again and I didn't even deserve it in the first place. I don't feel like my life is worth living. It's just a pointless struggle and the only thing that stops me from killing myself is that I don't want to traumatise my 9 year old half sister.

He has me blocked on all social media and I have largely managed to maintain no contact, out of respect for his wishes. He does a podcast and I can't bring myself to listen to it but I do read the content descriptions and he's out there giving advice to people about how to be happier and have good relationships. When I see how okay he is and what a loving, happy person he is, how much fun he's having without me ruining his life, I want to kill myself.

When i started the academic year i was super pumped, i had changed my perspective on education and was ready to see the material not as something to just write on a test but as the thing i truly love ( which is science ) but that motivation has drained away.

I studied really hard the last year, too hard even. I told myself that i never want to go through that suffering ever again but now i feel like its returning. For the past few months Ive been getting debilitating headaches and aches whenever i got started on my school work. Its ok now, but the weird thing is i don't want it to be ok, because then I'll actually have an excuse for not doing my work; but i still cant work right like i used to. I'm losing sleep, i feel so tired in class, it really sucks.

and i know that the best advice someone can give is "" imagine a terrible future as a consequence of not doing well in school."" but i don't see a terrible future even if i drop out. i really want to become an entrepreneur and i already have some ideas that i want to pursue. I have plans to invent some things ( one i already did ). i want to write an educational book series and some novels. Education wise, i can do a foundation if i want and pursue psychology ( something i am excited about ) but im afraid my motivation for that too will be drained. If i do something that i actually care about, i go all out, utilizing all my skills, my knowledge and my passion but when i just have to something, i do a half ass job.

The truth is I'm too scared to drop out, but i feel like im trapped, like i can do greater things but not when i have to spend a few more years slaving away. Please let me know what you think and how i can get motivated to continue with school stuff. Much appreciated.

119,"So a year or so ago, an Instagram account was made of me by a boy I’m not going to name.
On this account he thought it be funny to send Messages to young girls. 
Anyway when I confronted him about. He took the account down when he found out the police would be getting involved. 

Present Day 
Yesterday I was walking around my local town when I bumped into a girl who recognised me because of the account. 
She then called me Pedo Alan, and said I was the kid who threatened to rape her and stuff. 
I said i have no clue who you are, 
She said your shittyfacealan (Instagram Username)
I said that wasn’t me, it was “the Boy”, 
She said don’t lie it was you. It had your face all over it. 
It had your name, date of birth, where you live, your mobile number and more. 
I said I promise you that wasn’t me. 
She the shouted I was a pedo in public and what made it worst I was about 50ft from a children’s park. 

When I got home I decided to message the boy who had made the account
Questioning him about the messages he sent to this girl. 
I said I was reporting him to the police on the counts of Identity Theft, and Pedophilic Behaviour to girls under the age of consent 
He then said LOL. And tried to black mail me into submission with threats and stuff. 
I said he had three days to do what’s right and send messages to the girls stating it was you that sent the messages, and send screenshots of the chats to prove it. 
He called me a low life scumbag. 
He then blocked me on every social media. 

Summary
I have no proof apart from a eyewitness to the account being set up. 
What should I do, with no proof this could backfire on me very badly.

Yet, she never showed up for the final two classes so I couldn't try and engage with her again.  

I caught her once in the hall and said hi tried to ask her how she was but she got weirded out.

I'm 19 and I have two chronic illnesses - stage 4 kidney disease and Crohn's disease. It has ruined my life and I'm fighting them everyday. Every few weeks there seems to be a new side effect like arthritis or nausea. I've had to leave university because they couldn't do anything to help me with my attendance which is fair. But I'm also missing out so much. I am such an ambitious person and I had so much planned for me and then I got diagnosed w kidney disease two years ago and I just can't seem to get back off my feet. I honestly thought the uni and their disability centre would be able to help and it still crushes me that they couldnt. I'd love to get a degree but not through online uni, I want to make friends and be face to face. 

I used to work but now I don't because I'm scared I'll get fired or won't be able to commit. I was sick so much in my last job that I quit before they could let me go. I have good days and bad days but I can never tell when they will be. I have dreams of living overseas, somewhere like Ireland or America. I've been to both to visit but every time I look up health care for visitors in these countries it crushes me.

I see all my friends from school nearly finished university and travelling and partying and working part time. I had ambitions to do politics and history and travel but it's just not realistic with this condition. 

I sometimes just wonder why I'm waiting around to get better when for three years it's only gotten worse. Hope is the only thing that has kept me going but when I look back, my situation has stayed the same. I'm not going forward! 

I want to apply for a film editing course next year. I'm in bed watching movies and TV shows so much that it's all that I can kind of think of doing. I want to be able to get through it and achieve something. But I'm so scared and thinking realistically I won't. You can tell that my friends and family even think I won't when I tell them. 

Has anyone else had a chronic illness from a young age? That impeded them at first but then they made a life for themselves? I want and need to hear stories of success from people with chronic illnesses. 

Sorrrrry for the rant. I don't want to sound like an angsty teen. And I know it comes across as me feeling sorry for myself. But I want to have a lifestyle that I'm proud of. I want to live like a young person. And I'm really really giving up hope for the first time. ",05Nov2017,22

I have been really good at hiding a lot of things that I do from my family because I know that i'd be judged harshly and that I would anger and distress them. So i choose to hide the fact that I drink and smoke occasionally and have romantic relationships here and there. My family is very conservative and I have played along with it for a long time and it made me deeply unhappy so I have distanced myself from that. They have seen my taking those steps away from religiosity as me losing my mind and they have taken it as such a personal assault. 
I am at the stage in my life where I know the kind of lifestyle that I want to live and it isn't the lifestyle my parents accept at all. 
So in the last couple of months my parents and siblings pretty much found out that I have a few friends that smoke weed and drink and have premarital sex. These friends are not wild or unhinged in any way but my family sees them as a massively destructive influence. 
When they found these things out we talked and we decided to go to a family therapy session to resolve a lot of our underlying issues as well as the 'issue' of my friends. The therapy session was a start and I felt like the doors of open and honest communication were opened and that it was a step that really needed to be taken.

Cut to present day.

Me and my closest friend have been planning an overseas trip for over six months. I hadnt told my parents about it because I was scared of their reaction and I tend to avoid confrontation. Today, a week after our therapy session, all my siblings were over and I decided I'd tell them. There are three weeks until my trip. I told them and they lost it.
Everybody was yelling at me and telling me that the family was obviously not a priority for me and that I didn't really care about mending family ties etc. I said that I obviously want  to make peace with everybody and have a happy and healthy relationship with everyone but I don't see why my going on a month trip will completely derail that.
There were many words exchanged and my mum basically gave me an ultimatum that my entire family agreed to. The ultimatum was that I either give up my trip and give up my friendships with my 'problematic' friends or I will be cut off from the family completely and be kicked out of home.

I feel like i've been put in this impossible position. This is something I have been working towards all year and have been so excited about. It has kept me going all year long, and for them to make that ultimatum...I don't know. If i give in to whatever they want, am I going to have to mold my life according to whatever they want for me. I want my familys support and love unconditionally and I want to be free to live my life how I choose. And if i fail and make mistakes, I'll learn and grow and I want them to have my back and I want to always be there for them too. I know that I am not perfect and I could do a million things better when it comes to my family. I know I need to be better with them. 
I also want to live life!
 
My mum wanted me to make the decision there and then but I didn't give any sort of clear answer and kept repeating that I don't think anybody is in a rational frame of mind and we need someone objective to counsel us through this. 

At this stage, I know what feels right for me. I just need some objective advice. ",05Nov2017,1

I really don't know how to put it but i'm the oldest of two sisters and i am a constant failure to my family (academically, socially and visually) and i've been isolating myself because of that.

If i just catch a glimpse of her i feel an overwhelming urge to cry because she's beautiful from the inside out and so successful in all she does. I feel so worthless because we are so contrasting.

138,"Hey,
So I do believe in God. I've been to Catholic mass a few times, and to Methodist ones. I like the saints in Catholicism but I honestly don't think the Bible is ""God's infallible word,"" because there is just so much violence and hatred within many parts of it. I thought I was a Christian Deist for awhile, then a Taoist. I am really struggling with religion but I want to have faith at least. I have family that is Methodist and very conservative, and, although good people, are often extremely judgmental and narrow-minded when talking about other peoples' beliefs and I feel very judged by them because I don't regularly attend church, and apparently they think that all people who attend church must be good people and vice versa. I am not really sure what to believe. I find Christianity has a lot of values that are good but also has a lot of content in the Old Testament I don't really agree with. I also feel like so much is missing from the Bible that has selectively been taken out throughout history and I find that the LGBTQ community is treated badly often due to extreme ""Christian"" views and there is just so much judgement. I related to the Taoist philosophy but there is not one God in their religion, and, as a Westerner, I find polytheism to be a very unfamiliar concept. I am very confused but I want to follow something I can believe in, or at least have personal faith, maybe without religion. Any suggestions for philosophies I could look into, or do you think I should just be spiritual and not religious?

140,"Dear Reddit,

I  hope you all are well.

I am a long long lurker of reddit and this is my first time creating a username simply because I had no idea who to go to. For many years, I enjoyed simply lurking and looking for good material to read and the comments are always great to scroll through.

Last year, around December I quit my job of 9 years as an accountant at a top firm in NYC. I do not hold a bachelors degree, however, I had great mentors who taught me everything I knew and basically had a great salary and perks. I was never much of  saver - I grew up poor and never really had anyone to truly help me on finances and I understand I made a great mistake by not saving money all these years. I did, however, saved enough money to last me until now. I ended up leaving my company because I was bored, annoyed with the people, I wasn't happy and always anxious and depressed and wanted to pursue a new way of life. Currently I am enrolled in school for Graphic design. I am absolutely in love with it, however, I have ran out of money and I am terrified at balancing work and school and to top it all off I am an ex-cancer patient. I have a very weak leg and other parts of my body are weak - in other words I do not possess the same stamina as a regular individual. I am at a point where I am applying for my Spring semester next year but I don't have anymore money and I will have to take out a loan. 

Essentially, I need advice ... what can I possibly work in at the moment? Is there anyway I can pay off school a different way at the moment? Financial aid isn't covering me for the Spring and I can't get the grant that NYC is now offering. Like I am so lost on how to proceed and I don't know who to ask or where to go. 

Please help me :(",05Nov2017,1
141,"So. Long story short. My best friend since I was 5 was diagnosed with bipolar 3 years ago. I have really really tried to be there for him as much as possible, but it led to a few issues. He’d make me feel guilty for not helping, and my grades started falling. My associate dean actually pulled me in his office and told me in a nice way that I need to handle whatever I’m going through emotionally if I want to stay in my major. . And now I’ve started to place boundaries and he became emotionally abusive (It was bad) a few days ago. Even after explaining how hurtful it was to me and that I was going to breakdown at work if I continued to listen, he simply stated it wasn’t his problem and not his fault if I take what he was saying that way. I realized I could not enable that behavior by staying in the friendship at this time. Even if I love him as much as I do my family. And I do. It hurts significantly more to cut him off than to deal with his hurtful words or actions, but I also know no therapist would ever say that’s a good reason to stay. 

Sorry not so short. But now I’m stuck without someone who has been my best friend for practically all my living memory. I don’t know how to begin healing from this. From the pain of losing the most important person to me outside of my immediate family. From the pain his friendship was causing me. Life is not imaginable without him. I need tips",05Nov2017,1

I met up with the guy and be told me he'd be keen on hiring me full time as an apprentice.

144,"I can't seem to form meaningful friendships. I have no problem bonding with people romantically, but when it comes to platonic friendship I fail miserably. This has been a problem from about age 14 onwards. I moved to a new town, new school, and never really found my place with any particular group after that. I had friends, but we never hung out outside of school. I'm in my 20s now and I still completely suck at forming friendships.

Time and time again I meet someone. At first things go well. They seem to like me, I like them. I'm good at making first impressions I guess, but then it's all downhill from there. For whatever reason, they stop messaging first. I'm always the one who keeps contact. They grow distant. At this point I realise what's happening. They're taking the path of least resistance and subtlely pushing me away. Eventually we stop communicating altogether. It drives me crazy because by being totally non-confrontational, I never understand what happened or what went wrong. So whatever it is, it's bound to repeat itself.

I do have ongoing problems with social anxiety. I lack confidence, and after rejection after rejection I now find it extremely difficult to trust people or let my guard down. I'm always searching for signs of rejection to the point where I overthink every little thing. Every time this sort of thing happens, it just reinforces my belief that there is something deeply wrong with me, something off putting. I just don't know what it is exactly, or how to even begin fixing it.",05Nov2017,1
145,"We are both 26, we started dating when we were in high school during our senior year.  I have always been up front about what I want in life, most importantly is having kids.  She has always seemed hesitant but willing to try eventually.  But, we never really determine when this 'eventually will happen.  We were talking today and ahe told me she has been lieing this whole time and never wanted kids at all, ever.  So, for 9 years I have been with someone, who I still love very much, but has misled me because she was scared to lose me.  I may have been being naive by thinking it would all work out, but I feel like she has been very selfish to mislead me into believing that it would eventually happen.  I can't help but wonder if I had known from the beginning, would we have broken up before we were too emotionally invested? And, if we had broken up, would I have possibly found someone who makes me happy, and wants kids?  At this point I feel like we are both left with horrible decisions, she has to either have a child she didn't want, (which I know is her choice and am not trying to imply I would try to make her), or she has to accept whatever choice I make.  And I have to chose to leave the woman I love, or give up on the idea of having a child.

146,"(Im not an english speaker, excuse the grammar mess)

I just realized, there is no such a thing like knowing other people. I mean really knowing him, her excepte if you are in love...maybe.

Broke up a ten year long friendship and since im licking my wounds, consume the things. One of the reasons (there was bunch of them) was, my best friend didnt know me, didnt wanted to know me (never interested, or just asked why i like things, what i feel). I knew a ton of things about him. even if i didnt cared i asked stuffs about his hobbies, music.

 We were at a party where our mutual friend had his birthday. He got the perfect gift from him. A gift what was simple but its showed that you know the person. He knows this guy about 5 years. All my birthday i almost always got alcohol as a gift and he know that i barerly drink. So i always gave to the others. That was the turning point.

Realized there is no knowing each other deep, because even if you are in love, the other dont care what you REALLY are. Friends, lovers just care what you show. If you show you are the funny person, they want that ALWAYS, and if you show emotions, or you are not funny just for a day, they INGORE you. Im experienced that!

People dont want to know someone else, they want themselves to be grabbed out of the reality. They dont want to deal with emotions, more informations, they want only them. This is why emitoonless people get friends easily, get chicks, get fame. Your best friend dont want to know who you are, she/he want to spend time with someone, because dont want to be in his/her reality. ",05Nov2017,0

We were passing the bong and a blunt. The cops walk up to us with flashlights and we all freeze. The cops identify the bong,

My boyfriends dad is a pastor at the neighboring church, so the house that they live in is mortgage free. Overall, they’re doing pretty okay financially.

My boyfriend and I both really liked this idea, and have been thinking about investing money into her business as well. 
However, last night at dinner, his dad said that if they didn’t buy the storefront they wanted to buy us a “fixer upper” house in the city they live in. 

There are two issues with this. I don’t want to live and raise our child in this city. It’s a bit trashy, and has a terrible school system. I wouldn’t mind renting for a few years, but in no way do I want to live here long term. Also, the time and money it would take a rehab an entire house in this city is way over our budget right now. 

I don’t know how to explain this to them without seeming rude. They’re very conservative, and even took offense to me describing them as “innocent” one time.

First, I'm an Eagle Scout, so I'd get that extra salary right off the bat. I'd be able to save most of the money since I'd be stationed on a ship. I would also get the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which would make college even more affordable. I'd have experience in my field of interest, accounting(at least from what I've read about being a storekeeper). I'd also be able to travel the world, learn to be disciplined in everything that I do, and also get more fit.

She was my first real girlfriend and I consider my time with her the best emotional experience of my life, as well as my peak of happiness. I wanna stress that we were madly in love. However,   in 2015, she broke up with me. The details of the breakup aren't that important. Just know that she was the one that broke up with me, and she gave a very vague reason for it. I was heartbroken, but she said we could remain friends, which I was cool with.   However, it was clear that she didn't really want to be friends when she started ignoring me. Suddenly, her best friend (I'll call her Alexis) messaged me. I didn't know Alexis that much. I just knew that the two were very close. Alexis expressed sympathy for me, and disclosed to me that the reason Sarah broke up with me was because she wanted to take this guy to prom at our school. I believed Alexis. She then told me that it was unfair how Sarah was treating me, and that I should write her an ""angry letter."" I refused at first, but Alexis kept telling me all these things about Sarah and that boy, and I got madder and madder. I eventually wrote the angry letter in the form of a text.  This made Sarah immediately reply, and we got into an argument. Come to find out, Alexis was lying to me. About the whole thing. Both were trying to see how far I could go, because they thought that when you love someone you can't get angry at them. They were playing me, essentially, to see if I would get mad. We argued for maybe two days. I say arguing, but in reality I was religiously apologizing while she was telling me how bad of a person I am. Eventually, she breaks contact with me. She never really blocked me though. I can still send her messages and she still replies, but it's almost usually something along the lines of ""screw off."" Should I even bother getting her back?

180,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here, and I have a major stressor right now. Last night, me and my girlfriend were having some fun, it was great, but I am worried. That I may have gotten her pregnant. While we were having our fun I had lots of pre-cum. I made sure to clean it all of before I did anything. But my biggest concern is we didn't use protection and it was our first time. I was dry when I decided to put it in. But I'm still very worried, after maybe 30 seconds, I quickly stopped, I didn't put it in too much, or too fast, but I'm still worried sick. I've been talking to her and she says that everything will be alright! She told me that she will get her period in about 2 weeks, which is a long time..is there any way we can tell earlier?

I know I fucked up and I regret doing it, I have had a very long sleepless night and I just want some reassurance and advice from you guys. We both don't have jobs but do very well in school, and my last wish ever is to negativly affect her life. I've been worried sick and I just need some help..thank you.",05Nov2017,2

182,"Hi all. I’m 18, been graduated for 4 months now and I am really, really REALLY torn right now. I am stuck between ambition and desire.

1. On one hand, I want to go to university and eventually law school so that I might work towards a career in law and eventually possibly politics. This is obviously the wiser, more secure choice.

2. On the other hand, I want to leave it all behind and just go live a peaceful, quiet, happy and beautiful life in Hawaii (namely Kauai). Where I’d work by day and surf, swim, hike, or party on the beach by night. Maybe meet a girl there and settle down and live out the remainder of my life in a paradise.

I feel a sort of guilt for even admitting to that desire. For some reason it feels wrong to me but if I’m honest with myself I want it much more than I want the former.

How do I make this decision? Is the second one just completely unambitious and shortsighted?

The male perspective was then later opened for discussion..

I said that men are often taken advantage of because of their success; where I used the term ""success object.""

It was pretty personal (i.e. sexual) and when it happened I was miffed but mostly just rolled my eyes at her snide remark.

189,"I write. I draw. I love writing, and I love drawing. I'm not the greatest, but whenever I finish something, I always feel so proud of what I do. I try to be open to criticism and I always say ""criticism encouraged!"" Except I can't actually take it when it's given to me.

Externally, I take it. I'll say ""thanks, I really appreciate it!"" and tell them how much it means to me, but on the inside I'm berating myself for every little shortcoming and sometimes I get so depressed over my work being criticized that I almost want to give up writing or drawing altogether. In the end, criticism really is something I believe helps, and something I think everyone should learn to take, because the ability to self-reflect and improve from other people's words is very admirable. But despite how much I believe in that, I can't help but feel like absolute utter garbage whenever someone tells me I've failed in some form. The worst part is I set myself up for it too. I'm not a confident person by default, but sometimes I'll spend all day working on something and pump it out to go ""y'know I feel really proud of this one"" and then receive a particularly scathing critique which just flattens me for the day. So because of my inability to handle critique properly, I start becoming overly modest and self-deprecating to avoid the pain.

And I don't like that one bit. It doesn't just apply to my skills, it applies to my life in general. I'm constantly self-deprecating myself for everything I do, because I know the moment I try to gain a little bit of confidence, someone will shut me down and I'll feel like garbage. So to me, it feels so much more right to just act like I'm garbage from the beginning and have other people build me up. Even though I know that's not right.
I'm hesitant to be confident about anything - raising my hand in class, showing off my artwork or writing, even little stupid shit like telling myself I'm not quite as ugly as I seem to think I am. I don't want to be confident about anything because being confident means I'll eventually get shut down, and I can't handle that feeling.

What am I supposed to do? I don't want to become so confident that my ego gets squashed at the slightest criticism, but I don't want to live a life of self-deprecation where the people around me build me up. I just wish I could hit some nice middle balance where I'm happy and confident in what I do and don't feel like a stupid idiot just because I mess up sometimes. How do I achieve this?",05Nov2017,1

The problem is, that we have many mutual friends. Whenever we (friends) go out she is being malicious, biased and sometimes aggressive (pushing, sometimes hitting - not powerfull enough to hurt me but it is annoying and unpleasant as hell) towards me.

204,"We (a couple) have been good friends with these people, another young couple, for about a year now and enjoy spending time with them. Both of them suffer from chronic health issues that can sometimes make it difficult for them to function in everyday life but so far they have been able to find appropriate accommodations at work, etc. and both have supportive families. Except for one thing: their pets.

They live in a smaller two bedroom house and have 3 cats and a dog. I hesitate to call this hoarding because it does not seem like a great enough number of animals to typically cause problems and all animals are healthy physically, fed healthy diets, given attention and pets and toys to play with etc. and receive regular veterinary care. 

The problem is cleanliness: they let the dog and cats have free roam of the house. The dog is given toys to rip up and scatter bits of fabric and stuffing all throughout the house. She also suffers from severe separation anxiety and will howl if left alone outside for longer than a few minutes at a time. She is energetic and restless but I feel this due to her not getting proper exercise which I feel they are not able to provide her on a daily basis as any young dog needs. They take her out to the park 2 or 3 times a week and feel this is enough and are adamant about not leaving her outside despite living in a mild climate with a big backyard. With training I think she could make a great family dog.

The cats I feel are much worse. They spray urine and defecate and vomit all over the house/rug and generally make a mess of things. Again my friends are often lacking the energy to clean up after them. They have gotten better about litterbox cleaning etc. (they have 2 litterboxes for 3 cats) but sometimes it can still get quite bad. We can and have offered to help them clean before but they are eventually unable to keep up and wind up right back where they started.

217,"I'm using a throwaway account, and this is kind of a long story, so please bare with me...

In August, I (20F) moved in with three (18-20F) girls in an apartment associated with my university (that detail is important for later). I was randomly assigned to them, but they were all friends before we moved in. We all have our own rooms, but we share a living room, bathroom, and there are two bathrooms so we each share the bathroom with one other person.

I am going to call them A, B, and C. A is the girl I share a bathroom with. She is generally very nice, and the only issues we've had are typical roommate things on both ends, like cleaning preferences, leaving stuff around in the bathroom, etc. Otherwise we get along just fine.

The other two, B and C, are the ones I've struggled to get along with the most, most of it having to do with them being extremely hypocritical. Whenever my best friend, or any of my friends for that matter, the two of them (especially C) act extremely rude to them and act as though they wish they weren't there (rolling their eyes, ignoring them when they say hi, etc.) however their boyfriends are here/sleep over so often that they are basically living here rent free...I never say anything since the boyfriend are generally nice/clean up after themselves but it's still frustrating.

They are also extremely strict when it comes to me doing the dishes/cleaning. They are always telling me to do the dishes, when I 95% of the time do my own when I eat something and they literally leave theirs in the sink...so I am just doing their own dishes. They don't bug each other about it, only me. C also got mad at me once because I didn't clean the whole kitchen after she asked me to do the dishes (unsurprisingly I ONLY did the dishes...) which was really weird...I can't read her mind. I will say really quickly that it's not that I never clean, I do my share of the housework (dishes/wiping tables/laundry/trash/usual normal stuff) but they only call ME out on things like that.

The last thing is they are always judging how I cook. Now, I'm no chef, but I know how to make a couple meals and am pretty self sufficient, but they always give side eye or ask me why I don't cook/prepare food a certain way. I figure, as long as I clean up after myself, it shouldn't really matter how I cook...

I'm just really frustrated. I want to talk to them, but I am extremely awkward/non-assertive/un-confrontational, which I'm pretty sure B and C are aware of at this point (if it helps, too, I was recently diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome...) A is somewhat aware of their behavior but idk if she is just used to how they are or doesn't feel like saying anything to them.

I just feel very ganged up on and could really use some help...",05Nov2017,1
218,"TL;DR - Someone from my childhood came back into my life and we're falling in love, but her life style and mine are very different. How can I work hard to be a better fit for her career wise?


I had a childhood friend growing up. She had the same babysitter as toddlers and we essentially spent our entire childhood together. After high school, she went to college like 30+ hours away and while we kept in slight contact, it obviously was hard to keep up a friendship. Fast forward 7 years;

I'm working for a company doing some minor tech support and logistics. It's not a huge company and I only make about 17/hr and I DOUBT (but cant rule out) that I'll get another real raise anytime soon. She was in an upper-middle class family and after college she got a great job and it's clear she lives a much more lavish life style THAN I do. I'm not humble bragging for her, I know her perfume isn't top of the line rich girl stuff, but 70$ for a bottle compared to mine being 20$ at the most expensive and me kinda feeling like I over paid. 

My car is a 97 Civic. She drives a 17 chevy malibu, again, not saying she's rich, but the different in our vehicles is very huge. I cut my own hair and wear t shirts and jeans. She pays a stylist to make her hair fantastic at least once a month and wears very nice clothes. 

We've started talking again and after about a month, I asked her if she wanted to go out on a date. And then we did. and another. and another. and now we're a thing. But I -feel- like I want to be BETTER for her. It's not a ""will she love me for who I am?"" so much as a, I want to be better because I dont want ANYONE to think less of her or as if she's dating down I think. She makes a LOT more than I do and has an actual career. I flunked out of college and I had student loans I'm still paying off and I don't think I can afford to juggle a full time job + full time school if they even let me get more loans to go BACK to school. 

I know there are NO fast tracks to success. But is there any way for someone with drive and conviction to climb to a better job without having to go to school? What careers should I be looking into if I want to make enough money where I'm making 25+ /hr or something around that area. I want to buy a house, not rent. I want to have a new car, not a used car that, while VERY reliable, doesn't LOOK good. 

I know it sounds superficial and vain. I know she's not a haughty person or one who worries a ton about wealth or anything. But to me, if she's spending 70$ on perfume, I want to spend some on my stuff so I smell good for her. I want to wear nicer clothes and do more than one big date a month. Any advice would be wonderful. 

I live in a large city, so I have the opportunity to look into a lot of things!

224,"I've had this problem since I was young, and I really hate the feeling.

If I find someone physically attractive and nice (e.g., they talk to me?), I'll easily start crushing on them. It's almost always ""harmless"" and I'll never act upon it -- I might be a little bit more playful when talking with them, but it doesn't seem out of character as I'm naturally bubbly and loud anyway. It's not like I want anything more to happen.

However, it's extremely frustrating because 1) it happens so easily and frequently, 2) I don't know why it happens, and 3) it takes up a lot of space in my head. I'll start fantasizing or playing out scenarios in my head, etc. Again, never stuff that I actually act upon.

I am in what appears to be a nonstop funk. I am a student at a very good college, and doing alright in my classes. This year my 3 best friends and I (myself, another guy, and 2 girls) decided to room together, but recently things got really bad. One of the girls in the room started verbally abusing me (she told me to kill myself, said I'm messed up, etc.), and this got me really angry/sad so I went to a local administrator to see if they could remove her from the room. In the midst of all of this, I got very, very drunk one night and ended up having a mental breakdown-- at one point, I threw my roommates' speaker on the ground. She told the administration about this, and they decided to kick me out of the room. Then, she later said that I tried to ""murder her"" (a claim which is entirely untrue), so the school put me in a psychiatric unit for a few days. Upon return, I was told that I would no longer be allowed back in the room and I would have to move to a new suite with people I do not know. Additionally, I would have to attend weekly therapy groups, two alcohol-abuse training workshops, and a sexual assault prevention workshop.

I sincerely don't know what to do or where to go. I've tried talking things out, but the school is insistent on kicking me out of the room and (from what it appears) they're trying to ""get me.""

231,"I am a good student —with a 3.8 GPA in Biochemistry, and I will be graduating this year and going onto graduate school.  I have been taking 20mg of XR Adderall everyday since I was in 8th grade —legally. I am not sure if I ever even had ADHD because I vividly remember wanting to get Adderall when I was in 8th grade thus maybe not being 100% honest when taking the test.  However, my dosage has never went up or down since 8th grade (not sure if that matters). 

Regardless, Adderall has been a permanent fixture in my life ever since, and now I need it; when I don’t take the Adderall I feel unrelenting fatigue, and honestly can’t even function, but I don’t think that that’s because I’m ADHD, but instead because I’m physically addicted to Adderall.

232,"My father in law is a good man. He's been married for 35 years to the same woman, raised two adult kids, paid for their educations, cars, etc. Takes his wife onto trips. We now have a grandson and he's a great grandfather when taking care of it.

His alcoholism has come to a head recently: 3 months into us being new parents, my wife needed a mental break and desparately needed a full night's sleep. Thus left me alone with DS and some milk she pumped and drove to her inlaws house. When she arrived, her dad was passed out on the couch, drunk, shirt on backwards upside down, a mess strewn all over. Imagine yourself without a stretch of sleep longer than 3 hours for 3 months, during a desperate time of need to rest, coming home to what you believe is a sanctuary, and not only finding the person you trust incapacitated, but also bringing up all of the anxiety from her childhood.

Some color (as much as I am aware) on his behavior and some more minor symptoms: Her father has abandonment issues both social significance issues.

Abandonment issues - his father left him and his mother, straight up, when he was a young man. He internalized it as he wasn't good enough or he was unwanted. He became quite indecisive and permission seeking. Today, it manifests itself as unable to make decisions around very basic things: ordering a side dish at a restaurant, picking the right color gardening hose, choosing the right parking lot at the movie theatre all take, I kid you not, 10 minutes.

Social Significance - FIL was an executive in the 1970's during the hay days of the oil industry. Since retirement, he's struggled with the need to be significant and being surrounded by people seeking his advice. Today, it manifests itself as him creating artificial situations of people enmasse around him. For example, he would like to double pane the windows at his house as they are a bit old. He hired and got bids from 10-15 contractors, who he asked all to come over to the house, so that he could talk 1-2 hours about the project with them. This is 6 windows we are talking about, not rebuilding a an entire foundation.

I pride myself as a problem solver and a diplomat, who's good at confronting the real issues and creating systems that enable everyone to win. I do have some ideas on how to remedy this but also I'm looking to y'all for some advice on how I should proceed:

What I am NOT looking for:

- Your stories of alcoholic FIL. I understand, plenty of you out there, with heartbreaking stories, and desperate measures. I am sympathetic to your stories, but this is not a post to aggregate these stories.

- Solutions that begin with ""Just..."" I don't need another person to tell me ""Just ignore him"",""Just tell him to go to rehab"",""Just keep alcohol away from him."" These are not solutions, am sure you all agree.

- Arguments with facts. Face it, people don't make decisions based on facts. If you disagree, look at who's president. Telling him X% of people who are alcoholics die Y years younger isn't going to help.

What I need help with are pragmatic ways that will help him be a part of the solution:

- How do I frame it as something he is going to be with

- How do I set limits and what are those limits

- How do I deal with the inevitable screw up even if he was doing good

- How do I involve others in the family

Thank you guys so much for all of your help! I will report back.",05Nov2017,5

I want to have sex so badly. especially recently. Every slightly sexy picture online causes me to fantasize about sex. When I'm reading a book, I can't read past the place where relationships are involved. This is getting crazy to me.

I got to know one girl recently with whom I got along well. We are meeting up somewhere next week to have sex.

I am really scared to do this. I know there's a chance of getting AIDS. I know that after the act I'll be scared for my own health, I'll be convinced I already got some STD and will die soon. I always overreact to things, I overreacted to minor health issues in past. Heck, this summer I caught some especially strong cold and part of me was convinced I'll not make it through it. A cold can develop to pneumonia you know, and you can die of that. You can imagine now how I feel about having sex.

On the other hand the pull to do it is totally crazy. I have my heart pounding the entire day. I always wanted to try taking a bath with a girl. Then worship her feet. Then go to bed together, feel her touch and warmth. I want to know how her pussy juice tastes. In past these were just fantasies. But now I know there's a good chance of it happening... These dreams are so real and are just driving me crazy. Heck I even booked a room for us in a hotel already.

I have dated somewhat since we broke up and had 2 not serious relationships. They didn't compare to him at all (but ended for different reasons). I keep thinking about how he said he would never leave me, how he wanted to marry me, how he wanted to have children with me. He was so unbelievably romantic, a couple of weeks before dumping me sending me a long valentine's day text to me when I was in the hospital about how he prayed to the gods above (even though we are both atheist) that we would be together.

I feel so hopeless about finding another relationship like we had one day, and I feel so shitty about stepping backwards in getting over him.

237,"I am happily married to my husband who I have been with for about 4 years and some change.  My husband has lived an exciting, amazing life so far.  At the age of 18 he gave up going to college to travel all of Europe for a whole year living out of a backpack.  He was unsure of what he wanted to go to school for so he decided to explore the world and experience different cultures and people.  He was finally finished backpacking so he moved from Tucson to Phoenix where he met his future ex husband where they moved to Mexico City for a few months than later to Prague for 4 years.  After living in Prague they moved back to Mexico City where they got married but.  Things were on the rocks already but they ended up getting married with only his ex’s mom being there and they had went to dinner afterwards and he told me when he got home he balled his eyes out because it was not truly what he wanted but he is completely disconnected from his family and talks to no one from his family.  He had no ties elsewhere or to anyone but his ex.  His family disowned him when he came out before he met his ex when he was 20.  But anyways, shortly after their marriage they broke up and were off and on for about a year an a half which ultimately led him moving back to Phoenix where a friend offered him to stay with them for free. I met him shortly after he moved to Phoenix but he was still a married man.  I wanted to give you a brief insight on his life.  I was taken back when he told me he was married but he said it was due to immigration purposes and didn’t mean anything but it’s hard to believe since he was with his ex for about 6 years.  Although, he was his first and has been with him since it is difficult to just up and leave especially when his ex controls the finances and was always the bread winner.  We were exclusive and practically dating where I go over his house and find his phone where he was exchanging emails with his ex on how he still loved him etc.  I confronted him and he said he was playing the part so that he could get his ex to sign the divorce papers so when he flys back he could get divorced since he got married in Mexico.  I told him he could get divorced without him having contact with him or being in Mexico but he didn’t know how.  Fast forward he got divorced and and we’re now married.  

Now the part where I need help I find myself constantly thinking and looking at old pictures of him and his ex via Facebook from old friends.  I catch myself saying that he gave his ex the best years of his life and dying to have known him when he was younger or being able to intervene somehow.

245,"So I am an 19 year old Austrian girl and have huge difficulties in my choice what to do.
Here is my story:
Last year I started studying business (top 50 business university in Europe) and psychology with the goal of a career in Advertising/marketing/communication. I was selected for a group called ""top-league"" where you had to get top grades in order to stay in these group (we got workshops and parties ""in exchange"").
So after 2 months I got a huge breakdown because I was constantly comparing myself to others, because of the pressure of the top league, because I was overwhelmed by managing 2 study subjects in 2 different universities, maybe because I had health issues (underweight), maybe because of the change from school to university, because the business study was different from what I had expected etc...
So I quit. I just did what my sister did when she dropped out: I studied for the entrance exam of the medical university for a half a year.
And I got in. I am even in the top 2 percent. I started this October: I have really good friends, I have a guaranteed place in each lecture. However, I have had breakdowns and have cried for hours regularly since day 2 in medical university.

During my year of studying for medicine I regularly looked back to my business study and one month after quitting business I regretted it. I thought: I just gave up on my dreams: doing advertising/marketing and moving to Australia. I asked myself: ""What am i doing? Studying for an exam for a study which leads to a job I don't even want?!!
 One month before the med-entrance-exam I even took a law exam of my business studies and I even took a Spanish course. 

Now I am totally confused: What happened in the past 10 months? 
I am trying to figure out why I really quit my business study. Maybe I wanted to do something more social? (definitely wanna work with people) Maybe I liked the philosophy of med-university (helping people) more than the one form business? Because of prestige? 
Or because it was the easier option (half a year of studying for medicine with lots of leisure vs. knock out exams in business-university)? Because it worked out for my sister (loves her studies, has a social life) so I thought it had to work out for me as well?

Medical University is different here: only 6 years (80% do it minimum time), then residency (5-6 years). Allegedly not that difficult, not that much to learn when compared to medschool in other countries. 
Business University: 3-4 years; Bachelor the 1-2 years master. knock out exams because there are more students than the capacity allows, studying 8+ hours a day mostly alone by yourself. (which is horrible for me as I am a very social/people person)

When studying medicine, I think it's quite interesting, but actually I never wanted to be a doctor. Physiology is quite interesting, I dislike anatomy. I frequently get break downs while studying. (never had that while studying for business) I have no passion for it.
My passion is Marketing/Communication. My dream is to move to Australia and the business school offers double degree programs for the master degree for the best students. However nearly 50% of the business studies is boring as hell (accounting, law). I am thinking of switching back to business again because I never had these break-downs during these studies.

And both degrees (EVEN medicine) is free here in Austria by the way.
 
What's your advice?

tl;dr started business (+ psychology), wanted to do marketing/communications, dropped out for reasons I don't know for sure, did the entrance exam for medical university, succeeded, started medicine, dislike many parts of it, find some parts just quite interesting, but have many crying fits/breakdowns, thinking about switching back to business. both degrees are free in Austria. Dream: moving to Australia.

248,"I'm using a throwaway for reasons that should become apparent as you read my situation. 

I am a Ph.D. student graduating this spring and am currently on the job market looking for a tenure-track faculty position. I have submitted around 10 applications so far and was planning to submit at least 5 more. The first position I applied to contacted me shortly after their application deadline and I went through the whole process of doing a phone interview and in-person interview. Then, on Friday, they offered me the position which is great. However, I still have some applications whose deadline hasn't even passed yet and one in particular that I want way more than the one that has given me an offer. Unfortunately, the school that made the offer isn't giving me much time at all to make a decision (I have to notify them if I accept before my preferred school's application deadline has even passed). So I feel like at this point, the thing to do for my own self-interest is accept the offer I have received but then go ahead and follow through on the application to the place I want more. 

My concern is that if I happen to get an offer from my top pick after I have already accepted from the school giving me an offer, then I will have to back out of a position I already agreed to. I get that doing so would be unethical. The school who gave me the offer would have already cancelled their search since I accepted the position. They likely would have already contacted all the other people who applied to tell them they didn't get the position and probably wouldn't be able to restart the hiring process until next fall. I would put them in a really shitty position. But they have done the same to me by having such an early deadline and by not allowing me enough time to think through my decision and I think that strategy was intentional on their part. Plus, there's the real possibility that my preferred school won't even be interested in me or contact me back, in which case, I would keep the offer from the other school and they would never even know I had considered backing out.

Is there another angle to this I'm not considering? What would you do in my position (keep in mind I've worked my butt off in grad school for 5 years to get to where I am and really don't want to settle on a mediocre job just because they made the first offer). Are there any actual legal consequences if I back out of an accepted offer, especially if I do so after signing some sort of employment contract? What would those legal consequences be? ",05Nov2017,1
249,"I’m 22 and in college. My main reason for not moving out sooner was that my family lives only 20 min away from campus and living in a dorm is way too much. At first I was totally comfortable with this, but lately things have become uncomfortable and strained between me and my parents, mostly my mom. I have severe problems with my mental health (depression, suicidal attempts and tendencies) and I’ve hid those from them for years. I can’t tell them because I know that they see those issues something “only white people have” and “for the weak”. They’re not going to understand and if I told them it would just make things worse. My mom has recently moved into my room, meaning I have no where to go for privacy anymore and my issues are now leaking out into my schoolwork. I don’t have a job, and have issues getting one because of mom’s opinion of me being too busy for her or avoiding her. Whenever she gets upset with me I can’t help but feel like I should die. And it’s difficult to talk with her when she stonewalls me and just says I’m disrespecting her. 

I’ve been considering moving out. I feel like if I do, I’ll be more stable to function like a normal person. I can act how I want to act and have the privacy I need. But I may also put more strain for my relationship with my parents.

My main issue is that school isn't that interesting anymore. I don't find the teachers as good or inspiring, the subjects necessary or even relevant. But the hardest part is that everything is so much harder, unclear. I know that no one is supposed to hold my hand, give me an infinite amount of chances but I just...

don't want to try so hard so achieve that good grade. 

I know I can do it, that isn't the problem, but I don't have a driving force to be ""that"" good (anymore).

Is it okay to be fairly ok/good, or should I find a motivation to be the best I can be? Because I don't know if it's worth it...

I could always apply with a test instead of HS grades.",05Nov2017,3

263,"Hi, my brother (19) is the best person i ever met, my best friend. we like to think of us creating a business together (im 15) but im scared. He has more than excellent grades in school and high school (49/50 pts in each exam) but he is an asshole to my parents because they ""waste too much money"" and ""You dont give me anything"" 
And thats where i take part because i always help im to calm down and be ok with my parents, luckly this kind of situations ended many years ago but my parents are very liberal and strict at the same time, from a father that worked since he was 6yrs old. He said almost every insult you can think of to my parents. ever since our parents dont consider him as a son at a 100%.
We run a supermarket that has became very succesful that allows us to have a nice house, consoles (for me cos i like games) and decent clothing(i dont want to explain our economic situation and sound like an asshole but i cant skip it, this has a lot to be with the problem), but either he cant realize that we are OK about money or our parents are hiding something, as my brother says. 
Recently we are having problems getting workers because the area the supermarket is there are no loyal or experienced workers. so my brother started working there to help my parents. It began with 3 days each week but he noticed that his parents were not as happy with the amount of time he worked (i think he is lying but idk)So he switched college to a private one with better schedule but very expensive. He has everything on his life, friends, money that he got from selling A LOT of used an new cellphones from other people selling their phones at cheap prices (gets iPhones 7 at 40% the price and sells them at 80%. Yes its legitimate)So he can pay his own college, food, phones, computers, even his own car but there is a problem: He is not ok with that; he watches his friends (he got A LOT of friends on college, he was a forever alone in school) and his old classmates going to different countries, getting cars from his parents and those were his classmates which according to him (for some reason) our family should have the same amount of money. This escalated to other EXTREMELY high level when he ""found out"" (i dont know if he is telling the truth, its too much to be true)that our father owes crazy amounts of money from failed business and thats the reason he pays for his own college, clothes, phone and a mac he had to buy from his own wallet because his parents either didnt wanted to or didnt had the money to buy him one. and it even got worst when i (a guy with barely 3 friends and almost never goes outside but dont give a shit about that, and has not-as-good grades in exams, i do care about that)get a PS4, iPhone 7 and some games aside from him, that had to buy his own stuff at the age of 16. He recently started yelling about ""my friends go to europe, get new cars and i stay here as a cashier on my fathers business"", about that our father doesnt pay the college as he promised as long as my brother worked at his supermarket. Barely 1 hour before starting writing this he just told me a lot of stuff i was not ready for, the debts. 
I didnt see any proof, thats why i still dont buy it but he is the problem, he said ""what did i deserve to have a family like this"", ""i am ashamed from my own parents""...

""Ive been suffering of heavy depression and thought repetitively of attempting suicide, let me live in my pain""

Which scared me, a lot, i even wrote the first part of this post crying because of how heavy is that. 
For what i noticed, he wants truth, what is happening about those debts, He wants my father to be like the rest, kinda and he wants to have a normal life without asking his father, when is he going to pay the college to end up paying it himself. he doesnt want to pay almost everything that his parents have to pay. He wants his parents to not be mediocre and go work somewhere that will get them a lot of money, not considering that my father is 56 years old, been working since he was 6YO and he would be working at a place he is not comfortable working at, he would get a lot, but he is tired, REALLY tired of waking up at 4:00 and buying vegetables and getting the bread ready every day to sell and he considers that type of economist/ministry work to be extremely miserable. 

Im really lost here, i dont know what to do, should i leave him alone? do a family reunion? get a psycologist? Make my parents do what he says and ruin the family with my father working at other country?(pls no) I really dont know. Please help, im afraid he tries something at any minute.

A translator by trade, but decided I don't want to work as a translator my whole life since I didn't really enjoy it and didn't see perspectives. Always had some interest in computers, so started to looking for a job in IT industry (idiot). Found one, not at first, but still. Working there as junior SEO. Basically doing monkey job. Hate it. Don't feel like bringing much to company. Don't feel valued and significant. Anybody can do what I do. Feeling like a piece of crap. On a bright side, I can sort of migrate to QA team. Hope it will make me more important. Still, for the moment I have not many skills, I am very slow at my job, and I don't see results of my work.
Other thing that bugs me - my relationships. I guess, due to the fact that I am so sad all the time, my bf and I have had many arguments recently. Still do, btw. And I am the one who's wrong. All the time. I'm very insecure about myself. Yep, I'm stupid, ugly, awkward, and boring. Maybe not ugly, more like average. Plus, I don't feel like I bring much to our relationships. His behaviour changed, he's less sweet and warm now. More distant. It's my fault, I feel guilty all the time. I want it all to end and be like before. I spoiled our relationships with my sadness and now I pay.
I don't see purpose in my life. We are born to die.

270,"I've been married for more than 10 years, and I am profoundly and deeply in love with my wife. We rarely argue. We've also noticed that our peers consistently bitch about their significant others, and they have  made fun of us for ""actually liking"" our spouse. We're kind to each other, complimentary, and--I don't know--we are each other's favorite people.

We have a sticking point that comes up every year or two that results in an emotional breakdown. We argue. We cry. It ruins a day and leaves us drained for a day or two after. The sticking point is her parents--specifically her father. 

For more than a decade now, we have treated this man as our lovable, goofy down-home racist. EVERYTHING is politics for this man. Seemingly benign subjects that we discuss comes back around to religion, politics, and race. What's wild is how often he wants to tell us a story about black people that he saw on the news and how much of an overreaction ""they"" all have to whatever he's discussing. What's even stranger is how the town they are in (and most surrounding areas) don't even have any diversity to speak of. Yet he feels comfortable, being white and knowing no black people, to speak generally about problems in the ""black community"" and how they are the cause of their own problems.

My wife hates it when I argue with him. I can't say that my disagreements with him have been that severe. The worst argument we had was when he said that it is wrong for the public to be upset if a business decides not to serve black people. I said that if that is truly his opinion that I would call it bigoted. 

My wife does not hold the same opinions as her father. She occasionally argues with him about it, but she mostly smiles, nods, and rolls her eyes when he isn't looking. 

This is where I am asking for some advice. Today, she was on the phone with her father, and this sort of thing starts happening again. I say, too loudly, that I'm glad he as a white man understands what it is like to be black, and I'm proud that he has figured out what is ""wrong"" with the black community. My wife shushed me so her father couldn't hear. She's so afraid of conflict with her parents that she will just let him say the most sexist, racist, homophobic, ignorant, and most often downright false things without any push back. To me, this is an implicit agreement that what he is saying is correct. To her, it's just trying not to rock the boat. 

I need advice on how to handle not feeling negatively toward my wife when she doesn't call him on falsehoods or tries to prevent me from doing so. I know that every family has different dynamics, but I would be on her side if the situations were reversed. If my family is spewing morally reprehensible garbage, I would be PROUD of my wife for saying something. 

Should I be telling my wife how miserable it makes me to sit through her father defending neo-nazis (I mean that literally, not in an abstract way)? I'm afraid that this is making it seem like I'm carrying my opinions around openly and in everyone's face. That's not the case. I'm not correcting strangers on vague ""PC culture"" infractions. This is my family. Hatred spouted from strangers with a political agenda is to be expected, as much as I wish it weren't. These, though, are the people I love.

This is not a cry for confirmation. This is indeed me looking for help from what I hope are objective strangers.

277,"Hello /r/advice. I know this is a question that's asked a lot, but I don't have anyone to ask about this type of thing, and there are a few details that I need to consider. Thanks in advance for any help, I'm sorry for the length of the post.                  

I'm 21 and live with my parents. The usual advice is to keep that up as long as possible to save money, but I'm not saving much and I'm not happy either.               

One major problem is that my parents charge me monthly for a ""rent"" fee, which is supposed to cover food, utilities, insurance, and other misc stuff. When I was making around $1100/month, I had to give them $500. One of my jobs made me reduce hours so I now make $800/month, and I have to give them $300. So my budget looks like this:                     
$300 - rent             
$120 - food (I buy and cook all my own food, it's a little high because fitness goals/girlfriend)                    
$150 - gas (One of my jobs is driving)                 

This leaves me about $230 a month to save, but a chunk of that is also gone with incidentals and going out a few times (need to focus on budgeting this better, but at the same time I don't want to just stay inside forever and not enjoy myself ever, as my parents suggest). I also need to drop random large amounts of money on my car whenever it decides to break down, which is unpredictable and can be like $500 or more.                

On top of this, my parents decided to stop paying for my college after I finished my 4th semester (I wasn't sticking to a major). So now I can only take two classes with interest-free FAFSA loans, and I'm hesitant to take out more loans that have interest. I have to pay the extra amount the loan disbursement doesn't cover, as well as books/parking/other stuff. So this also eats away at that extra $230, and it's killing my progress in school as 2 classes/semester is not much.                

Another issue is my room/living situation. I'm not in a regular bedroom, I'm in a room that's kind of an ""add-on"" to the main house. It's 11x8 (small but still not crazy small) with no closet, and it's a really inconvenient location. Summers here are 110F+ but the air conditioning doesn't work, and I have to rely on my small space heater during the winter because the heating doesn't work either. So it's cramped, uncomfortably broiling/freezing, and my overall environment just feels bad. There's also some relationship issues with my family but I won't get into that.                  

My current plan is to get a full-time 9-5 job, which will allow me to save up an emergency fund as well as start investing the way I want to. It'll also allow me to:                
1. Pay for college (my uni has classes after 5 I could take, as well as some online ones). I could still use the FAFSA loans and just supplement that to take more classes.                        
2. Get started in an industry I want to move up in.                   
3. Build up savings for the future.                               
4. Move into an apartment where I actually feel comfortable.                 
5. Get a more functional vehicle that doesn't break down constantly.                 
                    
Right now I just feel unhappy, and I hate my living situation. Education/career-wise I feel like I'm going nowhere, and I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels.                          

What do you think about my little plan? I obviously wouldn't move out until I had substantial savings in the bank, but it is a goal. I really appreciate any advice, thank you in advance.

282,"My cousin whom i've known, and loved my whole life has had some pretty shitty things happen to him in the course of a week. I grew up with him, we spent our entire lives together. And seeing what's happening with him breaks my heart. 

I'll post a TLDR at the end, but if you're interested- read on. 

It started a last year when he graduated college. He was practically forced by his mother (more so his horrible step father) to move out, and get a job. Having no option, he moved in with his dead beat dad. Working in a factory. With his father mooching off his every dollar. And his job is hard... He's consistently working other's shifts. With the thread of being fired if he refuses. He's been doing this for the better part of a year. 

However, just last week- his father's house. The house he was living in, burnt down. To the ground. All his clothes, photos, memories, and everything he'd worked so hard for. Gone. in mere hours. Now, the red cross took his father, and his family in. But my cousin, being a separate tenet wasn't so lucky. He was refused, and his father doesn't care. So, now he has no home. He's staying in the storage room at our grand mother's house. A room barely bigger than a traditional bathroom. With nothing but the clothes on his back. and a family full of assholes. He has no options, and has been screwed at every single corner. The only person whom has given him anything. Is my other cousin. (his brother) 

So, how do i set up a charity fund for him. And is it ever worth it? 

TLDR:

My cousin was forced out of a future after highschool, and after almost a year of hard work. Lost everything in a house fire. I'm looking to make a charity fund for him.

I'm on a very tight budget and on top of that, my parents said I couldn't use any sort of electric powered heater. Does anyone have any ideas on how to heat it?",05Nov2017,2
