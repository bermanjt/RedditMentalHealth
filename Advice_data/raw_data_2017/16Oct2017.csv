Everything is getting so overwhelming I feel like I can’t deal with it
I need to get away but I also feel numb so I cant cry 

I have one night where I’m not working (I work in a bar) so I thought maybe I could just drive somewhere in my country and get a cheap hotel for the night and spend the night clearing my head
No phone, just spending the night with myself and clearing my head. But then there’s money.

2,"So I have a reasonable life, a good job and a comfortable home life.

But I've recently found myself trapped by some bad decisions, and a really close friend died a few days ago, unexpected and really suddenly. He was the same age as me and it really knocked me for six, I'm only in my late 20's.

Over the last few weeks for various reasons my anxiety issues have really ramped up and I can't face going back to work and seeing people I know and i'm really struggling.

My question is, is it that ridiculous to consider applying for jobs at the other end of county? Starting again and just seeing where it goes. Financially I would be ok, and i don't know that I would suffer emotionally. I could probably walk into a job in the the same sector, maybe even the same parent company.

I just don't feel like I can carry on as I am, where I am.

In context, I live in the north west of England and I'm considering ""running away"" to the London area.

3,"Hi,

&amp;nbsp;

I live in an apartment building and one of my neighbors appears to be a single dad with two sons aged 7-10ish. I recently heard loud screaming from one of his children with the dad occasionally raising his voice in response (but mostly talking very quietly). I have heard this kind of crying from their apartment twice before, but this time I tried to listen carefully as it set off a red flag for me.

&amp;nbsp;

There were guttural screams from the child in between periods of silence and whimpering/arguing--I could not really make out the conversation. It really didn't sound like the kind of gasping/crying you make when you're trying to catch your breath. I do believe I heard the father say, ""If you don't *muffled phrase* the right way, you're gonna get beat."" At this point, I thought it best to get an audio recording and this is what came through from my apartment window [TW: Screaming, crying, potential sounds of child abuse]:

&amp;nbsp;

[\[Raw audio, about 1 minute\]](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0XXFCZoRw48) 

&amp;nbsp;

There's a lot of static and background noise, so if anybody is able to clean up the file to try to make a little more sense of what's being said, that would be helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

I did call CPS to ask some questions about this encounter as I have no children of my own and I don't spend a lot of time with kids regularly--I'm not sure exactly what a tantrum is supposed to sound like. The woman told me she could not do anything about this specific situation but did say that if I heard it again and suspected the child was in immediate danger, I should call 911 for a welfare check.

&amp;nbsp;

Thoughts? Am I overreacting?

8,"Hey, so it's been awhile I since posted here I'm a junior in high school who's really shy/anxious often and have trouble talking to people. I did manage to succeed in not playing steam games, I used to play this game Toontown Rewritten and I keep visiting the forums and trolling as someone else for nothing. I wish to stop that, their security certificate expired so it's buggy, but when I go on Discord and see people ask me""Is that you on ttr"" or seeing it as them""Playing Toontown"" I start getting sad and reminded of it. Like, I can't leave the place and when I'm bored I have nowhere to be and go on Discord to chat in my free time. When I mention the forums I have something to talk about, but I really don't want to leave my friend there. He said he's not coming back to Skype and only use it for calls, Discord for chatting. I am so tempted to lash out one of them for mentioning it, and then he says ""oh"" I literally told him this before. The staff of the game TTR did not listen to my appeal and I have apologized and fixed my actions. I been stressing myself out and have to do this presentation, obviously ""many people fear public speaking"" as my school psychologist pointed out. I told her ""I understand this is a common fear, but I have it worse like I can't even talk at all. My voice gets shaky and already have trouble interacting with people."" It bothered me that she told me the most obvious thing, she didn't let me finish on that cause I was so nervous and stupid that I didn't say it. I used to self harmed myself. I cry when I lose a game, it's really dumb tbh. Also, how do you control your fucking nerves cause when I try to practice my voice sounds hard and my throat is like forced.

10,"Bear with me, this is a long story. I'll try and bold the important parts. Posting to this sub since it seems to have been ignored over on /r/relationships 

Well first, a bit about me. I’m just a regular guy with a regular family, for the most part. My parents (mostly my dad) routinely beat me for things like disobedience and neglecting my household duties, which really contributed to some unhealthy mindsets I’m still dealing with. He has abused me physically and emotionally, telling me I’m just a little bastard (this is from when I was 13) among countless others I’ve forgotten. I managed to get away for college but came back home due to various circumstances, so **I’m living with my parents currently while going to a local college.** 

Around last year this time, both of my grandmothers died. It was a rough time for my family but **when we went to bury them in their home country, he revealed that we (my siblings and I) had a sister** – let’s call her Sally. And she wasn’t a baby either, she’s around 10 (my dad has intentionally kept the age vague from us). He revealed her in an extremely casual manner, and after the funerals she was never mentioned again. My mother has been dealing with stress issues recently to the point that she has to take medication – even with the whole family’s help, taking care of her mother became quite taxing in the last few months. On the way home from the funeral, she just cried. I’ve never felt so hopeless and unable to console my mother.

Now, another skip in time to this most recent summer. My dad starts throwing away a bunch of stuff in the house, calling it junk, and forcing me to help him. I’m used to my father’s mindset (a bunch of my stuff got thrown away when I left for college) but his attitude was extremely standoffish and overall disgusting throughout the entire process. **Of course, this is all to make room for Sally, who is “coming over for the summer”**. He never thought it was relevant to tell anyone in the house; my mom told me about a day before this move – in happened. As a side note, **she is now here permanently** - my mom forced him to tell us, and even then he used ambiguity and half-truths to make it so he had *technically* told us.

**Since Sally arrived, the atmosphere in the house has been unbearably tense.** She’s been an all-around turd (doesn’t clean up after herself, always ignores advice, etc) and while my siblings and I were beat brutally for things like this, she has gotten nothing but stern warnings and cuddle sessions from my dad, which has rubbed all of us the wrong way. My mom has tried to distance herself from raising Sally, understandably.

Now, yet another jump forward to the end of the summer (bear with me, we’re almost there). **Over the summer, my dad and I got into arguments where he would try and treat my younger siblings harshly and I stepped in** – there’s no way I’m going to watch my full siblings get treated like shit while your half child is pampered. I had come very close to outright calling him out on his bullshit, but he shut me down every time with the threat of violence – unfortunately, I’m about average and my dad can outmatch my physically. I was leaving the house for about a week, but the day before I left my father took me out to dinner (this has never happened before, so I knew something was up). 

**When we were there, he essentially opened up to me, asking me how I feel about the situation and saying that he made a mistake, but I should learn from it instead of hating him. He also said he didn’t care about any of our thoughts, excluding my mom – he thinks we have absolutely no stake in his actions and his house.** I didn’t care for what he had to say, but I was happy that he was aware he fucked up and was trying to improve his communication with us. I really thought we were starting on the path to recovery.

Now, to the present (this morning). As I wake up, I hear him yelling at my younger siblings so I just get the feeling it’s going to be one of those days. I help my brother do his chores, then I start packing up. My dad starts yelling at my younger brother because he didn’t wipe the floor (the mop is with Sally). So I step in and say so. My dad takes this as a personal attack, and tries to make me feel embarrassed that he has to yell at me at the age of 21 (I’m 19, my father regularly forgets how old I am and just guesses upwards to make me feel bad). Eventually it gets to the point that he blames myself and my siblings for my mother’s state. Now this sets something off in me because when we talked, he admitted that he may have also contributed to her health. To see him go back on what he had said pushed me past the edge, so I called him out and told him he has also played a role.

 This sets him off, and he again resorts to violence, telling me I won’t say it again and so on as he gets in my face. Again, I back off because he can take me in a fight and all the years of abuse have made me afraid to fight back. I cried for a while afterwards because** I thought we were really making progress after the time at the restaurant** and that he would take some responsibility for the tense state of the family. But, we are back to square one. **Now, I hear my father yelling that he will “fuck up anyone who speaks of his mistake”, and that I am a “dog” who is ungrateful.** This part makes me especially sad because he’s now willing to physically harm *anyone* who challenges his delusion that his actions haven’t impacted the family.

This whole situation is extremely depressing and has impacted my schoolwork negatively. I just want to finish my associate’s, move to a 4 -year college and get to independence so I can get my two younger siblings (excluding Sally) away from his toxic grasp. I already am busy throughout the week with class, research, and tutoring, but weekends like these are hard because I have little need to leave the house. Any advice?

I was hired on by my friend and his girlfriend and have been doing well.

My friend and his girlfriend and myself are all Canadian, the owner though is Indian.

This has lead to him firing my friend and his girlfriend, I don't know what is going to happen to me. I am only hired via a contract with a third party who is helping subsidize my pay for the first few weeks while I learn the ins and outs of the job.

If given the option, should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay with a bad boss who is running the business in a way I don't like?

Or should I just leave and take my contract somewhere else, the Third Party has agreed to take my contract to another company if this falls apart, but we would need to find another company.

20,"For the past couple of months, I have obsessed over the question above. I am genuinely worried if certain styles of comedy affect the behaviors of other people. With the rise of the alt-right and other fringe political movements, I have found that darker styles of comedy (which is a style I happen to be a fan of) are commonplace in the movement. The rise of edgier comedic YouTubers such as h3h3productions and idubbbz also increased in popularity at around the same time, and they aren't people who are exactly left-wing (which is my political affiliation.) On top of that I have read numerous studies that state that certain kinds of jokes can have negative long-term effects on a person. 

There are two extremes that I believe in simultaneously as of me writing this post. I believe that offensive content in the media must be regulated to ensure products that every person can enjoy. I also believe that works in the entertainment industry should not be censored, and that it's the individual's decision to watch slasher movies or pornography. There are some horrible things that have become commonplace since the liberalization of the entertainment industry such as the shaming of rape victims, and the indifference towards those of a lower socioeconomic status.

The main reason why I ask this is because I want to make animated television comedy as soon as I get older, and I don't want to be burdened with restrictions. I do believe that a joke can be made about anything at all as long as it's funny, but I'm uncertain as to whether I should or not.

Am I worrying too much or am I being reasonable?",16Oct2017,8
26,"Okay so this may get long-winded. Be ready. 

I'm a 22 year old female, pansexual, and the last relationship I had was my sophomore year of high school. Not so bad, maybe? But it IS! If I am being completely honest I am lonely as hell - in the romantic sense anyway. I have a very great small circle of friends and a large family that is always there for me but it is not the same. 

I work all the time and I live in a relatively small town so meeting new people is hard enough in the first place but even when someone new does pop up they never show even the slightest interest in me. It sucks even more because unless I have been drinking I am the shiest person you would ever meet and I am incredibly introverted. It is very hard for me to approach people especially attractive ones. 

The last time someone seemed even remotely interested, I would freeze up every time he was around. I could hardly even talk to him. Eye contact was no go. We chatted through messenger a lot though and I thought we were really hitting it off. Like flirty winky emoji hitting it off. And then literally not even 24 hours after our last conversation he was suddenly in a social media official relationship with someone else. Maybe I'm just petty and read to far into it, but like what????

Other than that and my crazy depressed and emotionally lifeless ex girlfriend hitting me up every now and then, nothing for the past six years. SIX YEARS. I mean I'm not expecting people lining up at the door to ask for my hand in marriage or anything, but do most people go six years with no one approaching them at all? NO. They don't. My friends have people asking for their numbers and and old people from high school hitting them up all the time, but not lil ol me. 

Seriously reddit. What is wrong with me? Is my being shy really that big of an issue? Because other than that I can't think of anything else. I'm not exactly super attractive, but I am not ugly. I'm smart and can even be witty when I want to be. I don't exactly make a lot of money but I'm not broke either.

36,"Hi, im 19 years old and living in Melbourne , Australia right now. I started playing tennis when i was around 9 years old once a week, then started playing more seriously when i was 12. I was pretty terrible as a junior because of bad technique/habits that i got from some of my coaches that didn't help my progression as well as constant injuries, but as the years went on i got better and better. 

I finished high school last year with fairly average results mainly because i wasn't motivated to do well at all and i knew that i wanted to give tennis a go . In January of this year while away for a tournament i went light headed as i got up off my bed and i feel head first on the bathroom tiles, which resulted not being able to play out the rest of my tournament. I went home and played my last tournament of the summer on painkillers, which actually turned out to be my best tournament ever ranking wise despite the circumstances. 

After months of being scared to serve properly because of my neck , it turned out that i had suprascapular nerve block which means that a muscle in the back of my shoulder was missing, which meant my arm was quite weak. This did explain a lot of the injuries and weakness i felt throughout playing juniors. At the end of June i ended up having surgery to remove what was blocking the nerve in an attempt to have the muscle regrow. I got a protrusion in one my discs in my neck, but the surgeon recommended that i don't have surgery as the injury isn't bad enough to require it and the rehab is long , painful and not worth it.  

I had started university doing a bachelor of business which i didn't enjoy whatsoever. None of the content interested me and i was solely doing the course just to be able to get money from the government to spend on my tennis, since my parents where no longer willing to fund my lessons ($100 per week). After realising that this was the only reason that i wanted to go to university, i decided to defer my studies for a year straight after surgery and play tennis full time. 

I started playing tennis again in late July/ early August. 
I hit the gym almost daily after surgery and built up a fair amount of muscle that i had never had before and i felt that i was already playing better on the court then i had before i got injured. I had a match against my coach 3 days before my first tournament and i had never played better. Then came time for my first tournament around 3 weeks ago during the school holidays. I stepped onto the court and all of a sudden i couldn't hit a forehand. I had no idea what was happening but i felt helpless. Like nothing i could do could make that ball go over the net and in the court on my forehand side. Straight after my loss i went and hit with a friend and everything was back to normal. I was barely missing. I had another tournament the week after and the exact same thing happened. Except this time , for the first time in over 4 years, i lost a match 6-0 6-0. I had no idea what was happening. I called my coach and he explained that it was all mental. After having a lesson with him once school holidays finished he said that it seemed like i had completely changed my forehand without realising it. What he was showing me felt unnatural and i didn't know what was going on because it felt like to me i hadn't changed anything. Fast forward to todays tournament and i suffered my worst ever loss. I really don't know what to do. 

After my tournament in January, i was ranked between 250-280 in Australia and was 32nd in Australia for my age. 

I need advice on whether i should continue playing a pursue my dream or cut my losses now and go get a job/degree like everybody else. I still have a passion for it and i feel like i haven't fulfilled my potential but i don't know if its worth the stress that its giving me.

I don’t want to go to my local community college either, because I’ve taken some classes there, and I don’t much like the school and it’d be harder to move out. My parents would see it as an opportunity to stay home, which is the opposite of what I want. OSU is fairly close to me, though, so while I wish it were farther, it’s probably my only local option. 

I have a dog, and I’d like to bring her with me, but if I can’t, she’ll be alright with my parents. They’re nice to animals, but the situation isn’t ideal for me. 

I’d like to go into the STEM field, but I’m not sure what in. I’d really like to take the opportunity to travel for school if I can, though. 

If there’s any more information I need to provide, I can, but I’d like to avoid identifying factors, and you can probably guess why.

I’d really really like to take the opportunity to travel and be away from my situation, so any advice about my options, info, pros and cons, (maybe regions to apply/study at?), etc would be a huge help! Thank you!

38,"I'm 29 years old, I've lived at home for the last 5 years and need to move out. She's only 20, and to some degree.. I'm kind of attracted to her. We never hang outside of work. When I saw the place, it was really nice and well kept, and well within my pay range. But, upon inspecting the place, since she's lived there for 6 months already, I felt like I'd just basically be living out of a room in her place. I don't know if that was enough of a justifiable reason but, it made me wish I had my own place... but living on your own is outrageous and I practically need a roommate to live comfortably within my means. I'm still kind of conflicted and just looking for some outside advice. Thanks!",16Oct2017,1

40,"So, sometimes the clients at my job give us little gifts. Usually its gift cards or a few dollars. The company I work for asks that we donate these gifts to go towards company parties. I had a team of people working under me and a client gave each of us an extremely generous monetary gift. I talked with my team and we all decided to keep half and not tell anyone. This client will most likely work with us again, but not necessarily with my team. I'm worried that they might bring up the gift to someone and that it might get out somehow. What should I do?

41,"Okay I know this is going to sound confusing but here goes. I'm a 19 year old girl and I want to be crazy, kinda. I'm still in high school because I didn't graduate. Background story: I already have tons of mental disorders. Aspergers, Borderline, stuff like that. So I'm pretty much already crazy.

So I'm constantly in mental hospitals where the doctors go and ask questions like ""Do you smoke"", ""Are you sexually active"", ""Do you hear voices"", stuff like that. And I always answer no for them, and that's the truth. But recently, I've been dying to answer 'yes' to the question about hearing voices.

I just want to lie about stuff like that, just like how I lie when I say I don't have suicidal thoughts but I really do. And I kinda want to pretend to be a little crazy. Like I want to pretend to have seizures. I want to talk to a wall and pretend I'm hearing voices. I want to pretend I have multiple identities.

And sometimes I like to pretend that my whole life I'm just lying about having emotional issues and I'm really an actress starring in a film. Like I'm really a sane actress just playing her role. I know I don't have DID, probably not. I mean I wasn't diagnosed with it. But sometimes it feels like it. And I have a pretty bad compulsive lying habit but I promise everything here is true. 

And yeah I know everyone's going to tell me to get help instead of attention whoring. I already am, but this issue's kinda bugging me now. When I go to school tomorrow I want to pretend to faint or maybe faint for real. I want to get drunk even though I never had a drink of alcohol in my life. I want to jump out of a window in the middle of class. I want to bring a gun to school and then shoot myself. (Even though I don't have a gun) Am I crazy?",16Oct2017,1
42,"So last night my high school had our homecoming dance. I asked a girl I liked and she said yes. A few weeks back I had a talk with her and asked if she genuinely wanted to go with me and wasn't just pitying me, she said she wanted to go with me. But the moment we got into the dance she took of her corsage and blew me off. Her friends kept on telling her to out it back on and dance with me, but she wouldn't. The entire dance she didn't speak to me even once, but her parents gave me a ride home and only then did she even talk to me. All of this was extremely unlike her as we've been close friends for almost a year and she is generally a very nice and considerate person.

44,"I really wish I stopped existing.
Terrible, I know but things are just all out of whack lately.
I can never calm down, or relax. I'm always stressed, school's been getting to me, if it's not an A I freak out, I just have this obsession with being perfect. 
It's impossible, I know. But I just something in me needs me and everything to be perfect.

I feel like the whole world is against me, and my weird little obsession. Whenever someone gets close I push them away, I keep getting scared that they're going to distract me.
But in all reality, they maybe just want to hang out with me, or see how I'm doing.

I know it's not normal. I don't expect anyone to see me as normal. 

The goal I've set in stone is impossible. I can never reach it, I have to many flaws.
I stopped eating because it distracts me, and I thought I was to fat to be, well, what I need to be.
I stopped hanging out with friends and family, because they'll try to intervene.

Over the passed few months I've lost a lot of weight, and I've turned really weak.

I'm constantly fatigued, so I rely on energy drinks 24/7.

I rarely sleep, well I do, but it's difficult.

I rarely go out, I'm just always doing my work, always cleaning always trying to be this thing that'll never be real.

Some might say that I should go see a therapist or a psychiatrist.
But I can't.
If I hear that somethings wrong with me, I feel like it would break me.
But I always tell myself that there's something wrong....

I can't keep living like this.
I've been thinking about ending it all for a few months now, I feel like I should disappear. It just feels wrong to be here.
My significance is nothing, I am like a molecule in an ocean.
If I can't even live up to what I want myself to be, what's the point in living? 
I'm miserable, I'm exhausted, I'm broken, imperfect. 
I'm miserable in my own mind, my own aspirations are killing me. 


What should I do? 
I can't change it, I've tried to change, but nothings ever worked. 
And since I'm not perfect like I want to be I'm always freaking out.
I cry, I scream, I just freak out.

The other day, this thing came over me, I thought I was going to die, I was in my apartment, and then I just remember crying, I felt really scared, I think I passed out, I'm not sure, I guess I blacked out?

I had a thing like that happen to me in the middle of a mall, but it wasn't that bad.
I was crying, shaking really badly. I went to the women's restroom and just cried in there.

I can't live with the fact that something's wrong with me, I keep obsessing over this thing, and I just can't get it out of my mind.

46,"I have been at my job for less than 5 months, and it's my first job within my field with field work since my graduation in 2015. Unfortunately, I have had some issues with my direct manager. Two weeks ago I overheard my manager disparaging employees with the office door open, and the manager knew I was directly outside the door and within earshot. This is not the first time this has happened either, they have been caught talking about another employee in the past, by that employee. Unfortunately when I went to my manager's (boss 1) manager (boss 2), and their manager (boss 3) it turned into a horrible experience. Boss 1 was not in the meeting, but I felt like I was being attacked by Boss 2 who said they found it personally offensive I suggested the work environment was hostile. Boss 3 seemed to be nice but was held back most of the meeting. I intended to go into the meeting and only discuss what I had heard and witnessed but somehow it turned into a meeting about my own performance where I was then told I have performance issues. I have been repeatedly told that this job is a fast learning pace and they don't have time to give us training and now receiving the information that I have ""performance issues"" but I was not told what that means yet. In the past when I have been told I was not doing well I asked for clarification and suggestions and was simply told, ""you'll learn with time.""

58,"Hello Reddit,         
**TLDR;** I need your advice on how I could handle my depression in front of roommate. I'm used to hiding it but it's sort of harder to hide when someone is living with you in a small room. 
          

To give you a better idea of what I mean:        
I started developing terrible anxiety a few weeks into this semester and slipped back into depression. I was able to deal with the depression, undiagnosed for a couple of years now, but I had a private room. That meant that I could stay up till 5 AM crying, not turn the lights even if its pitch dark out, and just lay in bed for hours on end. It was hard, but I was still able to hide it from family. Now It's even harder as I have a roommate. She's a very nice person and we enjoy each other's company and its been going super well for us so far. 
           

The other day she stumbled upon me mid-panic attack which felt both embarrassing and uncomfortable. I'm not used to opening up let alone being seen mid-episode. I addressed the issue, explained to her that it was a panic attack, and that I'll be on meds soon. Thankfully, I'm in therapy and currently on meds. 
         

Nowadays, my depression is awful once more and I'm on a new type of medication so I feel weird most of the time, can't sleep, or even oversleep sometimes. That also means that my side of the room is getting messy and I'm not cleaning the bathroom as much as I used to, etc.. because I simply struggle with getting out of bed in the morning. I do apologize to her about the mess but I still feel like an awful roommate and an awful person too sometimes. She's very organized and productive yet I'm always in bed, I look like an awful mess and always seem to be ""having a bad day."" I hate being this person but I don't know how to make it better!

61,"Yeah, I mean like the title says that’s exactly how I’m feeling. I’m 18 years old, finishing my last year of high school, but I’m honestly feeling in the slumps and this feeling has been going on for a while. I just feel lonely, empty lost and scared about my future and this is only made worst by my feelings of anxiety.

I’m attending my classes and I feel like I’m not doing to well, I’m getting by fine at my part time job, but I feel like that’s taking up a lot of my time from school, but I can’t afford to leave the job either because I have to pay off my insurance to the car I kinda got forced into getting. I honestly don’t really have a social life if I think about it honestly. I really never had one. The only time I spent time with “friends” was at school, and that was literally how far the relationships went. Just class mates. Never had a girlfriend, because I always thought I needed cash if I wanted to go out with someone. 

I can’t talk to either of my parents about how I feel, because my relationship isn’t that good with either of them. My mom is a pretty cold person or atleast she turned into one. She’s been a bit hostile towards me over the last 3 years and I honestly can barely remember the last time she actually sincerely hugged me, without me trying to somewhat  try to hint at her that I wanted a hug or some words of affection from mother to son.

My dad, he’s been a great dad despite his many shortcomings, but I feel like I can’t vent out how I fully feel with him. Maybe it’s my pride as a son that I don’t want him to see me how weak I really am despite the mask of the strong son I’ve been wearing.

I’m just honestly scared and tired of worrying so much and not being able to just let it all out. After my dad got deported and even before that my whole life has been shit. Always having to worry about if we can make rent, knowing what we’re even going to eat tomorrow, taking care of my siblings, school, college. My future in general. 

I honestly just want to feel some kind of warmth, security and affection and not through money or materialistic shit, but I atleast want a hug from someone who can tell me it’s going to be okay, but I can’t get that at home. If anything I feel worst at home than anywhere else.

66,"I'm a first year university student, living about 100 miles away from home and just yesterday I found out about my mum's diagnosis, from my brother. I wasn't supposed to find out until November 4th which is when i'm going home to visit.

Some background information on her partner; 
He's 6'2"" and 51 years old. More dependent on my mother than both me and my brother. He's passive/aggressive and ticks every single box for a P/A to be clincally diagnosed. She's suggested him seeing someone multiple times before, which me nor my brother realised - but he won't. She's tried leaving him as he makes her life such a misery - but he will not go. He's threatened both me and my brother. Pinned my brother against a wall and raised his fist, on multiple occasions. It literally feels like he gets off on making other people unhappy.

Mum cooks for him, cleans, makes his lunch for work, vacuums, does his washing, ironing, walks the dog. Pretty much all of the house work which most wives/partners/girlfriends do, and then some. He will not lift a finger to help her and if he does it's considered a massive chore. For example; He will sit there and count the drinks that he makes in the evening and tells mum 'it's your turn, i've made x this evening.' to which she'll reply 'I make dinner every evening does that not contribute towards anything?' I recall one day it literally slipped my mothers mind and she forgot to make his sandwiches for work. He called her and made her feel like absolute shit because of it, because she didn't make his fucking sandwiches, he gets frustrated when he walks through the door and his dinner isn't sitting on the table. He is 50-fucking-1, this enrages me.

My mum and her partner went away this weekend, i'm guessing to somewhat 'lift the mood'. Anyhow, I called my mum as soon as I could to tell her that I knew about her diagnosis, that i'm heartbroken, scared etc. She said it felt as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders because she no longer has to worry about telling me herself as my brother did.

Her partner didn't see it like this, after I got off the phone to my mum she texted my brother saying '**** is not happy. Be warned.' So when they got home I had a text from my brother telling me that **** grabbed him, pushed/push past my mother to get to him and told him that 'He's going to break his neck/kill me'. He also said he was going to call the police, which he didn't. At this point my mum tried telling him to leave, that she wants to put the house on the market so they can both go their seperate ways. But for some reason, this asshole is still there and just will not leave.

He's incredibly jealous of mine and my mothers relationship and he makes that very obvious. I said to my mum that I know the reason he was so pissed about me finding out through my brother is because he no-longer gets to tell me, he will no longer get to witness my life fall apart infront of his eyes which I know, for a fact would have made his fucking day. He would have attemtpted a bullshit sympathy act but it's a complete facade. The whole thing would be incredibly dramatic, essentially making me worry like hell before he told me and i'm glad my brother took that opportunity away from him.

This is classic behaviour from him and it's never changed, nor is it going to. My main concern is that she doesn't need the stress from him at the best of times. Especially when she'll be bedridden and he's no longer able to depend on her, which will make him so angry and I worry he will take it out on her and make her feel bad. My mum is never ill and has the strongest work ethic a person could have. In the past 15+ years of her career she's had two days off. She doesn't like to depend on anyone and she doesn't realise how ill she's going to be.

Me, nor my brother - I even managed to get her to say it; we don't think that **** should be around when she's going through this. Me and my brother want him to leave but we just can't figure out how we can get him to.

Thank you to everyone who reads this, all advice and responses are appreciated.

So I live on student accommodation and the same rules apply but none of my housemates care that my boyfriend stays with me a few days a week.

People just mostly spend their time in the library on weekends, or they go to frat houses and get completely trashed. There is barely any in-between. 

The thing is I really like this other school. The band would be so fun, it is gorgeous, the people are nice, and there is a campus life. It just is a big step down name wise. It is still a good school but not anywhere near the other school. It is less expensive too. The people are not as bright as my school now. I can tell just from walking around on campus. 

All I can say is I don't think I have really had actual ""fun"" since I've been on campus. Things have been enjoyable, but it just hasn't really been ""fun"", and I really miss having a good time. I guess that makes me unhappy while I'm at school and I find that I just don't really enjoy doing anything all that much there. I just go through the motions everyday and I feel like there should be something more. ",16Oct2017,1
77,"Hi I am 13 years old and I am at the point of kiling myself right now. My mother is widow and this started 3 years ago when my step dad and her got into a fight and we moved. She started abusing me and my sisters. I have now been depressed, have anxiety, and trust issues at school because of her. I sometimes tell my aunts which are older than her the things she does, like one incident that happened a few weeks ago was that she told everyone she was going to some church camp to learn to become a better parent, but long story short she went to las vegas. I was the first one who knew about and told my aunts. Since then she is always emotionally and physically abusing me, leaving no markes though just red but wores off after 30 minutes. Today she went all out on me because I told her that I needed my uniforms by tomorrow and that she hadn't washed them so I took them to my room and when she saw that I took them from the laundry pile she.. you know. I hate my life even my sister's are always fighting with me. I am not talented, my grades are bad in school, and I have no friends. I only have a roof on top of my bed because my aunts and grandma loan my mom money for our needs. I don't know the California rules about abusing children. I want to report her, I never want to see my mother again, but I love my sisters and I don't want us to get separated either and don't want to wait to move out till I'm 18.

Before I started school, I was really excited to go to school and get away from everything for a while. So far it's been great! However, I hadn't been home for two months until I returned this past weekend. I was pretty excited about it all week. When I got home, everything was still the same. Mom's great cooking, my brother always playing video games, and my dad always coming home from work at 7. I realized how much I missed it all and I didn't want to go back to college. Now that I am back, I really want to go home again. I feel real homesick and I cry because of it. In the past few months so much has changed, and I wish I could just be a kid again where everything was so simple. I just really miss the past... :'(",16Oct2017,13

91,"Friday night I was contactint via snapchat at work by a stranger. They claimed to have found me through one of my somewhat instagram famous friends that posts pictures of me quite often. He propositioned me with a strange offer of nude modeling for 10,000 dollars for a week of work. The offer was to entail me sending pictures and videos for a payment. Naturally skeptical I asked for proof of legitimacy. Screencaps were taken of his bank account with transaction histories and statements. The bank account had 23 million dollars and purchases that alligned with legitimate stores for large sums of money along with a small contract stating none of the things i'd send would be shared on any platforms on the internet with an electronic signature. I'm still very skeptical but sent some pictures anyway because lets be honest, a picture is a picture and quite frankly im not ashamed enough to be afraid of blackmail. 
Fast forward to today sunday night and i get a request for an 11 minute video with specific instructions, and 5 pictures and a screencap of 10,000 waiting to.be transferred via paypal to me. Initially I've heard of such scams where people would be extorted into making these videos and then the person receiving them threatens to spread them around if a payment to them isnt made, but quite frankly based on the interactions ive had this far this doesnt seem to be the case. Apparently he was born into wealth and inherited a chain of fast food restaraunts and spends money in massive quantities with little care.
So ultimately my question is do I make this 11 minute video and potentially make 10,000 dollars or potentially get blackmailed? Whats really the worst that can happen here? Im a very skeptical person in general",16Oct2017,3

I argue that he might want to have a degree as a back-up later on down the line when he gets tired of doing dangerous and physically exhausting work. 



My argument aside, he makes a powerful case against having a degree, and none of his work interests require a degree.

I'm so grateful to have gotten out to safety with my best friend, and that my friend who was shot is alive, and finally left the ICU two days ago. I have seen an immense amount of good in people, it's beautiful. People have shown so much love and compassion. I feel like while my life has changed, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm looking at everyday with a different view. Life is precious and beautiful. Love and live fully. Find joy in what God has given you every day. 

My best friend got a tattoo a few days after. The day after it happened, I knew I wanted one too, but I wanted to think about it to pick something that would be meaningful to me, yet subtle. Something to remind me of how far I've come from this event. I don't want to rush it, but now that I know what I want I don't see the point in waiting.

My fiancé told me not to do it. He said to wait a year and then see if I still wanted it. My sister thinks it'll just be a bad reminder. I don't see it that way. 

It's really weighing on me. Is it really that bad of an idea? I wanted to get small Roman numerals of the date on my wrist.

The problem is, he can't seem to make up his mind whether he feels the same way about me. On one hand he can't get over his old girlfriend that he's been broken up with for 4 years. On the other hand, he acts like he needs me more than anyone. And yes, we've had sex a few times. But the other night, when he was having a particularly bad ""old girlfriend"" spell, he told me he didn't love me and admitted to me that he's not physically attracted to me. I have suspected as much for a long time, even though occasionally he tells me I look great, but hearing it like that totally crushed me. When we were talking it out (more like crying, in my case), he said that the other 99.9% of me was the reason he kept me around, and that maybe he just needed more time. 

But my thought process is, if he doesn't love me enough after this long to see me as beautiful, will he ever? For months we've been on this roller coaster of ""should we or shouldn't we"" start dating, and his excuse has been that he's ""not ready,"" but now I feel like the whole time it's just because he knows he doesn't feel for me in that way. In the meantime, there are other girls he finds attractive who he has gone out with occasionally, but he has insisted he's not dating them. But whenever I mention that maybe we should both start dating (other people) and give each other some space, he says he would be heartbroken to see me with another guy.

So I am in this constant state of anxiety, wondering when the ball is going to drop and he's going to tell me he's fallen for some other girl. And I feel like I will always play second fiddle to his old girlfriend and any other girl he actually finds attractive. Meanwhile, there have been other guys that have wanted to date me, but I have declined because of my feelings for him and the hope that someday we might actually end up together (which he has said he thinks will happen).

I am just so torn and so confused. After that horrible night, he came over and told me that he really did love me and asked me never to leave him. The next day he told me I looked beautiful. I feel like there is constant contradiction from him and I don't know what to believe, although he tells me that he will always shoot straight with me.

121,"This might not be as serious as other people's issues but it personally bothers me a lot. I am very elitistic when it comes to music. Years ago, I was very open to all kinds of music and I didn't care about anything except the sound of it. I didn't care about technical stuff or complexity or genre as long as the music was good and came from emotion and passion. However, right now I find it increasingly difficult to listen to anything because I will always find a lame reason to dismiss a band. I will give you an example. Nirvana used to be my favorite band back in the day. I just simply liked their sound, they sounded different and unique even though they weren't particularly skilled musicians (or rather technical), they made music from the heart and played music with a burning passion that fascinated me more than anything. Their music was simple, catchy and their live performances sounded like carbon copies of their studio records. Nowadays I stumbled upon them after a few months of 'break' and I was surprised to see how much I have changed. I still think their music is good, but there's a few things that keep me from listening to it. For instance, I deliberately refuse to listen to young musicians. I know it sounds rather odd. I just find it uncomfortable to listen to young musicians because it somehow makes me feel 'immature'. Or maybe it's the fact that older musicians give me this safe feeling that they are experienced and know what they're doing in the musical field. The fact that Kurt Cobain was just 27 years old when he died FREAKS ME OUT for some reason. So I tried to stay away from that. As I said, I have nothing bad to say about the music, I just can't get past this 'young and immature' label. Another example: I refuse to listen to Iron Maiden because I hate the entire metal culture and IRONICALLY, I hate the typical metalhead elitism, even though I am an elitist myself. I just feel like this elitism of mine is caused by constant exposure to metalheads' stupid opinions about anything that isn't metal. I feel like it influenced me heavily in my choices in music and I cannot revert this because I am easily influenced by people's opinions. So I refuse to listen to Iron Maiden and other metal bands as well because I feel like the fans of these bands influence me in a negative way. What should I do to get over all these barriers? It bothers me because I am missing out on good music because of my stupid mindset. ",16Oct2017,1

I understand that this happens in PhD projects so no big deal. The new area was something that I had no experience in, and I was entirely honest about this in my interview and brought it up again to be sure that I would have the support I needed. The support was definitely lacking but I carried on and tried my best with the advice from other colleagues in the lab. I have monthly meetings and for 3 consecutive meetings I was told that my work was on track and that everything was fine. I then had my one year review and it was a train wreck. I ended up receiving an assessment that wasn't meant for me, and my supervisor literally held my report over the bin and said that was where it belonged...even though he had said my results were good for the entire time leading up to this and he had seen 4 drafts of the report.  

I continued on the course and made it clear to my supervisors that I needed more support if I was expected to continue with this area of research, they agreed and all was well. Except the same issues are rearing their ugly heads again and don't show any sign of going away. I receive advice at one meeting and act on it only to be told at the next meeting that it was wrong, I ask for more support and receive none, and there is a continued pissing contest between my supervisors which overshadows the actual needs of the project. 
Now I am 2 years in to a project that I hate, that is so far away from what I was originally meant to be doing despite my best efforts.  

To be clear, I am a conscientious student who has never had an issue like this previously. I have been to see my research tutor and he has agreed with me on every point so I know it's not just me. I have spoken to my parents about quitting and finding a research job but they say I should stay, but I'm not sure if this is motivated by them wanting me to finish rather than my actual interests (they have told all of their friends what I'm doing).   

In the meantime my mental health has taken a massive downturn, I feel really unmotivated and don't feel like I would even be able to defend the new work at the viva stage because it's so far away from everything else I've been doing. The only thing really stopping me is the fear of not being able to obtain a new job with a massive hole in my CV for the last 2 years. My priorities in life have also changed, meaning that studying is really limiting where I want to be in my life right now, both financially (which I should have anticipated) and in terms of my living arrangements (hate where I live and who I live with, becoming unbearable).  

Basically I feel like I'm in limbo with no idea of what to do or where to go. Any advice would be welcome. ",16Oct2017,4
126,"For example, should you just go to work and do the minimum and like that waste as less time of your life on it.

Or do you work extra hours doing jobstuff you like or makes your job better, but they don't pay you (enough) for?

128,"Ok so to keep it simple I dun fucked up

Lemme catch you up to speed, so I'm a senior in high school, I'm a quiet dude, and had just finished getting over a recent breakup, upon entering this year, I had learned that I had to government with this ex I had recently got over, second semester so I decided to swap out so instead of taking this class 4th second semester I would take it 3rd. So everything seems great, fast forward to first day of this year. I meet this phenomenal girl who happened to sit in front of me in economics, my 3rd hour for 1st semester, and i decided hey it's my senior year I'll talk to her I've got nothing to lose wtf, she's hot I wanna have a conversation, so we click immidiately, every day for the next 2 weeks we are constantly talking cracking jokes having a great time, to the point where other classmates across the room got pissed at us (yet we sat on the far end of the wall) eventually I decide to ask her out to which she says yes, so we planned for the following Saturday

Finally it was there, my date with uh, (ok for mine and her sake let's call her Beatrice) Beatrice, we have a very nice dinner and watch Annabelle creation we have a great time, food was amazing, conversation was engaging, juices were flowing, so it comes to the point where I take her home, I say goodbye after I walk her up to the door and she embraces me like I'm her life's core, she thanks me for the night as do I and I drive home text her all night, and she mentioned me on her Snapchat story twice, once showing us on the date and again saying best night in a long time with a heart face like so 😍 

So it's back to Monday it's school again, at this point over text we decided we would be official so that was that, Beatrice and I, the perfect couple in my eyes, I would proceed at the end of the week to take her out for lunch where we eat at a shitty pizza place, but conversation was engaging enough to make it worth, I drive her home again, I walk her up again, she embraces me like last time and then kisses me, we give our goodbyes to each other and I leave, more texting all throughout the week, every day, at least 2 hours per each time we talk lasted to 6 hours at times, fast forward again about a week

I had been trying to plan another date for us over the weekend however based on our work schedules and she had a trip to go on with a club she did, it didn't happen but we ended up planning for the week after

We eventually decide, more to her decision I just kinda played along with the idea, a place we will call amazing fakes but I think y'all know what I really mean, so it's a kids arcade with some rides and laser tag plus bowling and a place to eat. On the website for this place I calculated I had to pay about $20 for us both, pocket change for the hours I work being it's a date. When I pay it turns out I had to pay some extra bullshit charges, comes out out to be roughly $70, great. So we play some arcade games but quickly run out because we only were given $5 cards for that insane amount of money I had to pay, we also had access to unlimited rides and food bar, I walk around suggesting ideas, let's do bowling, go karts, bumper cars, decent things to do for some high school kids I guess, and so she doesn't wanna do any, I jokingly suggest we do the ferris wheel, much too big for us to ride, which she thinks is an amazing idea, so we get on this monster and take it around for 3 minutes, I make myself apparent I'm trying to hold her hand, she doesn't even notice me lmao. Whatever, we get off the ride. Now she wants to do the kiddy roller coaster and the kiddy tower of terror (which was like 1 and a half stories tall) it's meant for kids not 18 yr olds. So we do, it's awkward as fuck. So then she's done, she doesn't wanna do anything more, so I suggest we eat, I paid $70 for this shit, I'm not leaving hungry lol, so she agreed and we go on our merry way, had some shitty pizza and a mountain dew, we go into the movie room and watch the good dinosaur where she doesn't focus on me or movie, instead she's on her phone ""consoling her friend who had a recent breakup"" I eat this cardboard with cheese and pepperoni drink my soda, she finishes her place, and she wants to leave, we were barely at this place and I am not paying that much money to spend &gt;2 hours at a shitty kids arcade. I suggest we go to this romantic part of town, has some small restaurants, mom and pop shops, nice lighting, perfect for a more mature date, which I wanted, she doesn't want that and instead she drags me to the mall where we go to some clothing stores where she buys a few things and we leave

That's it, that's the date, shitty right? But I put on some romantic music on the way back home, keep my hand on her thigh, try to salvage a bit of this terrible night, she seems happy I'm treating her well. I bring her home, same shit, little bit less clingy this time, nothing on Snapchat or twitter, no nothing, I get to school next week and she breaks up with me, cool. So she goes off tries to get some free easy dick cause I am not that easy, I do my own thing for a few months.

So now that you are caught up to speed lemme explain the dilemma I was trying to deal with. She retweets a lot of girl bullshit, ""I'm the type of guy that ____"" ""I want a long term relationship"" ""love it when boys _______"" after the breakup I had realized she was really only in it so she could try and fuck me, a check off of her list I guess, which I mean is not a way to get what she seemed to want, what she told me her long term plans were, ""I want to date to marry"" ""dating to date is stupid"" which I can agree on, I wanna date so I can find myself a companion, I don't want to just have a good time I want something real. 

Another thing you gotta realize, I have a Twitter to keep up on music, my friends, and memes. I have a Snapchat with close ppl so I can talk about life, advice, my opinions on shit, events I go to, idk just my day to day bullshit. Ppl enjoy my rants, cause apparently I'm smart according to them, ao I try to leave some life thoughts, and sometimes if something is bugging me I'll point it out, so that girl, Beatrice had been tweeting ""I miss you"" ""all I want is you back"" and retweeting shit, funny enough she would always do this directly after she saw something on my story I'm now realizing that would cause her to react that way, so I put something on my story saying, ""aye this is for only one of you but if you are subtweeting me, dm me, if you wanna talk to me, talk, I'm listening"" lol because I mean I wanna see what she wants if she wants me back she gotta work for me I'm not gonna fall for her bullshit but if she wants to try I'll offer a shot. And well she never would say anything because I thought hey lol she must be like some of the mofuckas on here that just skip through my story tapping real quick because she would never say anything to any of my posts

Today specifically she tweeted ""stop posting about it, let's talk"" so look this is the 3rd time she has actually tweeted something that is in direct line with my story. This is no longer coincidence she is talking about me, and I had put on there a rant saying basically, if you want something real stop being so hollow and using your beauty to manipulate guys just wanting dick and leaving cause you won't get your long term that way and I said stick around with someone for a while, work through the bullshit, talk about what's bothering you see if you can fix it that's what a relationship is, you each have to work for each other to be happy, if you are upset, you communicate. That's it

So at this point I'm like fuck it, it's been 3 times she wants to talk to me obviously wat I'm saying has some effect on her. So I dm her, I wanna help ppl even if they my ex, and I should have cut contacts when we broke up but I didn't, idk why honestly

I said, ""ok let's talk"" thinking she will know immidiately what I'm speaking of being she tweeted for us to talk 10 min earlier. She replies, ""about what"" I explained she was subtweeting me because she was replying to what I was saying on my story and she wants to talk to I'm here lets talk. She replies ""are you fucking serious"" I reply, ""am I wrong"" she says, ""yes you are absolutely wrong"" and after that she just goes off, I take responsibility I dun fucked up, I read a situation wrong, I have not been wrong in this regard before, someone does something, I kinda call em out, I offer advice, they listen, we work things out, viola.

I apologized for my mistake again and again, saying I feel so shitty as I should I'm gravely sorry and my words can not come close to how sorry I really am about my mistake. What does she respond? 

K.

What a bitch, so I go to friends for help and I block her on everything, her number, Snapchat, Twitter, shit  I better do insta too. But yeah, so I guess most ppl would say ok so what is the problem. I still have school with her, I am on my first break, I go back in 2 days, I have class with her still, and also remember how I said I swapped out of the class with my one ex, well turns out the class I swapped into next semester she's in, and me and my other ex, not Beatrice, are on good terms now. She's actually not a shitty person like Beatrice. So yeah, she's also pretty popular and I don't really give a shit about what other ppl think of me, but the problem is, if she talks and gossips, which she will, she's gonna talk shit about me all over yet when we were dating I did nothing but treat her perfect, on those dates, sure I was upset for the amount of money I spent or a shitty time, but i never showed that emotion, I kept that inside until I was home, I apologized for my wrongdoing

But now I'm probably fucked, or my reputation is lol cause of lies that will be spread, so I guess the advice I'm trying to ask for is, how do I save that and or what do I do, is there anything I can do, or should do for the future other than never speak to an ex again after we break up lol

Thanks y'all",16Oct2017,2

What i noticed is that it had a complete lack of communication side since i like to socialize and talk and bring my ideas to the table. But since my study has mainly introverted people i feel out of place. Im unsure if i should stop now.

It just seems that every time i leave my room my mother says something to me here's some quotes of the day
""You're worthless"" ""You Need a Job"" and i explain to her i want to focus on school at the moment and work on that and say i know where you're coming from but still I'm not good enough it doesn't help that i have anxiety. 

Which started by me being bullied since 5th Grade and it still happening to this day even though I've moved schools.

I told no one. 

I was attacked after school almost everyday. 

Called names behind my back and to my face. 
I hated myself. 

At my old school if i didn't do these two kids homework i would be hit repeatedly in the chest with a
baseball bat or i was punched if i was lucky.
 Now i'm being hit in the middle of the hall and the teachers watch it
happen and say ""I'm Horsing around"" and i somehow get in trouble

This weekend I was invited by my Grandma to a cookout, after thinking over and over i decided to go. It took a lot of effort. I was staying the night. She is a manipulator she always speaks in the third person if she wants you to do something. 
Anyway i told my Brother and my cousins that i was being messed with for so long.

They were upset of course… but it made me feel like garbage and regret it.

My Brother told my Grandma… and my grandma blames me for being bullied for what i wear.

I wear t-shirts and jeans sometimes basketball shorts. But it's The “Nerdy kind” as she calls it Dark souls, Fallout,
Final fantasy, Doom and, Metal gear solid and then normal t-shirts, jeans, shorts. Nothing weird right?

She told me i was worthless even though she knows i have problems with how people think about me. She can voice her opinion i have no problem with that but it hit me hard.

We barely spoke the next day

I put on a smile and went out the greet the family.

No one talked to me.

I was trying to start a conversation with them saying “Hello” and “You look nice today” little things like that. But i was ignored by everyone.

And i asked myself why. I barely ate anything lost my appetite.

I went to my Brothers apartment that night i buy him some food some fast food but it's all i can afford.
He thanked me and ate i bought a soda.

I slept on his couch that night and it was the one of the better nights so far this month.

I went home in the morning my mom was sleeping.

They found out i was a atheist a few months ago and they shamed me for it calling me a moron.

Religion was never pushed onto me never went to church I've never believed in it ever.

But my mother and her boyfriend remind me i'm going to hell everyday.

Yeah my dad left for three years. But growing up he would come in and out of my life but three years was the longest he was gone.

He pretends that it is all okay. 

Then i ask myself was it my fault?

No i tell myself but i'm not to sure.

His girlfriend was a issue for me. we would fight not physically but she would say things like “Your dad hates you” and that would go on for about a year.

The stress of school is the worst because the teachers the people i'm supposed to look up to are the worst if you dare to ask a question they will say “you should've been paying attention”.

And i needed the help i had bad grades i was afraid to say i had my homework done because we would go over it in class on the board.

And my mom would call me a idiot if i asked her for help for anything.

She cares i think… but sometimes i don’t know she can be a nice person and i can respect her she changed her lifestyle for me when i was born but then again that's what most parents need to do. I'm getting Professional help already for my anxiety Recently its been helping a bit. 

Thank you for reading this &lt;3

138,"Hello my name is Ted, I am 26 years old and I was born an raised in Greece. I live in Athens which is the capital of the country.  

For anyone that doesn't know, Greece has been in a huge economic crisis for a long time. Our corrupt goverment and our wrong way of living has led our country to a point where everyone struggles to make ends meet, and it keeps getting worse.  

But I am not here to discuss the general problems of my country, I'm here to discuss my own personal problems. I've been working on TV as an assistant director since I was 17, while I was progressing with my bachelor studies. I got my diploma at 21 and continued to work on TV. But things have gotten from bad to worse over the years.  

I don't know how TV networks work on other countries, but over here the system is extremelly corrupt, we are basically working for a form of mafia. People have gotten scammed, and keep getting scammed out of their money, almost 2/3 times they go work on a project. This is not an exaggeration. I have personally lost over 6000 euro (this is a LOT of money over here) that I know I am never going to get. On the network I am right now, they have stationed us in an underground ""office"" with no windows and no way for air to get inside whatsoever. To make things even better, the ventilation system is made in such a way that every fume produced in the building (from machines, generators etc.) ends up on our room. If we ever complain about it, we all know we can easily get fired over it. Again, this is not an exaggeration.  

Every other field of work is basically the same thing also. You work at least 6 days a week, for god knows how many hours every day (working overtime of course doesn't increase your salary and you are forced to do it) only to pray that you get payed sometime so you can pay your bills. Having money left over for something other than surviving is an extremelly rare luxury for most of us.  

I am currently in a situation where I am in debt over 1k euro, I get payed significantly less and I am taking legal action going after a station that refuses to pay me last year's money (over 3000 euro). I am borrowing money from my girlfriend to pay for rent and basic needs, but if I don't get at least some of the money they owe me there is no way I can ever pay my debts. As you can imagine this situation has caused me extreme anxiety and depression. And there are a LOT of other Greeks that have it way worse than me.  

So I want to ask you, is leaving my country my only option? I don't see any other way around it, even surviving is going to get extremelly hard since the current goverment is making matters worse, and there is no bright future in sight. If so, where can I migrate to? I am fluent in English and have a Bachelor's in Film Studies and Directing. Do I have any chance in getting accepted in an English-speaking country?",16Oct2017,1
141,"Hi there! I'd really like some advice. 23 female here.

I have really crowded upper teeth. I wanted to get braces when I was younger and in high school, but my parents brought me for a few appointments and eventually stopped. I wasn't so attentive and neither were they, and until now my teeth are horribly crowded. I never smile in pictures with my teeth and I even try not to laugh when I'm outdoors in the daytime.

Eventually in 2012 I went to uni and was very short on money. My parents couldn't send me enough to cover school and I didn't understand how insurance worked for the dentist/orthodontist so I never went. Over that time, I have teeth in the back that are broken, breaking apart, one is even exposing my gum and hurts occasionally. 

I'm so embarrassed to go to a dentist. I don't even know how to start. I just started working my first full time job and finally have some savings that I can begin to think about going back. I'm also embarrassed to get braces at this age and I've been thinking of other options, but again I'm short on money. I don't know what to do, it's a combination of being embarrassed about my teeth situation, hating my smile, being a bit broke...

Every time I see someone with beautiful straight teeth I want to cry. It's the one thing I want most. My boyfriend had braces and has a beautiful smile, sometimes I wonder why he's even with me when my teeth look terrible!

If you have ever dealt with a alcoholic relative you probably know what I'm talking about when I say he is such an infuriating person to talk to and seems like the alcohol has ate  his brain away to about a high school level of maturity.  
When calling the man, all you will hear is angry political rants that he probably heard from Rush limbaugh, or another discussion about his three favorite movies again..  (he will quote the entire movie out loud if you watch it with him, ruining the expierience)
Basically, he is a tool and I cannot stand the man but he is my father and did provide for me, any ideas on how i should interact with him?

P.s.  Coming to the realization that his excessive drinking was most likely what caused my siblings and I to you have to go through such a painful divorce does not help at all.

146,"I've been battling with acute anxiety and depression for most of my entire life.
I was bullied all throughout school. My parents divorced when I was at a young age. My father was/is emotionally abusive. I've been on 8 different antidepressants and antianxiety medications since I was 12 (I'm currently 23). I've been through a suicide attempt, and forcibly checked into a mental ward twice for suicidal thoughts. 

Last year, I went through an extremely traumatic sexual experience where I was drugged and taken advantage of. I feel like less of a man, or whatever society's definition of a 'man' is. I feel weak for having this happen to me while being in a loving LDR with an amazing woman. So very weak. It happened the weekend before finals at my college, causing me to fail all of my classes. I tried to make a come-back the following semester, but the amount of pain and anxiety I was going through made me do worse. 

I was dropped from my college due to my GPA, and I'm currently trying to work a job and go to therapy in the meantime. I'm being mistreated at work, and talked horribly about behind my back, causing me to finally stand up for myself and seek other jobs in the area.

I'm in a state of going to therapy once a week, and working 3-4 days a week as a barback. The therapy is helping a bit and helping to give me tools to use, but it's not enough at 4am when I'm having my seemingly every-other-day panic attack.

I want to feel normal and know that everything will be okay. Things that used to be fun and make me happy don't anymore. I feel crippled from my recent trauma and years of suffering at the hands of depression and anxiety.

150,"This is more of an *''Is this guy an asshole, or am I just being unreasonable''*? kind of question. But I'd also like advice. 

I'm genuinely curious if there are any mall cleaners on here — what are things that piss you off during your work day? I work at a supermarket that's connected to a mall, so I'm in the mall on a daily basis. 

I ask because I try to go out of my way to be accommodating to people. Most cleaners at my mall are middle-aged women and they're very considerate. Sometimes they'll come over to my table in the food court to clean up, and I feel really bad for just sitting there like I'm in their way, so I always offer to move to a different table while they clean mine, but they're always super friendly and respond with *''Oh no, it's fine!! You stay where you are''*. 

Anyway, there's this particular table I like in the food court as it's more secluded and has a bit more privacy (I hate being seated next to a lot of people when I'm in a call so I try to seek a secluded spot). As I headed over to my usual spot, this new cleaner guy in his sixties stopped me kind of arrogantly. 

Cleaner: Hey!  (He says as he sees me headed toward a certain area).

Me: Hey, what's up? 

Cleaner: Can you do me a favour? (asked rhetorically with attitude). I've just mopped that entire column of tables. . . 

He doesn't finish his sentence, but I already feel like a child being lectured by their parent asking me not to use something they've just cleaned. 

Me: And you don't want me to sit over there. Am I right?

Cleaner: Yes. 

I obliged him, but I felt really frustrated with him due to the way I was left to feel like I had done something wrong. It was the way he said it. And I've given it some serious thought. 

No cleaner has ever dictated where I can and cannot sit. Their job is to clean, so even if you sit in an area they've just cleaned, it's eventually going to get dirty again. So it's silly to try and prevent people from sitting there. I work in a supermarket and we often have to pull the stock on the shelves forward to make it look neat and tidy and accessible (this can take a long time) but we don't tell customers not to touch the stock just because we've invested some time in making it look good — that's our job! *''Hey, customer, I've just tidied that shelf. Do me a favour and keep your hands off the canned tuna!''*. 

I also thought about the possibility that maybe this cleaner just didn't want me to slip. But I highly doubt this. In my observation, I usually only see cleaners do deep-cleans of an area when the store is closed (not when it's open) otherwise customers would be slipping left and right. It seems counterproductive to do a deep-clean of an entire food court while the mall is open and people will be wanting to access the area. 

Also, if this were genuinely the case, I would think he'd be more sympathetic about it. Like *''Hey buddy, sorry to bother you but I've just cleaned that area and I wouldn't want you to trip and hurt yourself so I just thought I'd let you know''*. 

What do you guys think? Am I an asshole, or is this cleaner being unreasonable? And how should I deal with this situation? I have a hunch this is going to become an ongoing problem since I'm in the mall often and I've seen him around a lot lately and (not to judge a book by its cover) but he always looks pissed off and unapproachable. I figured this wouldn't be a problem since it's not like I want to be his friend, but if he keeps approaching me like this ... It's just something the other cleaners don't do (they always start friendly small talk with me and are always very pleasant people) so I feel like he just has a bit of an ego or something.

154,"I currently work at two jobs and I am looking desperately for full time work. I’ve recently got asked for an interview as a assistant manager in my field (sort of) and am waiting to hear if they’ll accept a phone interview as it’s out of state. 

One of my part-time jobs is extremely stressful, low staffed,  and management is very bad. I asked for help from a manager when I wasn’t properly sure and she told me “I don’t have time for this” and walked away. I even had a panic attack (they fired someone and I was by myself) and another said “It’s not that serious” and kept grilling me as to why it was happening and she made me return to work. I turned in my two weeks later that night. Even with two weeks, I desperately don’t want to go back to that place. 

The other job, while management is fine and accommodating it asks a lot with little hourly pay. But I make a lot of tips. I don’t want to be a server anymore, and feel I’m aiming too low because I have a college degree. Not to mention I just don’t want to deal with the public anymore, late nights, me constantly switching shifts...I just can’t take it anymore and want to to quit this one as well. 

The latter provides me with enough money to get by and pay my bills while living with family until I find a full time job. I don’t know what to do...

156,"I've been in a difficult living situation for the past year. I went from having a terrible, passive aggressive, rude roommate to a sloppy, disgusting, dirty roommate who has people crashing at the apartment all the time. Currently he has a friend staying from India indefinitely since he is here trying to find a job and housing. I am moving in with my boyfriend in two weeks, but since my current lease isn't up until December 31, I will still be paying rent for my current apartment I'm residing in now. I have already went to my property manager and signed the lease termination form, as well as let them know I will not be living there in two weeks. I also told them about the roommate's friends constantly crashing at the apartment, since there is a clause in our lease that says we are not allowed to have any other persons living in the apartment besides the people listed on the lease. This may sound like I'm being bitchy and controlling, but he has had people crashing on the couch since the first week he moved in. It would be different if these friends were staying for a night or the weekend, but they're not. I have people over for a night here and there, but they're not taking up the entire living room space like his friends are. Also, he's not someone I knew prior to him moving in, he was just someone I found to take over my old roommate's lease so I wouldn't be responsible for the entire rent myself. I don't know these people who he has crashing at the apartment, and they stay there while he and I are both at work during the day, which I have expressed to him on more than one occasion that I am not comfortable with that at all. I also have a cat, who two different friends of his on different occasions expressed was annoying since I let her roam the entire apartment at night because if I kept her locked in my room I would get little to no sleep since night time is her playtime. I hate walking into my own residence to strangers cooking in my kitchen, leaving a mess and not cleaning up after themselves, or using the washer and dryer during times I wanted to use it. 

So here's where I need advice. I have expressed my concern to the property manager that my roommate will have people stay in my room once I ""move out"" since he has no problem letting people crash at the apartment now, but since I am still paying rent for the said room, I don't want anyone staying there in risk of anything damaging happening to the room and bathroom. (My worries for this are valid as he had a party one weekend and my dishes were broken and two barstools were destroyed.) Also, since I will be moving away from the city, I would still occasionally like to use my room on several occasions to stay in the city on nights I have planned to go out and not worry about driving an hour back to the suburbs to my new apartment. My property manager said she would call me roommate to let him know of the clause in our lease, but nothing else was said on taking further action to keep this from happening again. So what can I do to ensure the safety of my space in the apartment, since my property manager doesn't seem to be taking my concerns seriously? I would like my security deposit at the end of my lease and I fear if he takes over my room, I might not get it back due to uncleanliness and his sloppy ways. Who else can I contact to help my situation or am I stuck with just hoping he will stay out in his own? Thanks in advance for your help! ",16Oct2017,1

158,"Hi. I'm a 17 year old guy who's born in a family belonging to the religion Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ in English). To make it simpler, here's the reasons why my situation is much more complicated than just leaving the church and why it's driving me insane. Sorry if it would be long.

* INC (that's what I'll call the church from now on) is a religion that would fall somewhere into the description of an extremist group. Basically, one of their many strict rules is that any ex-members of the church shall not receive any kind of support (financial, moral, etc) from anyone within INC. That includes your family members and friends.

* All die-hard believers go bat-shit crazy when they've learned of someone that has gone against their belief. BATSHIT crazy. The heads globally announce the names of ex-members who were recently ""dismissed"" for going against their rules, thus ruining your and your family's reputation to hundreds of thousands of people.

* They have a plethora of rules that some would consider to go against basic human rights, especially on freedom of speech. Discrimination is also very common within the church. (Xenophobia, xenocentrism, A LOT of misogyny, homophobia, etc.)

* I'm in no way financially stable to take care of myself if I do choose to leave the religion now (because leaving church = family disowning me). I'm 17, got no job. Also, moving out with family members ain't possible because all of them are also church members. Even if I do move out, I won't be ready to face the rest of the consequences at my current age.

* I'll have no way of letting my parents understand and be open-minded about my situation and beliefs. My siblings would probably support me, but God no not my parents.

* I got this church duty wherein I'm in charge of ""guiding"" and taking care of kids. I feel that my responsibility towards them is very hypocritical and I'm ashamed to be leading these children to a path that's doomed for the rest of their lives.

* I'm limited to the stuff that I am able to do with my life. Extremely limited. Because of all their rules that I am forced to follow, almost every situation in my life is riddled with the thought that if anyone from my church finds out, I am **dead**.  Even posting on this subreddit is making me paranoid. So, if anyone who's part of INC happens to see this, PLEASE don't tell anyone. Please.

* Every member is subjected to constant surveillance. In and out of church, even social media and internet activities. Do one thing against their rules and they find out, you're doomed.

* I love my family. I love my parents. I really do. I just want them to understand that I do not simply believe in all the things they've raised me to believe. I don't want to follow the church. I love them but I cannot find a way to express my thoughts without being disowned and seen as a traitor.

Of course, I've only told a handful of friends about this, no one else. Even they cannot think of any way that I could leave the church without suffering the consequences that would ruin me.

My current plan: Once I'm financially stable, I'll schedule a family appointment with a psychiatrist. I hope that my parents would be able to understand my situation, even just a bit.

I do extremely well in academics, something that I thought would be enough to please my parents. However, they've been recently noticing my lack of church activities and they subject me to even MORE church activities that are **intentionally** meant to ruin my schedule with friends, school, and other important stuff. I feel imprisoned. It's all affecting my social life and studies. 

All I'm asking for is some sort of advice that could help me cope with my depression till I'm old enough to be ready on my own and do things that I have been wanting for all my life. Any small advice would be appreciated. Thanks, Reddit. 

TL;DR I belong in an extremist Christian religion that I can't leave till I'm ready to live on my own. I'm under constant surveillance. I need help coping up with my depression and finding out some ways that I could let my parents understand my situation.",16Oct2017,0

162,"My new employer has been frustrated with me since shortly after we started. He has MS and is in a wheel chair, and basically only has function left in one arm. He hired me to be a personal care assistant through a government funded program to help him with daily tasks for everything as far as helping him in the bathroom to doing dishes, cooking and looking after his kids. 


He seemed to be generally unhappy with how I went about accomplishing tasks. Instead of informing me how I could have completed a task better when I was finished, so that I could  understand where he was coming from, he would interrupt me as soon as I started staying that I was doing it wrong. 


For example, he specially asked me to wash some brownie pans. I washed said brownie pans by putting a bit of dish soap on a cloth and scrubbing them under hot water before rinsing them off. He then handed me an empty hummus container he had just finished with to rinse, I rinse it then wash away the globs of hummus in the sink. He starts complaining at this point in a very condescending way that there were other dishes on the counter, about five small, not every dirty dishes. That's fine, I'll get to them, I just wanted to make sure the hummus had been washed away. I think it would be quicker to use my dishcloth method instead of filling the sink, since I would scrub every dish anyway and they are not very dirty or sticky at all. Obviously he does not agree, and so I do the extra step of filling the sink with water. To be clear, I would have done that if they were sticky or needed a quick soak, but it was just water glasses and a plate with crumbs. I have worked several times in professional kitchens, and so I was washing them in that style. 


The breaking point was when he asked me to help him wash his back. I began to just wash, scrubbing in small circles starting at his left shoulder and spreading out diagonally. I know what spots I washed and what spots I need to, as I have a great eye for this, so I know I will get his entire back quickly. No, he wants me to wash side to side. Fine, I start scrubbing shoulder to shoulder, progressing lower as each area is washed, working quite quickly and I stop doing the circles. He begins to get incredibly frustrated. No, it's shoulder to hip, in overlapping strokes. Okay, obviously he can't mean horizontally as I was just doing that, so I try vertically. No, no, no, Side to side! At this point he is fed up and tells me to just leave. 
  

I care far more about the end result than getting there, as I have worked several incredibly high pressure jobs. Previous employers have told me that I am more throughout and faster than other employees that they have had, but my current employer has no interest in letting me finish a job to completion. He instead tells me to stop what I am doing, destroying my plan for completing my task and forcing me to rely on his information to complete it. In turn that frustrates him. I have had this issue a couple times in the past with employers as well. I have been in managerial and supervisory roles and have training to be in these roles, and because of this I know I sometimes subconsciously push back against unskilled managers and supervisors when they start doing their job badly, but in this role I was really trying to consciously overcome that. 


With these examples and the other information I have provided does anybody have any advice on how I can perform at work without needing to be micromanaged? Am I just incompatible with such employers? Am I too confident and full of myself that I think I know what I'm doing, or not confident enough so that employers immediately consider me incompetent?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My employer is fed up with micromanaging me. Am I just stupid, and if so how can I prevent these issues at another job? (I'm pretty sure I've lost this one). ",16Oct2017,1
163,"About two weeks ago I (23f) moved back in to my childhood home with my dad and younger sister. I had been planning on relocating to Seattle (four hours away) and move in with my older sister (31). I have sold my car and did not renew my lease with this in mind, but medical issues that I wanted addressed before leaving prompted me to postpone the move.



I've been having abdominal pain for months but assumed it was not a serious issue. I've seen several doctors over the past few weeks that confirmed that I have cervical cancer that's caused ovarian cysts and endometriosis, (which is essentially the soft tissue of my female organs spider webbing together) and I have scheduled a major surgery for this upcoming Tuesday in another city an hour and a half away.



The timing of this is horrendous. This has been a stressful time in my life and I felt as if it would be overwhelming to relocate to an unknown city before taking care of the surgery so I asked my dad to stay with him until after its completed. I'm extraordinarily grateful for him letting me stay here but my relationship with my family has always been unstable and I feel very powerless and defeated about my circumstances and having no other practical options at this time.



My dad has a blow-and-go, ignition airlock device installed in his car and works often and is unable to give me rides when needed. Since I sold my vehicle, have no actual friends in this city and public transport here is limited, I need to rely on my sister for rides to the grocery store or doctors appointments. 



The dynamic in this household has always been focused around control and power. My sister, who lives at home is now 20 and attending community college has always been the baby of the family and golden child. 



While in high school I did the ""running start"" program where you attend college half the day in the morning and have a couple classes in the afternoon at the high school as well. There was no feasible way to attend without a car and so my dad helped me purchase a vehicle, with the stipulation was that I would do the grocery shopping for him and help my sister when needed. 



I was told to pick her up from school daily and drive her to and from extracurricular activities several times a week as well as be a taxi for her and her friends. The school was less than a mile away from the house and she was very capable of walking but I was appreciative of having transport and would agree to the stipulations since it was detrimental to my education. Sometimes I would have conflicting plans and tell her I wasn't able to drive her and she would always say ""it's not your car, you're an entitled brat, I'm calling dad"" who would in turn call me and say that the car was in his name and that I HAD to stop what I was doing and retrieve her from school or various other destinations or lose my driving privileges.



This entire time she was very belittling to me, constantly reminding me that I have no friends, am worthless, a loser and often would go as far as calling me a cunt or saying that I was ""not even a human"", with little provocation. She has a deep seeded hatred for me that I genuinely cannot wrap my head around. It took a toll on my self esteem to be put in a position of subservience to someone so toxic. 



My dad always told me that she had anger issues and that it was my fault for setting her off and to just give her rides without argument, regardless of the situation. Sometimes the things my sister said were so hurtful and demeaning that I had trouble listening to them and became upset, but rarely stooping to name calling or personal attacks. 



I am supposed to be the mature one, and was constantly reminded that I needed to bite my tongue and be compliant. I often would get upset and cry during discussions with my dad, which my sister was always present for, making continuous commentary on how lazy or unstable I was. I would always get sad or upset rather than angry. In those years I was labeled by my family as someone with a ""victim complex"" who was unable to take responsibility for my actions. 



I left as soon as I was 18. Several years have passed with me finishing up school and getting a job in caregiving and having my own apartment in the mean time. I'd see my family only on holidays although we've always lived in the same area. Tensions went down and things were fairly pleasant. I swore to myself that I would never move back home and try to give myself space away from people that I felt were toxic when given leverage over me.



I feel pathetic to be in this position now, however temporary, and have been having very negative thoughts about my life. I assumed things would be different since my sister is much older now and I've learned to control my emotions better, but the dynamic is very much the same. Although she has been sympathetic in some ways, since she also had ovarian cysts, and she does seem to have better control of her anger, she still often talks to me like I'm a sub-human and my dad still says that the same line of: I am older and need to be mature. This is all difficult for me to process but I need the help and feel like I don't have anywhere else to go.



I am seen as a crybaby and am constantly reminded that I'm a guest in this home and am threatened to be kicked out often over mundane things. Although I'm grateful to be here I feel like I'm not allowed to be upset at fundamentally upsetting statements. 



Today things came to a climax. There are three very untrained dogs at this house who are not taken care of properly. The largest dog pooped in the living room and I was being scolded for it although I stayed in my room all day and was unaware of the situation. I expressed my frustrations at being blamed and said that the dogs were out of control. My sister took this personally and started a very vicious rant about my worthlessness and said such things as ""you're a stupid bitch who no one loves"" and ""we don't want you here"".



I tried to go to my old room or outside multiple times but was told by my dad that I needed to continue the conversation or leave for good. I don't have anywhere else to go and had to just stay and listen to my dad berate me for insulting the animals, since I know how much they mean to my sister, all the while listening to her make jabs at my character and position in life. I got upset and tried defending myself and finally she said ""I hope the cancer kills you"". I flung into a panic attack and was hyperventilating and unable to control my shaking or heartbeat. As soon as I started panicking my dad said that ""this show wasn't going to work on him"" and was called disgusting by my sister multiple times. I had to beg him not to call an ambulance, I hate hospitals enough already and was very against the idea.



My dad called my older sister, who I was going to move in with in Seattle and said I was mentally unstable and to ignore my calls and not speak to me until I've had a mental health evaluation. I'm going to try to call her tomorrow but my sister respects my dad immensely and is likely to ignore me. Knowing this was my only option, my dad has said that I'm now ""allowed to stay"" until I've started proper therapy and medication. 



My sister is no longer is willing to give me a ride to my surgery. My dad says that it's her right to deny me a favor. The car was purchased for her but he paid for it and it is in his name. It boggles my mind how they could be so hypocritical. I'll admit that I could have been more careful or should have saw this coming but I was genuinely optimistic.



I have very little money saved (under $1000) and now might not have any prospects for housing in the future. I don't think I'll even be able to make it to my surgery, which is the whole reason I'm here in the first place. My dad appears to understand that I'm going through a lot but continuously exacerbates my anxiety. I'm worried about dying (not likely but possible) and am in pain often, the physical and mental stress has been exhausting. I don't know how to keep the peace when every thing feels so upside down and illogical and feel like my pride has been demolished.




I need to leave this house and I regret ever coming here but I have very limited options. I don't know what to do.



TLDR: moved back home temporarily for cancer treatment with hostile family. Conflict led to my future housing options being cut short and I may not be able to attend surgery. Feel overwhelmed and unsure how to move forward.",16Oct2017,4
165,"I'm only burning this because on my main account I'm lying about having a job in tech, mostly just to prove to myself that I still know enough to work in tech.

TLDR: The place is basically lying. They are trying to get me to go through a 'talent scout' who doesn't like me, and actively says so.

I recently went to a programming boot camp. They 'gaurentee' job placement. While the place isn't a ponzi scheme by technicality they are doing a really poor job at holding their end of the bargain up. While every time boot camps are talked about (online that I've seen) someone will talk about them like the graduates think they know everything and blah blah blah. Well thats not the case. Most of the graduates from the bootcamp I came out of had years of experience in programming. I myself had college classes in programming. One guy had a CS degree, and the best programmer I've ever met IRL went through the place (He had been programming for like 10 years, not having worked in the field before.)

They are supposed to help me with job placement. Their version of help was meet and greets with various startups, and companies that hire programmers. So far they have had one meet and greet, and there was a single employer there. 

They are trying to send me through a talent scout, however I've had dealings with the scout in the past. To be honest shes the worst talent company for tech I've ever worked with (I've had experience as helpdesk support, and as a network administrator.) She routinely changes the goal post on what I need, sends me to interviews with companies ***way*** over my level, and accused me of cheating on several tests. She has actively gone to companies locally and slandered me because I declined one place to work at telling them that I wasn't anywhere near qualified to work for them. 


Just a few examples: 

""Don't lie for yourself, let us lie for you."" It should be her motto. A job posting was for the US Military, and the only reason she sent me there is because *shocker* I'm ex military. I got on the phone with the guy for about 10-15 minutes we talked about the job, and a few minutes in I said ""Yeah I'm not anywhere near qualified for this."" It might sound like I'm hurting myself but IRL I'm not. It would have hurt my chances of getting a job as a civilian contractor in future to agree. Which was my goal at the time. At which point the guy thanked me for my honesty, and according to her they lost the military contract with them because of me. 
 
When she discovered I just tell the truth... She has gone to the boot camp and started talking bad about me. This caused the person running the place to call me and ask me ""why would she do that if it wasn't true."" When I explained the guy took her side. Turns out his wife and her are friends, because they are 'connected.' When she started to slander me. She gave me a list of requirements, all of which I have evidence of, and then when I send her an updated resume, she changes the requirements. This has happened more than 10+ times, and once happened 5 times in a day. When I sent her the first several emails as an attachment asking if she was serious she said ""I can drop who ever I want. Bare that in mind."" I replied with ""Well I don't need you. Maybe you should keep that in mind.""

She constantly talks about how 'straight white men' don't deserve to be in tech. And apparently is taking that feminist anger out on me. Despite not being white. When I pointed this out to her friends at the boot camp she posted something to her linkedin about feminism and race and something about how shes really only proud to place non white, non male, and non straight peoples.(Yeah because I picked being 75% Spanish and 25% native American. That's the hill I'm going to die on. Shes not a racist, its me who doesn't care about someones race. Right.)

Shes constantly getting triggered at things I'm saying, mostly by the way I answer her questions: ""I would rather get a job that has no over time and pays 40k a year, than one that pays 50k and I work 20 hours over time each week because per hour I'm making less."" This pissed her the fuck off, because she is paid per contract she sells and I suppose it bothers her that I'm willing to take a bit less pay to have significantly more time to myself. I cited actual statistics and that made her even angrier.

Personally I don't get it. I'm blunt. I call it like I see it. And to her I should just be a way to make money. But this brings me to my last and ***FAVORITE*** point:

I can just undermine her 100%. No shit. Every job she posts I can just directly apply to. Which ***I DO.*** I've applied to most of her job postings directly and gotten responses back. She has openly complained to the boot camp I attended about this. I don't have evidence of this claim but ...well I can tell...

The boot camp insists that I go through her to help me find a job, but is useless otherwise. Currently I have other scouts who are helping me, and I don't see the reason to go through her. She clearly doesn't like me. The boot camp has been worthless in terms of actively finding a job, and all their job finding advice is for startups, *which isn't something I want to do, and made that clear before joining, which they said wouldn't be a problem. Now they are saying it will be.*

So far one of the bootcampers have actually gotten a job that didn't have a degree or a shit load of experience in programming from before their job experience. 

The CEO of the program has openly insulted me several times in person when hes relatively certain no one else is around. His wife is friends with the scout. At which point I just asked him if he was being serious because if so that makes him a massive piece of shit.

My girlfriend has watched me struggle for the last two years to find work in technology. Despite openings that I qualify for, and even expanding myself into programming I'm having no luck. My GF makes 70k a year and has told me that if I don't get something before the end of this year that she will pay my way through school in blood bank which pays about 35k a year. (we will be married by/shortly after next February. We would already be married if I could get a fucking job to buy her a ring.) My girlfriend thinks I should declare bankruptcy if they don't place me in a job to fuck the place over.

I’ve tried telling them to stop, I’ve let them know that it upsets me, but they just see it as banter. These are people I work with and people that I generally get on well with, so there’s no escaping. 

Any advice would be great. ",16Oct2017,7
169,"(If this story is better suited for another sub, feel free to let me know!) (Also, apologies for the wall of text, TLDR below) 

I am currently a student at a large state college in the U.S. Recently, an acquaintance from my small high school transferred here. Initially I (a female), showed him around, took him out to eat, etc. Just the friendly initial invitations to get him acclimated and have a familiar face around. 

But it's been nearly two months and things have escalated. He texts me 10 times every day. I used to respond, and make conversation, but it's extremely draining. His texts are usually offensive, and tactics to push my buttons. (Racist remarks, insults directed towards my friends, facts about my family that he found out somehow). So after my therapist told me to cut him off, I stopped responding. But that almost made it worse. 

The number of texts increased. He'd do this thing where he'd go down the list of emojis, sending one in a message over and over again, trying to get me to respond. He'd try to face time me continuously, while in class or in meetings he knew I had. He texts me saying he has a really funny story about a mutual friend, or something that's unbelievable that I just /have/ to hear. 

Last night is what prompted me to seek advice. He texted me saying ""I'm actually really upset"" ""I really need to talk to you"" ""I need you're help"" Knowing he just transferred, and has some past mental issues - I got worried, and responded. Told him to call me. After the call dropped a few times and we didn't get a hold of each other for a few minutes, he texts me ""Ok I have to admit I’m not upset I just want to talk lol"" ""Lol can u just call me I’m bored"" 

I was pissed. That day, a family friend had a family member commit suicide. So a text like he sent initially really set me off, emotionally. That sort of manipulation shocked me into a realization. That this all might be harassment or something more serious than an annoying guy from my high school. 

I blocked his number last night, **but is there anything else I should do? Where do I go from here? I'm worried that ignoring him will only intensify his need to get involved with me further.**

TLDR; Acquaintance from high school who now attends the same university as me is texting me constantly, and manipulating me into believing lies in order to text / call him back. Scared that cutting him off will escalate the situation.  ",16Oct2017,3
171,"So today I finally decided to unlike all the movies, music groups etc. on Facebook, well, I got stuck with one last movie which I can't unlike and therefore remove from the movies on my profile no matter what I do. I go to fb.com/xxx/video_movies_favorite and there is this film which I can't remove... I clicked that X to remove it, but it won't go away, even if I go to the fb page of that movie, it says I am NOT liking that page (on the movie page there is a option to like it, like if you went to some new page you haven't liked yet) but the movie is stuck on my profile.

After he handed back my assignment he had left this comment on it:
“while I have nothing against drawing MANGA, I do think it's important to develop YOUR STYLE. The LINE concept works, but I didn't quite get VARIETY, it more reads as CONTRAST. Spending more time on quality, detail and execution can help. You draw well - let's see YOU in your work” 
manga is my art style. As for the variety, it was the one he had recommended. I am doing my work. Im not drawing manga characters that already exist, im comming up with my own.

I'm a 20 year old female, live in nyc and work at a restaurant as a hostess. Long story short, there's only one area to charge our phone's in the restaurant I work in (back in the kitchen) and my hostess stand is in the front of the restaurant  (so obviously I can't see my phone charging from where I am stationed to work all night), but I've never thought twice about this until one of my coworkers pulled me aside yesterday and told me 2 of the servers have been going into my phone and sending themselves the private pictures I have in my phone (photos of me in my bra/panties/fitting rooms, etc - but nothing completely nude). I never had a pass-code in my phone so they're technically not hacking my phone, but I know this has to be illegal in some sort of way? I'm afraid and confused as to what I should do, I don't want to tell and get them fired and have them retaliate and hurt me or something, but I'm also very disturbed that they've been acting like my friends while doing this behind my back and am not okay if they have photos of me on their phone, that were only meant for me to see.

178,"Tbh I don’t know where to begin, I guess I’m here for relationship advice. So I’m 17 and live in ATL and currently in a long distant relationship with a girl who is 15 and lives in Utah. Me and her kinda have a long history and have been off and on for about 7 months but have been official again for 3+ weeks. Only reason we’ve been off and on is cus we’ve both done a few fucked up things, i.e. her saying things were getting dry so I ran to another girl instead of fixing things and her sending a revealing photo(not nudes) to a guy she new I didn’t like bc of me doing that, her not being able to open up(previously, she does now). Me and her are in love and you can say all you want about our age and the distant but that’s not the point right now....since we’ve been together things have been good but I suffer from depression and anxiety and stress and I over think everything...like I think she’ll drop me and go fuck with some one else even tho Ik deep down she loves me, she didn’t tell 2 guys she was talking to as friends that me and her were together. 
That’s the back story but why I’m here is I low key brought up how hard it’s gonna be for me and her to transition into a irl relationship which scares the hell out of me and she admitted she felt the same but she kinda brushed it off and said it wasn’t something to worry about obviously it is considering the age different. Like I’m gonna try my best to make it to Utah in December to see her but then after that I’ll have to comeback to ATL. And the way she put it off worried me as if the passed 7 months didn’t mean as much as I thought it would to her, like she just cared about the 3 weeks and thought talking about our future together was almost irrelevant even tho she says our future together means the a lot to her. I’ve thought maybe I could go to college up there but I wouldn’t be able to do that until after my first year of staying local. Until then I’m also gonna try to go up there on every holiday I have, but do you honestly thing it’s gonna be easy for us to stay together when she’ll be around hella guys at hs and I’ll be at college, that’s hard even if it isn’t long distance. I feel like I’m rambling but idk what to do. I love her I really do, ik y’all might say “but y’all never even met” but when you talk to some all day everyday for 7 months your gonna feel some type of way. I’m conflicted on if I should end things and save us both the heartbreak from when it likely doesn’t work out down the road or just stick it out and hope for the best. Also, Ik if I end things now I’m gonna be an emotional mess, I’ll be listening to SB2H, 808s, 17, and even take care on repeat, I mean I’m in love, and Ik she’ll be a wreck too. And also since then wasn’t the right time to talk about our future then when is? 
TL:DR Me and my long distance girlfriend are in love but both scared shitless about how hard it’s gonna be to make things work, she brushed off the subject when I brought it up, I’m conflicted on if I should end things to save us both a bigger heartbreak down the road. ",16Oct2017,1
179,"Hello fellow internet user,

I recently got some time on my hands (healing after knee surgery) and got seriously sucked into the ""dark side"" of the internet. Especially certain subreddits, blogs and extreme websites. I started to read more comments below YouTube Videos, online articles and 9gag posts, as well.

What I found was often disturbing. I could not believe what some people seem to believe. I googled stuff (abbreviations, ominous studies, etc.) that I've never heard of before which made me get sucked in even more! I could not stop... the last two and a half weeks I spent HOURS doing that stuff without even realising how much time I wasted. And it really feels bad... it often makes me angry, shocked, even desperate.

Now, I am not completely ""new"" to the internet. I am 31, from a (non-english-speaking) european country, working at a university, playing video games online (mostly with RL friends, though), etc... But I never really used reddit, Quora and the like for more then some coding advice.

Why I am posting here is 1: can't really stop... I uninstalled Apps, unsubscribed, blocked etc. but I somehow always end up looking again for stuff which I KNOW will upset me.
Anybody got any ideas how to stop without throwing away my phone?

And, much worse, 2: can't stop thinking about the stuff I read...
I always thought of myself as a tolerant person. But now I sometimes catch myself thinking that a huge part of human population should be locked away to protect themselves and others. 
I tried to convince myself there are trolls out there, a lot of what's posted probably is fake, ignore the extreme opinions and so on... (That's what my SO advised me to do.)

But I know it's statistically unlikely that not a lot of those people mean exactly what they write about.
In my head I question colleagues etc.. ""Could they be some of those people?""
And I feel more hopeless than ever before about the human race.
It's not about ""growing up"" or being naive and/or overly idealistic, either. The internet is not a proper depiction of people in general. I need advice on how to stop obsessing over how many people really are that hateful (for example).",16Oct2017,4
180,"Hello Reddit Family,
I am looking for a little advice on how I should handle a situation that happened to me. I was at a bar on a Friday night about a month ago, a relatively higher end post graduate bar in South Florida.  I keep my IPhone either in my front or back pocket and it has a wallet case on it which contains my ID and Credit Card.  It was pick pocketed out of my pants pocket.  I know this because I showed my ID that was in the phone case to get in the bar and was there for about 30 minutes and did not pull my phone out once after.  Immediately I tried to trace the phone using find my iPhone and it was offline and never to be pinged again.  3 weeks go by, I receive a text from a random number saying ""your lost IPhone Rose Gold 6s 16gb has been found at 15:27. Sign in to your Device to locate your device""  Now obviously this is a scam, an attempt to get the icloud credentials so they can re use or access my phone.  I have received this text from two separate California numbers, they must be somehow related to the person who stole the phone and was somehow able to extract the phone number of the phone which is frightening.  I want to ask Reddit, what is the best way to proceed from here?  I doubt the police will be able to do anything, if agree'd and there is nothing I can do except report them to Apple for phishing how can I get revenge with only having their phone lines/URL to their phishing scams.

181,"I became friends with this guy in 8th grade-- he was my age but held back a year. He started out super nice and chill. At the end of my 10th grade year he mentioned that he'd been accused of sexually harassing a friend's girlfriend, but he didn't do it. The situation seemed complicated by jealousy so I believed his story. He would always play pranks on me that would start off funny then started to fuck with my head.  I went to prom with him and he tried to corner me in a hidden location of the ballroom and confess his love-- then told a guy I was interested in that he was my boyfriend. A few weeks later he brought up a situation where I believe a close family friend was accusing him of coercing a girl into sex (if not rape then close to it.) Every time I tried to confront him about these behaviors he was incredible at manipulating his way out of it. Last summer a mutual friend accused him of encouraging her to cheat on her boyfriend with him, and again sexually abusing her. This is all I can think of except for a bizarre scenario where we hung out and he pretended like he thought I was someone else, and it was just so fucking disrespectful for someone who was supposedly a good friend-- he called me by the wrong name, etc. 

Even after this, he still doesn't seem creepy-- even when his behavior would be creepy by anyone's standards. Despite being an average looking dude he always has a girlfriend which I think is evidence enough of his strange charm. He might be a narcissist I don't know. 

His dad is rich and famous. I want to cut ties with him but we still have a lot of mutual acquaintances. Most of them think he's a good guy, I just don't see how all these separate girls could be lying. I'm away at college now but when I go home I feel like I'll see him around in my neighborhood and I don't know what I should do about this.

185,"Okay, this is really tearing me apart. 

I grew up very Jewish (not orthodox): shabbat, synagogue, hebrew school, the whole shebang. I am not religious and do not participate in Jewish activities in my town. Ever since I was little, Birthright has been shoved down my throat. I finally went last year. I've never supported Israel as a state or Zionism, but I have been told since I was little that I would be a total idiot for not taking this opportunity to travel. I figured I'd go, not look into it too much (my mistake), and continue participating in leftist spaces in my town.

Now, I wish I could take this whole experience back. 

I have friends who have found out I went on Birthright and they are ignoring me, telling my other friends not to talk to me, and even have an ex-roommate who moved back to town (we used to be rather close) not even tell me she lives back here. I know I must sound very pathetic and self-victimizing. Perhaps I am. I believe that is what tortures me the most.

I am likening myself to a man who believes in men's rights just because women want equal pay. I am a female, for the record, but as a Jew, I feel I should not advocate for myself in leftist spaces. It does not seem fair. And I don't, I don't advocate for Israel or any of the Zionist rhetoric. 

However, attending Birthright it seems I have involuntarily aligned myself with Zionism. This is really, really messing with my moral compass. I am wondering if anyone else, jewish people primarily, have experienced something like this. Is there a way to not take it back but, well, to somehow decry the system? If I recognize that it was a mistake, that I have contributed to a violent participatory experience, what good will it do?

187,"Hello, I'm 20 years old. Last summer I graduated what's called gymnasium in Sweden. As I understand it it's the equivalent of the american high school. It's pretty common to work a year or two before applying for a university so last year I worked and I will work this year again. I worked customer service on a call center from november to june. I quit then because I wanted to travel during the summer and I hated that job anyway. I still haven't applied for any job yet, I'm really procrastinating and lazy. I just hated it last year and it's very nice of my parents to let me live at home without pushing me to find any new work. I will apply soon it's just that I'm trying to find the energy for myself to start working again. I feel priviliged that I have the opportunity to do it anyway because in the future of course I won't have it as easy. Right now however I just sit on my ass doing nothing but using my computer and stressing myself out about the future.

My current situation isn't as problematic as I feel my future is. I really don't know what I want to study. I really love movies and would love to work in film. It's the only thing I've been able to come up with that I want to do, I've felt that way for 5 years. But getting into movies is really hard so I've been thinking about maybe committing to advertisements instead, and then it's possible to gradually move over to movies in time. Cinematography and editing is intriguing for me.

I've decided that I need to start studying next year because if I have to work with a shitty job much more I will just get really depressed. I've been conflicted before because I'm afraid of making a mistake, if I change my mind a year in I will have a bigger student debt than I should have. But I can't keep going at this so deadline is march. That's when you have to apply for a university in Sweden.

I really want to experience the student life. I just find it difficult to take that step because honestly I don't think I'm equipped to handle the hard business of movies, even if I really want to work with it. (After working 7 months in customer service I've realized how important it is that I find a job that I actually enjoy to some degree.)

The older one is 25 and is depressed for a long time and for about 4-5 years he accuses me and my husband for ruining his childhood by forcing him to go to sports and competitions and by having too high standards for him. 

Now, a few weeks ago, he came up with this new theory that the only reason my husband forced him to do football and go to competitions is becauase I did not have sex with him because my husband was not hot and this somehow provoked repressed frustration in my husband which caused him to terrorize the son to make my husband feel more masculine.

He says I emasculated him by refusing sex. I think my husband mentioned to him the lack of sex between us when he was drunk once. I am in shock. I have absolutely nothing to say to anyone now because of the shock that I have been living in for the past weeks. Did anybody have a similar situation. I really do not know what to do or say now. 

EDIT: Some people here said that maybe my son has cognitive development issues. This is however NOT THE CASE. In fact he is extremely intelligent. He finished the university that is considered the most difficult and the best in our country and he was a valedictorian.

I can't help to take everything personal and my thoughts become so intrusive and make it nearly impossible for me to do anything.

I really tried. I wanna work full time but working at fast food makes it impossible. When it comes to dealing with people, running everywhere, and being responsible for three jopbs at a time because my job is extremely understaffed and the work load is becoming to much.

204,"Hi guys. As a kid I was involved in a car accident and I lost my vision on my right eye. Thankfully I've got no trauma related to the incident whatsoever, my eye got like 'cloudy' and small compared to the functioning one, my eyebrow 'hangs' a little, too. So yeah, my face is not symmetrical, and it's very noticeable ofc. 

I'm most occasions I'm a really secure person.. but my lack of confidence when meeting new people (specially girls) is still pretty obvious and I hate it. Hell, even if I'm taking to an old female friend of mine, if I realize she's standing on my right side (bad eye's side) I get nervous and may even start acting weird because she would see and think of me as the weird eye looking guy.

If I'm wearing sunglasses I feel and act differently. I consider myself self-confident as I already said, but I actually feel more confident.. As I realized this is when I thought of trying to do something to cover my ugly eye.

One solution might be a prosthetic eye. I tried once as I was like 13 years old but my eye didn't tolerate it. The eye should have been removed completely so I could use the prosthetic eye without my body rejecting it, which my parents and I didn't agree with.

I just resigned myself, went on, but now I started college recently and there's this girl I like, but I just can't convince myself to ask her out. I'm sure she (or any other girl) would reject me just because of my appearance.

Anyways, I actually wanted to try this with the eyepatch before starting college, so all the new people I'd meet would just know me an associate me with it. I asked then a couple of friends what would they think if I started wearing one, which they answered by saying that they don't think I need one to date a girl or smth, and actually encouraged me not to buy one, because I wouldn't need it...

Clearly I didn't, and now it would be late because all my professors, new classmates (and this girl) would notice it of course.

I also wear glasses, forgot to say, that's another reason I didn't buy the patch then, it would look weird wearing an eyepatch and glasses above it. 

I'm just afraid what people I already know would think of me when they see me wearing that new thing on my face.

Well, that's it, should I wear one if that's what would make me happier and more self confident? Do you think it would be weird looking if I wear both the patch and my normal glasses? Sorry for the long post, my english and thanks in advance ;)

**TL;DR:** lost my eye as a kid after an accident, my face looks kinda asymmetrical because my eye remained small. Not sure whether to use an eyepatch because I think I'd get more confident, but I'm afraid of what people I already know may think after seeing me with this new thing on my face.

205,"I'm 26 and I feel like I have, or at least am very near, rock bottom - at least in my perspective anyway. 
A year or so ago, I was interested in doing a lot of things in my spare time - I set up a subreddit and tried to get a community around it, I was staying healthy by running, I had an interest in making my own audio electronics and experimenting with my guitar setup, making music here and there, etc. 
But just today my girlfriend made me realise something. I had rather unflatteringly got some loose food out of my mouth and spit it in some finished ramen broth in front of her, which understandably made her shocked and in awe that I'd do something in front of her, and said to me after dinner ""It feels like you're just getting more and more uncivilized.""  

What I thought next was that it I wasn't doing it on purpose, but I didn't exactly shy away from being unmannered as well. It just felt that I had just given up on everything. Of course, I didn't say anything about it at the time but when I got home I had time to reflect. I used to play the guitar a lot, I used to tinker with circuits, I used to do stuff with my arduino, I used to run a lot, but since I've moved back to my grandma's place it just feels like every day I come home I just want to collapse on the bed and go on reddit, play some games and get some sleep. Once or twice I'll go on youtube and look at some DIY projects that I get inspired by, but the moment the video finishes, I flare my nostrils and go ""what's the point"". 

To clarify, it's not moving to my grandma's place that shut me off. I finished [this project](https://imgur.com/a/3AGVJ) (which I started when I was living elsewhere) shortly after moving back into my grandma's place, but I've built half a circuit on it since I've finished it. I want to pick up running again, but lately it always seems like there's something in the way - last week I had to go to Shanghai for a week, the week before that it was mid-autumn festival, etc etc. 

For some reason, every time I come home from work I want to pick up on stuff that I've been working on but everything just feels so futile. I'm just stuck in a rut with my feelings on what I should be doing with my time, and the result is I just throw my arms in the air, fall on my bed and call it a day. 

So reddit, what should I do? 

edit: I feel like I forgot to emphasise the fact that when I get home, I've lost the motivation to do *anything*. Tidy my room, clean out rubbish, take unneeded scraps of paper out of my bag, clear my table, wash and fold clothes, change guitar strings, change bedsheets, anything that I usually do I find myself just on the bed staring at a screen, only getting up to go to the toilet or have dinner. So I need some way to break this loop but I just can't seem to pick myself up at the moment. ",16Oct2017,3

Well we've been expanding on a new department of printing and my boss has basically assigned me a sales position. At first I thought it would just be informing clients of our new technology and I was looking forward to doing something different and was optimistic, but the more involved I am, the more anxiety I am developing about the sales process and trying to convince people to buy our products. I hate the formality; I took this job because it's so laid back. I don't want to go to stuffy meetings and have to schmooze + play nice with a bunch of people that I don't give 2 shits about. In addition, he is wanting me to do lunches and after work meetings with clients which I am NOT interested in--I want to go to work and go home. 


He keeps telling me I'll be a star salesperson and that I have a perfect personality for it, but I simply don't want to be that position. What can I say to let him down easy?? How do I go about it?

For example i originally had today and tomorrow off, but yesterday the schedule was updated to give me a shift today, and today the schedule was updated to give me a shift tomorrow.

I feel like this completely defeats the purpose of a schedule and plans are falling through because of it. And to be honest, I'd be fine with working every day as long as i knew the schedule in advance.

211,"Hi all, 

Backstory: I started my first job since moving to the U.S about 3 months ago now. The job is in a warehouse and is highly physical, mind-numbing, but pays okay and I appreciated the opportunity to make a wage after waiting so long to find something. 

During my time at my job I've met some nice people, but have also met some people that have made comments about somebody 'kidnapping me', saying that women from my country 'are the best women' and just making inappropriate comments in general. I didn't think it affected me so much until now. 

The last few days or so I have had a giant mental block against going into work. I just couldn't do it, and even though I know of the potential consequences, i.e if you don't work you don't get paid, if you don't go in you'll be fired, etc. and that didn't bother me, even when we could pick up voluntary time off which means you can take time off and you won't get fired for it. 

It has been 3 days total since I haven't been at work and a friend of mine said, ""Hey did you check the online system to make sure you registered your time off?"" I said yes, but got paranoid and double checked. I couldn't initally access my account and for a moment I felt relief. 

Relief at the thought of being fired. ""I have enough in my account to tide me over for the next month, and I can work at my local restaurant"" I thought. I had been complaining for a while about how much I dreaded going to work, this could be my opportunity for a new start! My wife works and earns a lot more than me  and while it wouldn't be ideal, we wouldn't go bankrupt or be homeless.

As I was going through these thoughts in my head, I found that I had also received an e-mail from a place I had applied to work at in my field of study and thought that this is a great sign. It wasn't a job offer, but more of a pre-screening thing. 

Then I found that I could log in to my account meaning I hadn't been deactivated and probably wasn't fired. 

My stomach dropped and I immediately started crying. I feel awful, but part of me truly just *does not* care anymore and doesn't want to go in if my life isn't depending on it you know? I have enough to pay for a month of expenses and I have a potential job opportunity coming up so I just can't muster the fucks to give. 

My question/call for advice is: What should I do? should I just quit at this point? start a new in a different job? I feel like a piece of garbage for letting it get this far, but I just don't care anymore :( 

Thanks all. ",16Oct2017,2
212,"I need some advice on how to handle a job opportunity and leaving my current job. Right now I'm working for a great company but in a position that I am overqualified for. I went into this job to get my foot in the door with this company. My managers knew this before I started. I started at this job as a temp in November of last year and became permanent in March. 
When I interviewed they said I have to stay in this department for a year (from my permanent date) before I could go anywhere else in the company.

A great job opportunity came up within the company, I applied, and I now have a second interview scheduled. It's in my field and it's something I have wanted to get into for a long time but there are never opportunities in my city.  

If I get offered this position I want to take it obviously but because they told me I need to stay in my department for a year I am not sure how to handle it. My managers and other people I work with have all stated I am overqualified and know I want to work for this other department as I was upfront when I started. I have been very successful at my current job and never acted like I was above it. 

Recently a man in my department was only a couple months in and he transferred to another department within the company. Rumor has it that he wasn't good at the job so he was able to go somewhere else. Not sure how true that is but I do not think it is fair to reward a bad employee and have him transferred elsewhere.

I wanted to know if I get offered the position,  what should I tell my higher-ups? Do I bring up that they have done so this already with another employee? They are great bosses and I do not want to leave a bad taste in their mouths.",16Oct2017,2
213,"My husband has always came home from work and talked non stop about it with a smile on his face. We have 2 children together who are very young and I am a stay at home mother for a handful of reasons 1. Dad can not handle watching the children by himself on a normal basis 2. Childcare is too expensive. For the past 2 months my husband hasn't gone to work and has basically mentally snapped. He has always suffered from anxiety, we often can't do many things because he will have panic attacks, his anxiety is so bad right now he can't make it out of bed. This is not my husband. The anxiety has taken over. It has taken 9 weeks to get a doctors appt (2 weeks away still) we have used every possible mental health resource and have come up short for any help. 

Today he told me he is quitting. He makes $27 an hour plus benefits. Gets paid extremely well for overtime, we get to travel once in a while (Hawaii, Japan), he has incredible coworkers, I could go on. 
I know loving what you do is so important, especially for someone who has mental health issues..  but I'm terrified. What on earth are we going to do.
We already live paycheck to paycheck, there's no possible way he will get a job that pays this well right off the bat, it would take years to reach that ranking somewhere. 
I'm so afraid he will tell me he wants to be in the military because I have said from day 1 i personally can't date someone who is military, I am not strong enough to deal with being alone that much, especially with 2 young children.

215,"Throw away since my future wife(FW) knows my main reddit account and I don't want to add this situation to her stress, at least not yet.

I've been friends with my poly friend (PF) since high school. I asked him to be my best man, and he accepted, and up until recently, he's been on board with our plan to have a small private wedding, with just close friends and family. 

He currently lives in a large house with a number of other people, who are all in various polyamorous relationships with each other. Among those people is one of my FW's exes, from nearly 8 years ago (before she and I met). When PF asked to bring a date to the wedding, she was fine with it, so long as he didn't bring her ex (their split up was not amicable). He said that was fine, so we sent him an invitation for himself and a guest. 

Apparently, this started a fight amongst his various partners, over who got to go with him to the wedding, so he called me asking if he could just bring them all. I told him absolutely not: by this point we're 2 months out from the wedding (we're getting married Christmas eve), and because we were planning on a small, intimate wedding, we have signed contracts involving us spending more $$ per guest, like, 250$/guest ish. Which is fine, but frankly, his desire to bring 7 extra people to a wedding rather than just one is a bit of an imposition. It'll add 1500$ to our wedding budget just for his dates!

At this point, I reminded him that FW didn't want her ex at the wedding anyway, so he couldn't bring all of his partners regardless. He flipped out, saying that her ex is a ""different person now"" and she needs to ""let the past go"", but I told him it's non-negotiable, and he hung up on me.

I got an email this morning telling me that I need to ""fix my attitude"" and stop being so ""anti-poly relationships"". I don't care that he's in a poly relationship. That's his choice, great. But that doesn't mean that I can afford to invite all of his partners to my wedding, OR that I should subject FW to her ex that put her in the hospital 8 years ago.

I'm about at the point of disinviting him from the wedding, because I feel like he's being selfish. But I want advice on how to talk to him, and maybe talk him down from the rafters, or, conversely, an explanation of how I'm wrong, because I admittedly can't see it.

**TLDR:** My Poly friend wants to bring his whole cadre to the wedding, we can't afford it, and one of his partners is my FW's abusive Ex.

216,"So I broke up with my ex a little while ago. He was upset and had a hard time with it, and I tried to stay in his life as a friend type because I felt bad. But once I started dating again, he became set on bombarding me with texts, calls and messages on various social media platforms. It was frustrating and annoying as he often called me drunk. But it died down eventually.

Now, I have started a serious relationship with someone new and he has somehow found out. He is now back to doing it again. I have him blocked on FB, so that has helped a bit. But he now texts me again quite a bit, trying to guilt trip me and making mild threats about stupid things. He also uses one of those texting apps in order to pretend to be another person and talk to me. He has even resorted to making a new Reddit profile every so often and messaging me on here. He is very predictable, so it is not difficult to tell when it is him.

221,"Growing up I had a best friend who eventually became friends with my sister also. Through high school we were a sort of three musketeers, always together. Slowly my sister and I noticed a change in our friend. We drifted apart and got back together a few times, until the friend started stealing from us and OD'd twice in my house. 

So we cut contact. Was rough at first with Facebook drama, friend blocked us both, and that was the end of it. All three of us seem better off now. 

Randomly the friend unblocks me and messages about a mutal friend who was put in jail for murder. Crazy stuff, I see why she reached out to me about it. She let me know what happened, I thanked her, and I figured that would be the end of it. 

Randomly she'll message me, I've just stopped reading them hoping she'll get the hint, but so far she has not. There's no nice way to say ""Go away, I don't want to be friends again, you had multiple chances and you chose drugs.""

So my question for you guys is, should I just block her? Ignore them like I have been? Reply asking her to stop messaging me? After all that happened, there's absolutely no chance I'd ever want her back in my life again. ",16Oct2017,2
222,"I'm using a throwaway because I'm pretty sure my ex-manager knows my Reddit account name. My time working at the UPS Store has spanned 5 years and 3 different locations. I moved to a new town about a month ago, and started working at my 3rd UPS Store. Right off the bat, the manager was asking me to do some pretty shady things with customers. For example, there was one incident where a customer asked me for the absolute cheapest option we had to ship her letter. I gave her the cheapest option and she paid. My manager pulled me aside and told me that I handled the situation completely wrong. He instructed me that anytime a customer asks for the cheapest option I should tell them that the cheapest option is one of our more expensive services (next day air, 2 day air, etc.), hoping that they don't notice that there are actually much cheaper options. If they do notice, I should say something like ""Oh yea, sorry there are cheaper options, I didn't notice. My mistake."" 

Also, UPS ground is guaranteed maxium 5 days. If the city its shipping to is within a 5 hours drive, its usually guaranteed to arrive next business day. Despite this guarantee from UPS, my manger instructed me to inform customers that UPS ground is 5-7 days, no matter where you are sending it. This is wrong, and is done entirely to fool customers to thinking that ground service is much worse than it really is, and to entice them to purchase a more expensive service.

Despite all of this, I never once argued with my manger's policies. However, I think he could tell I was uncomfortable with them, and that eventually I may protest. Last week as I was clocking out, he pulled me out back and fired me. When I asked why, he said ""I wasn't meeting expectations."" I asked him three times to further clarify, and he couldn't give a specific reason as to why he was firing me.

I'm a little relieved to no longer be working there. Every customer I ripped off made me feel like a complete scumbag. I have a lot of experience working at The UPS Store, and I never experienced such blatant lying to customers. What can I do to prevent this business from ripping more people off? Should I write a letter to corporate? Write a yelp review? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",16Oct2017,1
223,"Posted this on r/legaladvice, thought I would post here for greater visibility, since I don't seem to be getting any bites over there. 

Had minor surgery last week, and it went a little differently than expected. I'm now out on short term disability. Still not clear on how long, or if/when I will find out. 

My situation is this:

1. I have a professional license which requires me to take ongoing educational courses every two years.


2. I currently need two more full-day courses to meet my requirement for this two year period (ends this year)


3. My employer requires me to take PTO (vacation/sick) days to attend these courses. As far as I can tell, no courses are offered on the weekends.

4. As far as I can tell/remember, my short term dis. runs concurrently with my PTO, meaning I will be down to zero available PTO when I am ready to return to work (probably next week or the week after) With zero PTO left, I will not be able to take any classes before my deadline, which means BIG fines (which I won't be able to afford, even if I wanted to) and/or having my license suspended. [note: there is a LOT I don't know about disability, and what I've been told may not be 100% accurate]

224,"My life, literally and metaphorically, is in shambles. I'm on a path to self destruction. Again. I had a single class today and decided to stay home because the 'huge' task of getting ready and then having to be in a room full of people who actually are working on getting educated was really daunting. So I'm sitting on the floor in a room I share with my sister and neice. You can't see the floor by the way, we don't have a rug, just gray smooth concrete and it's covered with trash, clothes, random containers, the occasional pee jug and wig hair, because my sister and niece don't throw shit away. My mattress is fucked up, we've only had it for three years and the springs cut us, but most of the time, someone pushes some shit ontop of it that shouldn't be on the bed and that's how it is now but I don't feel like sitting on a mountain of dirty clothes, and rat-bitten sheets. There is no where else for me to sleep, I live with 6 people and there are only two bedrooms. 


A brief back story: I dealt with self destruction in my early teens but now as a uni student, I swear I'm self sabotaging at an unparalleled level. This can't JUST be laziness. This isn't normal.
A lot of the stress has to do with this huge worry on my chest. I am on a full tuition scholarship that requires me to get honors every semester, and I'm worried I'm going to lose it by completely avoiding my school related responsibilities. I'm 19 and I've started my junior year of uni in august by the way. I'm not bad at school, sometimes I'm even exceptional. But I never get to complete work the way I want to because of my own chronic procrastination. Last year, when I got an A in statistics, I was relieved that I got to keep my scholarship for another semester, but worried that I only got it because my professor felt bad for me or something. Which is a little irrational, but I tend to generally make people concerned or angry, so it's not too much of a stretch. This past summer I was suicidal, so every day was just... really bad. I needed money to pay off a small debt from a previous semester, but I didn't get a job and I only sent my resume to three places (none of which called me back) and I was generally too distraught to do anything good. My dad (he's 75) didn't know how I was feeling, but in general he can be a jerk, so he frequently called me worthless and stupid which totally fueled countless crying sessions. I also always have shit to do around the house, because no one fucking cleans really, and there are flying roaches everywhere and I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm going to stop talking about my house's problems for now. I could go on forever. 
I also have another relative who I don't live with that reminds me that I'm shit almost everytime we talk, and she takes care of my grandma, so I rarely visit my grandma either because of it, and it's been packing guilt on me too. I want to move away from my family so bad, and I wanna pursue my studies, but I'm worried I'm not going to accomplish what I want to, and everyone's going to think terrible of me for it. 
Right now, I have two group assignments to complete, one I don't even understand because I hardly show up to class anymore. My home environment is nuts so I can't really concentrate here either. I don't have a laptop either so I have to do all typed assignments at school. I know I'm making things worse, and I can't stop. I am already in debt for the semester because it still isn't paid off and the bill is climbing at $100 a month, and I will have to get a job soon but I'm worried I'm not going to do anything. I don't have anyone around me to talk about this with either, so I don't know what to do! I'm young, I haven't completely screwed up and I know I can get a grip on things, but I'm overwhelmed. It's not a motivation thing either, I have every reason to work hard. It's just... hard.

Since my last post he has tried to make/ keep me happy. Things are still shakey though. He is still a douche and the fireworks died a long time ago. We stick together mostly out of loyalty and because we have nowhere else to go, aren't getting any younger and therefore have made ourselves too comfortable in our stagnating union.

A big part of why things are so difficult between us is that I have suppressed feelings for someone else for the last 2 years or so. Let's call the someone else Greg. 

before I continue: 

-I have never, ever, acted on my feelings for Greg, though he does know that I think he is hot. 
- Charlie and Greg know each other (through me)
- Greg is a couple years younger than me
- Greg has a girlfriend (I respect that, but MY GOD she is the most unpleasant woman I have ever met)

Greg and I met through a mutual friend with mutual interests. 
This sounds cliche, but since the first time I ever saw him I was struck by how beautiful he actually is. I swore to myself that I would look but never touch because I was already with Charlie at the time. I thought it was just a silly crush or a case of wandering eyes from which no harm could come, and for a long time that's how I functioned. Greg was eye candy and a good friend and nothing more. 

Only, just as Charlie is such a negative, unlikeable guy, Greg is just SO unbelievably good hearted. I have never met anyone else so kind, so giving, so caring, so nice. 
I can't elaborate, but there was a time when he moved mountains for me for no other reason than he felt like it. He expected nothing in return. He just wanted to. 
You have no idea of how much moving those mountains actually meant. 

Still, mountains moved or not, I simply thought I was blessed to have (and undeserving of) such an awesome friend and made nothing more of it. 

Then we lost touch for a while. When he returned to me after months of silence (more than enough time for my relationship to deteriorate into poop) we undertook a passion project together. We are still working on that and of course that means that I have to spend a lot of time around him. 
It's great. I sincerely enjoy his company. But things have changed because I have fallen for him. 

But here's the problem. I fell for him the day I met him. Fast and hard. I just lied to myself so I wouldn't feel guilty. 
When he vanished, it was easy to pretend that all he would ever be was a piece of delicious eye candy with a swell personality, but it was always more than that. I just buried it. 
Sorry for me, the mounds of dirt I buried those feelings beneath are eroding away. 

I am trying so desperately to bury them again. I don't want to be THAT girl. I don't want to be disloyal and it feels like I am. Like I am living a lie. Like I am doing Charlie wrong. Like I am an inconsiderate bitch. 
I resolved to do and say nothing. To go on as if nothing has changed. To sort my Charlie situation out first before I do stupid/ rash things. 
That worked out fine. 

Until last night. 

Greg needed a place to sleep, so Charlie and I offered him our sofa. 
Before we went to bed, Greg showed me a series he was interested in and we (Charlie was there but dozed off) watched it together, side by side. 
Only, we weren't watching the series, we were watching each other. 
I don't think I imagined this.

Everytime I looked at him (which was often) I caught him looking back at me, with dreams in his eyes and a smile that set my soul ablaze.
It was awkward and intense. So intense you'd be able to cut the tension with a chainsaw. 

All I wanted in that moment was to reach out and  touch his sweet face, run my fingers through his hair and then kiss him. 
I realise I am a dirty whore because Charlie was literally right next to me, but I am losing control of my resolve and my desires. 

I am starting to wonder how things might have played out if Charlie was never a factor. I am pretty certain that Greg, at some point, has felt the same about me as I do for him. We have had many intense moments before, just never quite as intense as last night. 

I just want to blurt my feelings out to him, but I don't have the heart because:
A) I do not want to hurt anyone. Not even Charlie, who is an asshole but is trying his best. 
B) I do not want to damage my friendship (or project) with Greg in anyway 
C) Even if it didn't damage our friendship, and even if he feels the same, he is too much of a nice guy to ever act on it on account of his stupid girlfriend.

Oh... His girlfriend (call her Diana), is so pretentious and fake. She takes too many party drugs, she is loud and obnoxious. She belittles others to make herself seem better. She intefered in and almost ruined our project. She is possessive and jealous, and she treats him like a dog. I don't know what he sees in her, but a blind person could see that she is only with him because he is a catch- not because she gives any trace of a damn about him. 

Anyway... Some good and trusted friends have told me I will never know if I never try. Others have told me to do nothing and to figure out the Charlie thing first before I lead a lonely life of regret at ruining both relationships. Someone said if I can't choose, to say to hell with both of them. 

But I can choose. I have chosen. I want to be with Greg. More than anything. 
I just don't want to destroy anything to get to him or risk losing him altogether. 
Charlie, as dull and sour as he may be, is a comfortable (if not boring as hell) reality. 
Greg might just be a beautiful DREAM. 

I am a mess. 

I am sorry this was such a saga. Someone please tell me what to do. I am too useless to decide for myself.

TL;DR - I am in a shoddy relationship, but have fallen for someone else who also finds himself in a shoddy relationship. I want to be with him, but am too scared and selfish to express how I feel and risk losing everything.",16Oct2017,1
233,"I (21f) need a car and am being offered to ""buy"" (probably for ~500$) my grandmother's car that she does not use or need anymore. Alternatively I go on Craigslist and find a used car to buy that will probably run me a few thousand dollars. 

Strictly economically speaking, buying my grandmother's car is the correct choice to make. I have the money to afford either option but buying a used car will obviously cause me a greater financial hit.

The reasons I am unsure/against buying her car are as follows. The car in question, [a white Hyundai Sonata](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/2002-05_Hyundai_Sonata.jpg), isn't the kind of car I'd prefer to drive. I also feel uncomfortable (read as embarrassed?) with the obvious fact that I'm being handed down a car from my grandparent.

This decision is difficult for me. I really don't want to spend thousands of dollars on something unnecessarily. However, I'd feel kind of dope-ish inheriting a car from my grandmother. Especially one I don't even really prefer to have. ",16Oct2017,1
234,"I'm not sure if this has been a problem for most people of my age, especially in Western countries where most parents allow their children to be very independent and will often send them on their own way at the age of 18. But my mother is the opposite of what I mentioned above—she can be very clingy, intrusive, and inappropriate at times.

Since we’re Asian, our culture is very family oriented, and so things like living with your parents is normal here and is usually not looked down upon. I love my family, I really do—so I’m not embarrassed to hug them or anything; heck my mom still calls me “sweetheart” (even though I outgrew that name years ago). But recently this sort of attention and affection makes me feel really uncomfortable.

There’s always been the “text me every hour to let me know how you’re doing” which I can tolerate. But it’s the way she holds my hand like romantic partners do, or takes pictures of me when I’m sleeping that gets to me. I’ve come across this article on covert incest, also known as emotional incest—which is a type of relationship where the parent depends on the child for emotional support. I really do think she became clingy ever since my dad left us. She’s been a single mother raising my sister and me for over 12 years.

But recently, there has been some slack—starting from my third year of high school where I started to try asserting my want for more independence. Now that I’m in college and live in a dorm, it’s been hard for her. I want to let her know I care about her and that I’ll always be there for her, but at the same time she needs to know her limits.

Posted this because after she dropped me off at the bus station with buses to uni, she suddenly got on the bus I was on while it was still waiting for passengers and told me how much she misses me. She also kept telling me that I forgot to kiss her—which made people stare (I already hugged her goodbye in the car). Got caught by surprise and just sat there staring at her.

Not really sure what exactly I’m looking for, but any advice to help me with this situation would be appreciated.

P.S. this is my first post ever after more than a year of lurking.",16Oct2017,1

237,"So in case you didn't get it from the title, I'm looking for a fitness tracker. 

Here's basically what I would like to have in it:

- Watch

- Heart Rate monitor

- Steps / Floors

- Waterproof (would be nice, but not necessary)

- Sleep tracking (would be nice, but not necessary)

Now I've done some looking into this stuff, and so far the one that looks most attractive is the Fitbit Charge 2. It also fits one of my neurotic unsaid requirements of being inconspicuous, and looking decently modest on a wrist.

Now the thing that concerns me about it, is the price. It costs a bomb, and has loads of features I don't really necessarily need, but I'm willing to spend the extra bit on it. I just want to know if anyone has any experience with it, what the average life expectancy is, etc.

I also wanted to know if anyone had any better suggestions, I'm open to anything, would love if the price was more affordable, so please, anything you can think of.

238,"i'm 14, there is a girl i like, she is pretty nice to be around and i think she's pretty cute too.


I've noticed her a few times during past school years but never thought that much of her and just brushed it off.


But one day she randomly asked me what my name is (keep in mind, we don't go to the same class and never actually talked, and i never stared at her and stuff like that that she would notice). I introduced myself and just carried on.


A week later she asked me what my name is again, i re-introduced myself and asked her what her name is and she asked me what i thought of the recent school trip we went so i sat next to her (stuff i'm talking about are happening during recess) and talked about the trip and music and stuff. She started acting kind of awkward so i figured she was feeling uncomfortable so i just left.


She still says hello when we see each other on hallways and today she stopped me and said hello and started talking about her day or something (it was really loud so i couldn't hear anything and i just nodded and were saying stuff like ""yeah"")


About a month ago i started working out a ton and changed my diet and stuff to battle depression so i changed heavily based on looks, i looked like a drug addict before and now i look way better. She started talking to me around that time i changed my appearance heavily.


I like her (i don't have a huge crush on her like i had before on another girl in my class) but i am considering asking her out or something like that.


My question is: does she like me back? 


I am still not sure about asking her out because i don't know nothing about her and am afraid we don't have that much in common and i can't really get to know her during 5 minute recesses.

246,"It'd take a book to explain my full situation. With that in mind, I'll resort to highlighting the largest factors affecting my life right now.
- Perfectionism
- Suicidal Ideation
- Depression
- Bills
- Hospital Bills Specifically
- Self Harm
- Work/Relationship Stress
- Misc.
I'm aware there are other subreddits for these specific things, such as the Suicide Watch and Perfectionism subreddits. I'll likely send specific posts to those reddits overtime. Right now, all I know to do is ask for broad, general advice on how to deal with all this... crap.
Let's look at a simplified timeline that portrays my 'snowball' (in other words, where things began and how they built up to such a degree).
Bullying from Kindergarten-7th grade -&gt; Self Esteem/Worth/Image Issues -&gt; Perfectionist Attitude -&gt; Maladaptive Perfectionist Attitude -&gt; Suicidal Ideation Spurred by Lack of Self Worth and Increase in Self Hate/Degradation
These things lead me to various suicide attempts, hospitalizations, medication, and therapy (almost all of which occurred after High School). In the brief time since graduation, I have become very self aware of my situation. I am also very rational and logical - which shows that when I begin to 'rationalize' and make 'logic' from my ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) I'm not okay. This specific issue is something I've been dealing with for some time.
By now, it probably sounds like I know 'everything' going on with me. Honestly, to some degree, I probably do. I mean, what, with all the therapy I've been through... I'm striving to get better after all this but I've come to find that just KNOWING what's going on, how it came to be, and ideas on how to fix it don't actually FIX the problem. It's just self awareness.
Today I had therapy. It was perhaps one of my most emotional sessions, as so many things came to the surface. In the end, I am fixated on the thought of, ""What do I deserve? Nothing. What do I value? I have no right. Where do I want my life to go? I don't have a fricken clue."" I've said before that, ""I've forgotten how to live for myself because I'm living for others.""
So, in short, I'm not really okay right now. I'll likely send this post to the Mental Health subreddit as this CLEARLY centers around my mental state. However, what's going on mentally is affecting my entire current financial disposition. More-so, questions of where I'm going/should go in life are up in the air. I shall stress.
I. Have. No. Idea.
Okay, well, there are Ideas, but they aren't mine. In fact, the ONLY idea I have right now - far fetched as it may be - is to ""run away"". And by ""run away"" I essentially mean packing up and moving somewhere - anywhere - else. Get away from the toxic environment where it all began and start elsewhere. This would be an insanely risky move with my financial and emotional state as there is always the question of, ""Will I be able to pick myself up again in an entirely new environment and get a job/apartment/be self sustainable?""
That is the only idea I have right now. I feel like I'm going through a grinder, one ticking by at a snails pace. I'm being raked head to toe in real and self-assumed expectations of my life and how I'm supposed to live it.
Will recovery really only come from scrapping what money I have together and up and ""running""?
Why is this my instinctive ideal decision?
If this is a viable choice, how do I go around making it? How do I begin?
What subreddits are available for people that seek a long distance move (within the USA)?
Should I stay?
I know you can't tell me what to do but input would be wonderful... because I have no idea where to go from here, and trying to figure out where/who I want to be... I didn't think it'd be this hard.
Thank you for reading.

Anyway to pay for parking in this car park you have to call an automated number, its only £12 for 24 hours but its a bit of a pain. Anyway, she said she would pay for the parking as I had bought dinner and driven all the way there! I thought yeah cool great and she said she would call them asap and do it, I reminded her like 3 times and told her I would do it if she didnt want to but I eventually forgot about it, she finally called hours later. So today I get a fine for £60 through my door as she only paid for 12 hours on my car even though she knew id be there much longer.

248,"I got out of a serious relationship a few months ago and met this guy a month or so ago. I didn't want a relationship or anything so we've just been seeing eachother and sleeping with eachother. I have my own house and live on my own, I dislike being on my own so I often let him and our mutual friends [19m &amp; 22m] sleep over (our mutual friends are in a relationship, sleep in my guest room). 

They all stayed over at my house last night, I slept in until 1pm or so because I had no work, and our mutual friends had left by 12pm for work. 

I sleep with no pants/underwear on and for some reason this makes me feel really guilty and like I was 'asking for it' and I KNOW I shouldn't be thinking like this but then I know it wouldn't have happened if I was clothed.

I awoke this afternoon to a weird feeling in between my legs (I sleep on my side). I pretended to be asleep because I was kinda/shocked scared when I realised it was the guy I'm seeing's penis. He was rubbing it around and obviously trying to get into my vagina while I was perceived to be asleep. I continued pretending to be asleep and moved over a bit. He still tried. When he did penetrate me I felt sick and ""woke up"" and asked him what he's doing. He backed off soo quick and said 'oh nothing'. 

I felt so sick and kinda hid in the bathroom for a while. Wondering how far he would have gone if I really was asleep and slept through it all. I just don't understand why he did this, if he'd woke me up maybe I would have wanted to have sex but he decided to take me without my permission while I was asleep? 

I feel so gross and weird and he left after an hour or so saying he's visiting his mother. I tried to explain everything as great as I could so if someone could give me some clarity on the situation and if I should do anything?

255,"Okay, long story short, I am worried about my sister.
My family and I, come from a European country and my sister was born and raised here as well. She has a masters degree and was always a good professional.

Two years ago, she got an internship in a major company in America for about a year and, since the position was great, she decided to go for it. While she was there, she met a guy with whom they started dating.

In general, he is a nice guy, but very immature and always tends to think that everything will ""figure itself out"". When my sister's internship came to an end, she had to come back to our country because of visa reasons, so her and they guy she was dating (they were never in an exclusive relationship) had to call quits.

After a few months, though, they started talking online again and the guy decided to come to our country for holidays. He actually cancelled last minute because his ex, with whom he had a brief fling after my sister left USA, told him he was pregnant. It turned out that she actually lied (for the third time) about that and he finally booked the tickets to come a few weeks later after breaking it off with her completely. To me, that was one of the first indications that this guy had something weird going on. If only I knew what was about to happen.

He stayed for over a month and then he had to go. My sister decided to go there for a couple of weeks to visit him, because a) she never stopped obsessing over him (when she was living in the US, she kept trying to make him commit, but he didn't really want to) and b) she wanted to eventually marry the guy and get a green card. She thought that our country was kind of lame and not as cool as the US. We all told her it was a bad idea but she didn't listen.

Anyway, the guy is 27 and still lives with his parents so my sister stayed there too. It was supposed to be for a little while, but my sister kept postpoing her return again and again. After a couple of months, they sponteniously got married because if they didn't my sister would have to go. Even at that point, he wasn't willing to commit to her fully yet, he would say that they were friends with benefits and that he married her as a favor, so that she would get the visa. When my parents found out, they were devastated, especially my mother, because her daughter would live so far, married with a random guy, living at his parent's house.

Months were passing by. Over a year later, she was still living there and no matter how hard she tried to convince him to get a new place, he would just brush it off and avoid the conversation. In the meantime, she started working at his little company, so she was completely dependent by the guy. No family there, no close friends, they shared a car and went to the gym together. I want to tell you now that financially they could afford to rent a place, but the guy would rather spend the money on very expensive TVs and fancy dinners. Of course, he never threatened or abused my sister, she could have left that house if she wanted to and find a new job (she actually got one at one point but he convinced her to come back to his company but it was ultimately her stupid decision).

Another thing I want to say is that one day that he was getting bored at this routine, he dumped my sister at his parents' place and he flew with his best buddy to Vegas. She had to fly there to keep an eye on him and bring him back. (again, she should have left him by them but apparently she is a rare kind of idiot.) In general, this guy has good intentions but he is a bit immature and selfish like a child. He also gets excited quickly, gets annoyed quickly and when he does, he is a big drama queen and blames my sister a lot.

Anyway a few months ago, my sister accidentally got pregnant with him. She wasn't feeling ready for that baby and she was 50-50% in getting an abortion, but the dude is very anti-abortion and would have divorced her and she would have to leave the country. Anyway, she figured that everything would go well (he promised that he would actively search for the home now, and they were in an actual relationship by that point) so she decided to keep the baby.

Fast forward to now, they FINALLY found a place (which he picked by the way) and signed a two-month contract, but turns out he doesn't like it. He actually said that his routine was ruined, the bed was uncomfortable and there was a weird smell (I have actually been to his parents' house and it was the dirtiest, I guess he didn't mind that). He said that it was my sister's fault because she rushed him to find another place etc. Then, he took his stuff and just abandoned my pregnant sister at this new house alone. His mom was really happy that he came back.

My mom got so worried that she actually took the first plane and visited my sister. He came back to stay with them, but still says he wants to go back to his parent's place when my mom comes back, but promises to find a new place by the time the baby is born (I don't know if I trust him). In general, the atmosphere in the house is very negative. My sister is sad because instead of being in a stable situation while pregnant, things are going downhill, the guy feels like all the responsibilities of the world are now his to carry and my mom is angry with the immaturity and stupidity of both. The three always fighting over stupid things instead of focusing on the important ones. I skype with them for hours everyday and try to make them more positive and happy.

However, today I did something stupid. From day 1, I have been trying to kindly explain my sister that what she was doing would lead to problems sooner than later. At this point, and after yet another temper tantrum of the guy, my sister was really worried and unhappy. So I told her that things were shitty, he would never change and they would definitely break up in a few months from now. She would be left alone, miserable, with a baby she didn't really want, stuck in a place with no friends or family (as soon as she has the baby, it will be hard to come back to our country because he will definitely go to the courts and try to not let that happen).

I only told her that, to ""wake her up"". I was afraid that she didn't understand the severity of the situation. I also tried to advice her that she should consider aborting the baby, it's really her last chance.

Turns out she did understand the severity of the situation. She told me that she asked her doctor about abortion and at this point, she would have to ""give fake birth"" to abort the baby. She told me she couldn't do this and the reason why she has been very submissive to her husband lately is because she is just trying not to raise her child alone, at least for the first few years. She is devastated but tries to be optimistic that the things could eventually work out. Maybe his promises will turn out to be true this time.

I am so bummed that I made her already crappy situation even more negative. I apologized and told her that I was overreacting and knew she can make it. I told her that no matter what she needs, her family would be by her side  and that we all love her very much. I aksed my mother to try and be extra nice and supportive to her while she is still there and she agreed. I still feel like shit! That poor thing!

Anyway, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to help her, she is just so far away and alone with someone she can't really count on. And she is not very motherly anyway, she has told me that so many times. She has told me how she doesn't feel ready for a baby at all. She is very young, healthy, pretty, with great degrees and our family is quite comfortable with money... she could have a happy life at her own pace.

On top of that, I have a very bad case of resting bitch face. I've been told by people that I've known for years (after being introduced) that they never tried to speak to me properly before because I always seemed pissed off.
Employers/co-workers have also asked why I've been in a good mood, and when I reply with something along the lines of ""I dunno, just having a good day."" They've responded with confusion. ""But you look miserable/stressed/tired?"" (Happened more than once).

266,"okay, first off, i'm 14, i'm disabled (physically and mentally), i've been abused by my dad up until last christmas (parents are divorced, he remarried and my mom has a live in partner, i refused to keep visiting my dad and my mom supported this). i'm really scared i'm just overreacting because of my dad, i'm diagnosed with ptsd because of him and some other things, mostly caused by him. i probably have bpd with traits of npd and avpd (as soon as i'm old enough i probably will be diagnosed with it, i've been told i have traits of bpd before), osdd-1a, psychosis, depression, severe anxiety, and maladaptive daydreaming, all because of trauma.

i just. can't really take staying with my mom anymore, i think she's abusing me but i'm too scared to call cps or tell my therapist or tell anyone at school or anything. i'm really thinking of running away, and i almost can't walk because i'm so sick, that's how desperate i am to get away from her. she just makes me do things when i've told her i physically can't, like cleaning my room when i'm having a really hard time with my asthma. she guilts me into doing things like that and because of my dad i get too scared she'll get mad at me, and when she gets mad, she hides in her bathroom and throws things. she also gaslights me all the time, telling me i didn't hear things right or that that's not what she said.

she also kind of doesn't worry about what i'm going to eat when she knows in very deep detail that my dad would starve me. i go hungry a lot, that's the reason i've lost about 15 pounds in the past ten or so months.

and when i was little, she basically left me on my own. we live nowhere near any kind of subdivision or anything, so for the first four or so years of my life i didn't really interact with any kids. i was left on my own. that's why i developed maladaptive daydreaming. all she does, even now, is watch svu and play candy crush and smoke her stupid e cig and drink wine. and back two years ago when my dad was really bad, she wouldn't do anything for me. she agreed to make me go with my dad more when i begged her. it took me a year and a half to tell her my dad assaulted me.

but other than my mom, the choices are like. my dad, my alcoholic aunts, and my shitty uncle. i don't know what to do. i was thinking of running away, but i don't have any money, plus i'm really sick and disabled so it's just not an option. calling cps might make things worse, because my mom would know about it, she would know i did it. i know they can't tell who called but she would know. i was thinking of getting my friend's dad to call cps, but i don't know him that well and i'm just so scared he'll think i need to tough it out or something. i'm having nightmares and i can't sleep and i feel sick all the time and i can hardly get out of bed.

i don't think i can wait it out. it's 3.5 years until i can get away from her, and being disabled, i don't think it's going to be possible.

please don't tell me this isn't abuse or anything. i can literally show you screenshots of the cps website where it says emotional abuse is.

286,"(Sorry if the formatting is weird, I'm still new to posting on here)
I want to start this off by saying that my manager is one of the best I've had in my many years of working. 

I'm an assistant manager at a seasonal retail store so we attract mainly teenagers looking for an easy job. That being said, it's hard for us to attract a lot of serious workers because the job has a definite end. So my manager has her two daughters work at the store. The younger one works well and generally isn't a problem. The older girl, who is a couple years older than me, is a rather bossy person. The company has a policy against family members working together so this girl started the season as an assistant manager at a different location but had a lot of issues with the store manager so she switched to our store and now works as a cashier. So in the chain of command, I am technically over her. Despite this, I know she knows what she's doing so I generally don't try to 'manage' her when she's working. 

Yesterday when I was an hour or so into my shift and she was leaving, she brought out nine boxes of merchandise (not an overwhelming amount for how many people we had working) from a shipment that needed to be put on the floor. In a very rude and condescending tone, she told me, ""*All* this freight needs to be put out before any of you are allowed to leave tonight. And not just by the associates, you and the other manager have to work on it too. Got it?"" 

Added up against all these other things going on at work (getting blamed for associates not doing their jobs, no one listening to me because of my age (18), inadequate amount of help for closing shifts, excessive drama, etc.) being talked to like this feels like the last straw. 

There are only two weeks left in the season and I have two other job opportunities lined up. The only reason I haven't quit yet is because of how fond I am of my manager and I'd like to be able to come back next season. 

I don't know how to bring this up to my manager without offending her. What is the best way to voice this to her? ",16Oct2017,7

There's more examples. I'm not flirting with them, they are taken, and I barely know them. I don't want to stop looking good at parties bc I want to meet other guys. I also don't want to tell the girls because it will likely go back on me, that's the way things are. 

To be honest, normally I think I'm fairly average, but when I wear nicer clothes I do think I'm very pretty/hot and my attitude changes to reflect that.

290,"Hello everybody, it's a 23 year old university student here. I've got a girlfriend studying in another city. We left one year together behind. We see each other once 2 months and when it comes to saying goodbye, I start sheding tears. After that, I don't feel good. Always sorrow, always grief, always sadness, always longing... Can't control any of them. This morning, I have brought her to the airport and said goodbye to each other... I never felt that way after our first meetings because I didn't have such strong feelings for her at that time but now this relationship between us is developing, that's why I want her so much right now. I think I am gonna need your advice on the questions below.

1-) How to deal with longing? How can I let go? I can't even focus on my graduation thesis because of thinking about her... Missing her every second. 

2-) How to prevent producing too much bile? How to prevent it from backflowing to stomach because of this anatomical problem within my body that there is no bottom valve in my stomach which actually blocks the backflow? 

3-) She has got a lot of things going on right now. Exams, practical studies, internship, software languages, etc. All of them are a part of her life. Me, on the other hand, I almost completed a 5 year engineering school and the only lesson I take for this term is my graduation thesis. That's why I have got a lot of free time and I prefer filling them with her and longing. How to prevent this? Preparing a routine plan? Going to gym? Sport? 

4-) I can't get her out of my mind. I love her so bad. What would you think if I cheated her with someone who lives here, in the same city with me? I would never do that because loyalty an important item in my number 1 list. 

5-) How to wait for the next meeting? How to beat my impatience? How to deal with that longing? 

6-) Me telling her that I miss her, I love her and I need her might make her think that I am emotionally in need of her, might it not? That can be really frustrating for her. This could even irritate her. This could even lead her to separation.

Around 4am I am woken by this specific bird's call, which sounds oddly similar to a generic alarm ringtone. It will call a couple of times just loud enough to wake me up, I will get up and flash my phone's torch into the tree at full brightness. Normally this will not work at first, but after flashing my light at the tree a couple of times, the bird will fly away. I know it is the same bird, as there is only ever one voice making the alarm-like sound and I only ever see one bird fly away when I sneak a glimpse of him/her.

Edit 2: my problem is that I'm looking for a girl that fits in a girlfriend profile for having something casual, that's wrong and maybe I'm not that kind of guy that I want to be.",16Oct2017,1
313,"I’m in a current relationship with this amazing girl, but I’ve been thinking about my ex a lot lately. I don’t want to be with my ex anymore because of how things were between us, but I can’t help but feel hurt because she’s got a new guy. I’m really not sure why I feel the way I do. 

And I feel like a jerk because I’m in a relationship with this absolutely perfect girl, but this has been taking up a lot of space in my head the past few days. . 

Any advice on how to deal with it? ",16Oct2017,1
315,"Hello everyone! So... basically the title. Until now I didn't care about certain things nor gave importance to stuff when needed but I know I can't be like this forever and next year will be the year when I fully embrace adulthood and have to learn many things. So, what is it like? I mean, I know there is more to it than just get a job, a house and maybe a wife but what are those things? I honestly want to know.

Thanks beforehand and have a nice day!",16Oct2017,1
317,"A few days ago was homecoming and I hadn't really ever danced with a girl. This girl joined my ""group"" from the beginning and she would take my hand and make me dance with her. Somebody later told me she wanted to slow dance but never did. I am starting to feel attracted to her but don't know what to do. She has dated one of my friends in years past and has a reputation for not being kind to everyone. Any advice on what to do?",16Oct2017,1
318,"
I have been knowing my Dad was going to die. I live States away, and it's been really hard. I got the call that I need to come down and spend more time with him, and he wasn't doing well.
I called my best friend who lives 3 hours away (from my Dad) for comfort, not expecting her to make plans to come down to see us what so ever, since she's a mother and works full time.
She told me she was actually in town, would stay the night with me at his house, she said that she was going to be there and that I needed a friend and she wanted to be that friend.
Fast forward to my plane landing (early), I let her know I arrived, and she texted me back saying she decided to go home and she was already almost there....... I felt very betrayed. I didn't ask for her to be there for me- she told me she was going to be there. Come to find out she never went home, she actually decided to stay at her sisters house with another friend. 
I told her I was upset, but I was still on talking terms with her. Probably only because I thought she would get the chance to see him before he passed.
I didn't realize my Dad would die 2 weeks later. I was honestly expecting him to have a few more months.. 
She called me one time when he died. She didn't ask when the funeral was, she didn't check up on me.  Nothing but one call. 
When I came home for the funeral, she never called me. 
A few days after I got back home, she texted me asking to call her so we could catch up. I responded and told her how hurt I was that she wasn't there for me, and I couldn't imagine not being there for her if she lost a parent. I told her that I was still upset about losing my dad and I honestly don't want to deal with anything like this. I told her I would talk to her eventually but not right now while I'm still grieving. 
I want to grieve about him, and I'm getting so mad that this is becoming all about her....
She said she was sorry at first, but that she was upset I didn't invite her to the funeral, but she loved me and would give me space since I need it.
First, if you don't make the effort to see someone while they are alive, why would I think she would make an effort to see him when he's dead? Second, she knew about the funeral. Our mutual best friend went, told her when it was, and I made several posts on FB and IG about the funeral. She 100% knew and didn't ask about anything. 
I was though, very appreciative that she said she would give me space!!
BUT SHE HASNT!!! She ended up calling me just  later that day. And I'm pretty sure she called me when she was drunk. 
Then she has called me  again the other day, and asked me if I was still going to be a bridesmaid and I said yes but I still need space....
Then today she texted me at 3AM saying she was upset and can't stop thinking about me and if I'm going to end our friendship I should just do it! 
Then she called me twice in a row, which I couldn't answer since I was at WORK. So since I didn't answer, she texted me right after that saying she was done trying.

I'm still grieving. I'm hurt she wasn't there. And now I'm angry as hell that I have to even focus on this- when all I want to do is think about my Dad and focus on good things!!!!!

I'm so frustrated. We have been friends for so long, and she used to be a great friend. Now the older we get, the more it feels like friendships are only convenient if they benefit her. Honestly, I feel like she jealous that our mutual friend was there for me. I don't think she would care if our friend wasn't there for me. I feel like this is about jealousy, not her realizing what she did wrong. 

At this point I want to tell her to stop bothering me and I DON'T  want to be apart of her wedding now. The only reason I'm asking for advice now, is because I'm worried I might possibly regret it later on- which is the only reason I'm holding off. But weddings are expensive and take your time, and I don't think I want to spend time or money on someone that wasn't there for me.

I don't know if I'll get over this. If she would have actually cared about my feelings and given me space to feel and think- I would be in a different place. But having her try and force to me talk to her is pushing me over the edge. I have nothing to say right now. This shouldn't be about us. This should be about my Grandpa.

If anyone can give me perspective, it would be greatly appreciated. ",16Oct2017,1
319,"I'm starting p90x and worried that with a typical yoga mat doing some of the exercises that require me resting on my elbows might cause my tricep tendonitis to flair up. Can anyone recommend a either a nice thick yoga mat, or one with really good material that will reduce/absorb some of the force put on my tricep from resting on my elbows during those exercises?",16Oct2017,3

Even though I know he tried hard, the work that he did was pretty bad/low quality so I'm not sure what to do about it.

322," A coworker who I don’t know too too well, but she is one of the few I will sit and chat with and eat lunch with, just invited me to her daughters 1st birthday party. She like really wants me to go and is waiting to find out when I get off work to actually start the party. So I feel a huge obligation...I honestly don’t even know her kids names. I don’t have kids of my own, and I’m not around a lot of kids. So what the heck should my gift be for this 1 year old child that belongs to a woman I barely know? Like what’s an appropriate standard gift that won’t be embarrassing for me when the kid (actually the Mom) opens in front of the whole family??",16Oct2017,1
