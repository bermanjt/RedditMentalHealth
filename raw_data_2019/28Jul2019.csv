5,"I used to be interactive with anyone without worry. I used to go on Pokemon forums when I was 12 or 13 years old back in 2009 or 2010, remembered interacting with folks without any concern about it. Then immediately afterwards I discovered social media hell like Facebook and it went all downhill. Also had inner drama with girls down the line and that also fucked me up mentally. Now I know of my mistakes and not what to do, it didn't recover my mental health. After 2015 I've seen myself increasingly drift away from people I used to be friends with. Leading up to now, it's a total mess. Now 22 years old I'm completely hesitant to make interactions with anyone, without showing any vulnerability. I stay in my house for weeks on end unless I want go with my mom somewhere, addicted to masturbation, and even pushing away hobbies like playing video games. The only coping mechanism is watching YouTube.

I hope I get replies here because most of the time I post on this website I get ignored. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",28Jul2019,1
6,"People with anxiety don’t have low self esteem    
People with depression are not lazy    
People with ptsd are not going to hurt you 

We are hurt    
We are tired    
We are suffering

Because I was yelled at. I was judged. I was humiliated. I was ridiculed. I was punished.    
Because we gave 110% to everyone else    
Because we have experienced situations that nobody should

So don’t look at me like that or say those things    
So don’t tell me to get out of bed when I’m finally 
taking time to myself    
So don’t be afraid of me

They thought their opinions were right    
They thought they were helping    
They thought I was a monster

But they didn’t know it would give me insecurities    
But they didn’t know I believed I wasn’t enough    
But they didnt know I am at war with myself

If they knew, would they be kinder    
If they knew, would they be understanding    
If they knew, would they know how exhausted I am

You can help me by being mindful    
You can help me by gifting me patience    
You can help me by becoming familiar with my triggers

And one day, I will overcome my anxiety    
And one day, I will overcome my depression    
And one day, I will overcome my ptsd

In order to end stigma we have to understand that individuals are not their diagnosis. Instead, they are living with it. We need to educate ourselves in order to fully understand the complexity of mental health issues.

We are not self conscious, we are hurt. Life events caused us to develop anxiety.

We are not lazy, we are tired. Life events caused us to develop depression.

We are not going to hurt you, we are suffering. Life events cause us to develop PTSD.

7,"Okay so my friend and I fell out and I stupidly told them that I had hacked them. I was angry at the time and was trying to get them to admit to something. Thats all over now but this triggered their current paranoia. Apparently 6 years ago, they did something they regret online.They threatened to post naked photos of some person unless the person sent them more naked photos. Now they are constantly obsessing that they are going to get taken away by authorities. They spend their days sleeping and depressed and they told me that I triggered their paranoia because I said I had hacked them. I do feel to blame and I really don't know what to say to them anymore. I don't know what to do they are literally so consumed by their paranoia. I have no idea what they did 6 years ago, I do not know the full details, but they did not mention it before and they were never paranoid like this. They seem to be getting worse and I do not know what to do.",28Jul2019,3
8,"When someone I'm interacting with brings up my weight loss (which was only due to a severe eating disorder relapse) it is triggering. Yes, I went from medically ""obese"" to a ""normal"" weight. However, I did this by literally starving myself over the course of 8 months. Most people who know me know about my eating disorder and what does or does not trigger urges to restrict, but some people who know just don't care or aren't conscious of what they say, and some people simply don't know. 
This last week has been especially hard on me for this reason. I accidentally triggered myself while exercising the other day. I slipped into that mindset (if you have anorexia, you know the one) and I have been struggling to get back into a healthier one. This was followed by skipping a few breakfasts and maybe a lunch or two. I talked to my therapist about it, which helped a little bit but I'm still feeling dysmorphic. Today, I came across a picture on r/bdsm of a girl, the caption stated her weight. 95lbs. That in itself triggers me, but that's nothing I can't handle. I post a comment that says ""nice! out of curiosity, why did you add her weight to the caption?"" and some replies were fair and understandable, but there was one reply that sent me spiraling. ""if they're over 100lbs, you have to pay double the shipping."" 
I know this was meant as a joke, it's supposed to be funny, but I ended up not eating for most of today because I could not get the idea of everyone around me finding me disgusting out of my head. 
I asked my partner to help via encouraging me to eat and helping me prepare food (as I wanted absolutely nothing to do with it) and he says ""of course babe! I could go pick up one of those Zoodle bowls from the store, they're only like 200cal which I think might help you feel more comfortable!"" which I know was well intended, but the mention of counting calories set me off again.
If I open Instagram, I see nothing but pictures of skinny women in fashion that I love, but could never wear because of my body type and shape. I constantly find myself thinking ""I really love that style! Wish I was thin enough to pull it off."" 
If I open Tumblr, there's a little more awareness, but even seeing people my own weight wearing a style I like causes me to STILL think that I can't dress the way I want because I'm too fat, or my body is shaped in an ugly way. 
If I open Facebook, I'm bombarded by comments about my weight loss, or people posting their own weight loss and current crash diets. 
Looking for good exercise routines for female-bodied folks leads to nothing but blog posts about how ""if you do this exercise and eat this little food, you'll get skinny and have a flat tummy! maybe even a concave!""
Every recipe is all about how few calories it is, how it's diet friendly, or how it'll fit into your intermittent fasting routine etc.
If I go clothes shopping, nothing fits. absolutely nothing, and ofc the solution is to just be skinny enough to shop in straight sizes instead of having to go to the tiny plus sized section of the store and hope they have something cute that also fits correctly. 
I can't go anywhere, do anything, or talk to anyone without being reminded of how gross I am or how my body isn't right. I know, damnit!! you don't have to keep reminding me. 
I did end up eating dinner tonight, though.",28Jul2019,7
9,"Hey all, I want to start this post with the fact that I'm 25F, work in a call centre environment, and live in Ontario Canada, because our dumb ass premier is contributing to this dilemma.

So I've had many jobs since I was 17. Some people would probably call me a job hopper, but most of the time it's due to circumstances out of my control. And the other times it's the cycle of crippling depression and anxiety.

I've also been on and off social assistance in between those jobs since I was 20, which is a very sad place to be.

In November 2017 I finally got a job I actually liked despite it being a call centre. I was pretty good at it too. I quickly became an asset to the team. Then suddenly, I was hit with another bout of depression. I couldn't work, I couldn't eat, all I wanted to do was sleep forever. When I tried to work, I'd get anxiety attacks, and would usually leave early for the day. I quickly became unreliable and a burden.

I decided it was time (with medical advice of course) to go on a leave of absence. I've been on that leave for almost a year now, and nothing has changed except me cycling through doctors, therapists, and medications, trying to just be a little better so I can do something. Hasn't worked much.

Our premier has made it basically impossible (it was pretty hard before mind you) to go on disability. Especially if you have a mental illness instead of a physical one. So, I'm stuck on this leave of absence until they finally realize I'm a burden on their payroll and cut me loose. And it's only a matter of time.

I'm freaking out for my future. I have no idea what I'm going to do because I can't even do a load of dishes most nights. I can't do anything because I'm just so depressed and anxious all of the time!

I'm not sure if I wrote this as a vent post or asking for advice, but thank you for reading, and I hope you have a great day.",28Jul2019,1

I have only 2 triggers. Yelling, even raising your voice, and silence (mixed with isolation. Both scare me so bad I have panic attacks due to my father abusing my family for years (mainly verbal and physical) and me running to my room and fearing the dead silence that came with it.  I still have hallucinations (visual) when I don’t take meds, but the voices are always there. There are 4 usually.

I go to a garage sale and stumble across a crazy rare stamp which I acquire for the owner for just a few bucks. Great deal right? Nope. I would then have this odd anxiety about getting something really good. No rational explanation.   Eventually, being unable to cope with it, I actually talk myself out of thinking its a great deal by finding excuses as to why its no good. Or sometimes just having it give me anxiety without any relevant reason. 

Its like every time I encounter my great thing, instead of it making me happy, it sorta stresses me out.  So I stress but also , still cant part with it because i really like it. So im stuck. Reddit to the rescue?

18,"I posted this on https://whatnow.co/what-getting-injured-taught-me-about-myself/, but I thought people here might benefit from this as well. Injuries have a large effect on people's mental health, and it's a side of mental health that is talked about less.

TL;DR: I had built an identity around my athletic ability, which turned out to be a pretty shaky foundation to build an identity around. Getting injured taught me to expand my view of myself and figure out who I was BEYOND my athletic ability. In the end this was amazing for me.

In the fall of 2017 I returned to school after having had the most amazing summer of my life where I had been going climbing, surfing, and hiking as much as I possibly could. I found so much joy in these activities, and I made these activities become a large part of my identity. When I was introduced to people I was introduced to them as a climber, as a surfer, or as ‘really adventurous’. These had become the core of who I was. I continued to ride this wave through my time back at school and things seemed amazing. These activities weren’t as easily accessible in Michigan, but I still took any opportunity I could to stay fit and train for when I had the opportunity to partake in them again. I had become obsessed.

Then it happened. I was playing volleyball with friends and I went up to spike a ball. When I landed, it didn’t feel right. I took a break, and I expected it to feel better again in 5 minutes and then I could keep going back at my usual pace. But that 5 minutes turned into the rest of the night, and the rest of the night turned into the next week. And it wasn’t getting better. I knew something had to be wrong with my knee, and the thought of that terrified me.

The next month and a half involved a lot of different nurses wrongly diagnosing what would eventually be identified as a bucket handle tear in my meniscus as an LCL sprain. That month and a half was really hard because an LCL sprain is supposed to get better with time, but my knee never did. This was a period that involved a lot of false hope and missed expectations. When I finally got the diagnosis that my meniscus was torn and that the only way I would ever feel better was an invasive surgery, there was a sense of relief that I finally knew what was going on, but a new overwhelming sense of fear that I may not ever be the same person I was before my meniscus tear.

I had built my identity around my athletic ability. My athletic ability and the activities it allowed me to do where what gave me my confidence, where I felt at home, and how I relaxed. My athletic ability introduced me to new friends, it’s how I got the attention of the opposite sex, and it’s what led me to cool places and new experiences. When I tore my meniscus I had all of that taken away from me. I not only lost a piece of my meniscus, I lost a large piece of myself.

I considered myself a forward looking and positive person, but I kept thinking to myself “What if I had never played that game of volleyball.” “What if I just had landed better?” It was very hard for me to accept the fact that I was injured.

The whole foundation of my identity was crumbling. I felt lost again. I felt like I lacked direction again. The way I thought my life was going to be was challenged, and I needed to think of alternatives. I realized I was more insecure in myself than I had thought before. I began doubting myself in ways I hadn’t for a long time. “Will people still want to hang out with me if it’s not during a sport?” “Will girls still find me attractive?” “What am I going to do with all my time?” “What do I even like doing?”

During my recovery, I felt as if I had a choice. I could be miserable until I get better, change nothing, and leave myself susceptible to this mental torment all over again if I get hurt. Or I could find a way to be happy and like who I was WITHOUT my athletic ability.

The next few months weren’t initially easy. But I approached the situation with a positive and very proactive attitude. I knew it was going to take work, and I knew I had to take charge of it. Sitting alone in my room wasn’t going to help me feel better. I had to go out, I had to try new things, and I needed to approach new hobbies with an open mind.

I started growing relationships with the people around me more, I took more advantage of social opportunities, and I took a more proactive approach to my mental health. By the time that my injury healed and I was back to my normal athletic self, I was a whole different person.

Instead of creating an identity that was built on such a fragile foundation as athletic ability, I instead built a stronger foundation that couldn’t be as easily shaken. Not to say that after my injury I had completely figured myself out, there were many more trials and tribulations that sparked a similar change in how I viewed myself. But this injury in particular created largest and the most impactful change in my view of myself, and I came out of it so much stronger.

I had a fight with my family and my mind was thinking negatively, I felt depressed, I got myself up. Did the things I need to do and went bowling.

I went bowling and learn two things
1. Your not good at bowling via osmosis from watching bowling 25 years ago.
2. You can break a sweat, especially if your out of shape.

My greatest fear was people looking at me and judge me, one surprise was a person who comes by my work was there, we chatted for a bit, he was there celebrating his kids birthday party. 

I bowled two games, had some food and left, I paid around $30 for the day, I feel good, and happy. I feel proud, I feel like this is the beginning of a change.

23,"(Written in present tense but is from years ago, I am an adult now) 
I look back at what has happened to me in the past two years and I'm left unsettled but not sad, maybe a little numbed and empty. Adolescence has felt mundane sometimes, adolescence has been unsettling sometimes, sometimes fun but always emotional. I wish I could start all over from when I was a baby and be normal and feel like life was supposed to be in my imagination. I thought things were special and I thought things felt like movie scenes... Life's been awkward, real, and unfulfilling as of now. It's like I'm stuck in between this limbo of being a child who's scared to take on the big bad world and being an adult who wants to add life, sparks, and fulfillment into their life. I'm not complaining though; I have it well, I live in a first world country where I have the opportunity to grow out of poverty(money's been difficult for a while) but still I think I'm allowed to talk about my adolescent confusion. 

To get to the real meat of what I want to just release from my system. I'm obviously young and obviously young people try to experience sexuality. (Dunno if this is a sort of trigger for someone but I'll put a warning here) But I've experienced things with people who I shouldn't be experiencing things with. Two of my few handle full of physical experiences have been with adults(again in the past two years), and I'm trying to understand how I feel about that because I don't know how to feel yet and all I can describe right now is the color gray. I haven't tipped over to a positive or negative conclusion and I don't know if I should come to a conclusion or if I'm supposed to feel a certain way. 

The first time with an adult was the day before the last day of freshman year. I had been texting this man for a bit and he was in town and wanted to act upon our explicit chats. I remember not actually wanting to do this yet my body still reacted and got excited. I went to the mall and met him in the parking lot. I was nervous and shaking. He was chill and we made small talk as he drove off to a different parking lot, a more empty one. I remember before we started to do things I confessed these words ""I don't know if I want to do this anymore"" a few times maybe only twice. I really was trying to back out but I didn't have the guts to straight up say I'm out or no I don't wanna do this. So we did things in his car (didn't loose my virginity though).  I remember him saying that I was ""such a little boy."" I thought it was weird but I have a thing for older guys in the first place and it was a ""it's not that deep""/rationalization moment for my mind. But yeah my body language was ""let's just get this over with"" vibes all the way. I remember when he made-out with me it was rough and hurt. Physically I reacted to being touched in a sexual manner but in my mind I just wanted to go home I just wanted him to cum to get it over with. I hadn't said no but I suggested a lot that I wasn't the most 100% in doing this with him. And even if I straight up said yes and genuinely enjoyed it technically I'm not capable to consenting to him. ... Anyway I blocked him on all social media afterwards. Second adult; it's towards the end of summer now and I'm getting over a break up with my first boyfriend(legal relationship, until a fire months when he's 18). I sneak out at midnight, right through my front door and meet him down my street in his car. We drive off to a secluded area. He's different from the other guy, he thinks I'm one year older than I actually am which may be why he's ok with me being younger but still being one year older from what I am is still not the legal age in California. This is the time I lost my virginity. There was nothing threatening about him he was a pretty cool but still I'm a child he's an adult we shouldn't have done that. I remember he made sure it didn't hurt which was sweet but doesn't make this less illegal it's still statutory rape. The only thing I feel good about his that he put a condom on and was understanding of my awkwardness and inexperience since he knew I was a virgin and had only had a couple previous experiences. I regret loosing my virginity to him, but at the same time nothing feels special anymore and I don't even care about my first times and movie scene things that are meant to be magical anymore. I just wanna talk about this to people without catastrophe happening in my life. I want know if you guys thought sex would feel special, I want to know if someone can relate to my confusion.",28Jul2019,2
24,"I was browsing a few weeks ago on youtube and I fell across a video about rabies. It's a horrible disease which is always fatal once symptoms show. For some reason, I continued to look into the disease, finding out that it could be carried by bats, which I see a lot of in my neighbourhood.

Ever since then, I've been really paranoid. Even when I try to focus on other tasks and stay occupied, it still sticks at the back of my mind.

It's gotten to the point where I get butterflies in my stomach, and I feel like throwing up. Whenever I even hear a scratching or chirping sound at home, I immediately think that it's a bat and I feel really scared.

I find it hard to think about the long-term, because ""what if I get rabies and die before I complete a long-term goal'?

I seriously want to get this out of my head. I'd rather not seek help from a professional as of yet, so self-help techniques or other things that I could do would be of great help.

25,"The other day I was on my way to pick up my friend from college, I had my two other friends in my car let’s call them Wayne and Garrett. For some context I just purchased a new car. To get to my friends college I had to drive through some not so nice parts of town, which is where this event took place. I was behind an older beat up suv at a stop light, when the light turned green he started driving but was going very slow, around 15 mph, he started slowing down completely and stopped in the middle of the road. He then got out of his car and started walking very quickly towards me, luckily I was far enough back that I had time to swerve into the other lane and go around him. Wayne was in the backseat and after we’d been driving for a minute or so he mentioned that the suv that we had gone around was coming up behind us really quickly, I looked in my rear view mirror and he was flying towards us at this point. We were on a 4 lane road and I was in the right hand lane, so I slammed on my breaks and turned into a neighborhood, he was in the left hand lane at that point and he pulled a u-turn in oncoming traffic to follow us into this neighborhood. At this point Garrett has completely frozen in place and I’m yelling for Wayne to call the police, during this chaos I made a mistake and turned into a dead end. He followed and turned his car sideways trying to block us in, he then got out of his car again and started running towards us. I swerved around him nearly hitting his open door and got out of there. I started flying through the neighborhood, running stop signs and dodging other cars to try and get away, the whole time he was on our ass following every move we made. I turned back onto a main road and he was still following us, I blew through 1 or 2 red lights to get away. At that point we had started driving towards the nearest police station to hopefully be saved.

Wayne filed the police report and still hasn’t heard anything back, I’ve been having the same nightmare every night since that day about him actually getting to us and killing my friends and I. I can barely sleep, I work around 30 - 45 minutes away and today I got stuck in traffic and had a panic attack because I didn’t have a way to get out. I don’t see my therapist for a couple more days and I feel like I’m losing my mind over this.

26,"I’m 20F going through yet another depressive episode, this one starting after I had an abortion a week after I found out I was nine weeks along. My mom told me not to tell anyone about the procedure, even my best friend. I was feeling ashamed before it happened but now I honestly feel even worse. All I can think about is hurting myself. The only time I don’t think about it is when I’m sleeping. I haven’t been to work since the procedure two days ago and I’m scared to go back. It’s so hard having to hide how miserable I feel as to not embarrass my dad, since we work at the same place. But I’m scared to call out again and have the managers think I’m unreliable and fire me.

27,"My family has been looking forward to this reunion since February. The idea was mine, since we used to have them every year 20+ years back. My aunt hosted at her huge house, there were games for the kids, a ton of food, dancing, so many members flew in from other states, 50-60 people. It was a great day. 

But now I feel so emotionally drained, and feeling guilty that I didn’t spend enough time with the cousins I hardly see anymore. Not to mention, photos are up that showcase just how much weight I’ve gained lately. 

It was truly the perfect day. I love my huge family. Why does my depression and anxiety have to ruin it? I realize they only rule my life if I let them.. need to still learn to not do that",28Jul2019,1

However, I do believe that to some extent we have created a mass diagnoses of mental health disorders and I cant help but wonder if all that's happening is we are becoming too sensitive. 

Now again please understand I'm not saying mental illness isnt a thing - it is - and im not saying it's not an important field of study -- it is -- but does anybody else agree with me that maybe we have taken things too far? That maybe some of our issues are just us over thinking normal brain functions and wanting instant gratification or relief.. or am I just being way too analytical again?

Idk. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks :)",28Jul2019,1
29,"Hi, this feels very disturbing to write but I’ve been giving this question a lot of thought recently and I’m scared I guess to share it with people around me and thought I’d come here instead. 

Thinking about this has led to some very conflicting thoughts as I started delving into my past, remembering my childhood. I used to cry a lot, and I mean **a lot**. Maybe way too much even. Now obviously though I cannot remember what I felt at the time so I cannot remember whether the tears I felt were genuine or whether I cried because everyone else did. 

Anyway, fast-forward to a time when I was more self-conscious, my family’s cat had died and I still remember at that day I didn’t feel anything. While my family was sobbing, while my father, the type of guy not really into showing his feelings was weeping a bit, I just stood there. I looked at them and just didn’t remember caring much.

Fast-forward again to even more recently, my cousin got into a car accident because of an underage drunk driver. Needless to say, he survived with just a few bruises but when I got a hold of the info, again, it was the same void. I didn’t feel anything when I was told he got into an accident, I didn’t feel anything when I saw him, barely able to move because of all the pain, I didn’t feel anything when I was in the hospital waiting on news, it just felt like I didn’t care. And this is when I started asking myself this question, am I just calm by nature or is it something more?

One last thing is a lot of the time, people try to surprise me with gifts or unexpected surprises that are supposed to make me happy. I see them right there in front of me with their smiles on their faces, waiting on a reaction from me, to jump up and down or squeal in happiness but I don’t do anything of that because I don’t know how to feel about it. 

This brings me back to the question, does all of this lead you to believe I qualify as a psychopath? Or is all this worrying I’m doing proof of me not being a psychopath? I don’t like labeling myself but I don’t know what to do, has anyone ever felt like this before? Should I see a medical professional about it?",28Jul2019,6

33,"This is as honest as I can make it. But I am tired and am in the mood to post something like this and won't be tomorrow  and on phone so spelling 

Imagine a boy: from his literal birth to about 14 years old he was OK. Average or worse at everything except for two or so areas of study and a competitive sport, where in each he excelled and appeared to have a natural disposition towards them. Then, completely changed and for many, many long tedious reasons he lived particularly sheltered existence. A wide gap between then and now that i cannot bridge no matter how hard I try.

It's as if all the good and bad memories, my entire childhood and otherwise singularly important times in my life happened to someone else. It wasn't MY chilldhood. It didn't make me into who I am today. Almost like it was a dream. In any case it most definitrly feels like a lie.

An intuitive,  in-the-moment, honest and earnest kid who read fiction abd whose innocent curious worldview that you only ever have as a child was subtly but forever shaped by books like a series of unfortunate events or his dark materials or some shit idk I think you get it.

I never realized I was luckier than many. Caring parents &amp; grandparents provided me a non-stop stream of experiences, memories and lessons, new places and people. I had a knack for making friends with whoever was around (a lot of travelling including Morocco where dad is from so lots of variety I guess). I'm only elaborating here to emphasize the dramatic ifference.

I very rapidly began to stray from this. Looking back now I realize that a lot of what I began to struggle with were things I had no hope of understanding at the time. As if I was getting ahead of nyself. Only ever vague frustrations, a conflict between two vague opposing forces that I could never hope to identify. Only in the past year have inevitable and truly terrifying changes occured within me that is essentially the hard hitting knowledge that, ""No, you're not a kid any longer. This is it. You are an adult and no matter what, there will no longer be any concessions."" Manifested in apartment, bills, lack of time and new obligations. A forced shift in perspective and priorities. Unavoidable. Being an adult basically. I think 

But if after realising something like that I don't at least have the sure footing of memories (like how whenever I think back it's as if I'm a fucking third party spectator to someone else's past, a person I'm envious of), how could I go forward? How could I not have that nagging doubt that it's not the proper way to ""begin"", as it were? By thatvi mean figuratively emerging back into the world at large not feeling disconnected or largely useless to myself more than anyone else. No matter what I achieve is it worth it despite everything that came before is lost? I've tried and tried to build this bastard bridge but I cant. It's not as if I'm trying to relive thebpast. I'm simply trying to become familiar with the past me again, like an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. If you ever had to move away from your hometown as a kid, you might better understand. it's as if a version of myself was left behind instead of a friend you night have had. I'm scared that if I decide, ""no, this is pointless and impossible, stop and move on,"" I'll have nothing else. Also, what if it was possible? In the future ill never know. Then I do nothing. Ridiculous speculation. I do that a lot. The importance I have either rightly or wrongly placed on this effort is so great that I'm willing to stall any progress in my life just in case I can do this. Ridiculous I know 

Sometimes I find myself day dreaming that a hypothetical man or a random string of events takes me ""home"", which in my mind is an idea and feeling. I once had a dream about such a thing happening and I woke up already crying my eyes out. That was kind of weird actually.

After missing out on so, so much, the world kept spinning and although I'm already hundreds of times better I have no points of reference for abythibg. I grew up anyway, and that's that. Sink or swim? Or something 

I am lost. I am confused. I am angry. I am terrified. I have regrets and often turn a little bitter in the worst hours.

I'm also excited. Once more it's as if I'm reclaiming what was once mine. Past interests, values, passions and motivation. An honest love and respect for my parents, without whom I'd be dead.

And a new found determination in the face of these alien obstacles that I'm sure many of us share. (Although as I said I don't fucking know to what extent - which of the problems I listed are quintessentially universal among human and which diverge somewhat to the individual. That's a large part of my problem).

But the good doesn't outweigh the bad. At least not enough to comfort myself. Maybe I should just keep busy so I can't be existential. A simple solution I'd laugh so fucking hard after everything if it turned out that was the right way forward.

38,"I wrote this long post about my life, and I deleted it all. It was about my life in the whole, but all that matters now is current events and my diagnoses of anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder, and ADD/ADHD.

I thought I had a good friend, but she just disappeared. She said she needed time to herself from everyone, and on two different occasions I tried talking to her and she got defensive. I told her she could always come to me, and she told me the same. I need someone right now more than ever, but apparently, it doesn't matter. I removed her from social media.

I have been dealing with my ex-girlfriend for a year and a half. On and off again. Her life is a mess, and I stuck around to help her through it. Even after everything she still can't act like a person, or a girlfriend. I don't hold gifts or anything like that over her because that was my choice. I don't expect anything in return. She can't even ask to see me, or make plans with me. She barely holds a conversation. She doesn't act affectionate. She tries to play the victim in situations that clearly she has control over. She doesn't try to comfort me if I'm upset. I finally lost it again tonight and I told her to not say she loves me anymore. I don't feel that way anymore. It's impossible. I barely even see her and it feels like she is a stranger again. I bought her tickets to a convention and now I would rather spend the days and night alone there then spend it with her. I was trying to hold off just so I had someone to go with, and I feel like the only other reason I stuck around so long is that someone actually showed me attention.

I can't hold a job for the life of me. I have no friends. Every person I come into contact with is either toxic or broken like me. I'm a manipulative person, to begin with, and I hate myself for it. I at least warn people ahead of time. They say ""oh it's fine. You can always come to me with any problems,"" but obviously not. I give my all to people and they throw it back in my face. I can't even become friends with anyone but females since males are afraid to be emotional. I decide that I need to ruin my life more and end up getting intimate with 80% of the females because I like to live dangerously apparently.

I'm barely scraping by right now. I'm running deliveries for food apps. I've finally started a new job after 2 months but I'm sure I'll fuck that up in some way. I'm barely sleeping. I toss and turn every hour. I'm miserable all the time and the only thoughts that go through my head are ""I want to die"". I can't even talk to my family about it because they go overboard with everything. They don't know how to handle these situations. They have similar problems as well but they try to suppress it.

I hate who I am. I try to become a better person. I hate that I still live at home. I hate that I sabotage myself all the time. 

I go to therapy to fix who I am but as soon as I take 2 steps forward I always go 10 steps backward.

 I want someone to care about me. I want someone to love me. I want attention. I want to be held. I want to be loved. I feel like no one understands me. No one understands the struggle I go through every single day.

The only thing I keep telling myself that has been stopping me from doing anything stupid is that I don't want to leave my mom with all my loans. I'm losing my will to live.

42,"I am not religious, but I cannot shake the feeling that something is off. It's like I know in my heart that I am part of something bigger and I just haven't figure it out yet.

The problem is that when I become manic (like right now) I develop a sort of God complex because I believe that I am the center of some greater story. 

The only reason I am able to write a somewhat coherent post right now is because I just smoked some indica which seems to calm me down for a little while.

It might not seem like a problem to some people when I say that I feel like I am part of a larger picture, but the issue arises when I fail to find that hidden meaning to my life. If I can't find my true purpose, it is impossible for me to feel fulfilled and I start to feel like I am going insane.

If I was just depressed (like usuall) this wouldn't be that much of a problem. However, since I am manic, this becomes much more of a problem as I will stop at nothing to fulfill some greater purpose.

Also, I start to feel like I am the only sentient being in existence when I am manic. Very few things make me feel connected to others. I feel very alone most of the time. Normally this is good, but right now it feels negative.

Maybe my greater purpose is to find another sentient being. Thoughts all over the place rn.

45," Hello Everyone,

Lately, I have been wondering how big is my risk for schizophrenia. I have developed a schizophrenia OCD, where I constantly worry and ruminate about developing schizophrenia.

No one on either side of the family has Schizophrenia that I am aware of. My grandfather on my dad's side married multiple times, so some family members are unaccounted for, but the ones I do know of, including my half siblings do not have Schizophrenia. No one on my mom's side has Schizophrenia, and they are all pretty old, including my cousins.

The thing that makes me worried is I have Aspergers Syndrome and borderline ADHD (according to my psychiatrist). I heard the genes related to these disorders are linked with Schizophrenia, so to me, that means I have the genes for them, though I haven't taken a gene test to prove it. My mom had me born premature, and there was a period where I wasn't getting food from my mom's placenta. To me, I feel this means my brain probably got fucked up during the process, and worry I means I am primed for Schizophrenia and I feel that was what led to my Aspergers,. I am also Bisexual.

I have been through some very stressful situations in my life, and thankfully nothing has happened. I went away from home for University. It did get stressful, and I was in a stressful program. I also had to deal with a former friend who turned into a bad relationship because he blackmailed me for money and then started dating a female friend of mine, whom I told about his exploits, all during my 2nd year when I was 19, and this lasted for a year, with him emailing me time to time and also coming to a conference hosted by school and trying to contact me. I also went away for an exchange in my school for four and a half months in Europe, and nothing happened.

Also in my last year of uni, I took a heavy courseload in first semester that ended up being really stressful. Very time intensive projects, and I started to get extremely stressed to the point where my mouth went numb. I ended up dropping one of my courses because of the stress, which was a great decision. This lasted for a few weeks, and nothing happened. I did develop more obsessive anxiety tendencies such as my obsession with Schizophrenia. So it seems I have been able to handle stressful situations.

I am 22 years old, actually turned 22 last month. I work in SaaS Sales, and I started last month and a few weeks ago. I enjoy it, it can be a tough job with the rejection, but I am wondering if I should quit because what if the stress from the situation causes Schizophrenia? I haven't been in a relationship, but now I am wondering what if the stress from the break up causes Schizophrenia? This made wonder if I should wait for a relationship until I am 26.

Should I be worried about the risk of schizophrenia?",28Jul2019,3
46,"I'm 19 year old guy, and my little sister is 13. We have a really good relationship, and we talk a lot and get along really well. She had a rough couple years and was diagnosed with depression while I was in my first year of college. A lot of it is related to our parents, and some of it herself. 

I talked my parents into getting her therapy, and she and my parents went to therapy for a bit. However, she didn't think it was useful and my parents thought so too, so they ended it. I think that the only time my sister can vent properly is to me, and she seems happier when being with me. However, I don't spend most of the year at home anymore since I'm off at college, and I'm lost on how to help her. She told me today she has lots of suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and cuts herself.

We talked a lot today about what she hates about herself, what she wants to do, what was wrong with her life. I don't want to put too many details here. But I recorded most of the conversation secretly on my phone, so I know what to show to people who could help.

Please, I don't know what to do for her. Any help is appreciated. Thanks",28Jul2019,1
47,"They remind me of myself. Small children are happy and carefree. I used to be like that. A small, carefree child. I didn’t even know about self harm and when I found out I thought it was the dumbest thing you could possibly do. What idiot would do that to themselves?  When I found out about suicide I remember having the same reaction. Who would kill themselves on purpose? Who doesn’t want to live? My parents didn’t explain it very well so I forgot about it and left it alone. 

Now I look at small children and I don’t like them. They remind me of when I was like that, and remembering that only makes me feel worse about where I am now. I remember when I thought going out with friends was fun, and i wouldn’t have to feel guilty about eating, and I wouldn’t be hiding anything from anyone. I’d never even thought of suicide. But now look at me, feeling sorry for myself because I’m not like I was before. I’ve never fake smiled so much in my life. I hate forcing laughs and pretending that I’m ok. Acting enthusiastic about things I don’t want to do. I hate having to limit the amount of cuts I make and how large they are, because if anyone found out I’d be carted off to a mental hospital. I hate not being able to let all my anger out on myself, but I’m also glad that I can’t do anything drastic so I don’t end up dead. I don’t want to hurt myself, and I don’t want to die. But I always have a little voice in my head that encourages me and pushes me on, and assures me that I deserve it. 

I hate kids because they make me remember how innocent and happy I was and I wish I were like that now. But it’s an unjustified hate that i have no right to feel. They’re just kids and i hold that against them. They don’t deserve it.",28Jul2019,2

Over the better course of the past year or so. 

I have been thinking deeper into ""why"" I have always been so fascinated by bridges, especially lift bridges. 

Honestly, I think it could be from ""fear"". 

I was born in a large Canadian port/harbour town in 1995, along the Northern coast of lake erie in Southern Ontario, (Port Colborne). 

There was many bridges in my area that crossed over large bodies of water due to several waterways (Welland Canal, Welland River, Niagara River, Grand River, etc.). 

Nearly a dozen of these Bridge were movable for passing ships along the St. Lawrence Seaway/Welland Canal/Great Lakes. 

At young ages throughout my childhood I have so many dreams beyonds words to describe the beauty of these dreams, a large portion of my dreams involved bridges. 

Around age 5 or 6. I had dreams of driving across a bridge and it collapsing. 

This bridge had an eerie resemblance to O'Reillys Bridge.

Almost everything we argue or debate is opinionated. Hardly ever do we discuss facts. But I am always wrong to them. When I am wrong on something it doesn't change my view radically. I dont flop over to their view I change my view to adopt their idea while stilling holding onto my opinion. An exception in anything I say is immediate grounds for my opinion being wrong. I dislike fruit desserts but I love thumbprint cookies (shortbread with a jam center) because I enjoy these my dislike for other fruit desserts is wrong. It doesnt matter that it is my own opinion; there is an exception so I am wrong. It has gotten to where I cant voice my opinion and if I do and someone says something else one flatmate will tell the person to not talk to me as it is useless I dont listen. Just because I dont change my opinion in the face of everyone else being against me doesn't make my opinion wrong or that I dont listen. I have always liked that I have different opinions I look at things differently from other, but this whole thing makes it very difficult to continue looking at this part of me in a good light. 

My family says the same that I am argumentative. I have gotten better I know I have. I no long attack the person which was my biggest problem, I will stop when the other person has had enough, and I not longer argue fact. That ended poorly with someone about evolution. Those are problems that I am still working on but have gotten much much better at. 

To restate the biggest issue is that makes me doubt the validity of opinions. It shouldn't matter if I am in the minority for it in the room it is still an opinion not a fact. The past couple days I have kept myself much quieter than usual since people started telling me to shut up and that I am wrong on what I believe. it just gets to me.

I’m going to get straight to it- I think I’m struggling with hypersexuality and I don’t know if I’m being dramatic or if I should talk to my family and try to get help. 

I know— every 14 year old girl is horny. Every 14 year old girl feels sexual urges. I don’t think this is the case, though. 

It’s on my mind all the time, almost to a point where I obsess over it. I’ve been experiencing this for a long time, which I thought was simply curiosity, but it’s gotten worse. I decided to post about it when I felt... attached I guess? Or attracted to? I was feeling these urges towards a family friend. Again, almost to an uncontrollable extent. It’s not ok.

And it’s almost every male that comes into my life, especially if I’ve met them recently. I feel these urges towards them and I obsess over it and form these fantasies, and it feels wrong and it’s awful that I’m doing this to them and myself. I just want it to stop and I’ve tried many times to push it from my head and stop doing it, and it just keeps happening.

I don’t want to talk to my family. I don’t want them to think I’m disgusting or untrustworthy. I don’t want them to resent me or anything.

I don’t know. I’m just really embarrassed and scared and mad. I don’t think it’s normal at all to  feel these tendencies and experience these thoughts *this* often and *this* intensely. I just want it to stop happening. Especially since it has now happened to someone I’m close with, that my *family* is close with. I feel sick. I can’t believe I’m like this.",28Jul2019,3
56,"I am already someone suffering with an anxiety disorder but recently it has developed into something worse, i cant be on roller coasters for the past few years because of how scared I am but in the past year it has affected me so much I can no longer be in cars. When I am in a car I get so stressed and worried that I pass out or feel extremely lightheaded and ill because i am so scared when I can see the road infront.

I can’t tell her anything without her going into a rage. I had to leave the house because of this (among other things) How do I deal with her?",28Jul2019,4
59,"I feel so horrible about it. I've never lashed out this hard before. I called her some horrible things. I have BiPolar and idk if that's why I get so angry for no reason sometimes. It was over something so small.  We kind of broke up and are planning to meet and talk about it. I just dint want to lose her. Is it too late?

I just started taking new meds and I'm hoping that's why. I'm just settling into them. It only gets this bad when I stop taking my meds. Hopefully this new shift is causing this and I'll get used to my new meds.

I'm just in a confused mess right now and need some guidance. Is there anything I can do or say? Can I stop these bursts of rage?",28Jul2019,2
60,"So I hear all the time voice talking inside my head. What he says all the time makes sense. Drink tastes like piss food like shit. He can make me love things I hate and hate things I love. He can torture me to make me feel like hes poking me with needles or cutting me with knife. My every device and every device my family uses has virus. Voice told me that it would be nice if my mom would make some pancakes. No time my mom called me that do I want to come eat some pancakes. Next day he said to me that should we get some candy. I needed take one lady to farmacy so I said to him that we are not going to shop. Well this lady wanted go shop too and indeed we bough those candies. There was free fidget spinner in shop and I put it in my bag. After day it was all on pieces. Voice said me that this guys is saying xxx and guy indeed said xxx. I did something very embracing infront of my mom. Next day my mother didn't even remember that something like that happened. I can assure she doesn't have dementia. This was just a tip of iceberg. I have countless of these stories.

So could all this be explained by that I have huge mental health problems? Have you heard anything similar?",28Jul2019,2
61,"I just found this subreddit, and am only making this post because I really do not know what's wrong with me.

One day, I woke up and felt... off. I just didn't feel as good as normal. I wasn't sick, I was just randomly tired. This continued throughout the entire day, for seemingly no reason. For the past 3 days now I've constantly been feeling like this. I've been really snappy and sad for no reason along with it. I've snapped at people in my house when normally I would remain patient. I went downstairs for dinner and water, and when I got to the kitchen, I immediately felt on the verge of tears, when I have nothing to be sad or angry about at all. My mom said it could be hormones, but I find it odd that it would start now, as I really started going through puberty when I was around 10 and 11. I cannot explain it, and all I want is an answer to why I'm feeling like this. Thank you to anyone who sorted by new who was willing to read this.",28Jul2019,3
62,"I'm not trying to self-diagnose by any means, but this is a conclusion that I've come to after many years of suspecting that I may be autistic. My whole life (from as far back as I can remember), I wondered why I felt so different to most other people, and have felt generally unaccepted by many. I feel like I've never truly understood myself, why I feel this way. Hard to explain, but it's starting to make sense...I've researched ASD in adults, watched countless videos about those who have it, and have felt this overwhelming sense of acceptance. I found that I share the same feelings as these individuals who have autism. I was blown away that they seemed to be describing how I've noticed my brain works. It was truly incredible.

Now that I'm a 19 year old girl, I finally feel like I'm accessing this part of myself that I've denied for so many years. The more that I accept that I very possibly have high functioning autism, the more this makes sense. All the years of not being accepted for who I truly am (I don't have the most accepting parents), all these years of not knowing how to communicate my feelings and thoughts, so I just mimic those around me. I feel free.

Where do I go from here? I am finally getting into therapy luckily, and I'd like to talk about this with my therapist. So, any advice on how to talk about this with my therapist? On how to tell myself that it's ok to be myself around people, and that I don't need to pretend to be something that I'm not? I honestly feel so lost, so any advice would be appreciated! I'd love to talk with any of you who have autism, I'd love to exchange thoughts ☺",28Jul2019,5

65,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. You do not have to experience thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.

Anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in English can take part. If you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. The questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need.

Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. If there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the link below. This will take you to the survey and study information page.

66,"Two hours ago I was in my bed, I got off my phone and was just thinking about random stuff and the things I plan on doing tomorrow when I started getting really deep into thought. It eventually ended up with me recalling an incident a few years ago, I remembered back when I went to a psychologist because I kept getting anxiety attacks of something I don't really want to mention. I questioned myself why I thought of the things that ended up with me having to visit a psychologist and why my mind would even think of them. It ended up with me being realizing what caused it was an incident that happened when I was in elementary school and another event when I was in middle school leading up to causing my anxiety attacks, at the time I was visiting the councilor I never knew what was the cause but I just learned how to halt my anxiety.  my mind felt very at ease now realizing what caused my old anxiety attacks and I started to relax, but soon after my mind started to think of so many different random things I was startled, I couldn't stop my mind from thinking of these random things, it was as though these random thoughts would just come and go in a flash and replace one another like someone just blazing through a slideshow. I was getting the shakes for some odd reason and my ears felt weird. I turned on the lights in my room, I felt kind of numb in a part of my body. I promptly started to search if I've gone crazy but the search results sounded different than what I was experiencing, I felt like I couldn't control what I was thinking but felt in control at the same time, it took me a few minutes for my thoughts to start calling down, I could hardly think straight. Right now I'm typing this on a throwaway account because I'm really scared that people might judge, but right now I feel so confused and scared, someone just please explain what I just experienced.",28Jul2019,3

68,"Seems like some of my girlfriends friends don’t like me, some of my colleagues don’t seem to like me, and it gives me a ton of anxiety thinking about it. Why do I have this strong desire to be liked by everyone to the point where I almost feel like having a panic attack? 

It doesn’t seem normal. I did not used to be like this, I used to not care, but I have no idea what happened that caused me to change. Maybe something about my last breakup because it left me devastated although I am okay now?

What can I do to fix this?",28Jul2019,8

70,"Mostly I hear that I need to just accept that it’s the person’s own decision, they are an adult, etc. But there have to be ways of handling this better somehow?

Long story short, it’s about a man I’m in a relationship with. His mental health has its ups and downs, he has depression, and he’s been diagnosed with low levels of serotonin before, after an incident with panic attacks following a hypertensive emergency.

Occasionally he feels suicidal. He never attempted , but he keeps talking about doing it and sometimes counting days until he does it. I don’t think that he’s the kind of person who would actually do it, but I can’t just assume this, right? Because what if he does. 

I’ve tried to convince him to seek medical help at different stages of depression, and he never agrees. He doesn’t believe in psychology, and doesn’t want the help of a psychiatrist. He says that life has been unfair to him and this either has to change by itself, or he’ll end it. To be fair, life hasn’t been fair to him, that’s not a delusion, but so is the case with many other people, and they keep living and trying. 

He doesn’t feel like he has any future, like nobody will ever give him any work and everyone forgot him (he’s a freelancer in a creative field, and 48 years old. Used to be quite successful, but so much not anymore).

Anyway, during the worst stages of depression, he refuses to admit that he’s depressed at all. He just talks about wanting to die. Sometimes he talks like he’s dead and decomposing already. For days. It’s terrifying. When it’s not at its worst, he still talks about dying every couple of days , but otherwise keeps living more or less normally.
 
I managed to get him a prescription and actual medicine that has helped him on the reuptake of serotonin before (after the panic attacks). He even refuses that, saying that medicine won’t change his life. I tried to teach him more about the brain chemicals and how it works, so it would seem to him like a physical illness to be treated, rather than his mind having to be fixed. 

Is there something else I could do? I love this man and I can’t hear people telling me “you’ve done all you can, it won’t be your fault if he takes the decision to kill himself” , etc. I really can’t think of it this way, so please don’t comment that. He’s mentally ill and all I can do is keep trying to find a way to convince him to accept help.",28Jul2019,1
71,"I have been in a severe, depressive loop for a while now. 

Recently hit a nasty rut and haven't been able to get out of it. For a week I haven't seen the outside, haven't even opened the windows. I've not showered, shaved, washed or eaten properly really. The worst of all is that I've only been doing whatever mindnumbing shit I can do and thus ended up ignoring my best friend because of it.

When she brought it up to me I lashed out at her. We got in an argument. She still talks to me, reassures me she's my best friend, but I know I hurt her. I know she's upset with me and will refuse to open up to me no matter what I do or say, and that just makes me go further down the rut. I struggle to talk to her even more now because of this, I know I can't fix it even though I desperately want.   
It's a stupid fucking thing to be so upset over when it's my fault. It's stupid that I keep having anxiety attacks about it, or wanting to hurt myself because of it. My depression isn't an excuse.

But at this point are you really living, or just existing? I am 25 years old and just waiting for death.

Why must I feel shame if I want to take my own life, on my terms? Why must others me judge me so harshly to ensure I never bring this up? Why must others put their feelings over mine, and expect me to happily live my life - if for nothing else, for them? (My family specifically).

So after some more thinking, I tell her I want to stop being Muslim. Then she go's on saying that she was a bad mother, what was she going to do for holidays, and so on. 

It was a mess. So I tell her to forget it ever happened. And that I was still Muslim. 

I posted on here cuz the whole thing has affected me a lot. I don't trust her or anyone in my family with my secrets anymore. I started self-harming behavior, and though about hurting others. 

I love her but idk if I can be open with her again. Recently, I told that I've been feeling un-well mentality. And she said I could go to a therapist if I wanted. But I'm  paranoid that somehow she'll find try to find out.

77,"I'm in a state right now, I apologize. Basically, I fried over so I'm a little more anxious than normal. If you want the story, it's my first post and I only use this account for mental health posts. Long story short, I hit an ex for lying to me once.

Now I'll be letting myself enjoy things and feel good about myself again, and think,""In the furture, I could be famous with the best career if my like and a false news headline could come up about me and they may look into things from people from my past life, and ask my ex and then he could tell the one story that is true: I hit hom once. I'm a criminal scum bag. AND THEN make up all this other shit about me that isn't true if he starts to resent me for other smaller fights too, because this one shitty thing holds true and cooperates with the narrative he wants to tell. AND THERE WILL BE NOTHING I CAN DO TO PROTECT MY SELF WORTH IF THAT LEAKS OUT because there's nothing I can rationalize with myself and my brain to say that I don't deserve it because I hit him once and that was so fucking shitty of me and there's nothing I can do to not think of myself as a piece of shit - because it's true and I'm garbage for having done. If it means anything, my ex and I are currently on decent terms and are good friends so I'm basically triple anxious that he'll betray our friendship like it means nothing, because he resents me for hitting him (somethings that's valid and he should), but on top of that think of all our other petty fights over all our great bonding moments.

^ Then I also I have similar thoughts but think of a more legal vibe, like a false crime comes up about me and the court does find me guilty because it's true, I did commit a bad crime once.

Then sometimes I start resenting my friend who is involved in the narrative and made me feel poorly about myself that one time, and I'll loathe myself for even resenting her at all because this girl has been SO AMAZING TO ME OTHERWISE. She's really the loml, there's nothing I wouldn't do for her otherwise and I can really see myself taking a bullet for me. So I'm like, ""Why does brain still resent her for making me feel badly that one time? She's a treasured friend and I love her, and I see us being friends when we're in rocking chairs. Am I faking an image?""

Then my parents have told me that we're going to Disney world for the last time as a family it's been a huge happy spot for me and I haven't felt genuinely content for awhile, but then I'll think that I don't deserve to feel happy because of what I did.

I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember and it sought help 6 months ago. Got out straight on propanalol and that seem to solve the physical symptoms, however I recently got diagnosed with OCD, I knew I had it, had been struggling for so long but just didn't tell anyone.

I'm struggling at work, I can advance from the position I'm at as that would involve working alone which I cannot do with OCD and anxiety. I am paying £70 for therapy, it's one hour a time and I tried to get it free but the sessions only run weekdays at working time. I work so far away from where the sessions would be held and can't keep taking more time off due to it would have to take a whole day off every time. In the same way finding somewhere closer to where I work I would have to keep taking time off which work don't like.

I have minor asburgus which is really easy to control and basically just makes me a little monotone and spaced out when speaking to me, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I would then have this odd anxiety about getting something really good. No rational explanation.

so i had been suffering with anxiety and sever panic attack a few years ago 

I was diagnosed last year or so with general anxiety, depression and OCD. It was brutal, I was in a constant state of fear and emptiness. I had panic attacks when I had to make a phone call to a place of business or go to the grocery store. Ultimately what helped me the most was building my self esteem through journaling. Exercise was also a major component and I still do it regularly. while i was suffering the peak of these days a friend of mine reached out with his beautiful book which helped me. I used to read it every night and after I wake up.If I skip a few days, I can feel the tension and Anxiety set in.

I still have anxiety and depression. They will always be there but I know how to manage it now. Meditation makes me much more in tune with my body and mind and I can squash that anxiety with some slow deep breaths. It gets easier and someday, you will get to the other side.  So i thought this small success story of mine will help motivate you guys out there , we are in this together . I will drop the link so you guys can check the book it might help you guys out

But there's 2 things that have been bothering me for a long time but I've always had something more immediate to worry about before. It's starting to get too much to the point where I've constantly felt like shit for the past 4 days.

The first thing is that I've never been in a relationship before, or even had my first kiss etc. Most of the time it doesn't bother me too much but there's now someone at work who I really like and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I get the impression she likes me but other times it's as if I'm not even in the room. I'm absolutely terrified to ask her out though for several reasons. If she says no I still have to see her nearly every day, and I don't want to become the weird guy at work (especially as I seem to be well liked by most people at the moment) I've also never properly asked anyone out before so I don't know how to go about it and I'm not sure how I'd handle rejection.

The second thing is that I can't stop thinking about climate change anymore. Do not try to convince me that it's not real because you are wrong and nothing you can show me will convince me otherwise. And I appreciate some of you may want to make me feel better with ways humanity is currently trying to solve it, but unless you can come up with lots of incredibly convincing evidence that won't work either as I believe we're many years too late.

I've always known it was an issue but it always felt so long away, I had other more immediate problems and I thought it might be possible to find a solution. Now it absolutely terrifies me, it's already started happening and I don't know how long we have left before things get bad. At that point I will kill myself if I have the guts (and I highly doubt I'll be the only one). Optimistically we might have 30 years left, but currently it's looking more like 5-10 years. I know I've probably spent too much time reading depressing stuff on r/collapse etc and probably should stop, but I'm not going to stop worrying about it by ignoring it (I already tried that). Everything just feels so pointless because it's all going to be destroyed soon anyway. I've already decided I'm not having children because I don't want them to live in the world that's going to be left behind. The worst part is that there's basically nothing I can do to stop it, even if I completely stopped polluting and disappeared it would make a negligible difference. All I can think of at the moment is to try and enjoy the present as much as possible but it's not working any more.

For the last few days I've been constantly thinking about one or both of these things, and I've been extensively worrying about climate change for the past few months.",28Jul2019,1

Context: I've been diagnosed with depression about 7 years ago, still haven't recovered, probably never will. The point is for these 7 years I've watched all my hobbies slip away till today when I'm left with no hobbies at all. 

Instead of trying to go back to the things I enjoyed doing I keep distracting myself with things that don't bring me joy. I feel guilty because of that.

A few of them know that it hit me hard but I dont think they know how i really feel now.

At this points I started to notice that I avoid my feelings like sadness, love and everything else besides anger and  happiness. I also get out of the way of disputes but not always I just go in one when i am feeling really unfair treated.

93,"I've had intense suicidal ideation for over 18 months now. I've been trying to work with my therapist and psych doc, but the group that I'm with keeps changing my care providers, and now my therapist has extremely limited availability. I get to see her once a month. I'm 34 and I've never met any performance matrices in any job that I've worked in. If I'm working full time I burn out in 6 months. Like, glorious flames of skidding to a sudden halt burn out. The longest I've ever been able to hold a job has been 18 months, and that was because it was part time and my boss let me take a lot of sick days. I've been unemployed for a year because when I burned out last year I ended up in the hospital and they told me the only thing wrong is that my life is too stressful. No med changes or anything(but kept me there for a week where I had to fight to get proper food that wouldn't make me sick since I can't have soy or gluten). I've run through A LOT of meds over the last 19 years. The last psych I saw there up her hands and when I asked when I should come back she said, ""When will the crisis be over?"" If I knew, I could plan better. 

All that to say that I need to be back at work ASAP but I cant even get through my day without breaking down angry or crying. I recently found out that if I did apply for disability what I would get wouldn't even cover my rent(and I'm in income restricted housing). But my kids would get more if I died. 

I feel like I'm losing hope of ever living a normal life, or even a semi stable life. Meds work for maybe 6 months then I stay on them because I know if I stop taking them doctors wont want to work with me and I obviously need them. But they don't work. Then I go on this escalator of lets increase all the meds to max doses oh no that didn't work lets bring you back down. And then the TG thing makes it harder because I cant afford to change my name, I've been on testosterone since march but no one takes me seriously because they just see a cis woman wanting to use a ""mans"" name. I feel so alone and helpless. I just keep hearing, ""No one can do the work for you, you have to WANT to get better"" BUT I DO. And I'm doing everything I can and it's never enough.",28Jul2019,3
94,"There might be some triggering things in this.

Hey everyone! I just joined Reddit to ask this question and hopefully get some guidance because my sister is worrying me and our family (we live in California if that helps to give us some resources). She, of course, does not know I am writing this but I need to seek some type of help.

Let's call my sister Ann. Ann has ADHD, takes Adderall, and goes to a psychiatrist to keep them updated on her mental health but I am afraid that she is not being honest with them because she is afraid of what they might think of her. Earlier this year, she found out she would not be able to become a firefighter which was devastating for her because she worked really hard for years to get where she was. Ann went into a ""dark valley"" (her words) that lasted 6 months. She would sleep all day, lash out on loved ones, and she said she had dark thoughts. She said she never wanted to hurt herself but she did wish she never existed on a daily basis and would even pray that God would let her die in a car accident or something. She was in a really dark place.

I was gone for 4 of those 6 months and when I finally came back, Ann was acting in such a way that I hardly recognized her. The sister I knew before was irritable and it was like walking on eggshells when talking to her as to not make her mad. When she picked me up at the airport she was excited and talkative, telling me she had soooo much to catch me up on. When we got home, my mom, Ann, and I sat at the table and Ann began to catch me up on her life with uncharacteristic enthusiasm. She was talking about how she found God again and how he took her out of that ""dark valley"" she was in and I thought this was normal. She then told me how she felt during this valley and began to cry when she talked about the feeling she had of wanting to stop living. Almost immediately she changed the subject, and her mood, and began talking about a whole different story that happened while I was gone. She would occasionally bring the topic of her dark valley again throughout the conversation. Ann talked about how she and my mom went to my other sister's house to hang out and both of my sister's got in an argument that was mostly one-sided on Ann's part and basically when Ann and my mom were driving home, Ann was sobbing uncontrollably and even said that she felt like she was going to grab the steering wheel and crash the car, killing her and my mom. She also kept mentioning that she was excited to share the different ideas she had about several businesses she wanted to start but I thought nothing of it. (This is how quickly she would switch subjects and stories). It was a bit odd at the time because I could barely add any comment due to how much she talked but I brushed it off as her just being excited.

The next day, I went to visit my other sister who told me the whole story of what really happened during the argument, my mom was there to corroborate her side. Basically, Ann wanted to borrow 4 books from our other sister and got mad when my sister made a comment that it makes sense to only get one if she will be reading one at a time. An argument ensued, Ann was mostly the one attacking and began to insult our other sister as a mother and a person. It was pretty intense. After Ann got home, she took the family dog and left without saying anything and texted our brother that she was sorry for everything that she had ever done to him (she has a history of arguing/being rude to family), and this worried him because it was out of the blue/uncharacteristic. So he reached out to my other sister who was worried even though she was a bit upset still. So they asked my mom who told them she left with our dog but she wasn't sure where. Ann finally came home and told my mom she went on a hike with the dog and had met a man who she assumed was an angel and they talked about Jesus during the whole hike.

After hearing this, I felt worried about the previous interactions we had because I did notice something was off. Since I came home, I have noticed many moments where she was not herself so for the sake of brevity, I'll list them below:

* In one hour, she wrote on about 50 note cards the things she believed God was telling her.
* God is telling her she needs to be on Naked and Afraid
* She created a bitmoji of a man who she claims is her angel and said the holy spirit made him not her
* She says she is writing a book
* Talks about a business she wants to start for firefighters who end up not able to find a job
* Another business she wants to start is one where she creates vape like smoke but good for you so people can smoke without worrying
* I looked at some notes she made and they're very odd
   * I have pictures and the words look like chicken scratch (not her style at all) and the subjects go from God to her vape idea very quickly
* she constantly tells my mom that God is telling Ann to tell my mom to be more obedient and stuff like that
* Ann says God is constantly telling her things like her business ideas and who to save
   * She also takes everything that happens as a sign
   * One time naked and afraid was on and my niece told Ann that she should be on it (because she likes nature) and Ann took that as a sign
* My mom says she wakes up singing and dancing
* She is planning an impulsive trip to Costa Rica (with not so much money but she is adamant)
* She is constantly and uncharacteristically happy and energetic
* She says she has racing thoughts and can't sleep sometimes because God is telling her so much
* She says that Pastor Rick Warren's son talks to her (he passed away)
* Ann went to a homeless center and washed a homeless man's feet (which isn't bad I guess it just does not seem like something she would do)
* She thinks everyone hates her or is saying something bad about her when they are just saying something normal
* Yesterday, my mom and I came home from grocery shopping and Ann was in her car with our dog. When my mom asked where she was going, Ann said she had to go to the beach as a mission assigned to her by God so she went
   * I had to pee at like 4 am that morning to I went to the bathroom and it was locked, I knocked and it was Ann and she came out in a towel, I thought she was just taking a shower, but she was taking a bath... at 4 am... my sister would never ever take a bath so I thought this was so weird. She had candles and music and even had our old dog's ashes on one of the bathroom ledges. She added apple cider vinegar to the bath which made the bathroom stink so I tried to hurry lol
   * The next morning she left at around 6 am, and I woke up to my mom telling me that Ann was going to church early to talk to our pastor or something and she took a backpack. My mom said that Ann had not slept all night and was printing pictures the entire time. So my mom decided to go after her and try to see what she was going to do. I'll try and update when I learn more about what happened

I love my sister, and I know something is wrong and no one in our family knows what to do. Is there someone we can talk to? I want to get her help because I do not know what she will do next.

99,"I want to identify a low mood state that often occurs without any trigger or reason. It doesn't fit any emotion description I can find.  I know what anger, sadness, irritation feel like, and this isn't the same.  I feel deep in my chest and gut, like a dull but strong 'unease' or disquiet.  It feels like I should be doing something else, no matter what it is, unless it's emotionally intense.  

Its usually not very intense by itself, but it colors everything, like the difference between a piercing pain and a dull but strong ache.  In this state I find it hard to concentrate, it just feels like I am supposed to be doing something else, no matter what I am doing unless it is emotionally intense.  In this state I can also have very strong emotional reactions, but it can turn into almost anything - sad, angry, irritated, worried, sometimes positive emotions like excitement and desire. But the starting state wasn't any of those emotions, just a disquiet or unease.

I can usually get immediate relief by expressing an emotion intensely.  But I don't think its an underlying emotion about a situation or experience because I actually have some choice of the emotion to express.  For example:  choose anger, pick something to be mad about- yell and break something;  choose sadness - see if I can bring myself to cry.  Even pain, like poking myself with a pencil hard, can bring momentary relief.  Usually it has to be expressed or acted out in the world - if I ruminate, or feel shame, I get locked in and the state lasts for longer.  I'm not acting impulsively, I'm usually trying to get relief from whatever this thing is. 

Sometimes it can also go away on its own if I don't get stuck in rumination.  It comes more often and stays longer during times of stress.  Sometimes it comes out of the blue: things are going well, I feel good and enjoy what I'm doing, and then suddenly the 'unease' comes back and I don't.",28Jul2019,2

101,"I don't even know if I came in the right place so I'm sorry if I'm upseting somebody but I don't know what to do and just looking simptoms random gives me a headache so I guess I'm here. 

Lately I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't have any idea what to do. To start from the begining, I've dealt with anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts and depressive episodes for a long time, long enough that I can't remember how my life was before them. I've built things in my mind to help me manage them, mainly I do it by making a special space in my mind for them, like another mini-person in my mind, but not really. I just put all the things I don't like in a hypothetical person from my imagination and say to myself""Don't become that."", but lately this is not effective anymore.

I'm 16(I can see some eyes roling) and I know that I'm probably exagerating but whatever is happening to me freaks me out. It just seems that I can't speak right anymore. I always had speech problems, more exactly I can't  pronounce the letter R, I just can't. But the problems I had in the past are nothing to the ones I have now. I stumble over words and stutter a lot and people can't really understand what I'm saying sometimes. Many times I combine two different words and I can't separate them. It's like my brain turns off and I don't know where I am or who I am with or in what context I wanted to use the original word, all I know is that I say one word wrong but I can't remember the right way to say it, my brain refuses to think, so I just repeat the wrong word over and over until I go back to normal. More than that, I forget regular words, like I can't even say how many times I forgot my own name and I said a nickname or something like that.

I get blackouts a lot. I observed this at first after I saw that objects where moving around me whitout me knowing that I moved them. Like I put a glass of water next to my bed and then I wake up that it's empty and on the table, I can't remember the entire road from home to school, or I don't remember when I wrote two pages in class, or ate the food on my plate or open certain tabs in my computer, I just wake up to things being like that.

I feel diconected from my own being. It is like I play a game in third person with myself as the main character. I'm in control of the actions and decisions the character makes, but I can't associate myself with them, it's like we are completely different people. 

Also, I'm such a two faced bitch and I don't do it intentinately I swear to God. When I am in a stressful situation I will plan the guilt on someone else, I want to take the guilt, I really do, but my mouth moves without asking me before and I just do it, or I lie without any reason, like, it's not a big thing or an important thing but I just lie automatically and then I have to deal with it.

The lying, speach problems and suicidal thoughts happen all the time, but the blackouts, anxiety and depressive moods happen mostly in cicles. Sometimes together, sometimes not. Like I have nice periouds(1-2 months) and then some in which I have blackouts everyday, anxiety is up and high and I feel fucking numb and I don't have enough strengh to do shit like eating and showering and moving out of my bed and doing something(2 weeks-6 months).

I said something slightly personal to him, but it was something essentially everyone knew. When I say personal, it’s too strong of a word, it wasnt vindictive, mean or anything like that but it must have got to him because he went on to humiliate me by mentioning a personal conversation we had about a month back where I expressed I was suicidal, was self harming etc. I didn’t even rise to it, I just left the argument there.

At the beginning of my journey alone at home, i used to be very excited to be getting to do things in my way anytime i want. Being raised in a very tough family especially regarding dating Men , it was tough for me to think about any dating or fun outside home + financial or security matters, so i just learned to satisfy myself at home, watching comedians , comedy shows, great movies or series , anything to get my adrenaline up. then  obviously as many people i have facebook to answer messages, but then i strated enjoying phone calls more and more, socializing  in an easy way , where nobody would hurt me   , where my dad wouldn't know about it was the key . I won't have to go out and pay money, it worked fine for me, after some days , talking to someone special , we got into each other fast and this made me start my first relationship which basically virtual. we grow very intimate with each other.

But then the day he decided to come i got super nervous to see him , and frankly it was great the first minutes, we easily got VERY comfortable with each other, till things got weird inside me. weird dissociation sensations and huge fear , i couldn't sleep nor eat. i felt overwhelmed with everything around me and him especially, i didn'T want him anymore ,my breathing difficulty got me off the bed , my whole body was shaking , and his recation made it even worse ( he got very intense and cried) . at 6 am, i went back home and slept easily. this traumatized me for a long time and caused some depressing weeks afterwards . we were at the point of breaking up but he kept on trying to get me back (he is also very sensitive and this broke his heart) . when we got into the LDR again , talking through internet, we grow again more intimate than ever, only what i didnt know , this week after he came to see me , i lost it again , we had fun at home but after he left he called and just by hearing his voice on the phone, it made me cry ,feeling i am more intimate with the experience via internet. last time we met , we were walking outside , i tried so hard to be happy, it was good till a sudden numb sensation got me and lead out of this world and happiness, i took a cab and came back home with a loss of feeling, which made cry like a crazy.

Also i always been very indecisive in my decisions in life, so looking at him made me ask questions like: do i really want this ? + and i get vey anxious when he is not smooth doing something or being a bit less focused.i feel like he is not responsible enough and i can choose better .

Hello,

I need some advice on how to help my friend out of his situation.

About us: I have known him since high school. We hadn't met in many years after graduation, but we maintained contact through online gaming. I wasn't aware of his problems up until recently I gave him a visit.

About my friend: His mom told me that he has stayed in his bedroom all day(rarely goes out) ever since high school graduation, he didn't attend university nor try to find a job. He has no motivation to do anything besides watching videos and gaming.

He is now 22 years old.

What I know: The reasons he doesn't want a job, maybe has something to do with lack of qualification and self-esteem issue on working a job that's low paid. Also mainly due to the fact that he believed there's no need to get a job, because he lives in his family rental house with other tenants and gets their rents monthly. He also hits his mom or throw things when she does something that embarrasses or angers him. Like there was one time, he threw her phone after finding out she was talking to me on the phone.

He seems to be normal as a person, but not quite mature for his age, like shouting and even hitting his mom over something that embarrass or angers him.

He considered himself a millennials. He barely has any social interaction with anyone irl besides parent and me as far as I believe. He also claimed to been in a relationship but broke up. He doesn't talk to his other family members like grandmama, cousins....

Oh, and his mom live with him. His mom told me, when he was growing up in teenage years between 16-19. His parent hadn't got the time to educate him properly, because they were busy with their restaurant business. At one point, one of the workers told my friend, he doesn't have to work, because his parent own a restaurant and a rental house, one day he will inherit them.

I tried to help him before, but he is in denial and evasive on the topic, even warned me not to annoy him. I doubt he has major mental issue, but after locking himself in bedroom for so many years, and not going out to socialise. He may have developed some mental problems along the way.

about his parent: Little is known about his dad, just he was very angry with the way his son become and not living with him anymore.

As for his mom, she was well aware of his issues and seek therapy in the past, but failed due to she couldn't get my friend out of his room. I noticed she is still kind of spoiled him. I even told her not to obey and take care of everything for my friend, let him be independent. But, she told me she had tried this method in the past, but failed due to my friend started annoying the tenants and throwing things in the kitchen.

That's all I think.

Please, I need professional advice on how to help him. I want my friend to be a normal young adult and to get a job.

I am 25 years old female living alone for about 3 years in a ""not very secure"" muslim arab city, raised in tough family , I recently become a non believer and currently working on my last year of masters. to sum me it up , I am a very anxious person so i got used to have my home as a source of fun  which equals internet , to socialize, i strated enjoying phone calls  via social media .

My first realtionship , then  happened on Facebook,  we got into each other fast  and we grow very intimate easily.

One day, he decided to come and see me ,I got super nervous at first, and frankly it was great the first minutes, we easily got VERY comfortable with each other, till things got weird inside me. weird dissociation sensations and huge fear , i couldn't sleep nor eat. i felt overwhelmed with everything around me and him especially, i didn'T want him anymore ,my breathing difficulty got me off the bed , my whole body was shaking , and his recation made it even worse ( he got very intense and cried) . at 6 am, i went back home and slept easily. this traumatized me for a long time and caused some depressing weeks afterwards . we were at the point of breaking up but he kept on trying to get me back (he is also very sensitive and this broke his heart) . when we got into the LDR again , talking through internet, we grow again more intimate than ever, only what i didnt know , this week after he came to see me , i lost it again , we had fun at home but after he left he called and just by hearing his voice on the phone, it made me cry ,feeling i am more intimate with the experience via internet. last time we met , we were walking outside , i tried so hard to be happy, it was good till a sudden numb sensation got me and lead out of this world and happiness, i took a cab and came back home with a loss of feeling, which made cry like a crazy.

Also I've  always been very indecisive in life, so looking at him made me ask questions like: do i really want this ? + and i get vey anxious when he is not smooth doing something or being a bit less focused.i feel like he is not responsible enough and i can choose better .

why this only happens when i am around him ? i am still not sure if it's a trauma ? is it him that makes me anxious or relationship in general ?",28Jul2019,1
122,"Hi everyone M17 I’ve been diagnosed with depression and I’ve recently stopped taking my medication (lexapro). I stopped about 2 months ago bc I was in a relationship for a few months and I was feeling happy and I thought it was natural bc of all the good things happening in my life. I decided to just stop taking my medication which probably wasn’t the best thing to do but recently I’d say starting about a month ago I’ve been generally very unhappy, tired and unmotivated even with my relationship. Basically everything I felt in the worst of my depression. I need some advice on wether or not to get back on my medication. I haven’t spoken to my parents or doctor about this and as far as they know they think I’m still taking it.",28Jul2019,3
123,"To give a few pieces of context before I start. I’ve already begun to feel incredibly depressed finishing my first year of college. So my counselor set up a psychiatrist meeting, when I met with him I started 5mg of Lexapro. After 3 months my parents said it would be best if I stopped and it was wrong of him to give me medication on my second meeting with him, and that I can deal with my depression through other means, and I agreed. It probably wasn’t good of him to do that and my depression isn’t bad enough in my eyes to have to taken anything, I shouldn’t have in the first place.

I’ve been off them for a week, I cut my dose to half pills then every other day then cold turkey. But something feels wrong. I don’t even feel depressed I just feel off. 

Everything feels louder, and slower, and while I have had time to work on my depressive state over the last few months being out of school something is different. I feel incredibly tense over nothing. And sometimes I feel nauseous, I can best describe it as being in a dream and my head gets all flowy. I’ve begun to feel a bit more depressed but that was expected what I didn’t expect was to feel so angry at myself for everything. 

But other than that, I can’t help but feel that somethings not right at all times. Today was a bit of a turning point though. And to be fair I’ve always been empathetic to characters in books movies etc because I like to feel more connected to the story, but when I watched the new Overwatch Sigma video I couldn’t help but feel increasingly unstable, but I couldn’t look away. Something about the psychological horror just make me realize something, I enjoyed being in his position. I do play dnd and as a DM I occasionally look up villains and music for inspiration but this connected to me on a deeper level and I’m scared. 

To clarify I don’t have voices in my head, nor do I hear or see anything that isn’t there but I just feel, unstable. Like I wanna scream at any moment, and burst into a new character making dramatic speeches about power, death, and hopelessness. My chest feels incredibly heavy and I just kinda sit around in my room listening to this horrific music as my body tenses up, my fingers move on their own and my mind stressed out. Something is wrong something feels very wrong but I’m so confused I don’t even know how I’m feeling I don’t know if it’s relapse or my mental health or just me being a fucking idiot and overanalyzing everything like I always do. The thing I hate most is that I can’t identify what I feel, it’s not a panic attack, it’s not a depressive episode it feels like I almost want to go insane and finally just be free and not have to listen to anyone. 

Please don’t have concern for anything bad happening, I would never hurt anyone else or actually go insane it’s more in the sense that my family is strict and school has been so much and I never get to do anything for myself. But feeling that rush, that sense of power and almost evil just gives me a way to express my myself in a way I could never have. It’s almost like a release. DnDs always been my release but this, acting out this insane character is relaxing once I’ve drained myself out and just move on to my normal self. But it’s stressful, and really irritates me that I don’t know what feeling this is. It’s almost like I’m using my relapse to imitate insanity just to find a release for the bad feelings of stress and relapse side effects but I don’t know).",28Jul2019,1
124,"i have fearful-avoidant attachment.
it mostly stems from early childhood emotional neglect and eventual emotional/physical abuse during my teenage years. it's marked me deeply and prevented me from holding any sort of emotional relationship 
one of the issues i encounter with friends is that i tend to feel hurt another person i'm close with doesn't acknowledge my pain nor helps me soothe it. indeed it comes from the years of emotional neglect, and it's not always the other person's fault, but i tned ti end up being a pushover in relationships where people feel free to vent to me because i'm open and accepting and yet they cannot reciprocate at all. it comes from my mother, obviously. never soothed me nor responded to me when i needed her to, and i had no friends at school for all of my primary education years either. my father was alwayd away. i was totally isolated and unheard. whenever someone talks over me i regress back to that one 6 year old who felt like crying but couldn't tell her mom because she never gave a shit and would rather focus on her son. i comforted my brother when my parents fought violently for hours. he would always get sad and down and i'd make a fool of myself to get him to smile, to distract him. 
 who comforted me, though? fucking nobody. that's why i get angry at people and pull away, even if it's not...their fault. my rational mind knows not everybody has the time nor the healthy mind to nurture me. i have to nurture my inner child myself; tell them that it's okay to feel, to exist, and that they deserve to be heard and loved and seen. that their existence is not a bother and that asking for help won't make others go away. but it's hard.",28Jul2019,3

130,"I'm writing this from my bed, at around half past midnight. I'm pretty sure that the distraction of writing this post is the only thing keeping me from having a panic attack right now, I might already be having one? 

Ever since I was little, I've been scared of being alone/being in the dark. Whenever I've been alone in a room, I've pretty much run out of it as quickly as I can, especially if it was dimly lit or in the dark.
Whenever I'm left alone in a room that's dark or a power cut happens and I'm suddenly blinded, an immediate and entirely debilitating panic hits me. Usually I'm paralyzed and can't motivate myself to move at all. 

Other times, I'd turn off the lights in my room (I usually sleep with a light on) but sometimes I try and face my fear. The only reason I don't turn it back on, is because I'm too scared to reach for the lightswitch. 

In the dark, if I hear footsteps or one of my three dogs in the hallway, I'll get waves of fear and I'll go deadstill and hold my breath, even though I can usually identify the person and there's no actual danger. I get terrified. 

Finally, I never feel alone. Ever. I always feel like there's some presence in the room with me. I either see it in the corner of my eye, as I'm walking. Like a sharp black movement that usually terrifies me, or like... as if someone is standing behind me or looking over my shoulder. 

It's sort of like that feeling when you're a little kid and you need a parent to close your wardrobe door or check it for monsters, but x10 and it never goes away.

Is this normal? Should I seek assistance? 
I'm not sure if this is directly affecting my anxiety disorder or if it's a symptom, or if I'm going mad.

Sometimes, my brain is full of negative thoughts, or mainly filled with them. It's always 100% full, because of my ADHD, but as long as it's not all bad it's ok. But sometimes all bad things stack up and I get this kind of nostalgia, a feeling that nothing will ever be really good or satisfying. I kind of predicted this happening, because I was on a happy time in my life, finally trying to see sense in what I was doing, but naturally happy times and sad times alternate switch. And I start thinking about stuff like my ADHD and how I'm still coming to terms with the diagnosis (I'm almost 20 and I've been diagnosed 2.5 months ago), how it will always affect me cause it's not a temporary illness but rather something I'll always have to deal with -not even a break -, and I think about everything I struggle with, and my future, and my struggle to feel normal, and money, and if I'll ever feel and be loved again...

I know focusing on the good things should help me, but it's really hard to do so. I'll speak with my therapist about this in particular. I also know that this is supposed to be normal, but it's hard. Fighting is hard. And this feeling is a bitch, and I hate it with all my guts.

He won't talk to me, but writes me novels of emails, accusing me of not caring about him to the point that I won't even read them anymore.

So just to disclose I've got avoidant personality disorder, some aspects of dependant personality disorder and depression. Long history of self harm and self destructive behaviour. I don't feel like I've disclosed all of the nuances to anybody because it feels like they never have the time to listen to it all, but I think those diagnoses are fair, though not as in depth as I think they could be.

  


I'm currently waiting on the confirmation dates for a cool group intensive CBT thing that apparently is super uncommon (in the UK on the NHS). I can't wait for it. Truly. I feel like I'm an extrovert that's been stuck living as an introvert and I can't wait to retrain my stupid brain with this special course. 

  


That said, in the meantime I've been on a low dose (75mg twice a day) of Pregabalin and it isn't enough. I knew from the start it wasn't enough but was kinda riding the wave of progress, thinking any progress was good enough. That was like 3 months ago. My GP will not give me an increased dose without the Psychiatrists approval, I think mainly because Pregabalin is a controlled substance. I've asked before and was told they'd contact the Psyche. Three weeks passed and nothing so I went back to my GP. They said they hadn't heard anything back either, so they tried to dump me on my third anti depressant. I tried it, went through absolute hell and quit it, like all three before that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was due to see the Psyche two weeks ago but they postponed for 5 weeks. Not the first time they've cancelled btw. So I've actually been experimenting to find the kind of dosage that would work for me, though this means I have to have skip days where I take nothing. My experimentation has shown that a 300mg dose twice a day would be good. Dunno if I should tell the Psyche that I did this when I next see them because I'm worried they will think I'm at risk of addiction. Oh also, I should say that I don't intend to be on meds forever. This is kinda intended to take me through to my intensive group CBT course, lest I lose my fucking mind before that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So to finally get to the point of this post, I'm struggling. I'm really fucking struggling. I'm only getting by on the prescribed dosage with skip days and alcohol. I've had Lorazepam twice before but I need a referral from a GP to get more (normally I can just get a new prescription through my GPs online service) because of the risk of addiction. I asked for more four weeks ago when I asked for an increased dose of Pregabalin and was given the most hand wavey bullshit response I've ever heard. And it was BECAUSE I was trying to hold my shit together. They didn't consider my anxiety to be bad enough to prescribe more. Nice, that. Kinda my fault, I didn't want to seem like I might be drug seeking so maybe I faked it too well.   


  


This weekend I had to drink to see a friend I've known and interacted with regularly for over a decade. I've got suicidal thoughts coming out the ears. I'm constantly debating doing more self harm.

My anxiety is actually keeping me meeting my work deadlines so yay, thanks for that at least? I dunno, I just feel like the front I'm putting on is too effective, for the GPs at least.

I am no monster and experienced small happy momments, but it's another type of happy. More innocent, more pure and very concentrated.

I woke up, and I did not feel tired, I did not feel like it's hard to stand up or question should I sleep more or wake up to go to work. Or if I can come in late.

Evening came and I fell asleep like it was no problem, with again was a surprise. 

After waking up like that for two more day's, I thought maybe life is not so bad, maybe it's turning towards good. 

Sadly, after that, I never had a day like that. And somehow, I stopped wishing for it, I am okay with being unhappy.

Does anyone else has this feeling? Does it has a name?",28Jul2019,8
142,"The title pretty much says it all, but I can’t help but to feel really lost in life right now and my anxiety gets worse and worse. Ever since I was in seventh grade, I knew I wanted to go to college for psychology. I knew I wanted to get my bachelors in psychology, get my masters in clinical psychology, and then become a therapist in private practice. I was also drawn to psychology because I wanted a deeper understanding of why humans think and behave the way we do, whether we’re influenced more by nature or nurture, and generally just more about the human condition. Once I got to college, this changed by my second year. I found and continuously discover that much of psychology is more subjective than objective, a lot of the field is theory based, and a lot of questions I have just don’t have an answer. My classes bore me to death and even if being a therapist sounds nice, I cannot possibly imagine sitting through grad school doing more of this shit. I’m heading into my last year of college next month and I’m freaking the fuck out because I’m about to earn a degree in a field that I want nothing to do with. I’m also getting an associates in political science, which is something that actually does interest me, but I feel like that degree is useless too. I’ve spent countless nights crying, working my ass off, and I’m going to be graduating with honors, but all for what? I’m waiting for me to have an “aha!” moment where I figure out what I want to do with my life, but it never comes. I have ideas of what I want to do, but nothing really sticks out to me or nothing seems like my “calling” the way I once felt with psychology I just don’t understand why everyone else seems to have their future figured out except for me and I’m scared.",28Jul2019,45
