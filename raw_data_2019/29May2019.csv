0,"During school, to my classmates I am quiet and serious, however always ready to help them, and I like to go play volley with my closest friends. A generally pleasant, yet not talkative, person.
However, at home, I am completely different. While on WhatsApp, if they object to something I posted, I usually reply with something that subtly insults them  and an argument starts. I often reply in even more insulting ways, and the other classmates usually join to help the guy. It keeps going until I get away with the last laugh before those administrators kick someone out. And afterwards, I think about how satisfying it would be to beat those guys up without getting in trouble for it. 
That happens with my mutual friends only, however. With my closer friends I am more respectful and tend to explain why I’m doing this rather than trying to argument then, even if they are helping the classmate which with the argument started.
I’m scared by this. Am I a manipulative narcissist or a pleasant, but quiet guy?",29May2019,0
1,"Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes in advance.

To start off I have a lack of morals values, buts it’s confusing. There’s a lot of things that are like wrong and that I know are wrong, but on the inside I don’t actually feel anything. For example: incest and bestiality. I know that those are wrong and I would never do it myself, but I don’t find myself to be disgusted. I don’t wanna get in too into detail about it, but I feel this way about a lot of different morals (and that includes a lot of serious ones that many of you guys would consider really terrible). However, I would never go out to do any of these things cause I know it’s wrong. I don’t think it’s me internally thinking about the laws either because I’m a strong believer that laws aren’t always constitutional. It’s like- I know that’s wrong. Why would someone do that? Just a different part of me doesn’t feel anything.
I also feel this with other people’s emotions. For example, my friend use to be suicidal and it got to the point where he was going to really go through with suicide. I talked him out of it and he decided to turn his life around. However, whenever I gave him advice or supported him I didn’t do it out of my love for him or anything. I helped him because it came natural to me. Like a “this is what I’m going to do and I know I’m going to do this” type of response. Another time when I talked my friend out of drugs I did it because it’s kinda like I’m suppose to do this. I don’t feel like I have to help them, but it’s not like I’m doing it out of love for them (I think). Like when a friend wants to vent or needs advice I’ll jump on it. I will say that I do want to help them. The best way I can put it is I don’t do it out of a place of concern.
I hate admitting this and I know (or at least feel) as if it’s wrong of me to experience such apathy. Especially cause I question how genuine I’m being whenever I do anything. When it comes down to it I can’t say I love anyone for sure. I can’t even say for sure how much I do/don’t care about my friends. Overall, I have a hard time identify emotions like love, care, compassion, sincerity, etc. 

I’m open up to any personal questions as well and I’m sorry if this is kinda confusing. I have a hard time explaining it since I’m not sure what I’m experiencing.",29May2019,2
2,I struggle with mental illness.  I’m writing because I am lonely and depressed right now.  My fiancé has cptsd and we weren’t jiving very well.  She was just miserable because of her illness and there was not much I could do(I joined a subreddit for her illness and read up about the symptoms and other posts to better understand and talked with her to better understand what I could do) and her anger was getting worse and so were her triggers.  On the bright side she is getting help now.  She moved in with her Dad temporarily to get treatment and help him work around his property.  I’m just missing her so much.  I have never loved a girlfriend/fiancé the way I love her.  I would do just about anything for her.  I’m holding onto hope that she will be able to heal and come back one day.  I have no idea how long she is going to be gone.  I talked to my family about it and it helped some.  Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience or advice.,29May2019,1
3,"I call them breakdowns, I cry but really hysterically and non-functionally. Anywhere from a couple times a week to a couple times a day. It's different from crying *because* of something, where I can speak and reason with myself. I don't know that I couldn't do anything, but I can't, I guess, convince myself to respond in real sentences (my speech is garbled with no real intent to say any particular thing). And I also get really snotty and slobbery and it's just sort of part of it. And I'm suicidal as I do, but I'm not motivated or able to really think it through, so I don't feel I'm actually at risk of committing suicide.
And when I'm not having a breakdown I'm moderately functional.
I live at home and go to community college, and it's sort of my last chance next year to ""get the college experience"" with a dorm and all that. 
I have this whole academic year to sort it out, but I'm terrified to be a terrible roommate. Even being in the same hall as me could be awful.
Can I just tell my roommate I have frequent breakdowns, and it's nothing unusual or to be concerned with? Are there usually good place to breakdown in a college campus?",29May2019,1
4,"Hi guys. I'm a 19 y/o girl diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, but I feel like there is something we are missing in my diagnosis because none of the treatment we have tried has helped and I feel as if Depression doesn't encompass all my symptoms, especially ones that have popped up recently. If it matters, I currently take Cymbalta and Lithium. 

Anyways, on to what happened. I have been suicidal for some time, drifting between active and passive. Recently it has been very active, to the point where I had a plan of how I would do it, but didn't know when. Well today I was driving home and I decided it was as good a time as any to go through with it. I drove to the beach near my house and up to the boat ramp, where I intended to drive straight into the ocean as fast as I could. I got to the edge, just touching the water and something stopped me. Not some big moment of hope where I realized life was worth living or anything like that. I just stopped and my brain changed directions. I parked the car and got out and I walked into the ocean fully clothed, about thigh deep. I don't know why I did it. I stood there and stared at the water for a while, and then got out and layed down on the pavement, looking at the sky. Still not really having any thoughts. Then I stood up, took off my shirt, and walked to a different part of beach. I walked into the water again and just sat down. After a while I started to walk back to my car and I lost all my energy and just layed down in the fetal position in the sand. As I got up, there was a flare of activity in my mind and I ran to my car. When I got there I started screaming at the top of my lungs. ""They can't find out I'm crazy"" ""They're going to lock me up"" etc. stuff like that. I texted my boyfriend after that telling him I needed to run away and that I was leaving tonight. He called me and I said the same kind of stuff about being locked up and being crazy. He kept trying to calm me down and tell me I was having delusions but I felt so sure that what I was saying made sense. I still do to a degree. 

This whole thing felt like I was having intrusive thoughts but instead of ignoring them, I just gave into them. Idk I have never experienced anything like this before. Was I just having delusions/paranoia or a psychotic episode Could anyone think of a reason for this to have started out of the blue? 

If this isn't the right place to post this question, let me know and I'll happily move it somewhere else. I just am very confused and scared and I want to understand what just happened to me.",29May2019,2
5,"I broke my ankle in the fall, have a ton of medical expenses, along with already having a history of mental illness, being out of work with broken ankle made me very depressed, was hospitalized for SI with a plan, got a ton of help, felt like a new person, and now I have to pay for all of that and I’m in the negatives of my bank account. 

What was all of that for. I don’t want to kill my self, but sometimes I just want to die. 

Work is hard. Pays like shit. Social worker. Trying to save lives while worrying about keeping my own. 

My parents and boyfriend help when they can, but it’s not enough and it’s not their fault.

6,I wonder if anyone relates to this feeling. Even when I don’t feel sad or am not going through a depressive episode the idea of dying gives me such intense relief. I often find myself fantasising about being killed so that I don’t have to do it myself because I know I wouldn’t at this point. I mentally write my suicide note so often pouring my heart out in my own head to everyone who I feel doesn’t understand me. It’s so exhausting just to exist even when I feel okay and it’s not as overwhelming at the moment I would just really feel so much joy if someone came and threatened to kill me.,29May2019,6
7,"I feel like my whole life is falling apart. All my friends are plotting against me and anything bad that happens is my fault. I feel like my thoughts control what happens around me, and if something bad happens, I blame myself. I feel like I have no privacy and nothing to myself anymore, and for a while, I convinced myself that other people lived inside my head. I need somewhere to go to talk to someone professionally, and I don't have a therapist anymore. Tomorrow is my last day of school so I can't go to that counselor. I've tried hinting to my mom to let me stay in a mental hospital (it's the only thing I thought could help then) and she didn't get it. I've asked her to take me to a doctor and she won't. I just desperately need help. I've never thought of committing suicide, but lately I feel like that's the only way to escape all of this. I have very bad OCD, so I get intrusive thoughts a lot. They've been much worse recently and I feel like I might accidentally act on them and hurt someone. I recently witnessed a car accident as well, where a few people died. I didn't see them, but I still think of it quite a lot. It's been 4 weeks and I still blame myself for it. Whenever I hear sirens or anything I am reminded of it and I have panic attacks. I still remember what song was playing during it and I can't listen to it anymore. I barely remember parts of the accident because I sort of dissociated during it. This combined with everything else going on in my life right now makes me feel like I'm going insane. I really need somewhere to go, so please someone help. I'm only 14 so I can't go anywhere myself, I live Ohio if that helps. I just really need someone to talk to who actually knows what I'm talking about. I know it doesn't seem like all this is bad but I can't take it anymore.",29May2019,2

10,"I went to my second session today, and it's just weird. That's not a bad thing, and I don't dislike it, but it's not at ***all*** what I expected.

Today we talked about the nature of the human consciousness and how that relates to biology or the compendium of experiences forming patterns. We talked about expressing the universe in binary terms. And how to describe the color purple to someone who is color blind (or rain to a Fremen). Oh, and whether or not our perception defines reality, which led into quantum mechanics.

I keep loving myself and I keep trying my very best in everything I stumble upon. I am really proud of myself. I’m not letting the younger, frail me down and I’m showing her that I did it, that I could have a new beginning, that I could learn from my past instead of living in it.

12,"Alright, people of Reddit I need some advice. I started taking medication for depression and anxiety about a year ago now. I was originally prescribed Celexa, which I swapped out for Cymbalta when I recognized Celexa had lowered my sex drive. Unfortunately, that issue has not improved on Cymbalta. While my depression and anxiety have greatly improved on medication, the lack of libido really sucks. I have three options: (1) stay the course, see if it improves, and try to spice things up in the bedroom on my own, (2) try another medication all together, or (3) add a dose of Wellbutrin to my daily dose of Cymbalta which my doctor says has helped others experiencing the same thing. I'm hesitant to add another medication to what I'm already taking because I'm only in my mid 20s and don't want to just keep adding medications as issues arise. On the other hand, my sexual identity is a huge part of who I am as a person and a partner. Has anyone had a similar experience positive/negative that may help me navigate this? Thanks!",29May2019,1

20,"YOU CAN SKIP THIS FIRST PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT, IT'S JUST SOME CONTEXT THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT
I do have a lot of diagnoses, I'm not sure how many of them are correct, but I know for sure that I have at least 3 of them because I am very obviously mentally not right. I know for sure I have OCD really bad, I obsess and panic and worry about things like crazy, do rituals and feel like bad things will happen to me if I don't follow what my OCD tells me to do, I mean I've basically been diagnosed with every anxiety disorder I know of. I have some sort of trauma but I don't like saying I have PTSD because I have PTSD for an unusual reason. I've been diagnosed with every form of depression I know of and I know I am depressed. And there's other stuff. I'm paranoid, very paranoid and I have irrational obsessions and fears (fears someone is watching me, or that supernatural forces are harassing me,  stuff like that). That's really more information than I need to include but I already typed it out so... Whatever.

Anyways, I try my best to be a nice guy, I don't insult people often, and I'm really only mean to people who are openly bigoted, hateful, and insulting towards others, but I really only come across those people on the internet.

I feel like a hypocrite because I always enforce positive vibes and genuinely want to be a good person. But I have sooo much violent hate inside of me. Sooo much violent anger. It's crazy.

I daydream about doing violent things, and am constantly having violent, furious fantasies

I act confident and am open about my insecurities, like my weight, I'm a heavy guy so I joke about it to make myself feel better. But on the inside I feel like shit. And I'm angry about it. 

I'm furious about the fact that I'm mentally ill, it's unfair for anyone to have mental illness that makes you want to die.

And I'm so full of hate for the world, and if there's a god then I'm pissed at him/her/them/it, and I have hate for people and the things they do. And a lot of it doesn't even pertain to me, like I'm angry at bigoted religious protesters I see on YouTube. And I know I shouldn't watch those things because it'll make me more angry but I need someone to put my hate on, and they're easy to hate.

I just don't know what to do with it all. I wish I'd just die.

I'm just venting basically, I know it's silly and stupid and might seem like ""attention seeking"" but it's not. I mean how'd I benefit from attention from people who have no idea who I am? Lol.

24,"I have shown signs of an anxiety disorder my whole life. My main triggers are sickness/death-related issues, horror movies, and any situation where possible health-related problems are shown. It stems from a fear that there is no afterlife. As you can probably gather from that, I’m far from suicidal.

I am on Zoloft (50mg, going up to 75mg) and have been for a while, but that’s the only treatment I’ve gotten.

My parents are generally good with hearing me out, especially my dad since he has the same disorder. However, these are some of the issues that have arisen:

• when going through a rough time my aunt pulled me aside during a family gathering and told me I was being inconsiderate towards my mother and need to think about how my illness negatively effects others more

• during this time I’d also frequently have a severe attack at 1-3am, where my mom would respond by yelling at me to go to sleep already and get over it

• when attempting therapy, my parents sent me to the same therapist my dad goes to. This made me uncomfortable, even knowing that they can’t tell him anything, but my parents refused to switch me and even now refuse to send me to anyone else (I stopped a year ago because she didn’t help much at all)

• my mom is more conscious about tv shows and movies that might trigger it, while my dad loves horror and documentaries on gruesome topics as well as Steven King novels. He frequently watches them with me in the room and refuses to turn it off when I ask. More than once this has ended with me leaving the room and trying to block out the noise

26,"Hey all,

I'm currently up at quarter to 4 with what I believe to be a dissociative episode / semi dissociated 

For a long time I have dealt with derealization / depersonalisation, I have a lot of early teenage trauma I haven't really spoken much about to therapists etc as I struggle opening up and never have had a constant enough therapist to get comfortable in that way

I don't have any mental health diagnosis, I have a family history of severe depression, and I have dealt with anxiety my whole life (I could probably get a diagnosis but growing up with a mentally ill sister has given me a lot of doubt about the extent of my mental health problems at times), I do believe in the past I have been pretty depressed, I have had a few incidences of self harm but nothing frequent

What I have suffered with, however, is dissociation. Sometimes it doesn't happen for months, but every now and then I'll have a day, or a few days where I just feel so disconnected with things. Or a night where I'll feel emotions so intensely, but I will also get extremely paranoid about things. I could be extremely happy etc and be listening to music and just thinking about things over and over and about how amazing life is, and then I could get super paranoid. Like tonight when I was in bed with my boyfriend, I was getting super paranoid in the dark that I would see something / it would play tricks on my vision, so I started crying, we chatted about it for a bit. I'm now trying to just chill out, I've taken a sleeping med and I'm watching some laid back YouTube vids to take my mind off. I've had times tho where I feel like I'm going crazy, in the past I used to be most creative at these times and most the time I'm up till early hours in the morning. I also find it weird to look in the mirror and everything feels detached. 

My issue is there's not much consistency with my mental health in this way, a lot of the time I'm actually okay, I struggle at times with feeling depressed and anxious but I don't experience these feelings for extended period of time.

Sometimes I feel it's almost like a more minor version of mania ?? But I'm almost certain I don't have bipolar or anything 

Is it possible to experience this occasionally and it not be anything serious ? Or have any reason? I feel a little bit concerned",29May2019,1

33,"my boyfriend has had depression for many years and receiving therapy with ups and downs, and I try to be supportive as much as I can (educating myself, what \[not\] to say or do etc., being sensitive to his reactions and changes) we have a great relationship, and his depression actually has not gotten in the way of our relationship much at all.

however, perhaps I'm overly sensitive not to hurt him, but I find it difficult to bring up difficult topics or sound negative in any way on stuff (for instance, my family or work stuff) even though he's not even remotely responsible. I feel a need to share my thoughts and worries with him but of course not wish to burden him with extra problems.

those who have went / are going through depression: how do others' negativity affect you if at all? does it make you feel worse? or do you feel fine because you also see things negatively? what or how did others' framing of issues helpful?

those who are / were supporting loved ones through depression: any relatable anecdotes and suggestions?

any feedback appreciated!! thank you!",29May2019,1

Hello, im Endless Chaos, this is an alt account I created to help get through some of my personal problems without my friends or people I know seeing my main account and telling people about this. I have been harassed for about everything that I ever say or do. It’s always me as the punchline in the joke, never anyone else usually. “Endless Chaos book! Endless Chaos Book!”, over and over again until they move on to some new word of the week. These people im talking to are my “friends”, despite everything. Although I do have some friends who don’t do that to me, but never talk to me that much. Im over weight and in High School, so it’s something to be expected I guess. I used to be one of those cry baby kids in elementary school and was always picked on for it, so maybe that caused something to do with my weight, im not completely sure in all honesty. I have had suicidal thoughts come and go throughout the years, but this year was the first time I actually got close to doing it, by drowning myself in a hot tub while nobody was looking. The reasons why will become more relevant later, but for now just know that I probably won’t attempt to get any help due to massive cost and unwillingness to talk to my family about my issues. For many years, I have plotted murders to school shootings to Terrorism. Most of it has been destroyed but there is just something in me that wants to create violence and havoc, to hear someone beg for mercy before you kill them. To preform a blood eagle on the person that raped and abused one of your friends and to put their mess of a corpse in front of the entire school to know what the fate of rapists should be. “Hahahahahahahahahaha edge lord”, I hear you say, but this has controlled me and has forced myself to confront my inner demons to try and fight back this urge. This continues with this girl, that I have loved and cherished as a friend for years now, that I suddenly developed strong feelings for her one day, despite vowing that I would never do so....These feelings quickly turned into rapist thoughts, I just wanted to force my self upon her and make her my mine. This had happened with other girls in the past, some of which the girl even knows I wanted to rape and even spoke to me about it. Ironically, my biggest fear with relationships, is that I will end up getting accused of rape one day out of the blue, she sorta reassured that most girls wouldn’t do that but the fear still remains. Continuing on, I have tried “ritual” masterbation to try and get the thoughts out of my head, but now every time I see a girl I find attractive, I just want to see her submitting to me or me forcing myself upon them. At this rate, im surprised I haven’t committed the horrible act yet, I have seen too many victims of rape be completely messed up and different afterward and maybe that’s what is preventing me. But at this rate, it’s no longer if I will do it, but rather when it will happen. If I ever did it tho, I will commit suicide afterward, no reason of living after such an act is committed, maybe God or Allah or something would forgive me, maybe not.

I just want help before this demon consumes me entirely, taking out everything I once knew and cherished. Thank you for reading this and please comment any advice, concerns, or questions and have a nice day.

P.S might be a while before I open up this account again since this is my alt account that was created for stuff like this...",29May2019,3
40,"I apologize for the wall. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My father is 65 years old retired pharmacist and has had bipolar and diabetes for as long as I can remember(I'm 24). These last few months have been particularly horrible. My family lives in Florida and had significant damage done to our house because of Hurricane Michael and we had to move. My dad takes meds for bipolar and because of the hurricane was left without a doctor to refill his prescription. We were able to get him to a hospital at his request and get him help and everything was fine. 

Around February, my dad contracted this guy to clean out our house so that we could eventually move back into it. We decided as a family that we didn't want to move back to the house as we were enjoying life in our new surroundings. My father decides to sell the house to the man he contracted to clean it and we were planning to buy a new house. We found a house and were getting all the paperwork done while my dad was going back and forth from our old house to were we live now in order to oversee the work being done to the house. He also told us that, in addition to selling him the house, he was becoming business partners with this guy. That sent up red flags to me and my mother but he assured us it was legit. Around that time we went to visit my grandmother and on the way back after having split up so he could go to Destin for his pharmacy licence, he got into a wreck by falling asleep at the wheel. We found out he wasn't taking his blood sugar levels or insulin and we made sure he started back up again. 

Fast forward to around the middle of April and, after we manage to get all our things that we could save out and into a storage unit, suddenly my father stops going to back to our old house. He says that he is tired of going back and forth and we agreed because he would be there for several days and then be home for a couple. So we told him that he didn't have to go anymore and that we would be happy to handle checking on the old house. Keep in mind the guy still hasn't payed us for the sale of the house at this point. 

Over the proceeding weeks it becomes apparent to my mother and I that something is wrong with my father. All he does is eat, sleep, and watch TV. He isn't helping us do anything in regards to getting ready to move into our new house. When we ask him why he isn't helping us, he became combative, telling us to leave him alone and if we didn't he would throw us out of the apartment we are living in. After about a week of pestering him he finally told us what was going on. He had given the guy he sold the house to over a hundred thousand dollars to rebuild the house, even though he doesn't have a builders license, just so he can flip the house. The guy used that money to buy land in his name only and buy himself a new truck. He also hired an attorney after doing all this to get his money back but not only did he not get a contract for his supposed business partnership with this guy, he did not get a contract to ensure the repayment of the money. We also found out he totaled his vehicle from the wreck. We had no money to pay the mortgage on the new house and we are forced to sell it.

My mother and I were shocked and upset but we honestly had no idea what to do to about it. He just shut down and stopped taking all his meds. The only thing we felt we could do was wait for him to snap out of his depression. The more we tried to talk to him the more verbally abusive he would get. It was a struggle to just get him to take a shower and we constantly tried to get him to voluntarily go to the hospital which he refused. Anytime we did something he didn't like he would insult us. 

It was making my mother physically ill to live with him so we packed our things and went to stay with my aunt for about a week. My aunt suggested we talk to and provided us with a lawyer. The lawyer provided us with options that we could use in order to get him help, including calling the local sheriff's office in order to have a wellness check done on him. He somehow managed to convince them he was fine. We also called APS to send someone out to see him but he refused them at the door. We returned to the apartment to try to appeal to him but he he told us he wasn't going to the hospital. When we pressed further he got angry and told us to leave him alone. We are honestly at our wits end and ready to just move out and away from him. We don't see a way out. I want to help but he doesn't want to help himself.

TL;DR my father has retreated into himself and refuses to get help. I don't see anyway to get through this except to remove myself and my mother from the situation permanently as soon as possible. Any help would be appreciated.",29May2019,1

48,"First off, I was diagnosed with MDD, dysthymia, DMDD, and ODD, though I think DMDD was a misdiagnosis. I'm saying that just in case this is a symptom of one of these.. if so, I wasn't aware of such.

Anyways, I seriously hate myself for my thoughts. They aren't even like.. violent thoughts or anything. They're simply so weird and farfetched and the logical side of my brain says that there's no way that this is true, but another part of me says that it's true.

Basically, I have this whole... ""lore"" for myself. It's really weird. I hate myself so much for it. I think I'm some extradimensional being, somewhat like a god. And I'm living on earth. People ask ""what kind of god would live on earth when they can easily get everything they have with their powers?"". My answer to that is, ""I"" got so lonely in the universe and ""I"" found life so boring that ""I"" decided to forsake my powers and live on earth...? It's seriously so weird. You're probably feeling uncomfortable by now. I'm feeling 100x that discomfort. Anyways. ""I"" did that and that's why ""I'm"" here. I also feel really gross saying these thoughts and connecting myself to this other version of me I made in my mind. That's why I'm putting ""I"" in quotation marks.

In a way, these thoughts have really helped me get through some tough times. Thinking things like ""don't worry, if I was able to control everything, it would all be artificial and I'd be lonely and bored again."" ""This is just how life is, and experiencing bad events is inevitable."" Things like that.

At the same time, I feel so disgusted with myself. Does a normal person have these thoughts about being some sort of godlike being? Does a normal person ever have a whole story to back up their self perception? I seriously, seriously hate myself so much for this.

Like I said, one part of me knows this is absolutely ridiculous and that I should wake up to reality. Yet, the other part of me would absolutely hate to let go of these thoughts because it gives me someone to actually *be*. Even if I tried to actively combat these thoughts with logic, I'd always come back to clinging to it again.

I guess to conclude would be asking if this was common in depression, or if it's something else. I really want to see a psychiatrist about this. Unfortunately, I live in the Catholic dominant country of the Philippines, so I don't think my claims to godhood would be taken into unbiased consideration (or at least as unbiased as it can get in an unhelpful system).

54,"I had been on Lexapro 20mg daily for 3 years for panic attacks. I have not had a single one in over 6 months and I was doing so well mentally. My psychiatrist said it was okay to go from 20 to 10, and in a few months could talk about getting off of it completely. Well I ran out a week ago and I thought it was as good a time as any to stop them. I didn't go to my psychiatrist since I had no transportation as my car got totaled a month ago, and I had no money to pay for the appointment and meds.

The side effects the first few days were the worst. The headaches, feeling sick, and the mood swings. The phsyical part has gone away, but the mood swings really kill me. I cry and get upset over silly things, and can get mad and frusterated over nothing. Well today my new car (new to me, its pretty used), blew a tire on the way home from work. I literally just bought the car yesterday. My dad came and helped with putting the spare on and we drove around town looking for a tire shop that was open, but it was 7pm and they were all closed. I was so upset because I didn't know how I was going to get to work tomorrow, and pay for the tires. I was so mad that I yelled at my dog, and just fell onto a chair and cried for about 5 mins, over a tire... Well this is probably my 6th or 7th time being stranded on the side of the road as it is my 4th car now and I am only 22. 

My boyfriend tends to irritate me easily when I am switching anti-depressant meds. When I went down from 20 to 10 I had similar side effects for a few weeks. I then blew up at him for no reason, and I hurt myself so much emotionally for doing that. He is such an amazing guy and he does not deserve this. I told him maybe he should break up with me because of my mood swings, yet he has stuck around. Does anyone know of any way to handle this? I feel like I am going insane. I can't keep myself from blowing up at my boyfriend or crying over things that don't matter. I really hope this only lasts a few more weeks like the last time I changed doses. If it doesn't, well idk what to do. I felt like I was ready to stop Lexapro, and I don't want to relapse. I never even had mood swings before I started the meds, just panic attacks.

56,"I'm posting this here, because I couldn't think of anywhere else suitable to. It is a self description of what is inside my head right now, something I need to speak about.

There is a storm in my head. In it flows multiple emotions and feelings. 
There is grief. Grief over the things that I've lost in recent years. Grief of the friends I've lost. Grief of the family that has been taken from me. 
There is anger. Anger at the world, and it's societies, which are killing our home, in which those people who have the ability to help the world and help it heal don't. Anger because many have lost so much humanity that they are concerned only with themselves.
There is hatred. Hatred for the man saw fit to rip my family to pieces simply for a power trip. Ripped my sisters from me. From each other. Hatred how he sees fit to portray himself as a God who can do no wrong to their young malleable minds.
There is sadness, sadness at the fact that my world is crumbling around me.
There is a sense of being lost, for I cannot become the steadfast protector that I wish to be for those that I care about.
There is a sense of loneliness, that stems from not being able to form a steady bond with people who could help to ease my mind. I am alone in this battle. 
And finally, there is rage, forming in the eye of this storm at the fact that I can do nothing to stop everything crumbling around me. I can only sit and watch it happen.

This storm has been growing for the better part of two years. Slowly, unnoticeable at first, and then like a small cloud, then growing and growing into a maelstrom. This is the kind of storm that brings with it only disaster. It is the type of storm that leaves nothing in its wake, instead leaving the landscape behind it unrecognizable. I feel immense fear, because this storm is becoming more difficult to contain. I can't hold much longer against it. It will break free, and I will no longer be in control. I will no longer be myself. I am scared that once this storm finally subsides, I will no longer see the world and the people around me as they are now.

57,"Hey guys, I really need to talk. My family has been toxic and dysfunctional for years. I vowed to never become it and be a loving and kind person. I went through multiple forms of abuse for years and forgave. I continue to love, and look at the best in them though it’shard. 

For years as a kid/adolescent I would beg and plead to see a therapist, to get help, that I was depressed because what happened to me I struggled very hard with (for me to say that, it’s extremely hard to do) from that, only to be told depression, anxiety, adhd etc. isn’t real and it’s in my head.   

I try to protect my family as best I can. I show them love I wish I had and believe everyone should feel love. No matter how much pain, despair, and raw hurt I have felt through my nearly 22 years of life I’d rather swallow my own pain and help them because I can’t stand to see them hurt. 

I realized tonight two close family members gaslight me constantly. I’m getting married next year, and they’re apathetic—though they say otherwise. After blowing my lid of holding things in, bawling my eyes out to them, and feeling hopeless I’m told “you make everything out to be a conspiracy theory—not everyone is out to get you.” And it breaks my heart. Anything I do is not only wrong but never happened and twisted. Hurtful words said, then sweet apologies later leaving me feeling confused, scared, thinking “am I crazy? What’s wrong with me? What if they’re right, am I not self aware enough?” And truly questioning myself and making me feel downright pitiful. I’ve heard terrible remarks for years that I’ve left behind and this reopens them. 

I love my family and I don’t want to see them hurt. So in the comments—please be constructive and kind. I just need advice, love, and support. Mental health is so important to me and I don’t want to hurt them or make them feel depressed because I know I can handle it and I’d rather take the pain of everyone. What do I do?

58,"I used to have a water cooler that supplied clean safe water. That has been broken a while though, so I've been drinking bottled water/gallon water jugs since. But right now I've been out since Saturday and cannot get more until next Saturday. I have nothing to drink but the tap water.

The problem is, I don't trust the tap water. I know logically that it's *probably* safe. The tap itself is dirty but not dangerously so. It's just gross. It tastes nasty. Some part of my brain is terrified that this water is going to make me sick. I'm repulsed by it. The combination of (illogical, I know) fear and my sensory issues taking offense to the taste makes me near unable to drink it.

I've been dehydrated for days. I wait until I'm have a headache and am so dizzy and nauseous I can't stand it anymore. Then I'll go to the sink and drink a few handfuls of water, until my disgust of it overrides my thirst. But it has been so long now that this strategy is no longer working, I forced down the water I could tonight and I still feel dehydrated to the point of sickness. But the idea of going to go drink more makes me feel like I'll puke.

I need to drink the water. I can't make myself drink the water. There is absolutely nothing else to drink now.

Any advice? How do I overcome this and drink the darn water already?",29May2019,1

68,"I think it all started to happen when my online girlfriend dumped me after being so loving to me for 2 years and known her for 5 years.. I was toxic and manipulative in the relationship but I wasn't aware..after the breakup, I think something happened, it's like reality became a lie, like nothing feels real anymore... Our entire relationship was only in games and movies and we were very attached to each other and suddenly everything changed and she felt nothing towards me and after I unawarely attempt to manipulate to get her feelings she just wanted me gone, but I still clinged to her and still wanted to be friends with her because we had so much memories, but she changed completely towards me, no longer friendly, and soon blocked me again when I was somehow disrespectful and discouraging and she said I'm just unpleasant to be around. This is the same girl, I talked alot to everyday, about all my problems and everything and thought she ever cared.. I had anger issues and I often argued with her. Somethings to note: I might have Asperger's, I never instinctively emphasize with people and only cared about what I want and I don't have a single friend irl currently. I am 20 years old, it's been 1 year and 6 months since I graduated high school, and I have just been at home after trying out college but later dropping out. After she dumped me, I remember becoming obsessed, unable to sleep, kept obsessing about why she did it and how, I still feel it right now. And just kept bothering her because I just couldn't believe we never loved each other and it was a toxic relationship after everything we did together. Right now, I m just in my room, feeling everyone in the world is against me after they get to know me. After she cut me off completely, I asked my online friends to help me that she also knows to contact her, and she got mad and raged at me to get lost. And I been talking about her to my friends and my feelings for days, I still feel the pain and trauma, it all happened too quickly..from my best friend and lover to the person that hates me to death and wants to see me burn. She was all I had and needed for so many years, and some other online friends that I barely talked to. And now everything changed and flipped. We met at this online game and it shutted down last year. Right now I just thinking how online friends who I known for years, arent even really friends at all. And when she left, it really traumatized me. And now I'm still at home, waiting to get a job or getting into college. And just very obsessed with her and how it all happened, the memories and what I know are very real, we know everything about each other. Right now what I'm suffering is, finding it hard to fall asleep, having to walk around alot. And feel like my obsession is slowly turning all online friends against me. It got worse today, when I saw how my friend that I thought was helping me, made it seem like I'm so desperate for her and that probably made her lose even more respect for me and completely scared of me. And it's like, I don't have a single friend anymore. I feel like female friends just make fun of you if you are a weak male. And I only had and known these ppl all these years. I'm scared of going offline, because I really don't have a single friend irl at all.. and I prefer texting too. I raged at that girl that made it seem I was desperate was ridiculing and she got mad and now hates me too I think. And everyone just hates me, everything I ever thought was good. I'm still at home, waiting for a job or college.

I keep having sudden bouts of feeling really, really detached from things I really shouldn't. Yesterday, for example, my sister went missing. We found her in the end and she's fine, but when we were looking for her and everyone else in the family was panicking and even crying, I felt so disconnected. I felt absolutely nothing. I went through what could possibly happen to her without feeling anything at all. I felt appalled, but not appalled--like I was watching myself be indifferent. Does that make sense?

I get like this when big things are happening and when small things are happening. I'm sometimes very emotional, so emotional that I feel like I'm going to completely explode and I can't handle it all. It's like all emotions most people deal with normally are multiplied by a thousand for me. If I'm interested in something, I'm obsessed. If I'm happy, I'm ecstatic and can't sit still. If I'm sad, I'm depressive and can't or won't get up and socialise with anyone at all. 

I don't know whether any of this is normal, but my friends and family have told me I react to things very strangely and extremely. I've been called explosive and overrractive, and I've been called uncaring. I just don't know. But sometimes I get so scared of myself. I don't really know who I am and I don't think I ever will.

The MacAnxiety Research Centre at McMaster University ([http://www.macanxiety.com/](http://www.macanxiety.com/)) is currently conducting a research survey to learn more about internet addiction within the general population. The survey will ask you about your internet use, as well as current OCD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and impulsivity symptoms. We are looking to collect information from both healthy (non-psychiatric) and psychiatric subjects, as we wish to determine if there are any associations between internet addiction and certain psychiatric disorders.

The research survey consists of online questionnaires that will take about 20-30 minutes to complete, and all responses will be completely anonymous and confidential. You are eligible to participate if you are over the age of 18. Please click on the link below to access the survey if you are interested in participating: [http://fhswedge2.mcmaster.ca/redcaps/macanx/surveys/?s=qxPwJv](http://fhswedge2.mcmaster.ca/redcaps/macanx/surveys/?s=qxPwJv)",29May2019,1

I've noticed in the past year or so that a lot of my depressive episodes start when I'm bored. There's something about the lack of stimulation that my brain latches on to and tries to fill with unhappiness. It'll *look* for a reason to be upset even if there really isn't one or overreact to something insignificant.

So I've started to pay attention to when I get bored and try not to let it last long enough for that to happen. Ideally this means working on any of my hobbies or getting stuff done around the house but more often I lack the motivation be productive.

Which brings me to my other conclusion: We need to learn how to forgive ourselves for not being productive. If scrolling through Reddit or binging Netflix is the only thing keeping you from spiraling, so be it.

28 years old male here. I have OCD like symptoms since almost 10 months, when I have began my Nofap jurney. I don't really have long strakes, just 8-10 days, longest one was 73 days.

In the past 10 months I had several OCD thoughts like fear from schizophernia, being pedophile, incest, being sexual abuser, catasthropization my foot fetish and so on.

Since I try to overcome my porn addiction I am inclined to binge eating sometimes(binge eating or not I don't know, I just eat more compared to myself, but it's normal to a for example 60-70kgs male,). Because of this I gained 3kgs in the past couple of months(I was always a skinny guy, so I am 58kg now from 55kg. Theoretically it is good, I always wanted to gain some weight, to look ""normal""). This +3kgs gained weight is pretty strange for me now beucase I always had 6 pack abs, and it's covered now.

In the last afternoon I looked at my stomach, and I said that ""Hm, it's coverd, so strange"". BUT, this tought started to develop an unbearable anxiety, fear from developing bulimia or anorexia. I's started just like a snap. I forgot all the other obessive thought and I am constantly checking my stomach a couple of times and I am monitoring myself what is my reaction to what I see in the mirror and I think that ""Oh God, please I don't want to develop an eating disorder. I don't hate my, body, right, I don't hate myself, I don't want to be something like that."" When I see a piece of food since then I am mentally checking how I am reacting that piece of food. I imagine that I am eating and monitoring what i feel about this, and say that ""Oh God, please I don't feel guilt when I see this piece of food, right?"", and I am anxious. I am checking a lot, checking the symptoms of anorexia and bulimia, treatment options, mortality, success stories, and so on.

I never fealt guild when I ate, I didn't want to vomit or something like that so I have never had a problem about eating. But in the past 2-3 days I feel a little fear about eating when I am hungry, because I fear it's obsessive.

What do you think, this is just another obsessive though just like the others or I am really developing an eating disorder? I have a huge fear about eating disorders right now, because I know that OCD and eating disorders often have a co-morbidity.",29May2019,1

I realized I’ve suppressed childhood physical, sexual and emotional abuse. I’m on medication, however, there is a looming heaviness I can’t shake off. I figured getting my hands on everything I can learn about PTSD and childhood abuse would help the healing process. It has and hasn’t.

I have a Fitbit and when I'm not reaching my goal of 10000 steps a day I'm freaking out, it's already at a point that I'm somewhat freaking out when I don't reach this goal by midday. I start thinking which way I should take to work to get more steps in before I even arrive there because I'm going to sit for a long time during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I also stumbled upon keto and intermittent fasting, guess what: I'm using another app to track my 16:8 fasting cycle which doesn't really help with my weight situation I guess (I'm super underweight. BMI: 16.5). Of course, I not only want to do the 16:8 every day but also beat it, meaning I'm aiming for 18:6 or 20:4.

&amp;#x200B;

The new fasting thing leads to another issue now that I'm super weak and I'm not able to work out. Yes, I'm freaking out about that, too. Also, I'm counting all my calories intake and check every single restaurant for a low calorie menu. I really study the city I'm going to next where I can find such a restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know why I'm letting these things take so much control over my life, should I just delete the apps and throw the Fitbit away? Is this just another phase of mine? I've had this Fitbit for two years now and things are going south just now. It was all fine until a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I fear I'll go overweight and into obesity again when I would get rid of them. I've been there a few years ago.

I just wonder if seeing a psychologist would actually help me or if I could solve it myself by going out of my comfort zone (which I am extremely terrified of because I have this obsession with sticking to the perception other people have of me, I call it “acting out of character”. Because of this I act differently around different people and go through moods of feeling more confident to talk and feeling like people just completely ignore me and don’t want me there). I feel like I can solve these problems pretty easily I just need to get over myself and be strong but on the other hand I don’t think I could hold everything in and do it alone. I spend about 60-70% of the day by myself because I feel like people don’t want me around. That’s why I want to be more charismatic and be able to talk to people because I do long for connections, people just think I prefer to be alone.

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but honestly I rarely ever feel guilt, and if I do, it's like a fleeting and suppressed emotion. Whenever I see those cry or become emotional, I feel more awkward than anything because I genuinely don't feel what they feel. I've been told I can be narcissistic and sadistic, but I just don't see that in me. I read about Covert narcissists and they sound like a bunch of whiny pussies. ASPD sounds confusing, because I do feel emotions, just not emotions that invoke empathy, unless its directed towards a VERY select few, and even then expressing it genuinely is almost impossible.

 I certainly used to be defenseless, weak, and abused in a chaotic household, but as I grew up, my empathy for others dwindled so much, I can barely feel bad for doing immoral things. If given the chance to hurt someone or have control over them, I'd take it with no hesitation. I like talking to certain people, but I don't like being emotionally vulnerable. I don't recall ever feeling genuine love, unless it's that desire to have someone wrapped up around you. I honestly desire control over others, and it's become unhealthy. I have a stable life with a loving family, but it just doesn't feel right.

117,"As a person who suffers from a wide array of mental issues such as severe anxiety, depression, OCD, intrusive thoughts, as well as mild bipolar-like symptoms, it's incredibly difficult for me to remain emotionally balanced 24/7 without a bit of help from prescription drugs to mellow me out.

Of course, when my mood unexpectedly shifts... so does my personality, and it's as if I'm like a completely different person. It's bizarre, really. For instance, I could be a genuinely nice guy who's sweet and friendly to the people that are around me. But as soon as my mood drastically dips, I become bitter and angry with a resting bitch face, and on top of hating the whole entire world with a relentless passion of vengeful hate. I noticed that during that mental state, my mind would uncontrollably revert back into the past and re-live all the painful moments/experiences where other people had hurt me. And I would start creating scenarios in my mind that involves me hurting them back out of vengeance... in a not-so-pretty way. Basically, going from 0 to 100 just like that. Luckily, the impressive part is that I would *never* act on those negative thoughts. In fact, I control it pretty well as long as nobody says or does anything that makes me explode without notice - which happened maybe once or twice before, and it was horrible. 

That said, as soon as the ""nice guy"" of my psyche comes back, I start feeling extremely guilty for how I was feeling about those people earlier, even though they were indeed shitty people that had hurt me.",29May2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

For a little bit of a background, I'm a 27 yo male. I've only had one relationship( I was in for four years) and a son whose life I've never really been in. I've always been a loner. I've had friends but only maybe one or two close ones at a time. I grew up with my holiness grandparents and I never really got to get out and do much. So I was never in a lot of social engagement when I was younger. 

&amp;#x200B;

7 years ago my life really wasn't that bad. I graduated High School with an almost full technical scholarship to a nearby community college. Nothing special but I was the first in my family to really get anything like that. At that time I had been going for about a year(went in straight out of high school). Me and my gf were moving into a place of our own after some idiotic mistakes on my part got us kicked out of the place we were living( she didn't have to leave because it was her parents house, but she chose to come with me.) But we were happy to be moving into a place of our own. After a couple months we let another person( a male friend of mine) move in with us because the place he was living was a pretty toxic environment. It wasn't that bad having him there and he had some pretty cool friends that would come and hang out. He never really had a job but he found other ways to make money. Everything was going pretty good for a couple months after that and all of the sudden it's like I just started going crazy. I started thinking that everyone was talking shit about me (my friends, family, etc.) I began to think that my gf was flirting with guys that would come and hang out. I became afraid to leave her alone with them( including my friend who was living with us). I would stay up until everyone else was gone or asleep, even getting to the point where I wouldn't go to sleep until she left for work, and I would only sleep while she was at work. We only had one car, and she would never drive it to work so that I would have it in case of emergencies. All she wanted me to do was pick her up, and I never could because I would always end up oversleeping. She stayed with me that entire time. She got pregnant and the first thing she wanted was an abortion. She said she was scared that we wouldn't be able to raise it. I was scared, and I didn't want an abortion. I loved this woman and I knew that we would have an amazing kid. So we decided to keep the baby. She left me a month after that.

 I know it was because I had become a disgusting, awful person to live with. I do wanna state that I'm not physically abusive or anything. For most of my life I've always been a timid shy type. I'm not very shy anymore but even though I hate to admit it I still do have a pretty timid nature. Idk why I'm this way. I'm not small or anything. I'm a pretty decent size and I could definitely hold my own in a fight. But I hate confrontation so much and when it comes down to where I have to confront someone my anxiety starts racing out of control.  

So she left me and after that everyone else did to. Or I pushed them away. Idk. That fucked me up pretty hard. This was the first time in my life I had ever been by myself. Alone, sometimes not seeing anyone for days. I just withdrew and I stopped going out and doing anything. My ex would still come by and see me occasionally and update me on everything, but I couldn't ever bring myself to get up and go do anything. I missed the ultrasound where we found out we were having a baby boy. My family still tried to help me but I was in such a bad mental state everything just kept getting worse and worse. The guy who had been staying with us moved in with a woman who he had started dating. I would go over there and hang out just so I wasn't lonely. Then one day while I was over there, his gf started asking about my sons name and how we had picked the middle name (My ex had named him and then told me what she named him.) So that's what I told her and then she got a smirk on her face, looked me dead in the eyes, and said you know that's (my friend's) middle name too. She laughed after she said that. Both he and her had known about the name for a little while, I guess my ex had told him. So this led into thoughts that she had been cheating with him. I confronted her but I could never believe when she told me that she hadn't.  I started drinking, and smoking weed and cigarettes excessively. On occasion I would take pain pills and nerve pills. I was there when my son was born, and I tried to be there every weekend when he had to stay in the hospital because he was born premature(Still with the overwhelming thought that he might not be my son always in the back of my head). My anxiety from being alone all the time and my social anxiety from wanting to try and hang out with someone but fearing rejection would make my heart start racing and chest would feel like it was gonna explode and I would just get up and start pacing all over my house. I got a job thanks to my ex but I wasted my money on stupid shit. I didn't pay my bills for rent or power or water and racked up hundreds of dollars worth of debt. I eventually got kicked out. I was basically on and off homeless after this. I still tried to see my son but eventually stopped almost all contact after an argument between me and my ex. I still had delusions that we would get back together and be a family. And I guess in my mind if I couldn't have it all then I didn't want any of it. 

I forgot to say anything about my college. I was still trying to go to college through all of this but the eventually I got to where I wouldn't wake up for classes and I missed half of my semester and they took away my scholarship( I was on fasfa too which I also lost. I had to have it to pay for my books which the scholarship didn't cover). 

I spent almost two years after this living in my practically abandoned childhood home with no water and no power. My family still owned the place but no one had lived there in a while. My aunt would bring me non perishable food and drinks so I didn't starve. I was still finding ways to drink and smoke and take pills despite being jobless. I started stealing from family to buy. I eventually got arrested for having pills. After that I got clean and was able to clear my head up. A couple months after that I went to court and soon after got a job to pay for the court fees. 

I had that job for a long time. I payed off my fees, my debt from my bills, got a car, made some good friends, got an apartment with one. I fixed my life and then some. My ex even came back and let me see my son for a time(she didn't really want too but she said that he wanted to meet me.) It was great. I had just gotten my car so I had a way to go over there and see him. I didn't really know what to do or how he wanted me to be but I tried. But it was weird too. It was like a had social anxiety being around my son. No matter how hard I tried I really just didn't know how to be. My car messed up so I lost my  way of going over there and my ex believed it was more of me just not wanting to go see him. She told me to stop coming by so I didn't disappoint him. I can't blame her for how she felt. It hurt a lot though. I was really happy getting to see him again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here lately I'm starting to realize that fixing my life never really fixed my mental problems. I've been dead on the inside for a long time. I can laugh at times and I can cut up with people but everything just feels meaningless and empty. I have a couple of friends, but I still have extreme social anxiety. Not in places like work but in social environments where you're actually trying to meet people and make friends. My anxiety still kicks in all the time and my mind races a lot. Sometimes  I can't sleep in my own room because my anxiety kicks in so much I start to feel sick being in there.Recently, I've started again feeling my friends are talking negatively about me. I know they aren't but I can't get my self to believe that. It's like somethings constantly fighting me to think they hate me. I've wanted to be in a relationship for a long time but for some reason I can't initiate anything. I've literally gotten so short of breath I couldn't even talk. It's weird because I can still get sex if I want it. I've had sex plenty of times in the past few years. But I don't want that. I want to be with someone. But for some reason I cant stop from projecting myself being with someone rather than just letting things go and see how it ends up. I end up making myself depressed and upset and ill more than likely stop talking to that person so I don't have to deal with my own fear of rejection. It's a real asshole move because a lot of these people have actually been pretty good friends and don't deserve for me to treat them that way. But then I'm dead on the inside and I don't really care. But then I do care. And then I don't care. 

Dealing with these problems and my brain being the way it is is really hard. I'm always tired. I barely wanna go out and do anything still to this day. I only really do it because I have to. I go to work because I have to to live. And constant thought's of suicide. I'm not going to kill myself. I'm scared of dying especially in any really painful way. But living is so fucking hard. Constantly having to deal with this feeling. Being this way. Knowing that I'm the reason that I'm not happy. And being scared that I'm gonna be this way for the rest of my life.

127,"(TLDR; I'm looking for ways to convince the woman I love that she can trust that my mental health is now stable after long-term extensive help.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a pretty tough situation. I met a woman when I was 20, we dated for several years, planned on getting married, but I became jealous, controlling, etc. It was clearly due to my own mental health issues, but I never sought help. Years later, I was diagnosed with MDD, anxiety, and PTSD (post-military service). All of this led, obviously, to the demise of the relationship. We spent a few years without speaking, I got married and had two kids, she had relationships of her own, etc.

After those few years were up and I got divorced (and her boyfriend passed away), we started talking again. We were living on opposite coasts at the time,  but we went back into a rhythm of speaking constantly (2-3 hours per day) as friends at first, then flirting, etc. Soon after, I asked her to meet me in Vegas and we ended up spending a weekend together there. For the following year plus, we traveled back and forth across the country to see each other until I moved to her coast (which I was planning to do regardless). We never locked into a relationship, but were dating/hooking up/etc. starting with the Vegas weekend. 

Soon after moving to her coast, I had a series of rough months regarding a lot of stuff (some involving her, others not). It was at this point that some suicidal ideations came to the surface around the time it felt like our relationship was being strained too far by my issues. When they reached their peak, she helped me by getting me to the hospital and I went further under care of some doctors and such that i saw on a monthly/weekly basis. 

That was last August and basically felt like it was the end of any chances we had. I didn't want to put any more of my problems on her since she was in the last months of a very intense graduate program, etc. However, somehow, back in November we started 'dating' again, spending at least 2-3 nights per week together, going out constantly, talking constantly, etc. However, she refuses to commit now because of the fear of getting into another situation like I put her in too many times before. This leaves a door open to her being able to be with other guys, and not settle into a real relationship with me.

Now, 9 months later, with near-constant dating/hooking up/etc., she still doesn't think she can trust me well enough to get into a legitimate committed relationship with me. 

Clearly this is logical and safe on her part. My past bullshit has caused her a lot of pain, but she has told me many times, even as of late, that she's always been in love me, that she thinks we're soulmates, etc., etc. However, that's not always enough when one person is so taxing on the other.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can actually show her that I'm better, stable, healthy, and trustworthy? I know, in my heart, that I can handle the situation now and I never felt that before. Are there any books anyone's read, or any websites/links/articles? She and I both know that we are ""meant to be,"" but she does not want to allow herself to fall into something that may hurt her.

The thing is that small point formed on the screen  is not at all noticeable and he is saying he'll put it for sale.. buy new one. he put it up on a website where we can sell used goods.. and he asks my mom money so that he could  buy a new one( he did not buy it before with his money) and later said that I had to buy it with my money coz he says all of this happened coz i did not cover it ..and he says that he had taken care of it very well.. and now he feels like he has failed and he went on to the extent that he says all things go wrong in his life, and he should have been dead in his teens itself. 

This is not a new thing.. he has been suffering from depression from 18 or 19, he is 25 now. He faced bullying when he was in college and was depressed, he was into therapy for a while and got out of it , he refuses to take therapy now.. says he is ok. and the thing that has happened today  is a very small thing and he went to the extent to think of killing himself because of this. He was ok in the noon.. talked normally to me . And he  became like this again in the eve.. and he doesn't share anything with anyone other than my mother. Its not only about venting.. he just talks to her everyday and discusses things. The thing is , he doesn't open up to anyone except my mother.. though he seem to get along with other people, he just acts till they leave and its the same story again. In these depressive periods, he says all of his depressive thoughts to my mother and she gets depressed even more. Idk this is really depressing.. and my family is dysfunctional.. my dad does not give emotional support to my mom, my bro.

Today, I told my dad several times to talk to him coz he is really depressive, and the way the conversation went.. Its not the way things should go and I can only say .. my dad is emotionally absent in this family which worries me.. coz my bro and mom need help now. My dad is narcissistic and i dont think he can help people and just keeps on feeding his ego no matter what happens. I can't help in this case other than supporting my mother with some words coz my bro is very angry on me .. this is too much to take. 

Honestly, he too has seen a lot of shit in his life as far as i saw.  i don't know what to do.. how to keep things normal? how to make him know its a very small thing? Any help is really welcome, thanks.",29May2019,1
129,"Hi. I am suffering from very severe depression and body dysmorphic disorder. I’d say that on average I go swimming in the ocean for an hour maybe four times a week. I usually throw on my fins and goggles and swim around the kelp forests looking at fish and seals. Typically after that I am much more present in the world. My thoughts aren’t totally dominated by obsessions and intrusive thoughts. It like I just exist contently. Does anybody else notice this effect? I understand that the vast majority of people don’t have access to the ocean. I’m sorry if that makes this post a bit exclusive. I imagine that time spent in nature has a similar effect, which I have noticed. But there is just something about the ocean and being underwater that changed me. Thoughts?",29May2019,1
130,"Hello everyone,  
I am not sure where to ask or where to get probably some sort of advice. My name is Jordan and I am a 22-year-old guy working as an IT Technician (recently changed my work from being a B2B salesman). And I feel that there is something not right about me.  
For a few years, I have been feeling different. Noticed that a few months ago. I mean like life does not have to bring me anything more to my life? Can't describe my feelings correctly. This year I changed my work because I felt really exhausted. I was two and a half months unemployed because I wanted to rest for a little bit. Now I am working my first month as an IT Technician and I enjoy my new work most of the time.  
I am not sure if I feel unhappy or empty or idk... I have a really great girlfriend, a job I enjoy, not much money but the amount I am okay with. I have almost everything I could wish of owning. And still, even though that I feel empty?   
I left my hobbies because I stopped enjoying them, and even when I tried to find something I enjoy, I failed. I tried many new things but nothing came to my heart as music and graphic design which I stopped making/learning.  
Not sure if I should visit some kind of therapist, or I am just done with life in my 20s? That would be sad. I have goals to achieve but I am just not motivated to do so. I just want to lay on bed, dring or smoke weed, and listen to music. Because when I am drunk or high, I do not think about anything, just about the present. Not past, nor future.  
What do you think about that kind of situation? What would you do? I don't want to be just waiting for my death...   
\+ money really can't bring you happiness, I have bought almost everything I wanted. Felt happy for a few days about new thing. Then it's just a thing. Nothing more...",29May2019,1
131,"I have diagnosed ADHD but no official diagnoses of other mental health issues. 

I’ve been increasingly more and more anxious ever since i was a teenager (now mid 20’s) and i’m now so bad I struggle to leave the house to do routine tasks like grocery shopping or even fun activities. I just put everything off hour to hour until its too late and i’m off the hook for the day. 

I have also developed this like loss of motivation that feels like laziness. I have hundreds of “to-do’s” around the house that never get done and i put off dishes and laundry etc until I’m at a point where it HAS to be done. 

I feel like if i had my way i would do literally nothing all day and just lay on the couch and think while scrolling around on the internet; and i barely accomplish more than that on a typical day unless i can successfully force myself into doing it somehow. 

Both these problems extend to my work as well, i can barely sleep on sunday nights because i’m so anxious and i dread having to do anything. 

I used to enjoy work and i felt like i had more energy and accomplishing tasks wasn’t so difficult generally but now i feel overwhelmed all the time by even the simplest things. 

Its bad enough that I’ve turned down jobs (freelance) just because I’m too anxious in that moment. 

I only start to feel my actual mood shift negatively when i get frustrated with myself because it feels so dumb that I’m lazy and afraid of nothing. 

I tried a few sessions with a CBT therapist without knowing what that was and i’ve tried going to a psychiatrist but i’m really uncomfortable with SSRI’s. I feel like i’m so in my own head and that my subconscious voice is so “know-it-all”-ish that i have doubts therapy could even help me but obviously that cant be true right? 

I really just don’t even know what to do or where to start and it makes it even more difficult that talking to people and doing even simple things is a nightmare because of my symptoms. 

Any advice or help would be so appreciated, i feel trapped in my own head. 

I live in Westchester, New York if anyone has any recommendations in the area or in NYC.",29May2019,1
132,"I'm 25 years old, and I've always been some that struggled to fall asleep or stay asleep. At some point I used a sleeping medication: Restoril, for a month and it helped a bit but then I stopped cause of the side effects (depression worsened). Then I switched to more natural stuff like melatonin and it never worked for me unless I drank like 6 of the 5-10mg pills and even then I would always wake up, then I stopped too Unisom which didn't work, and switched to Benadryl because I also suffer from allergies and it was like killing two birds with one stone. I had to stop that as well because I kept needing to increase my doses to be able to sleep and I realized my body became dependent on them because when I tried to stop, my body had withdrawals. So I stopped that as well. I used to LOVE sleeping, even if I had to take 7 Benadryl, NyQuil and whatever. It was an escape for me. I went the entire day with one thing mind: this will all be over soon and I can get home and sleep &amp; be in peace. Even though the sleep was still shitty (continuously waking up) I loved it so much, it just gave me a break from reality. 

Now I'm back to not using anything, im struggling really bad. I quit my job 7 months ago to focus on my last two semesters of school, so I don't need to do anything. Today I finally fell asleep around 9am and woke up fully at 2. Here I am laying down thinking: sleeping is such a fucking chore. When I woke up I said: finally, now I can just get up and start my day instead of trying to keep myself asleep and when it's time to sleep and I sit there and role in bed, I get so frustrated and cry because it's so annoying to sleep. I wish I can go days without sleeping and I can but I always break into hives when I am sleep deprived and it's annoying to have to itch all the time. 

I hate sleeping, it's a chore, it's no longer an escape to me. It feels like I haven't had a good night sleep in years, I genuinely can't remember the last time I ever did. Sleeping is so artificial to me, I either use medication to help me sleep or I don't sleep at all. 

This is all so depressing, I just want to scream at the top of my lungs at my frustration. I don't know if anyone can just talk to me, maybe give me advice, thoughts, etc. I'd really appreciate it.",29May2019,2
133,Hello everyone my step grand father is causing extreme emotional distress. In my family my mother has to take blood pressure medication Becuase of him. He is 76 years old and he makes my family’s life a living hell. He has been checked out for everymental disorder possible from 10+ doctors and they all say he is perfectly sane and healthy. He is constantly shitting himself and he does this on purpose to make my mother touch his private area. But she won’t she makes him bathe himself. It’s gotten so bad that we made him a tub outside so ours is not full of shit. The next thing is that we caught him looking at my 9 year old sister he tried to put his fingers inside of her and so much more he stole rubbers and he tried to tell her what they were for. We called the police and since he lives here they can’t do anything about it. Unless they see it and when this happened we got him a tiny house to live in. He also try’s to burn that house down so we took his cigarettes and lighters. Then he tried to hit my mother and the police would not help but they sent him to a hospital and they said he is just fine. But he lied to the ambulance people and we were investigated for elder abuse. The case worker finally listened to us after she closed the case so she could not help. And no old people home will take him. Not even the lock down facility will. And we called the state and the military resources desk they could not help. “My family is a military family so if that helps please let me know I’m not trying to brag” but this has gone on for the past 3 years and 4 of my family members are deploying the same time I am. And my mother does not need this stress while all of us are gone. He has done a lot more I could really write 3 full page books on what he has done but no mental place will take him and no resthomes will either and my mother is almost ready for a divorce from my step dad because of him he is really that bad he has ruined the family and their marriage. Their marriage was amazing they never really argued or anything. But since he came in it has been nothing but fighting and just bullshit. Please help me I know this is the wrong thread but there really is no other place for this. I have talked to my ncos and they are no help and my dads ncos and co can’t help. This is my plea to you guys please help.,29May2019,1

""No matter how many great people I meet I just don't feel like I belong with any of them.

It happens at work, university, sports clubs, everywhere. They all disappear eventually. I just don't see the point in interacting with people any more because it always ends in disappointment and pain. Maybe I should become a total recluse and just shut myself off from the world""

139,"I won’t get into the nitty gritty details, but essentially I read an article (https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation, written by Anne Borges) that seemingly articulated many of the sentiments I felt towards my personal relationship with mental health.

She mentions some of the ways she “stays afloat” while combatting passive, yet depleting suicidal ideation. I feel as if this sentiment can apply to spectrum of mental health in general — we likely all have some routines and practices in place for intentional preservation. 

I thought about this topic while reflecting the other day. I’ve discerned my relationship with my mental health is likely healthy, while my mental health is not always good. 

I’ve recognized some of the practices associated with my ‘flourishing’ states (being outside, with people, cooking, reading) —although these ‘devices’ do not necessarily negate any impending mood change.

Moreover, I’ve also realized that self-reflection (in the form of writing or audio clips) partially alleviates these low periods. The downside is that I usually cannot bring myself to a point to clear introspection when I am sad, as it usually ends up in an aggressive, sappy self-critique (*any tips on how to transcend this obstacle?)

I’m wondering what ‘floatation devices’ other people have manifested for the sole purpose of emotional/mental/psychological preservation?",29May2019,1

So a frequent suggestion is journaling. I've dealt with Anxiety, Depression/Suicidal, ADHD for a majority of my life. So yes, I've heard it all the time.

Occasionally I will journal or ""brain dump"" and it feels okay. I can just never make myself sit down and do it. I don't feel bad when I do it- as in I don't cry and I don't feel raw when I do it. It just feels like a chore and I don't enjoy it. It immediately becomes something I  feel like I HAVE to do. I've tried nice pens. I'm not artistic and trying to make a beautiful artistic BuJo fills me with anxiety.

When I sit down to write, the thought of poring over anything I feel/think in depth just feels exhausting. I don't ""get into the zone,"" and I feel so aware of each moment passing by.

145,"In short, I have never once asked my friends to help me with my depression in any way. I have never brought it up in person, even once. They've known me for 4 years. I am 24.

I have had a Finsta (private venting instagram account) since high school, like anyone else under the age of 25 who doesn't live under a rock. I post how sad I am that I keep running out of money (I work THREE minimum wage jobs and spend NO MONEY, yet still in tons of debt and medical bills for my kidney disorder). I post how sad I am that my grandma is sick. I post how sad I am that my dad b\*at me as a kid and is now calling me trying to get XYZ from me and how mean he is to my poor mom back home. Normal venting things. Overshare? Sure. But that's my generations compensation for health care/therapy being severely out of reach (my jobs don't provide it). But I NEVER ask my friends for anything, never once had a talk to them about it or texted them for help/a shoulder to cry on, never went to their house to vent, I just vent to all my followers.

So, they know I tried to k\*ll myself when I was 19 (I am 24) because I posted about it before and made my entire senior film about it in school. So it's crazy to me that they think it's chill to make fun of me being depressed. I'm never sad when we hang out, which is once in a blue moon now. I always try to tell jokes and do whatever they want (even drugs I don't wanna do) if it will make them be nice to me. I just want people to be nice to me. So I am completely kind back. Like best behavior constantly.

Again, I never ONCE have texted them, ever asked anything of them. Heck, one time my house was being fumigated and I didn't even ask to sleep over their houses cause I'm so paranoid about being a burden. I slept in the house and had to go to the hospital the next day. So I am VERY adamant on not being a burden.

And yet, today, they called me ""emo and a downer,"" something I haven't heard since 2009. But they do it in a really mean, deliberate way. They also called me salty and annoying, because I posted about the r\*pe a\*bortion ban being wrong on twitter. They started making fun of me today saying I was ""the sad one in the group who doesn't do anything."" They definitely know my history with s\*\*ual a\*sault based on posts. Calling me ""emo"" is a loaded code. (I am trying to illustrate the connection here).

Well, now I have to go to the hospital next week because I am so sick of being dunked on. I was on a 6 month waiting list for therapy but I'm just gonna have to go see the soonest psychiatrist at an actual hospital because I'm so desperate. There are plenty of people who are politically loud. Plenty of people who hate their dads. Plenty of people with semi annoying twitters and finstas. But I don't believe I deserve this kind of treatment because I NEVER bring it up to them or talk to them. I am nothing but nice in real life. I'm serious. I am my own worst critic and I would be aware of that.

Nobody else on earth has an issue with my twitter or finsta. It is this small group of 7 people who are all pretty nerdy and sensitive. Seriously, I have never heard this complaint before. I went to a real college and they all went to art school and never had to take psychology/sociology/any real classes, that is my only guess for why they don't understand what any of this means.

I know it takes a certain empathetic person to understand the nature of depression, and people who have lived sheltered lives think depression is a code girls with blue hair use on Twitter to get likes.

Long story short: I am depressed and my current job just makes it worse. I am currently on the waiting list for therapy and have my ups and downs, but overall, I cannot get my life in order. My job drains me (but not on a burn out level) and when I get home, I have no energy to do basic stuff. I have a written diagnosis and I think about going to my doctor and ask for one or two weeks of sick leave. I would try to have a schedule for those days and have someone checking me so I do not just waste away but actually try to take positive steps forward.

I already took ""mental health days"", but I always found an alternative reason to tell my coworkers. My problem is, that if I take more than just one or two days, there will be questions. Unfortunately, the people I have to work closest with, are quite judgemental and constantly gossiping, so I was wondering - can you think of a better reason to take some time off? Should I just pretend to take my holidays for ""family matters"" (a gathering or something) and tell my team leader to not tell them the truth about my leave? I do not know whether they would actually notice that the days do not add up, because I am planning to leave the company this summer anyways.

I've been in a chronic depression for a long time despite being on all this stuff.  I was looking to streamline my regimen and finding a new drug that might help.  I had NO IDEA he would do the following:

In ONE FELL SWOOP:  Stop taking Wellbutrin, Prozac and Cytomel, and start taking Trintellix, Lamictal, and Rexulti.  
ALL AT ONCE:  No tapering off my current drugs and no testing one new drug out before adding another.  Just quit 3 things and start 3 new things all in the same day.  In addition, he wanted me to start taking my Clonazapam every day, twice a day, instead of ""as needed.""  

I had mentioned to him that I was concerned about weight gain and he gave little attention to that.  I looked everything up and especially with Rexulti, weight gain can be common and bad.

But, HOW would I know what is doing what?  If something has an intolerable side effect, how would I know which drug is causing it if I started them all at once?  How about withdrawal from what I'm on?

154,"Ok. I totally forgot about this incident until my mother threw it in my face again last night in front of my sisters. 

So, April 30, 2019 I started exam week. Two major exam that day. My dumb -ass knew about the exam schedule 2 weeks in advance. Did I use those two week wisely? I freaking tried but couldn't focus and concentrate to save a life. I tried and tried and couldn't get shit done. The weekend before exam week I just couldn't bring myself to sit behind my laptop. Therefore, Monday I finally found myself in my books and stayed up all night to study as much as I could manage the night before. 

Tuesday came; I walked in both my exam with the grace of God and completed them. Thankfully. 

Lucky for me Wednesday was a holiday so I slept that entire day away and I was okay with that. My following exam would be Friday anyways. 

Thursday I had a shit day at work and tried to study for my final exam as much as I could during work time. (Lies. My brain was overwhelm from my procrastination and I couldn't function properly by Thursday morning.) I'm at work kicking myself for not preparing better for my exam. Over thinking every life choice I ever had. My mind spiraling out of its skull. My eyes feeling like it was being stabbed from within. I know it was all in my head. I just couldn't cope mentally anymore. 

I finally get home Thursday knowing I had to stay up and study for my final exam, but my mind and body wasn't on that same knowledge. So I find myself laying on my bed dizzy and can't sleep even though I'm praying to God to punch me out for a while. Then there comes my mother at my goddamn door. Screaming at the top of her motherfucking lungs about the goddamn dishes that they used that day. Bear in mind, I was a work all day and hadn't eaten at home Wednesday and eat something until I was at work Thursday morning; so I didn't know she or they had cook or whatever. Anyhow, the dishes is my responsibility regardless if I eat at home or not with that being said my mother is at my bedroom door screaming about the dishes.

This was it. My brain couldn't function anymore and I just started crying. Not just tear drops. No. I'm talking about an Ugly-Cry cry. Crying like I haven't cried in a decade, which admittedly it was a while since I cried one of those cries. As a result I may have been due for an Ugly cry like that. Just wish it wasn't in front of the ""Mother of the Year"". 

Now she's not only screaming at me for the dishes, but also because I just started crying. Now she's asking why I'm crying. So I told her I can't function right now. I'm having a break down. I'm stressing and overwhelmed, and I just can't right now. 

Why in the world did I think it would be a good fucking idea to tell this bitch the truth !!! Why Good God! Why!! 

Her response : Well mental break down or whatever get up and do these fucking dishes. And she said that so calm and collected like it was nothing to say that. 

That sends me into another hissy-fit of tears, and I just spend the rest of the night in my room trying to gather my little brain. ( I did wash the dishes, mind you, at like 5 AM though) 

Now to last night. Ahh, but we ain't down with that incident yet. Thought we were, right? It happened from like 4 weeks ago after all. But no. 

Last night I came home from work and I'm in my room disassociating and trying to get away from the day I had. Then I hear one of my sisters in the kitchen and from the way she's making so much noise I know the kitchen is a mess. She starts complain how I need to wash the dishes. 

And that's when Mother Dearest waltz down the stairs and says : You can't ask her because the last time I did she was having a mental whatever. Maybe she's having one right now that's why the kitchen is so dirty.",29May2019,1

156,"i start crying and get intrusive thoughts such as ""go overdose"" and ""slit your wrists right here and now"" but mostly the overdosing thing and i'm honestly concerned that i will eventually act on those thoughts because there is nothing out there for me anyway,, or that is how it feels like",29May2019,1
157,"I’m disabled and homeless, I can’t work, I never had my drivers license and my credit score is so low I’m not allowed to do payment plans on anything.  I’m just planning on committing suicide.  I can’t even walk so how the fuck do they expect me to get out of this hole?  I’m pretty sure I’m either going to shoot myself or cut myself.  I can’t take this hell called life anymore.",29May2019,1
158,"I'm really sorry if I come out as selfish, I really really am, but I just don't know what to do anymore. I get hospitalised twice for mental health problems and all I'm told is that it's just my autism with a lack of discipline. You can check my post history for more insight.

I just look at everyone else(irl I mean) and think how nice it must be being validated, and how I feel like a ""proper"" diagnosis is the only way I can feel like a valued human being. I feel so censored, I cannot talk about anything otherwise I will be punished, and even when I do talk it all goes against my psychopathic favour.

But at the same time, I feel like I'm being nothing but a selfish fraud, and deserve death for being a mockery towards people with diagnosed illnesses, trying to fit in and ""look cool"", I just wish I was dead just thinking about how evil I can be.",29May2019,1
159,"What I’m struggling with is the fact that he killed himself, though I don’t really know the family too well. It’s also very difficult for me to think about going back home knowing a guy had hung himself in the house. Apparently he had turned music on and the whole situation just really affect me a lot.

When I get home I’ll move out to study, but I’ll probably stay home for a year first. Right know I’m feeling very sad and anxious. I have no idea how I’m supposed to live there knowing someone died such tragic death there. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",29May2019,1

161,"So I've had about 27 ect sessions done, abused dxm alot, adderall even more, been drinking alot, done lsd, lots of weed, shrooms, many different meds for depression. I act different from others, I'm quiet low confidence. I've also been feeling slow for a long time like info takes longer to process. My vision is alittle blurry, hard time focusing, and slurred speech. Do you guys think I have some sort of brain damage? I haven't been on meds for over 1 year",29May2019,1
162,For the past few months I have been feeling a bit odd when trying to sleep. I feel anxious and stress about sleeping because I overthink what if someone breaks in and hurts my family or myself (most common thought) or just overthink my personal problems in general . I also try to sleep but feel like I am falling into my bed (not in a good way) or I close my eyes and my brain feels spaced out or like I like to describe it “going up a tunnel” or my mind is floating away. I know this seems odd but would just like to know if anyone has ever felt this way. I have not been diagnosed of anxiety or depression but at night I overthink and have racing thoughts. Thank you..,29May2019,1
163,"I constantly feel lost and disconnected from the world around me...almost a sense of being on auto-pilot most of the time. I feel very detached from my emotions, if that makes sense. I've acknowledged that I have a problem for awhile, but I struggle with how to ""snap"" out of it. This has impacted nearly aspect of life. 

It's not a bad quality for work because I can put my nose to the grindstone and not really think about anything else, but turning this mindset off has been nearly impossible. B/c I can't turn it off and I get terrible anxiety when I am not working or doing something 'productive', I'm constantly not 'in the moment'. It's not just work either at times, it could be a family problem or something else that absolutely consumes my mind. 

This has impacted my relationships with friends, girlfriends, family, etc. I just don't feel present enough to form meaningful relationships where I can truly appreciate company and often have terrible anxiety about exposing myself. The only time i can be in the moment is drinking...which I know is not a good solution and has caused a lot more harm than good. 

Generally speaking, it's crushed my self-esteem even though my rational side knows I have so much to be proud of. 

I have spoken to people about it, but I can't seem to break the cycle. I am sure others have dealt with this and I was curious how you overcame it?",29May2019,3

165,"I have bad anxiety, depression and PTSD. I dont get much sleep most nights. I get tired easily. My mom has been recovering from shoulder surgery. Its been three weeks since her surgery and she's recovering well but its taking a toll on me because Im trying to take care of her and I can hardly take care of myself on top of it.

As I said I dont get much sleep and yesterday I had to be up really early running on about 90 minutes of sleep. I have to help my mom out of the recliner almost every morning (She cant sleep in a bed right now and the recliner handle is on the side of her bad arm. Had to help her get dressed. I had to take my dog to get groomed since my mom cant drive right now. Then I had to take my mom to physical therapy and then pick up the dog from the groomers.

Woke up early this morning to get her up completely exhausted. Running on empty I helped her get dressed. Ive been helping her today with laundry and today she keeps criticizing me telling me Im doing her laundry wrong. She asked me to go down and flip the laundry a few minutes ago. I asked her nicely to give me five minutes and she gave me a bunch of attitude. She criticized how I was washing the dishes wrong. She has me fix her coffee everyday and she says that Im fixing it wrong. She is perfectly able to fix her own coffee. She has done it before when I forgot to fix it the night before.

Long story short Im tired. Im exhausted. I dont feel good and she knows it as Ive told her. Im now 2 alcoholic drinks in and I dont normally drink. (I know I shouldnt but Im about to go off on her). I cant take it anymore. I know she needs help but I cant take it anymore. She is taking advantage of me having me do things for her that she can still do. Im about 5 seconds from breaking down and losing it.",29May2019,1
166,"I started my first post-college job a few months ago. The company is great overall, but my department is really stressful. I've been diagnosed with GAD and major depression since adolescence, and I feel like it's making my ""normal adult stress"" so much worse. 

I cant enjoy activities outside of work because I've always got a sick feeling thinking about everything I have to do or what I might mess up on next. Any advice that might help me not focus on work so much once I'm done for the day/weekend?",29May2019,3
