I feel like I'm broken beyond repair, and my parents are disappointed that I struggle with school, this just makes my depression worse along side my suicidal thoughts.  And I cant help but think that this is all my fault, that I am a disappointment and a failure. Thanks for reading it feels good to get this out of my head.",10Sep2019,1

2,"My friend literally calls me dumb ass all the fucking time and it's getting annoying, he's been treating me like shit ever since high school but now that we're rooming together in college he's gotten 100x worse and I only roomed with him because we've been really good friends since 5th grade and thought it would be fun. The other day I was acting like he normally does and got REALLY pissed at me and said I was just doing it to be mean and he does it sarcastically... honestly talk about hypocrisy. Anyways he calls me dumbass A LOT in high school and even more so in college, and now its finally getting to me and I'm afraid it's going to affect me academically because psychology... I dont know how else to explain it. I'm probably just being a bitch but it's just fucking annoying and when I do it to him he flips out.",10Sep2019,1

4,"I hate daily medication. It always ends up being something I stress over and then I end up avoiding it. 

I start out strong but then I miss days, and completely stop after a while. 

Doing the same daily thing drives up my anxiety, which makes my depression worse, which makes me hate my meds and feel like they're not working.

Is there any injections, patches, long lasting pills? I'm more likely to stress less about something that happens once a week or once a month. 

I don't care if it's an injection, an implant, a patch, a pill, anything. Does it exist at all?",10Sep2019,1
5,"Throwaway because of reasons. 
Last week I finally managed to gather the strength to go and speak to my doctor and he diagnosed me with depression and panic attacks. 
Don’t get me wrong, my situation isn’t as bad as some other guys on this sub, I’m just in a bad place mentally speaking.. 
I’m so glad that I had the courage to do this. 
I’m gonna see my psychiatrist next 2-3 month since I can’t afford it at the moment. 
I wish I could speak to my mom about this  but she will probably take it badly. 
Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to share this with someone since I don’t have anyone to speak about it",10Sep2019,3
6,"So I was just discharged from a 2 week stay at a mental ward after I made statements to crisis counselors over the phone (for the sake of privacy, I will omit what it was that I said) and now that I’m stable after a 6 month psychotic break (March 6th - September 9th, 2019, from my 21st birthday up until the day I was discharged from the hospital), I urgently need your advice right now. My counselor talked about housing me in this “in-patient apartment place” called “Transition”, and I just got finished talking to my friend over the phone about moving there, and he told me that the place was a homeless shelter and NOT a halfway house as my counselor was terming it. I’ve got until Friday to see my counselor about this place that they’re sending me to, and if it really is a homeless shelter, then the people at the facility must think that I’m a lost cause. The only thing that happens at homeless shelters is that everything belonging to you gets stolen and you get jumped, raped and/or possibly killed. I don’t want my family to be paying funeral bills if they kill me or for me to be facing down a federal grand jury indictment right now if I kill them, so I need your advice. If I have to go homeless, then so be it. But I must at least live within walking distance from a psychiatric facility to get my meds, because from what I’ve heard, that’s not a pleasant experience. But at least I’ll still live on my own and receive my own disability money in that case. And if I die on the streets, at least I’ll die a free man. Is there anyone who knows what this place is all about? It’s in South Carolina. The homeless shelter my friend told me about is actually in Columbia. I need more information about this place before I leave to see her. If it is, I’ll reject it right in front of her and opt for the streets, I don’t care what she says or does. If not, and it is an in-patient apartment place, then I’ll be cool. Anyone with info?",10Sep2019,1
7,"Hi,

I am struggling quite a bit with brain fog/delirium and was hoping maybe someone else had experienced this or has some advice. 

Problem: I have pretty bad brain fog and lack of focus on a daily basis, but what really scares me is what happens at night. Usually around 6-7pm I feel completely unable to focus visually or mentally. I'm unable to read as well, focus on TV, or listen to conversations or respond intelligently. I feel like I slightly lose my grip on reality. In the morning I feel better, back to the general brain fog. Some days are worse than others but it's pretty consistent.

Background: I'm a 28M, in good physical shape. Work out, eat tons of veggies etc. In the past I have felt pretty intelligent and highly functioning. I have a masters degree in a technical field and used to be able to focus on my work pretty well. I used to love to read at night and hang out with friends. Now I feel unable to do these things.

I have been on antidepressants for most of my life but over the past year  changed a few things. I have taken 300mg Wellbutrin XL since I was about 14 and have taken 20mg cymbalta for the past 2 years. 

However, I tapered off my meds fully for the first time last November, then decided to go back on them on March. Then I had a lapse in insurance and went off them again until about 2 months ago.  I also take magnesium, multivitamin, B12, Algae oil omegas, and occasionally lions mane mushroom extract.

I have also been a fairly regular medical marijuana user for about 3 years; about weekly or biweekly for thc and was daily using cbd a few months ago but stopped for a new job. Pretty much never drink, maybe one drink a month average.

I am not sure what caused this, I have only felt it for around 6 months at this point but it is getting worse and it scares me. How can I get back to the way I was?

Thank you. I sincerely hope you all find peace if you are struggling too.",10Sep2019,3

I'm feeling really distressed about all of this, and I'm not sure what to do or how to feel.

I can totally understand that, but I also feel empty not knowing about my childhood. I want to know why I'm so broken, what the fuck happened that messed me up the way I am?

9,"Not quite sure where I'd should post this but hey whatever. 

I never really felt bad for any kinda human in a unfortunate situation. So for instance, when a UNICEF commercial comes on and starts showing kids from 3rd world countries starving, dying etc. I never feel bad for them. Not 1 bit, not gonna lie I even blame the parents sometimes. Kinda like ""Why did you have these little shits if you can't afford to take care of them"" type attitude. I know its cruel but I'm being honest. But god forbid one of those ASPCA commercials come on I start to break down. I feel so bad for those animals, they did nothing and get abused and neglected so much. I guess its maybe because most animals are loyal as hell no matter what and humans are certainly not idk. But is somehting generally wrong with me for thinking this way or am I just a ""different breed""",10Sep2019,1
10,"I'm half drunk playing polybridge right now (it's fun. I highly recommend it) after stressing up and reaching my boiling point. I'm feeling really guilty, as I just told my long distance girlfriend (who is having a rebound from anorexia merely a month after one of her close friends sexually assaulted her) that I need a break, because every day since then I'd wake up to try and support her, but she hasn't done much to try and get better from this situation, nor have I gotten support from her myself. Yes, I know I'm the asshole here, and yes, I know this situation is delicate as fuck and takes time to work through, but it's been taking a toll on me. 

As this is going on, my mum is bed bound due to her arthritis, which despite many different approaches to treating it, is getting worse. She can no longer stand up by herself, and it's tearing my heart up. Not only mine though. My dad is in shambles due to this situation. He's pushing through, but he's also at his limit. To make matters worse, we cannot afford treatment any longer (at least for now), as my country's economy is on fucking fire. We have to be careful about what food we buy to get to the end of the month, even with both my parents and I working to keep food on our table and a roof over our heads. 

To add to this, every year like fucking clockwork someone in my family gets cancer. Three years ago, it was my mum. Breast cancer due to a biological treatment gone wrong. Two years ago (more like a year and a half), my grandpa went from being perfectly healthy to dead in just under two months from his diagnosis of stage IV Leukemia, and a very aggressive one. As my entire family was grieving this loss, six months later, and therefore one year ago, my 10 year old little cousin got diagnosed with leukemia herself. Luckily she's in remission, and actually got in the newspaper because while she couldn't attend school, she started baking cookies and donating half the proceeds to charity. At least there was some hope during this situation. While this was going on, my dad got a malignant tumor on his left leg, but the biopsy caused his immune system to recognise it as a threat and took it out. 

This brings us to the events from the past couple of months. After I've been dealt so many blows, I felt I was getting better, and so was my girlfriend. That's when, on July 12th, as I was giving one of the most stressful finals in my career, my girlfriend was getting sexually assaulted by a guy she had been friends with for over five years in a tent during a campfire sleepover thing, which I couldn't attend for obvious reasons. 

Now, roughly a month and a half later, I crumbled. Every day it would be waking up to see why she was upset, then go have breakfast, not before having to literally lift my mum up from the bed so she could limp to the toilet, mind you, then sit down at the table, only to see the news and realize that all the money I've been saving up is now worth less than the day before. This is before leaving my house to freeze my ass off waiting for the bus to go to a university I can barely afford, and probably won't be able to for long enough to finish my career, only to be in charge of investigating a series of thefts going on in my classroom, as I was one of the few people who couldn't have committed a theft, as I had to travel half the planet away to go check up on my recently sexually assaulted girlfriend as all the robbing was going on, only to find out when I returned home that my mum had actually stopped paying for her medical insurance so I could go visit my girlfriend, because we couldn't afford her medications *and* the trip. 

Also, I know the guy who sexually assaulted my girlfriend. I needed my dad, my best friend, and a psychiatrist to talk me out of tracking him down and murdering him when I was visiting my girlfriend. 

Now, I might start therapy this month, depending on the schedule of the psychologist I contacted. If not, I'll keep searching, but my question is simple. How the fuck am I supposed to tell my new psychologist all this?",10Sep2019,1
11,"I recently started going back to public school (was home schooled because of horrible anxiety and depression problems) and recently i haven't had that many issues with depression but my anxiety is starting to get worse and worse. before it was like a  70/30 split, 70 being depression and the 30 being anxiety but now its 90/10 with 90 now being anxiety. it feels like my body is physically being attacked from it and i don't know how to react. 

&amp;#x200B;

i wake up in the morning and my body just doesn't want to move, all i feel is panic and shakiness.  it gets so bad that i have to bite myself to stop shaking. after that my body stops shaking but internally i feel it get worse like a cold prickly shaky feeling underneath my skin, sharp pains in my fingers and shoulders and my breathing becomes rapid. if it continues further than i start to mummer and groan until i fall back asleep. 

mentally while i'm shaking my mind starts to think of stuff that it knows makes me panic like crazy. things that make me distressed/angry/depressed or devoid of hope. it no longer feels like i have anxiety and i deal with it. Now it feels like i'm fighting something that knows me more than i know myself and abuses that. some days are better than others but sometimes it gets to be to much.

18,"In my last few years of high school, I had practically every minute of the day planned out. I had cohesive notes on every subject I was taking, multiple personal projects, etc. No external pressure, I was just that fucking motivated, and sincerely excited about academia.

A few years down the line, I've never even tried to find a job, I'm leeching off my parents, and I'm doing well if I end up studying for half an hour a day. More of my assignments are late than not. I've lost all passion for my degree, but I've already changed it once, and I don't know what I'd change it to this time, or if that would help. I don't work on my hobbies with any consistency, I barely play video games or watch movies or read books because it seems like too much effort to focus on something for any length of time. I spend hours in a fog lurking on social media. Every so often, I *will* find something I'm interested in, obsess over it with painful intensity for a few weeks, and then lose enthusiasm again. I'm still going to the gym regularly out of sheer force of habit, but there are a lot more days where I'm dreading it. I just can't stand having any responsibilities anymore.

Not too mention that I'm too socially anxious to hold a proper conversation *anonymously* over the *internet.*

I've been talking to a counsellor-type person for maybe a year now, and I recently got referred to a psychologist(-in-training -- it's cheaper than a fully certified one), but whenever I try to explain it, it just feels like they either don't quite get what I'm saying or don't think it's a problem, and I never get any concrete suggestions for how to improve. It's possible this is Just Part of Growing Up, but if so, I can't imagine how any adult finds life worth living.

I have plenty of ideas for things I'd like to pick up and ways of improving my life, but limited energy, and I can never pick one out and stick to it. I feel utterly directionless, and I know, I'm young, I'm supposed to be, I have plenty of time to figure it out etc. I just... well, no overbearing health issues at the moment, but why should I assume that?

20,"It's been a long run and by long I mean since I was old enough to know what was around me. I'm currently 29 and after a long stint with drugs and alcohol to cope with suicide and depression. I'm coming to a solid brick wall.

I made a firm choice back in April to get sober, which for me means absolutely no drugs or alcohol. I've mildly been using all my life. I began drinking at 8 and drugs around 10-11 to cope with my depression and childhood trauma. This was exasperated a few years ago by a really bad domestic situation, and I began using drugs I normally wouldn't. About three years ago for some odd reason and I have yet to answer this myself. But I began abusing heroin in molly in dangerous amounts. Since I was 26 I've attempted suicide 8 times and lost track of overdoses. This was no normal addiction it was stupidly heavy and out of control.

My first known instance of knowing I was suicidal was when I was around 7. When I first said I wanted to die. Every year that passes this thought gets worse, and when I was 15 I started having nightmares of my own death. I still do which is half the reason I don't sleep for days at a time and if I do sleep it's for short periods of time.

I'm the last I think I was 19 when I first came out about my horrible depression. It wasn't recieved well by my family and I was judged pretty bad for it. The way I took it was as it was an inconvenience and still seems that way too this day. As a child I wasn't allowed to express emotions in a healthy way without getting screamed at or beat. My mom in particular always said ""Kids can't be sad or angry, because they are children and not adults"" so that's been stuck with me all my life. It continues to be inside me although I'm in a terrible amount of emotional pain currently.

With my stress getting incredibly overwhelming by the day and with lack of sleep. Some of my medication I went back on doesn't work. Like I said I decided to get sober about 6 months ago and continue to be that way everyday. It's getting harder to manage without drugs or alcohol, but it's a choice of not wanting to die that way. Since I had to do a run through of my life just over a month ago for some legal trouble. I haven't left my room, besides to get my suboxone from the pharmacy. I kinda have to or else I'm sick beyond belief. I tend to sit in my room away from even my roommate, and cry most of the day in silence. I'm starting to realize I'm incredibly broken and know I need an extraordinary amount of help. Despite knowing this I just don't know how to ask anyone around me for help or even someone to talk to and just have them listen.

I've tried this recently with my mother when I began speaking to her about a year ago. But I have to put this relationship or whatever the fuck it is with her aside. Last time I saw her she just reminded me for three hours of everything I've done wrong in my life and that I need to take accountability for what I've done. Which I feel I have addressing not only my mental health but also my addiction I haven't told absolutely anyone about. Everytime I try and speak to her about things that got me here. She just judges me and tells me I'm complaining or making excuses.

Long story short cause I can go on quite a bit about this. I'm incredibly sad because I don't have words to explain how bad it actually is. I cry easily most of the day and night, and isolate myself from absolutely everyone. I'm coming to realize being on disability for not only my mental health, but also an injury that occurred over the past year. That all my dreams in life, such as starting a family, owning a nice small home and maybe a used car. Is just never going to happen, which breaks my heart into million and millions of little pieces that I can't seem to put back together. My issues are so bad right now. My roommates cat spends all his time with me because I can even tell he knows. Yet he's currently the only thing with my tear filled eyes, to bring even a small smile to my face when he looks at me with acceptance.

I'm so very lost and I don't know how much longer this can go on for 😥",10Sep2019,2
21,"Not sure if this is a mental illness or not but I’ve been devoid of most emotions since I was a kid. I think something that’s stopped me from ever cutting myself or seriously considering suicide is that I just don’t feel sad anymore. I don’t feel lonely or a need for affection. I’m never happy either, it’s sort of a state of dullness. I find the most awkward moments for me are when someone shows affections. I’ve been pretending to feel excitement during Christmas and my birthday since I was 10 and my acting is really bad. It’s weird to have to say you love somebody back when you don’t feel anything. Of course you love them because they’re useful and you have a good relationship with them and you’re family, but there’s no feelings. I even tried watching drone strike videos to try to see if I felt anything and nothing. I’ve never cried at a funeral of my relatives. At a very young age I was the first in my family to stop going to church. Not because I didn’t believe, I was too young to understand that part. It was merely a mixture of feeling uncomfortable in a community and wanting to spend the time being alone. Recently some people have commented on my lack of empathy and I’m starting to realize how strange it is. If it costs me something I won’t help someone. Of course I’d help a old woman that’s fallen down because that’s the socially acceptable thing to do but I’d never give away food or expend effort in helping someone. Is there anything I can do to get better? I feel like I’ve wasted my entire childhood and teen years being an emotionless robot.",10Sep2019,1
22,"Not sure if this is where to post this.  I think what I've learned is, if your friend whom you think or know is seriously depressed asks you to hang out, do it.  Doesn't matter if you're tired or if you think you've hung out enough lately. My long time best friend came to visit me from up north and told me about his depression.  I hung out with him, went on long drives, helped him speak his mind.  Out of nowhere he asks if I'd go way up north to his place to help him move back down here.  I knew he wouldn't have asked if it wasn't important.  I don't regret taking the time off work and spending all that time driving.  Those are all good memories now.  I was spending time with him every evening for the last couple weeks.  Yesterday evening I hung out with him, then later that night after I'd been home for a while he texted to ask if I wanted to go back out for a long drive and chill.  I didn't get the text because I was playing video games.  Then he walks into my house unannounced, which he tends to do, and asks me in person if I wanted to go for a long drive.  I explained I think I'll stay home tonight and hang out with my girlfriend the next morning, as I hadn't spent any time with her for weeks.  He grabbed a couple scoops of ice cream and said he'd see more tomorrow.  Now it is tomorrow and at this point in time I believe he is dead.  Not confirmed but there was a suicide note, and with the stuff he talked to me about I'm pretty certain he has gone through with it.  I was riding with the police going to his usual camping spots in the woods but no sign of him.  I think what I've learned is I shouldn't have assumed I could read him, and think he was getting better.  If he asks to hang out like that it's because he can't handle all the thoughts inside his head and he needs a distraction or someone to talk to.  And if you're someone who is depressed or suicidal and reading this just know it's always better to tell someone how you feel than keep it inside.  I didn't go with my buddy last night because I thought he was doing better.  He should have told me he was actually on the edge.  I shouldn't have turned him down, but at the same time, to anyone who is suicidal, never do this to your friend.  Never just go off and do it.  If other people are fighting to keep you here, don't just end it and let them blame themselves for the rest of their lives wondering what they could have done.  That is all.",10Sep2019,1

24,"I’ve suspected it for a while now, but I haven’t ever brought it up because I don’t want to sound like one of those people who thinks they have OCD because they like things to be organized. But I have some weird tendencies that I’ve never thought of as OCD until someone told me that they might be. To list a few:

I often have to touch something a bunch of times with the right amount of pressure in the right places before it feels right. Otherwise it feels like an itch that needs to be scratched, just on another object. It becomes a big problem when I end up accidentally tapping stuff on my phone or pressing buttons in the car. It makes driving... difficult in many aspects.

When I’m playing a game where I have to select a character (mostly Overwatch), I have to select and unselect the same character a bunch of times before it feels right. Again, it feels like scratching an itch.

If something touches one side of my body, I have to touch the same place on the other side of my body or else I won’t feel right. I’ve had this one the longest, and I’ve gotten really good at doing it subtly and habitually to the point where I don’t have to consciously think about it. Sometimes people notice though.

I want to make it clear that I’m not trying to ask for a self proclaimed reddit doctor’s diagnoses. I mostly typed that all out because I can never talk about it in real life because I’m always worried that people will think I’m making it up for attention. And that’s kind of the issue with seeing if I can be diagnosed. First of all, I don’t even know who to go to, and secondly, I have no clue how to bring it up. And when I do, I’m really worried that whoever I have to tell will think I’m making it up or something. Can anyone offer me any advice on what to do?

I Dont know what my issue is and im scared that there isnt one. For almost 4 years ive been dealing with suicidal thoughts and have never seen anyone about it. I get “episodes” where i just feel like the world went from full color to black and white. Its like a switch flips in my mind and i just become sad and withdrawn. I dont have control over when it happens and it always comes with intense urges to self harm and commit suicide. I Feel drawn to these things like i feel drawn to water when im thirsty.

I have posted these before and they always help me figure out what i need to do but im just not sure anymore, im running out of options. All that helps me right now is staying busy. If im not biking then im running, if im not running im studying and if im not studying im sleeping. Nothing has made me feel happy for a long time and i dont know what i to do about it.

I have tried exercise and i have hobbies. I am a precussionist for my school band and i do judo three nights a week. I dont do these for enjoyment anymore its just so that i can stay away from my own thoughts.

Im starting to think its my own fault for just feeling sad all the time. If im not high im not able to act like the person everyone around me thinks i am. I feel like im watching my own life through someone elses eyes and its completely surreal.

I want to know what the hell is wrong with me but im to scared that theres nothing wrong at all, that my state of mind is superficial and its my own fault for being so sad all the time. There is some rational part of me that knows i need help but another part of me is telling me that its my fault and i have to solve the problem by myself.

I do have a appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist in December but im terrified that im going to be told there is nothing wrong with me. I dont understand why everyone around me gets to be happy and i dont. Did i do something that made me less deserving then them? Is it even worth the effort im trying to but in to better myself?",10Sep2019,1
26,A few days ago my roommate (who is in the spectrum and has had a tough life) told me that for the past 6 or so years he’s had a dream of violently sexually assaulting a girl who’s face he’s never seen along with stories of how he’s yelled at his mom and chased her with a knife. I feel like I should tell someone as he might be a danger to himself or others but I don’t know who or how I should tell them please help me out with this I don’t want to hurt him or get him in trouble and I know depending on who I tell that will happen so how do I help him?,10Sep2019,1
27,"I went to see a psychologist within my insurance (very low copay), and the psychologist seemed very nice. But that meeting got nothing done, except for one thing. 

I was told that my problem wasn't very clear, and in order to make it clear, I should go do a long series of tests/evaluations (about 8 hours of them). While my insurance probably covers some of it, I was told that the out-of-pocket portion could cost somewhere between $2000-$3000. 

Is that seriously what I have to go through? I mean, aside from the cost, I can understand why it should be done, but how common is this? Should I shaft myself financially and go through with it, or see yet another person? I've had 2 attempts so far.",10Sep2019,2

For example, the washing machine broke and now I cannot get my clothes out of it and the wheel on my vacuum cleaner has mysteriously gone missing, making it impossible to use. I know that it is probably just my mind's perspective telling me it's more than just bad luck...but how much bad luck can one person have",10Sep2019,1

30,"I've been married for a year and a half, we have a son that is almost one now. Today she tells me she no longer has feelings for me and says it has been this way since the birth of our son; she also said this in regards about our son. She wants to keep trying, but says she told me so I am not blind sided if in the future when she tells me to leave her. I love her with all my heart and soul, but am I to stay with her for in a year's time she tells me to go or in 5 or 10. She tells me she doesn't want me to leave but also doesn't have feelings for me anymore. 

A little about me. In my early life I struggled with depression. It may sound silly, but I have always had a longing for an attachment to someone and them to me. It troubled me for years. Always the same scenario with relationships I've been in; they always end up leaving. I came to terms with everything and dragged myself out of depression years ago. Then I met her and everything just worked between us. We dated for about a year, we were both in the Military at the time. We had plans to get married and she then got pregnant. All it did was speed everything up, but not in a bad way. We decided one of us needed to exit the military to care for our child full time. I chose to be the one, because she was more fond of the lifestyle than I was. 

Now I feel myself on a slippery slope and I am worried I might not rebound this time. I don't know what to do. If she tells me to go and battles me for custody of our son and I lose... I don't think I want to have a life like that. My son is all I have now.. I don't know what guidance any of you have to offer me, but I don't want to confide in people I know; even though I know they would listen and wouldn't judge me.",10Sep2019,2
31,"I have really bad anxiety, its gotten better over the years and I do go to therapy but this feeling of apathy is new to me. It started over summer, it was really gradual. I would go somewhere that I'd usually consider to be so much fun and feel nothing. I even went to a concert and while it was amazing and made me happy I left kind of feeling a weird sense of emptiness. This hasn't left since around that time. I've been trying to find the meaning for the feeling and have come up with nothing. My life is great, I have amazing friends, family, etc. But still the feeling of happiness is so fleeting lately?? I tried my best to find anything that would give me that happy feeling again and I can't find it. Romantic stories, phone calls, heck even doing homework. Nothing gives me a really direct feeling. I feel so detached from how I used to be. Especially since I used to be an extreme empath and cared so much about everyone and everything. I feel like that part of me just left. I've been scared I'm a sociopath or something. I do feel feelings like anxiety, stress, anger, etc. Just not strongly. Idk how else to explain it besides just sleepwalking through life.

32,"Hey, I'm new to here and this.

I've been struggling for months now, I've had depression and anxiety for many years but since I was laid off back in July things have gotten worse. Within a few weeks I went from high energy optimistism to a lull. I'm frequently irritated, anxious and tired. I've been fighting a bullshiz denial of unemployment, which has caused a major dent in my finances. 

Anyways, my partner is aware and sees what I am going through, he does things to help me, but when I get in a rut I'm difficult to unwedge. He has come a long way communication wise and emotionally, but he struggles with how to help me when I'm really deep in the blues. 

I don't know what will help or what he can do in general, I talk when he notices and asks me but it only goes so far and we end up in silence. 

I need advice, because I know he wants to help and I need this, but what will work?

But seriously I need some advice.

So I'll start off, I am serving a 2 year, full time, Church Mission for the LDS or Mormon Church

one of the rules is absolutely no outside unapproved technology, anyway,

I really need some advice. I think I am struggling with depression, I literally feel useless and unfulfilled and I don't know what to do.

I don't know if this has anything to do with it- but I am also gay, so especially its sometimes hard to teach some of the doctrines from the church. I really don't want to tell anyone in the mission about that yikes

Honestly this post is really poorly written but I am looking for some things to not be so depressed while spreading the gospel and stuff

Also I can't go into too much detail because I really really want to stay anonymous

Thanks to all

I do want to say that I believe in the gospel truly, the book of mormon has helped my life personally before and I do believe it is the word of God.

I also want to say that I am quite scared of telling my mission President. I won't describe his background because it would be a self dox but let's just say that one of my previous companions asked him about a gay person we were teaching and he basically said he needed more faith.

It honestly was some of the hardest moments of my mission so far to be teaching someone who was gay that in order to be in good standing- they were forbidden from having romantic relations with someone of the same sex.

Tbh I'm simply looking for ways for me to stop being so focused on things like this and focus more on helping others because I do truly believe that the gospel and its teachings helps people

Thanks

40,"To throw a little context into this, I'm a 15 year old girl in a public school. My mother is bipolar. I've had extremely bad insomnia for as long as I can remember, and usually get around 3 hours of sleep per night now. I get really anxious and panicked for no reason every few days, to the point of tears usually. Sometimes there will also be a few days during which I'm really happy and everything feels amazing. I've told my dad that this happens and, given that my mom is bipolar herself, suggested that it's a possibility that I inherited it from her. I asked him if we could schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist or something, at least to eliminate other possibilities. He said sure. Weeks go by and nothing has changed. I bring it up again. Same thing happens. During these panic attacks I tend to have intense looping thoughts of suicide and self harm. I've never acted on them, but it's getting difficult. I've told friends and teachers that I feel like this. They have done nothing to support me aside from say stuff like ""Oh, that sucks."" I have exactly one friend I trust that I can lean on, and it makes me feel horrible that I'm dumping all of my stress on him, so here I am. 

I'm also type 1 diabetic and have stage 2 kidney disease.   


I'm usually heavily encouraged to manage nearly all of my medical stuff, aside from things that require a parent signature or are just not in my control. This includes carb counting, blood sugar monitoring, insulin doses, remembering to take other meds, treating lows and highs, ect. I'm also in charge of doing my laundry, keeping my room clean (because the sister I share it with sure as hell doesn't), and making my own money to buy things that I want. I worked at McDonalds for several months before quitting because of horrible management and toxic coworkers.   


In addition to all of that, I take advanced chemistry, english, and geometry, as well as a normal spanish class, since I have high career goals. I can only be grateful to my past self for deciding to not take an AP history course this year. Though I am able to treat my blood sugar in class, I am usually still expected to understand the lesson and complete the homework as soon as I am physically able. For those of you who have never experienced low blood sugar, the feeling of it doesn't go away right after it rises to a safe level. Shakiness, panic, irritability, and lack of focus can remain for quite a while.    


The icing on the cake is that I'm also expected to have a normal social life, and thrive as a gifted student. I tend to like people, and I enjoy social events a lot. However, that also causes stress. I want to be able to reach out to people and be there for my friends, and just be good to those around me. This means that I'm usually the one people go to when they're stuck in drama, no matter what type. I feel like I'm stretching myself too thin, but at the same time it goes too far against what I want to be in life to ignore people I could probably help just by listening to.   


Sorry for the long vent, I just don't know what else to do.

42,"I'm male.  Mid-late 20s.  Moved to LA a month ago.  My adult life, I've struggled to fill my spare time with interesting stuff.  After work, I go home and watch youtube videos alone.

Interests.  I love music.  I go to a lot of concerts.  I watch sports: baseball, basketball, football.  I like intellectual stuff; I'm a fan of the Joe Rogan podcast, which I consider somewhat intellectual.  I have minor chronic injuries that keep me from doing sports, but I like walking around and discovering new places.  I go to meetups like Tech in Motion.  I used to play 2K but I no longer have a playstation.

I recently got a therapist who has been helpful in spicing up my lifestyle.  So I have some ideas.  But I could use more.

Suggestions I've gotten so far are

* sports bars - doesn't seem like my thing; I don't drink or anything
* [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) \- I haven't had much luck with it
* hang out with work friends - I have a small office
* religious community - I'm not religious
* volunteering - I don't know what to do.  Most of the opportunities I've considered don't seem like they'd introduce me to interesting people.  For example, I could be a ""Big Brother"" or serve soup at a kitchen but I wouldn't meet anyone like me (my age).  So I'm not interested in any of the volunteering opportunities I've considered.

43,"I live in United States, Utah, Utah County. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety - my previous therapist/psychiatrist team floated the idea that this was at least partially due to being raised by a narc. She's not diagnosed though so that's not official, they just thought it was possible after hearing me talk about her.

I recently moved to Utah County, a highly religious portion of the state and every website I visit for mental health professionals in my area mentions ""faith counseling"", ""spiritual guidance"", and ""spiritual health"" in their listed services.

I have been having depressive thoughts lately that is causing me to want to sleep more, I feel my anxiety increase at the same time, and I have had a couple of nights of insomnia.  I can't deal with the changes that are going on around me and this is causing me to have sad thoughts and thoughts that don't even exists.  What I mean is I play a scenario's in my head, to know why something has happened or will happen.  I do take medication for my depression and anxiety (Zyprexa and Zoloft), but this has just put me in a state that I can semi-function day to day and nothing more.  Before I was put on Zyprexa, I was taking Risperidone and I felt much better than I do now, given that I had to take the medication for several months before it fully took effect.

My support group if very small, I have family, siblings, but was and still not the type of person who is willing share my feelings.

We’re the ones who have the privilege of saying we need help and being able to afford it.

51,"Before anyone tells me to go see a therapist, I just want you to know that I'm not stubborn about my mental health. I have a whole list of bugs in my head and I'm not ashamed to talk about it and I've already had therapy for it. Its just that now there is something new I've never felt before and I'm a bit confused by it.  
I've had depression before, and I've always had social phobia that made my life so much harder, but I've learned to deal with it. I know depression can manifest in many different ways, but I'm not sure its quite that... Maybe I shouldn't ask here, but I mostly want to know if someone else felt that way or heard about it and if they know what it means. 

Recently I've started to feel like my life is a movie. I've read about dissociation, but the description, the symptoms and the stories I've read didn't fit. I know the world is real... I dont have amnesia, I can remember my whole day even when I feel that way. What I feel is more... Like I'm a camera filming a movie. I look and record what I see, but I forget I can interact with the world and whenever I do interact, it feels like its not me interacting.   
Maybe in with context it will make it easier to understand. 

Yesterday I was at work, and it was boring for everyone, my coworkers had the idea of playing Frisbee to pass time. I watched them and even though I wasn't participating, I had a big smile on my face. I could feel their joy, as if I was participating, but I wasn't. I felt like I had no control over the scene happening in front of me. Instead of participating I just sat and watched. I was having fun, but it was just like watching two characters you like from a movie having fun. When I client came in, I automatically  took her order and served her, but it didn't feel like I was the one doing it. I guess I feel trapped in my own mind... 

This feeling used to happen only in social situation, like when I was invited to a party. I wouldn't feel comfortable talking to people because social phobia and all, but I wouldn't mind sitting and watching people have fun. Just by watching them, I could sympathize with their joy and I would share the fun they have and I would have a great time. But the fact that this is happening outside of social situations like I'm used to,  make me feel uncomfortable. I mean, in a party I DONT want to interact with anyone and I pray no one interact with me. But at work, and in all other situation, I want to be in control, I want to interact with the world as I see fit. The feeling that used to protect me from my intense fear of humiliation in public is starting to appear at any moment, and its not as comforting now... Its actually scary. I'm scared that this feeling could pop up during a positive time and ruin it. Just today I just randomly entered camera mode and stared at my partner in silence. We were done talking and instead of leaving or saying something else, I just stared, smiling because I was happy. I was waiting for something to happen, I thought about leaving but forgot I had to move. I was expecting for someone to move the camera for me... My partner had to say something for I to snap out of it and move.

A year ago, S disappeared. It was after i had been sexually assaulted and during that i have a memory gap, followed by unreality and hallintinating. I don't know if those 2 events are linked, but T thinks they are.

55,"Venting... Grew up in a third world country. Mental health treatment there? Gaslighting, insults, beatings, social isolation. It is REALLY messed up. I have witnessed people gossiping on those with schizophrenia: ""He must have taken drugs in college and overdid it."", ""Don't be like him kids"", ""Avoid him on the streets"". Those that committed suicide: ""Dude went crazy"", ""Poor idiot"". 

Me... Went through major surgeries as a kid and have been left for almost a year alone at home. Of course, developed depression. Unknowing I had depression as a kid, got terrorized by my parents. They were unhappy to have a child that socially isolated itself. Those 2 people drove me to hitting myself, made me wish I was never born to them, and made me daydream of killing myself.  At that time, I thought that all these thoughts where justified under those circumstances.

My life went by and I kept having poor concentration, obsessively thinking about death and frightening myself, being afraid that someone I love would die, hating the way I am, act weirdly in social situations (either a tad manic or tad lethargic), ended up drinking alcohol, developed insomnia, developed hyperarrousal, heart palpitations, anxiety, then treated my crippling anxiety with THC, then realized that I do not feel comfortable being alone with myself. I typed in 911 on my phone and fell asleep. Next day went into overdrive to get help.

I have gotten some treatment and I just now realize how life has been made difficult to me for no reason at all. I do not really know how to ever consolidate my love and hate towards my parents. I realize that they haven't been the main cause to all of this, but they certainly made sure that I would reach my potential with mental illnesses.

At the moment, it turns out that all my brain chemicals are off balance. Alpha2 agonists are a godsend. Likely going on anti depressant next. Possibly stimulants when things don't swing around like crazy. Got some weird depression where I casually end up suicidal while still tending to life and everything. Psychiatry is weird.

But hey, I now have hope again!!! I am also given the chance to tackle a lot of destructive beliefs I formed of myself.",10Sep2019,2

75,"I have struggled with my mental health from the age of around 14 (I am soon to be turning 22). I have only ever had two professional diagnoses, depression in my early teens (although I would not say I am depressed now nor do I struggle with low mood as such..) and generalised anxiety disorder (potential panic disorder although I haven't had a bad one in a while). 

My anxiety disorder has been existing and progressively getting worse for the past two years, before this I'd say I was a generally anxious person but not to the point it effected my overall wellbeing, I am just an extremely sensitive and hyper-emotional person. 

I have been on both propranolol and sertraline to help with anxiety. Propranolol helped a lot with the physical side effects of anxiety but it never the chaos that was still existing in my mind. A year later I had another bad episode and was put on sertraline, alongside having therapy. Sertraline really didn't agree with me I had awful side effects and I decided after 3 months I didn't want to take them any longer, i also felt I was in a much better headspace because of the counselling and decided to come of meds and do it alone. Since then, I have had much greater understanding of my emotions and feelings and can cope a lot better which is a huge achievement. I still however deal with multiple physical side effects of anxiety. 

Being off medication and having a kinder approach to understanding my personality and my emotions has left to several discoveries. Recently its been episodes of mania, I had never really experienced this or recognised it at least until I tried sertraline and learnt more of what it meant. To this day I have intense waves of mania, I always compare this feeling to a 'come up on MDMA, the waves of happiness and euphoria and confidence and general manic feeling. I thought for a while maybe I was bi-polar but the low mood doesn't really effect me its more id be sad as a result of an anxious flare up. 

I feel like I can get angry very quickly and struggle to get myself out of it and then an our or something later ill be manic, one extreme to the other. This feeling comes with such intensity ill love everyone around me and feel like I am literally full of sunshine and walking on clouds. is this some kind of mood disorder or my body not being able to regulate serotonin or dopamine properly ?????? I'm so clueless at all this and BPD doesn't seem to correlate with my symptoms either

DISCLAIMER: I don't dislike the feeling of mania, I actually enjoy it and feel at my best when I am like this rather than being numb, sad or anxious. 

I would really like more of an insight into this! many thanks x",10Sep2019,1
76,"Hello

This may sound like a non-issue, I've been trying to get over it through therapy.. but now I couldn't access therapy yet the thoughts still circling in my head.

I was misdiagnosed with Asperger's (and there were a lot of things surrounding my dx that made it questionable to begin with) This is a diagnosis that I did not agree with for a long time and it got revoked later in my life. My childhood behaviors were then later explained by attachment disorder and PTSD instead in subsequent evaluation. However the misdiagnosis caused underlying problems to be overlooked, inappropriate treatment and being placed in special education and it affected me negatively.

Now I see myself in dealing with my past better, but the issues now sit on the public perception of misdiagnosis.

However, now I have a public perception worry about it.

Before I got re-evaluation sorted out, I've been trying to find resources from site like Wrongplanet and r/aspergerrs. I realised that a lot of people in the community do not take well with the idea of someone doubting their autism diagnosis or even consider a misdiagnosis a possibility. Some called me out of being in denial and trying too hard to be 'NT'. having multiple professional opinions of the dx being wrong didn't help them change their mind of thinking of me as some kind of traitor.

This disheartened me a lot, to me autism diagnosis wasn't helpful or relatable and It took me a tough path to find an answer for myself.

Now I feel like my experiences shouldn't exist and it shouldn't be believed. It is against a common narrative they want to push. Like ""Autism is underdiagnosed in women and girls due to masking"", while I can say it might be true. My experience prove a counterpoint.

I just want to feel like I'm not alone in this experiences and have someone to relate to. I want to be respectful to their community. Although one of my psychologists who redid my diagnosis said neurodiversity community can be biased and i shouldn't listen to them too much?

Is it just online space that it's like this? I don't find similar behaviors common in other mental health communities either. 

Any idea what i should take from it? Should I just ignore them or there's a better way for me to see my experiences as ""real"" and not a taboo thing to have been through?",10Sep2019,1

I have basically no experience dealing with mental health issues so please tell me if this idea is way off base.

In Canada there is not a lot of support for people suffering from mental illness (as some of you may know). My uncle who has been suffering from schizophrenia his whole life is now in his 70s. He was living with his mother up until 2 years ago when she passed away and is now in a retirement home that houses people with relatively less-severe issues than him. He has been violent in the past (assaults on his own mother for example), doesn't always take his meds, can be verbally abusive to staff, often does not use the bathroom properly resulting in a huge mess constantly, doesn't change his clothes, trouble using the phone. And for his whole life has been constantly chasing women of all types, but mostly prostitutes. Any time he gets his hands on any money whatsoever, he gets a girl for a night or two and she takes off with the money (this happens all the time). He is a good person in his heart but he is extremely difficult to be around for any amount of time. The family is having a meeting today with the residence and we assume it's because he's being kicked out because of the daily phone calls we have been getting.

Because of the money involved in keeping a roof over his head, there just isn't the funds available to provide the full support that he needs. We are already paying about 6-7k/month just to keep him in this place and off the street or jail and even that is not enough.

Last night I was thinking about it and the costs piling up and thought ""why not just send him to a place in another country where labour is cheaper and he has easy access to whatever he needs"". For that kind of money in the Philippines for example, he could have personal care workers 24/7 etc.  Has anyone heard of this kind of thing? I'm not sure this would really be viable at all but it's just a thought so I'm putting it out there. Thanks",10Sep2019,2
82,"**TW:** Self-Harm and Abuse

I’m a 16 year old female, soon to be 17, living in the United States.  I’ve been struggling with mental health problems since February-March of 2018.

I tried to reach out for help, but my mom is so controlling and believes I’m just ‘looking for attention’.  She refuses to let me see anyone, despite the numerous times she found out about it.  She’s really damaging to my mental health to be around.  She’s controlling, manipulative, and mentally and emotionally abusive.  She downgrades and beats my ideas down on a daily basis.  I have little to no confidence, self esteem, or stability anymore.  I’m scared to be myself around anyone.

Here recently, I’ve moved into a bridge school.  It’s basically like me moving into college 2 years early.  It got better for a while, but then everything nosedived.

My anxiety spiked to the point I can’t relax without *something* worrying me.  I usually see myself as skinny and decent, but now I see myself as fat and ugly.  I can’t stop thinking about my past with my mom, my toxic ex, my toxic friends, and everyone who’s turned against me.  The worse of it recently has been my depression though.

It’s devolved to the point where I scratched up my arms for the first time.  Not cut, since I didn’t break the skin.  I scratched up my wrist with a pin twice within the past *month* when before hand, I fought off the urge well enough to not hurt myself.

As much as I hate to say it, mom being hovering over my shoulder made me keep my act up.  Now it’s just falling apart.

—

**I’m stuck with a choice.**

I could tell someone (maybe my councilor at school) and get help. I would risk loosing everything, including my games, devices, good school away from home, online friends, and even my boyfriend of a year who’s been the most supportive and caring person ever.

*Or,*

I could try and deal with this alone/online with my friends/boyfriend, and I won’t risk loosing them.   The problems haven’t gotten better though, and I’ve been doing this for the entire time I’ve been like this.  I’ve already devolved in only a *month* to hurting myself.  I stick with my original plan to wait til I graduate, before moving away quickly to live with my boyfriend.

I really don’t know what to do since I can’t do this alone IRL anymore.  I don’t want to risk loosing the one person I love though, just because my mom doesn’t believe I have mental health problems.  Sorry this got long, it’s sorta just a vent to get my frustrations off my chest.  If anyone does have any suggestions though, I would really appreciate it.",10Sep2019,3

Have had these issues all my life and had learned how accept its just who I am.   However this past year or so for some reason things seem to have gotten much, much worse.    I have been having very severe fatigue issues.    Before it was pretty common for me to need to take a 2hr nap or so in the middle of the day....Now those naps tend to last a good 8hrs.   This means on average I sleep 16hrs a day.

I have custody of my 9yr old son and believe he may have some of the same problems as me.   He has always had problems in school with learning.   He's in 3rd grade now only because the schools dont want to hold him back any grades due to already being a year older than most kids in his grade.   He has just now begun to start learning how to read.   So kindergarten-2nd grade he absolutely hated school.  This year something seems to have changed and he has been excited to go everyday and tells me about his day when he gets home which has been very exciting to see the change.   

The problem is he has already been missing a lot of school do to me.  I just cant manage to get up in time to get him ready.   I would set a good 4 alarms on my phone before 7am and had a bad habit of just snoozing them quickly for over an hour.   So then I got another alarm app that makes me solve some math problems before shutting off.    This seemed to work well at first but lately even that I seem to manage to snooze too long.   

He gets so disappointed when I wake him up and tell him we missed the bus.   At first of course he didnt mind because he could just play video games all day but after awhile he has been getting bored playing them and so ends up miserable for the rest of the day as theres nothing to do.

Fastforward to now, I have finished the job and am getting ready to fly home.

I was staying rent free with a family friend, but she lives super far and traveled like 1h to work and 1h back home, so this is not an option. I'm not sure if I should take this, it stresses me out because I would be left with very little money after paying for living expenses, health and retirement. Also, I don't know anyone here, mostly family friends who are my parents' age and have no kids. So I would be extremely lonley and would be leaving my long term relationship behind because we agreed we wouldn't do LDR again. 

I can go back home and live with my parents and look for another job, but it is most likely not easy and would probably earn the same amount I was offered, but wouldn't have to pay rent or for food while at my parents' house. Although I would be risking their judgement because they always want to control what I do, so they probably would want me to take the job even though it would take a toll on my emotional and mental heath.

What would you advice me to do? I'm more inclined to not accept, but am not sure how to tell them this.",10Sep2019,2
90,"With every new day, I feel more and more that I just can't live an adulte life, I'm just not strong or good enough. I'm afraid of everything at a point sometimes I just can't act. I don't like traveling or going on holidays because taking the train or whatever stresses me. Everytime I have an appointment with the administration, the bank etc., I'm just so scared, I'm 27 but acting like a child.

I see people being successful, being good at what they are doing while I'm here, not even having a real job, just earning enough money to have a precarious life.

I'm living in Europe right now but my girlfriend wants to go to live in Canada. The amount of papers needed is absurd, I don't know how I will do it, I feel like I just can't, it's too much, insurmountable. I can't understand how my girlfriend can do all the things she is doing, I just don't get it, how can she have so much energy and courage?

Just the fact that people can work 8 hours a day, I don't understand it, how can they do that? It's inconceivable, my brain just can't comprehend it. A lot of time, I feel like I still have the mind of a child/teenager in the body of an adult.

91,"Hello everyone!

I have never had any serious mental health problems and now I am totally at a loss. I would be very glad if you could help me shed some light at this issue.  
My problem is rather complicated, so here's **TLDR**: even though I am in a very happy relationship, everything is going fine and I have no real problems, I cannot force myself to complete some long overdue tasks. Sometimes I am full of energy, sometimes I am just sleepy all day long. It makes me frustrated and anxious about my future, because even though I am very ambitious, I can't get motivated. I don't know what to do.

Things that are important for me:

* My romantic relationship. I am very happy with my fiancé of 5 years, he is my best friend and I can't say a bad word about him. We would love to get married move in together, but it would be impossible if we had to live on a single income. We are both students. He works. I don't. That leads to...
* Work. I was offered a great job, which got me super hyped up. The offer was revoked for no apparent reason, shortly before the supposed date of contract. I couldn't find a new offer due to the circumstances and I am still unemployed. I have been told that my previous experience and credentials should land me a good job, but it seems that I will have to settle for a low-level position, possibly an unpaid internship. It makes me worried, because I would like to have a job connected to...
* My studies. My grades are good and in general I have little to worry about. On the other hand, I don't know what to do with my career. I study in a very competitive field, but unlike many others, I am not super passionate about it. I become easily interested in whatever I am currently studying, but it is not my hobby. These studies (prestigious, good uni, held in high regard) were a logical choice I could make with little to no effort, not a dream come true. My professors consider me talented, but I don't have a good plan. I was wondering if I should try to graduate early, start another major, go study abroad... I have no idea. That leads to...
* Ambition. I would love to major in different fields, to study abroad... but at the same time I am not sure if it is worth the time and effort, given my lack of good life plan. Furthermore, I am unhappy with an idea of a LDR, and my fiancé would likely stay in the country given his current career path.
* My family. I love them, they are fun, loving and very friendly, but my mum is a bit of a helicopter parent and is not always mentally stable (I think she is bipolar, but has never been diagnosed). They are disappointed with my studies, because they have finished the same studies and they are unhappy with their choices. I think they are biased and don't take many factors into consideration (they made a lot of mistakes I hope not to make). My grandparents are sweet, but sickly and elderly – they are yet another reason I am unsure about the option to go abroad, I would hate to miss the few years or months they have left.
* Projects. I like to do volunteer work and I am involved in many projects. They started overwhelming me, though. Most of my tasks are creative (design and creative writing) and I can't really do them when I am feeling blue. I postpone them, waiting for a miracle, I invent silly excuses and other more pleasant tasks... I am disgusted by myself, frankly. I could man up and do that, for cheesecake's sake, but I choose to be lazy. That's why I am constantly stressed and I cannot truly rest. All the things I had to do were in the back of my head throughout my summer holidays, and I think I didn't rest much. I can't abandon the projects completely, some of them can be extremely beneficial for my career and they did bring me joy. I still enjoy doing these things, I simply detest the fact that I have to do them and that I am late. 

I have a feeling that if I got a lot of money out from nowhere, I would come back to my old self. I would be passionate about everything, I would practice sport much more regularly, I would do a lot of things I can't do now, because I don't find the time. And frankly speaking, I waste my time. I can do nothing but play games and browse Internet or read books all day long. Problems with procrastination are not new for me. They started when I realised that I didn't have to work much in order to get satisfying results. Unfortunately, my behaviour is totally irresponsible at times and I regret it very much – I promise myself that for the next competition, exam, conference I will be much better prepared, but I still wait for the final call to start doing things. I was granted a 'golden child' status early on, but now I see how my underperforming colleagues outperform me in many ways. Good for them, but... I'm worried about my future. It seems that not everything will be as easy for me as predicted.

I don't have any type of addiction apart from procrastination. I am not sad, I don't want to harm myself.I am just angry at myself and completely lost. When I have nothing to do, all anxiety is gone and I am very productive. I have tried establishing routines, with some success. Pomodoro helps me a lot, but hey, I have to turn it on.... and sometimes I can't bring myself to do it. Some days I am really proud of myself, some days I am utterly ashamed. This feeling of physical fatigue is overwhelming, but at the same time I don't see any stamina loss while doing sports. I feel I am wasting my achievements. I need to find a solution. I would greatly prefer self help, but I haven't been a big fan of motivational images / podcasts so far. Please help me...

92,"Last night, my girlfriend of three years threatened to leave me. She said that I haven’t changed at all over the course of our relationship and if I have, it’s been for the worse. She finds that my depression and anxiety have left me a shell of my former self. She thinks that I don’t function well anymore. I don’t eat much, only shower a couple times a week, and don’t find any interest in pretty much anything anymore. She finds that I’m not as affectionate anymore and sees that I tend to just be preoccupied with something. Like I tend to just space out. She also thinks I’m socially isolated. She’s my best friend and I have two friends besides her. However, it’s hard to see all of them because of clashing school and work schedules. We’re all so busy. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past with ideas for a plan, but I haven’t had any in awhile until last night. She just wants to see me change for the better and thinks that hospitalization may be needed to put me in the right direction. I see my therapist today and my girlfriend wants me to discuss the potential of going to the hospital. Do you think I should? Is hospitalization even necessary in my situation?",10Sep2019,2
93,"For this World Suicide Prevention Day I wish to share my own experiences with suicidal actions and depression to help end the stigma. I’m only 16 and I’ve had 6 suicide attempts in the past 2 years. My latest attempt put me in a mental hospital. Depression is something I struggle with daily and I know for many out there it’s the same way. One big misconception is that suicide is selfish but it’s far from it. All my attempts were because I felt like a burden. My perception was so narrow all I saw was death as an option. It’s like a dark pit that drags you down. If you’re struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts I encourage you to get help. Remember you’re not alone and don’t be ashamed. And I can tell you it does get better, it may take a while but you will see the light again.

94,"So I (17M) have been having some strange moods for about a year now. I’ve felt very low much of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that I’ve been depressed all year because there were large blocks where I was very happy. But at around July time, I got my first real girlfriend and began training in the sport that I love and want to dedicate my life to everyday during the summer and spending time with my girlfriend everyday. Sounds perfect right? Well I was unhappy. I was happy when I was with my GF but when I had to spend a day without her and by myself I could hardly do it. I would get super depressed over almost everything and start to question my life. Then I’d see her the next day and feel better etc etc. Then about 4 weeks ago she broke up with me. Obviously I was devastated (I know, if you do the maths the relationship didn’t even last a month, but we were friends for a long time and she meant a lot to me and she just decided to completely cut me out of her life), and I’m still depressed about it. Like really depressed and I can’t stop thinking about her. I know this is rambling but please keep reading. I feel fine when I’m with people, I’m happy and can laugh and tell jokes and feel ok. But the second I’m on my own again, I start thinking about her. It ranges from being worried that she’s struggling and needs a friend, to thinking about her being with another guy and feeling worthless. I also currently feel very unlovable and I do not feel like myself at all. This all sounds so trivial compared to some of the other things on this sub but I think I might need to get therapy to help me move on from her. I’ve always had trouble with reminiscing too much and not moving on, and I just don’t know how to stop. Should I consider therapy? Why can’t I move on? Please help, it’s really affecting my quality of life :(",10Sep2019,3
95,"So, my primary partner and I run a business / community together. The relationship isn’t going great. He’s depressed, and drinks to deal with it. I have anxiety, and I’m starting to suspect adhd or something. The business is, in no small part due to my horrible executive function and procrastination and lack of technical skills, the most career success or meaningful work I’ve ever had. It’s also an important community to a lot of people, people pay us for some services on an honour system, we’re about accessibility. I don’t know if we can break up and keep working together, and this community is also where most of my close friends are. 

But like. I feel criticised, and like a fundamental lack of willingness to admit fault or see things from my point of view so much of the time. And he says some things that are pretty red-flaggy. Not that I’m perfect, I’ve had a lot to learn about boundaries and still make a lot of relationship mistakes. I’ve tried to push for therapy, or couples therapy. He’s not up for it. I do love him, but I’m also frustrated and tired and just fucking want more kindness. We live together. I have a part-time job, and no financial reserves. And I’ve found it hard lately to invest in friendships, and my self-esteem could be worse but it’s not great. Send advice/hugs?",10Sep2019,3

I've gone to three doctors before; two have refused to prescribe anything and have suggested meditation and exercise (I exercise and I find meditation doesn't help whatsoever). The other doctor prescribed me xanex but gave me a lecture for taking it during the day and said I had to take it at night...she only gave me 4 tablets and I never felt any effects. I've tried everything I can think of to stop myself being anxious and try handle it without medication but it's gotten to the stage where I well up and nearly start crying in meetings and dealing with issues and I can't go through 4 years in that state. Is there anyway of making it clear to doctors that I have tried and I'm only using this as a last resort? Thanks

105,"Some background for context: I live in BC, Canada. I'm a 17 year old female currently on fluoxetine and brexpiprazole. I am diagnosed with ADHD. I live on my own.

My counsellor would theoretically want me to be on stimulant medication. A lot of my ""depression"" symptoms are caused by ADHD, hence the lack of relief from the SSRI. 

I have a history of psychotic symptoms (diagnosed OCD with psychotic features), so my psychiatrist refuses to put me on stimulant medication (or atomoxetine for that matter). I have not had any psychotic symptoms in months and I feel pretty confident that they are not an issue at this point in time.

My ADHD is ruining my life. I can't go to school or work. I self medicate using insane amounts of caffeine (800mg-1000mg a day), nicotine, and in the past, street drugs, and it makes me feel awful but without it I am unable to do things like sleep, shower, or dress myself. Without caffeine I fidget so much it drives me insane. If I didn't take enough caffeine pills to make me feel like throwing up today, I would not be able to write this post.

My psychiatrist wants me to stop taking the caffeine, which is totally fair, but I cannot function at a minimal level without it, and he is not offering anything else. I'm doing CBT but it's not helping a whole lot.

I was given the option to go to inpatient treatment in order to start a stimulant medication but that wouldn't be for another couple on months and I can't bear to wait that long. My inability to do day to day things is making me suicidal. My lack of impulse control at this point is dangerous.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",10Sep2019,1

How that girl now is being lead on by you. You think maybe she wasn’t the right one, maybe the wrong one was right. That doesn’t make sense though, you could never go back to her. You feel nothing for her. You remember you have therapy tomorrow and you feel better. You remind yourself you’re cycling again. So you relax and tell yourself again, today will be good. As your driving down the road you stop at a light and remember that people can see your car. It eats at you. All the little things do. What people think of you and your image matters so much to you. It always has, and why is that? Why must you find comfort in others rather than yourself? You remind yourself your cycling again. You relax and tell yourself today will be a good day. You finally get to work only to do what feels like dragging yourself out of the car and lugging inside. All the while saying today will be good. Today you will be energetic.

Why can I no longer talk to people like I once could? Then you remember it’s because you aren’t confident any more. But how did You become confident? You feel like your 15 again.

You work with a new girl tonight. You want her to like you and think you’re fun to be around. after all that’s who the real you is. But who is the real you? Your therapist tells you to live in the present but you can never. You hate who you’ve become. You’re only a shadow of what you once were. You remind yourself your cycling again, and decide silence is better. Just pay attention to work. You think how when the new girl gets there you’ll try to be nicer. The other day she saw you in an awful mood, maybe she thinks your weird. Maybe everyone else told her you were. Maybe they all think you’re scrawny and know all of the things you think about yourself. Maybe you’ll never be happy like you once were. You’re cycling again. You will have a good day. The new girl gets there and she says that the only girl you really care about said you suck at your job. You start to get heated. You think she’s no better than you. How could she say tht?

I’ve gone through periods of euphoria and periods of absolute hopelessness. Sometimes the intense feelings last for hours or days. So many manic moments and depressive moments throughout the day/week. I pick my lips and my cuticles, and could rearrange the tiniest details for hours due to ocd.

117,"hey, so i kind of messed my whole life up. during the summer i finally worked up the courage to go to therapy to help aid my depression and possibly diagnose with me ADHD (i've had this suspicion for years with many of my other friends.). it was going ok, but it just sometimes reminded me on how i messed my own life up. i am a huge procrastinator and klutz, meaning that i always show up late to classes and almost never hand in homework. my grades always fluctuate which freaks my parents out and admittedly me too. i have also chose to leave my religion because i was scared of god and tired of the mundane tasks that i've had to do all day. i belonged to a religion where it was basically my culture in my race. leaving it could have wild and random results and i just cant put that upon myself and my parents. i am also a huge liar, telling my friends and teachers that i have adhd and other random things. i lie to my parents everyday about the religion and how i really am outside of the house, and these lies are starting to weigh on me heavy. the biggest lie i present to almost everyone is that i am happy, i have a huge fear of telling everyone for some reason, maybe because i dont want to admit it myself idk. but recently i have had the two most major screw ups of the year.  


the first screw up was the therapy. i like having someone to talk to but i messed up my appointments. i have no idea when my next regular appointment is, and i am being prescribed to an antidepressant called remeron. i am eager to try it out but i messed up the appoints on that three times, to the point where i've been waiting more than 4 months. i either missed the appointment or i scheduled the wrong day. now i have to wait until october 3rd, another month away all because of me.  


the second screw up was building my own pc. a year before i bought an old 2011 macbook because my parents wanted me to buy a macbook product, so i looked on ebay and found a ""deal"". turns out this macbook has been nothing but hell for a year, its now at the stage where it randomly restarts throughout the day, in the middle of doing random things. i sent it multiple times to get it repaired, always coming with a new problem. this summer i decided that i had enough of this, i wanted to build my own pc. my friend hooked me up with the parts which are cool and in my budget, and it took a LONG time to convince my parents. i assured them that nothign was going to go wrong and that this would be saving money. the estimate for a new monitor, keyboard, mouse and pc was about $900-$1000. we ended up going over budget to $1100 because of price changes and tax. my friend said he'd help me build it (since he was experienced) but wouldnt arrive until another week after all my parts came. this made me really impatient, so i took matters into my own hands and started building it myself. everything seemed to be going well, until i turned it on and it didnt work... multiple parts stuck in their place and the computer not even displaying anything. $1100 down the drain, and my dad hates spending money on things on things he's unsure of that will work. i've messed up everything and i really don't know what to do. i'm not suicidal but i was for a while, because now i am too scared of what happens in the afterlife. this really is all my fault and i fear that there is nothing i can do.",10Sep2019,1
118,"School has started for the fall term, so I figured this would be a good time to bring up mental health on campus. University can be stressful, and finding mental health resources can be challenging. 

&amp;#x200B;

***MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES***

I’ve written out a list of different **helplines, mental health organizations,** and **initiatives** targeted at students and young adults below. Most of these are specific to North America, especially Ontario, but some of them are more universal.

&amp;#x200B;

***UNIVERSITY TRANSITION RESOURCES***

Also, for new university students in particular, the transition from high school or workplace can be tough. It’s worth checking out what your campus offers specifically, but for Ontario students, here’s a general list of **university transition resources**.

&amp;#x200B;

***GENERAL RESOURCES***

Lastly, a note about other services you can access on campus: 

There are a lot of resources on campus that support mental health indirectly. You don’t have to tackle challenges alone, whether they’re academic or otherwise. Of course, every campus is a little different, but finding a community or other support network is hugely helpful and possible no matter where you are. 

\- Professors and Teaching Assistants (as well as Residence Staff for those living on-campus). Yes, they’re a resource. No, their office hours aren’t just for taking up space on the syllabus. Yes, go talk to them if you have concerns!

\- Athletic facilities. Your campus may have a gym, a pool, a skating rink (or multiple skating rinks? In fact, in a 1 kilometre radius of our campus there are 3 indoor skating rinks, an outdoor speed-skating track, and an open-air canal which freezes over and becomes a skating rink. Excessive? Maybe. Convenient if you like skating? Yes.) Digression aside, incorporating exercise into your weekly routine is a great habit and helps with managing stress. 

\- Financial counselling

\- Off-campus housing services

\- LGBTQ services

\- Ombudsperson

\- Peer Support 

\- Services for students with disabilities

\- Indigenous student services

\- Clubs and Societies. These are a good way to get involved in social events and meet new people.

120,Oh darn. 6 months of joy is over. Last month i kinda felt it creeping up but this week has been full on. Is this forever thing? Going to my 10th year yey! People told me being sober makes it alot easyer. Atleast last year i was so numb and braindead from booze i didnt even realize being alive. Now it just puts me back to my original form. No smile. No joy. No friends who i want to spend time. Isolation until next spring. From all of theys people on earth why did i get one who gave me this trauma. What was the plan. Was it to make me robot or just take love out of my brain? How can you even think that if you make your only son the punchingbag he could ever be happy sober. I know there os other people who know what being emotionaly alone on this world means but that doesnt help. I cant understant others emotional life. I want to feel trust and love. I have tryed to learn handle. Everytime i feel tear coming up everything shutsdown for weeks. Never hit your kids when you are angry. Never empty mental rage to your only son because yelling and hitting a woman/girl is wrong. Just because he is boy doesnt mean he is immune. Over 16y of my life was this. I dont hate myself. I just cant control myself if i let lose. I know who raised me and i have that in me. Cant get hold of that other better version because winter season always resets everything. I just wake up in spring and start from 0 saved files. 24m and i already want to go. Not even my both parents can be reason not to drive 200kmh to tree. It would be right to bring hell for them. But everytime in summer when i feel like god. I know i dont want to go. Maybe i just accept the fact that im not social and never having ability to form relationships. Good night.,10Sep2019,1

Over the past couple of months I've had to take several steps back and take a good hard look at where my time goes.

It all started with one alarming statistic: the average time spent on social media apps since 2012 has ballooned from 1.5 hours a day to 2.25 hours - that's about 16 hours a week ... damn.

122,"I (23 M) work at a startup in a major city. While I was never diagnosed with depression, I do have Aspergers and am aware of the correlation and relationship between the two. 

The past couple of weeks at work have been especially taxing on me, as my boss has been overseas at a foreign branch of the company. As a result, I’ve been tasked multiple things to work on at once without much guidance (us being in different time zones). I’ve been missing deadlines left and right, and am simply feeling dissatisfied with work overall. Whenever my boss checks in with me via Slack, it’s typically to criticize whatever I’m doing. 

Much of our performance metrics is related to web traffic for our site, which has been dipping significantly the past two weeks — which my boss is passive-aggressively blaming me for. I’ve been struggling to catch up on work, while yesterday my boss dumps this overdue research project on me that was her objective to begin with. While she was overseas the past two weeks, I’ve had trouble concentrating on my work, being unable to focus no matter how hard I try. This has caused me to feel tired all the fucking time, as well as having increased bouts of anxiety (especially when I’m sleeping and commuting from work — feelings of dread of going to work coupled with shoulder tension/pain). In other words, I’m fucking miserable. 

Today, I could barely concentrate on one thing without getting easily distracted, while simultaneously having chest tension from anxiety. After our weekly team meeting, I went outside to get some air, hoping this can help calm me down (I was also fighting a headache/lightheadedness). Instead, I ended up walking around the block (I think? I had trouble understanding where the fuck I was) for over an hour, with zero comprehension of my thoughts or where I was or what I was doing. I kept walking around in repetition to help calm me down, but that did nothing. I had a full-blown panic attack while walking, crying profusely, having strained breathing, nausea (I might have thrown up — fuck if I know). I wasn’t just feeling sad and down — I felt physically unwell and ill. When I was able to compose myself enough, I cancelled the rest of my meetings for the day and left the office. I’m a tiny bit calmer now and have some food in my stomach, but I still feel fucked in the head (physically lightheaded). 

Sorry if this came off as an incomprehensible, Joycean stream rant. Can any of you please help me understand what is going on with me? I want to get help, but I don’t understand what is going on — am I depressed? Burned out? Crazy?",10Sep2019,1

129,"I've gotten worse and worse. Today was like the big boom. Depression does NOT make things easy to deal with... at all.

I got sent home for an outburst.

I work at a car wash and me and another guy work the tunnel, prepping cars for the wash.

So the other guy was in the tunnel, Two guys were on lunch, One on the register ringing up a customer, another guy on a smoke break so I was the only one out there in the vacuum area. The other tunnel guy. We'll call him ""T"" came out and I asked him for help vacuuming a car, there were two out there.

T saying ""I aint touchin it"" and walks off. I drop the hose and lean against the car, I wasnt about to do it by myself if he was gonna be that way. Well this apparently pissed him off. He pissed me off.

The supervisor gets on him abit about it and he ends up vacuuming the car behind the first. He goes on lunch, I take over the tunnel. I'm so mad, I turn on music and just do my job. I'm calming down. I'm letting it go. Everything will be fine right?

Towards the end of his lunch break, I finish a line of cars and go out to help vacuum a truck. Supervisor is on the passenger side helping out. I've let earlier go and have calmed down, moving on. T comes up behind me and gets on me with an attitude, accusing me of doing shit I didn't do like pulling cars up and leaving them alone and going to sit in the break room. He keeps on and on. I ask when I did that. He doesnt give me an answer, continues to accuse me of shit.

Mind you, I've done nothing but good for this man. I've helped him when he's backed up. We've laughed and got along, never had a problem.

At this point I calmly tell him to go away and leave me alone. He doesn't. He just comes back with ""Make me, boy."" Suddenly, from 0 to 100 in milliseconds I get angry and just shout ""Go the fuck away!"" He says ""Make me, boy"" again. It's at this point the supervisor's son is pulling him away cause he saw how bothered I was. That's when I just lose it and kick a bucket full of water about 20 feet. I hear my supervisor, who was calm and understanding through the whole thing just say ""Go home, -my name-""

He should be glad I had enough control to kick the bucket and not his teeth.

A few months ago I could have handled it all much better. But within the last few months I've just felt worse and worse. It's been harder to get out of bed in the mornings. I've nearly called off work many times but could never do it. I keep pushing myself to do what I'm paid to do and this is how I get repaid.

I was already convinced I need meds or a therapist. Definitely even more convinced now. I come home feeling mentally and physically drained and lock myself in my room. I just shut down and dont talk to my friends and I'm just secluding myself. It's just getting harder and harder to cope with shit day to day.",10Sep2019,2

I was born and it was all good when I was young I had some friends but I later found out that they are fake, so fast forward I went to 4th grade (in dutch I was eight at the time). in this time there was a lot of bullying to me it was all my fault because I was different as other people, I had no friends and that was hard. The feeling of being lonely that i still have now is hard, when I was nine that's were i met a good friend of mine named quinten. He moved from house and he came in my class at the time. It was the first good friend I had and that was nice, when time past by I still had agression like attacks were I would be mad. That's why people picked on me just to see me mad, I went trough therapy for the agression attacks and the bullying dimmed down for a bit. When I was 12 I went to highschool here I met another great friend (the contact between me and quinten died down because the school difference) this friend seemed like a great friend.... seemed at the last few month's of highschool he talked behind my back because of money. he said shit about me that you dont say about your friends, I think this is the main source of my anxiety problems. The emotions I'm feeling are extremely intense, I never had such intense feelings like,everything in my head turns in a rampage. I only can think about death and suicide, I try to not think about it but it still is in my head. And I'm dealing with enormous self hate, there are a few things I like about myself but that's pretty it. I did cut myself in one of those ""breakdowns""/ ""panic attacks"" it relieved a bit but the regrets were there.

Most days I’m afraid to open my laptop which is where I log in to view work. When I have homework due I somehow come around to opening things up and crunching things the night before. This ultimately leads to me struggling. 

A little bit of background as to why I might experience this is the lack of former education before university. My first few classes were purely remedial to rush through the schooling that was absent in my life.

Now when a deadline comes, it kinda just passes and I don't really care, my mechanisms I've relied on my entire life don't trigger and it just rolls on by. My mind never feels sharp, my memory which I guess was a bit of a crutch doesn't carry me through day to day problems. Hell I don't even feel like I know how to be good at things anymore. 

I loved diving into a new thing and learning about it, now there's no motivation. I struggle to even type this out in a focused manner, get distracted and can't pay attention properly.

139,"Hey guys. I’m a 15-year-old girl which I think is important to say because I do hope my problems will disappear together with puberty. But I don’t know what to do anymore. This is going to be a long post.

I’ve been bullied since I was 6. When I was 6 a girl broke my collarbone. When I was 7 she put a bag over my head and unintentionally (I guess) started suffocating me. When I first started being bullied I was an extroverted, happy girl. One year later after being punched and excluded nearly all the time I wasn’t the same anymore. My mother told me that I was strong and that I could endure it even though she knew what I was going through. Finally I changed schools and startes going to a school where the teachers and children were really kind. I started to feel better and thought forgetting about the past two years would solve everything. 
I was wrong.

When I was 9 I first thought about suicide. At that point I began to love my mother more than ever before. Next to my father who was never someone I could respect as he made my mother and I cry with his hurtful words, my mother was like a god. He called me a piece of shit. Useless. And although she never succeeded in putting a stop to it: She was there for me. I couldn’t sleep for months and had nightmares about my mother dying, especially because of me. It got to a point where I couldn’t take the fear anymore and I told myself: When my mother dies I’m going to commit suicide. I was never as gleeful as in that moment. It was a great wave of relief, knowing that I had finally found a “good solution” to the problem.

When I started going to secondary school things got out of hand again. The whole class started bullying me. It was wrong how I looked, how I talked, how I acted and even my way of thinking. Everything about me was bad. This kind of bullying was different. It wasn’t physically painful at all. But it hurt me more than anything else. I think the only thing that kept me going at that time was my mother who I could always talk to. 

I endured four more years of constant bullying but I stayed strong. I had to stay strong. I think it was in the 3rd or 4th year when I started hating myself. I couldn’t bear it anymore. I felt helpless about the situation at home which was getting worse and the one at school. I didn’t feel good enough. My disgusting flesh deserved to be cut. My body didn’t feel like my own anymore. It was just something to demolish and to take out my anger on. 

My best friend developed a panic disorder in 4th grade. She wrote to me saying that she was going to kill herself. I talked her out of it and spent a whole year helping her out when she was having panic attacks to the point of coming late to classes. On days when she could go to school she was bullied and I put myself between the bullies at them. I wanted to beat them up. I wanted to scream at them. But in the end I couldn’t even cry. I just begged. 

Then I finally changed schools again. This is the school I’m going to right now. The people are nice. I should have been grateful for this new opportunity. But I think the last years have finally broken me. I tried making friends but except for a friend from my old school I don’t have any others in school. I can talk and laugh with them. But when I tell them about some of my (minor) problems they abandon me completely. 

And then I finally got a real friend. I truly loved him- he was my best friend. I needed him at that point in my life. I was scared the whole time without a reason while my hands were trembling and I felt like I was suffocating. And then he was there. He turned out to be suicidal. 

Before I got to know him I had already tried to jump from the 8th floor once. I was at my lowest. And he seemed like a light. Long story short: We talked about everything. 

I started taking drugs and got caught in class while hallucinating. It was a nightmare. I cut myself deeper than ever before. The blood was running down my arm but I didn’t feel anything. I didn’t feel any pain. I felt happy. And after that I felt deeply disgusted. My mother found out, my bedsheets were bloodied. She cried. 

I started going to a psychologist. I felt empty. Meaningless. There was no way out of this, I thought. The psychologist was a bad one. He diagnosed me with depression immediately without hearing me out. He told me I didn’t tell him enough and that he couldn’t work with me like that although I tried opening up to him. I got scared. He hates me, right? He thinks I’m making it all up. He looks down on me like on a bug. I feel ashamed. Those were my thoughts. 

I accidentally took wrong pills. And too many of them. I didn’t want to make myself vomit. “It’s finally over”, I thought. It wasn’t though. Although I nearly suffocated in the middle of the night and although the pain in my chest was awful I survived. 

This best friend of mine attempted suicide by taking lots of pills. He didn’t succeed. He didn’t really want to kill himself. But the drugs he took and the things he did drove him to it.

Sometimes in the middle of the night I feel this panic welling up inside. I start yelling into my pillow, crying, shaking, pulling my hair out like a lunatic and scratching myself. If I hurt myself again my mother told me she would take my cat away from me and scratches are less noticeable. That animal is probably my greatest source of emotional support right now. My mother doesn’t want to accept me anymore because I’m not like I was before. She tells me I’ve changed and that she doesn’t recognise me anymore. My life is crushed. I don’t see a light. And today I’ve just destroyed another friendship with a really kind person. 

I don’t talk about my problems anymore. I don’t want to make my mother worry anymore or hate me. I don’t want to talk about my problems with my new psychologist because I am nearly sure that he hates me or that he thinks I’m ridiculous. 

I hear a weird humming sound in my head. I can’t really hear what other people are saying and I don’t care anymore. A month ago I told myself after replaying a suicide event over and over again in my head every day without being able to stop, that I would start being normal. I don’t want this crap anymore. I would stop thinking about suicide. Suddenly in that moment I started praying although I’m an atheist. My thoughts didn’t make any sense. I took a knife to stab myself without wanting to. I didn’t want to but my body moved on its one. I succeeded in putting the knife away and getting away with just a small scratch and a panic attack. I want to be happy but it doesn’t work. I’m trying, desperately. I can’t control myself anymore. My head is heavy and I want to be alone. I can stare at the wall for hours. I feel empty. 

Sometimes I hear things that aren’t happening. A glass shattering and someone screaming once. Or something falling down although nothing has moved. It doesn’t happen often but when it happens it still scares me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to be happy.",10Sep2019,2
140,"I am still pretty young but I've had a really troubled past, I'm not really lacking in the friends department but I don't have many and I do homeschooling so I'm not so social. Why that's relevant is because when ever something happens or i need to vent or rant about something, I never do it but instead I imagine doing it. For example if iv been talking to my one friend a lot and something happens or my past starts to catch up I just visualize myself talking to them explaining everything and maybe telling them my secrets. I never plan to have these conversations in real life and generally most people don't know much about me but that's just how I cope with stuff.

I was in lecture for health psychology and the subject matter was on how stress and anxiety affects the body- it started listing off all these anxiety symptoms ive experienced and how stress and anxiety could kill you, and that put me into anxious thinking, giving me chills heavily and my vision going from being lightheaded- im not sure if thats the start of a panic or an anxiety attack but i tried really hard to calm myself and it worked with techniques i learned from CBT. Ill be able to talk about this w my therapist soon, but i was wondering if others have any suggestions to deal w this kind of thing.

145,"I don't know what to do. 

Im not mentally well right now.  I have depression and severe anxiety among (probably) a litany of other undiagnosed things. 

Im almost 17 years old. Yesterday I was playing Minecraft with my friends when my dad comes in the room and tells me to get off. I don't understand why. I was only about 8 o'clock and I was having fun. Of course this started a fight. What else am I going to do? Watch TV? Its the same thing as playing games. 

I flipped the fuck out. I was telling myself not to keep  acting like that, but I can't. I can't control myself when I get angry like that. Its like I become super aggressive and keep shooting my mouth off at this point. I said some really mean things to my parents.

So I ended up showering and going to bed. 

And I actually had a good day at school today! No real anxiety or sadness. For once I didn't hate school. 

Fast forward to when I get home. 

I get home from school before both of my parents. I wanted to take a nap because I was tired and my mom gets home, wakes me up and tells me she's taking the Xbox. I become super angry again. Again, I was even more aggressive this time. I broke a picture frame and punched a hole in my closet door, while again calling them extremely hurtful obscenities. Now the Xbox is gone. 

I almost want to just slit my wrists just to make them sad. 

Now, I feel like I'm back to myself. I fucked this up. I think I wanna leave, but I have no where else to go. I can't miss school. Im thinking 'all of this over an xbox'? And i didn't want to fight today. But it happened anyway. Why can't I just be normal? Why does it have to be me with These problems? 

I don't wanna be angry. But that person I become when I'm angry is a monster. I can't stop it.

149,"My mother is currently 62 years old, after her divorce 12 years ago she became very dependent on Ambien, anti-depressants, opioids, etc. She’s never really taken medication correctly.

4 months ago she had back surgery. She was taking Gabapentin, percocete, hydrocodone, we know for sure after her surgery, probably not correctly. Also Ambien every night for 12 years. She also stopped taking her Celexa antidepressant cold turkey 1.5 months before surgery without telling anyone.

3 months after her surgery, on 4th of July weekend, she started saying that Walmart had bugged her house, was whispering while pulling out her hair, completely delusional and in psychosis. After not being able to control her and too scared to leave her alone, we checked her into an inpatient facility. They tried everything. Ran every scan and test. She was seemingly healthy. They recommended ECT and so we went for a second opinion. In her two days home she was so delusional someone had to stay with her 24/7 to make sure she didn’t go to the neighbors to warn them of doom or call the police in the middle of the night. We took her to a second inpatient facility, they again tried everything, after 2 weeks she did outpatient care and they “released her.” She did not improve and again this second round of doctors recommended ECT. 

This is when I flew in and saw first hand how bad it was. Only 1 day during that 2 weeks I was home was she herself completely, which gave me hope only to be destroyed the next morning when her delusions were back full throttle. After a couple of weeks at home it was apparent that she could do nothing but pace and talk about her impending doom, that she had been convicted of a crime she cannot describe, that people were after us, etc. 

So now she is in a third facility, which is also the state medical school and is the best psychiatric facility in the state. They took her off of the medications from the other facilities and tried Lithium. It did not work. Now they are recommending ECT and saying she is a prime candidate.

My brother and I are in our early 30’s and are scared to sign over paperwork with a lawyer to get temporary guardianship to allow her to get ECT basically against her will. In her delusions she thinks she is going to the electric chair. Does anyone have any experience with this? We are at a complete loss. We are terrified and exhausted and feel alone and guilty.",10Sep2019,3
150,"hi
i have turned my internalized homophobia into a fetish. I seek out str8 guys online to pay money to, to bully me online and occasionally in person, fo laugh and make fun of me. I am being constantly told that there’s no escaping this and it is who I am and I cannot change myself, so I should give in, and spend all my money, jerk off all day and humiliate myself to the idea of a person that I regard as a real man. Although it does turn me on, and it is all I think of when I jerk off, i do not like the feeling of doing it during and especially after. I feel unproductive, I feel self-hatred towards myself a lot. And this self hatred turns me on. I’m told by some men, ones that take money from guys like me, that I will never reverse this, that I will never be able to change myself. I don’t know a lot, but probably it is hard to change your fetishes or get rid of them, if this can be called that. I don’t know that I’m asking here really, just feel so hurt that I don’t feel in control, so tired of telling myself I will stop and not doing that. So tired of lying to myself. Jerking of triggers dopamine levels and potentially I understand that I curb this addiction, it is just hard to find a backbone and cancel things that make you feel good but also extremely pathetic. I don’t want to be addicted to self hate. I feel shame. And I feel like maybe I overthink things and that self-wallowing is what makes me feel so shit. 
I don’t know if this is an addiction or forever a part of me, but I don’t want to live like this in constant search for abuse and seeing that as the only way to be useful. I feel like there’s no hope really to fight this, and then I’m reminded that fighting is fighting against my nature which is not what I should do.

It’s now a felony for me to own any firearm legally and I have to petition the fucking courts just to have my violated constitutional rights back. I’m treated like a fucking felon now because of my mental illness. These are the last people that you want to give that type of information to. My mother told my counselor about how bad I was years ago and she had me committed for almost three weeks where I was treated like a second classs citizen without access to even the most fundamental of human rights and civil liberties and I was tortured the entire time I was there by staff and other patients. These places are about as helpful as conversion camps for gays (ie not helpful at all). Quite the opposite. They strip you of your freedoms as a US citizen and subject you to torture. They label you as a psychotic, fill you up with medications that aren’t even proven to work, and cause more side effects than you could shake a stick at. Don’t do it. If, by unfortunate circumstances, you have to see a counselor, tell them you’re fine every time you see them from now on and don’t tell them shit. Also don’t ever trust the suicide prevention lifeline or any crisis numbers because they’ll do it just as well as any other counselor would.

So I just took a test in class today and I feel bad because I literally knew nothing on it, which made me feel so dumb and stupid. And the thing is I studied. I only knew maybe 3 things on it, and I wasn't even sure if I did those 3 correct.

I feel like I may've gotten a 13% on it. Thankfully it was multiple choice. But it's just this is my first college test so I'm worried as to how this will play out in my overall grade.

• I am constantly disorientated and ""foggy""
• I really struggle to concentrate on anything and feel like I can't think straight
• I hate everything about myself
• I can't do anything without screwing up
• I talk crap all the time
• I don't know how to act or talk in really any situation
• I'm not good at anything
• I'm useless
• I bring everybody around me down
• I ruin everything for everyone
• I'm ugly
• I've (unsurprisingly) never been in a relationship
• I'm selfish
• I don't really seem to feel any emotion
• I don't really ever want anything or aspire to anything or desire anything
• I don't look forward to anything
• I feel like there's no point in being awake

And before you comment “go to therapy”, “take meds”, “work out”, and shit like everyone else does i’ve already tried all of that. I have for years.

I’m 15 and have been diagnosed with OCD, Selective Mutism, Anxiety, and Depression. I’ve been to manyyy phycologists/ therapists and it doesn’t really work out with me having selective mutism. When I actually do talk I can tell that they don’t care. Also it takes many months to get into appointments, they are never there when you need them. I have never gotten help from an appointment. They either give me dumb paperwork to do or tell me to meditate (i’ve been doing that for YEARS, not for me.)

I’m on a streak of missing school. 4 days in a row so far. I have no friends there, or anywhere really. I haven’t had a friend since 6th grade. There are 2 people I have online but we aren’t that close. One is a girl, let’s call her R and another is a guy, called P. 

P and I are basically eachothers diaries. We’ve known eachother for a while but basically just send eachother a journal entry of how our day went. We have nothing else to talk about.

R i have met more recently and I love her so much. We both struggle with suicidal thoughts and spent a lot of time comforting eachother. I probably think we’re closer than she does. She’s been to a mental hospital before and said it felt like a prison, but she feels the need to go again. She hasn’t been online today and i’m scared about her. We aren’t close enough for me to just message her being like “you good?”, that will probably freak her out.

I’ve been questioning if I should go to a mental hospital. I have a Children’s Hospital right near me I can go to. My mom, dad, and brother all said it’s not for me. But nothing else has been helpful. I haven’t really told them i’ve been thinking about killing myself cause I don’t want them to be even more stressed out.

Also I think the hospital would be bad for my OCD and Selective Mutism. I’m used to taking a lonnggg shower everyday, and I don’t want other people to see me naked. Bitch I can’t even talk to other people. And I especially don’t want to have to sleep in the same room as someone else.",10Sep2019,1

160,"In all fairness, I am always dealing with psychosis.  I have to tweak my own personal diagnostic criteria for it because it plays on depression and anxiety for fuel - which spreads me thin over the world, no matter what I am doing.

I started a blog recently, after writing a pseudo biographical book on my journey throughout the medical establishment.  In fact, I wrote the book nine times, about 300 pages each, over the past two year period.  I felt like I was getting no closer to getting my life out of a rut where I can't even support myself.

So, instead of putting a finishing edit on the last book, which was getting near publisher worthy copy, I decided to go live on the internet with my work in writing.  I don't get paid for anything except SSDI, and joke that this has turned me into a professional patient.

But after recently coming through a psychosis where I had to push the outside of the envelope a little bit, I've come full circle, in finding my work more aligned with what are my true values and along the lines of my own moral compass.

Put another way, I thought I was providing some service by recording the crazy places which my mind takes me when psychosis gets its grip on me, that there was some sort of achievement in just living through it.

I need some feedback from the community.  One article, two, a quick speed read - it doesn't matter.  I've given copies of my articles to friends and family members now for two years and none of them have ever said anything about it.  They persist with the relationship they have with me as if I never let them in the door to how I deal with my struggle.

It's a big ask, to expect someone to read one or two of your articles, as they are schizophrenic in nature and only makes sense if read as an entire work.  But any comment would be greatly appreciated.  Writing is how I keep myself above ground - literally.  So it would mean a lot if someone could help validate that I am working toward a skillset in writing, where I could one day enter the workforce again, in a sustainable position.

Thank you,

161,I’ve been hearing and seeing things that’s aren’t there I won’t go too into detail but I’m very concerned and don’t know what to do. I definitely want to talk to someone about it not a doctor as of right now but someone. The only person I can think of that I could talk about this kind of thing with would be my guidance counsellor from high school but I’m graduated and am in college now l don’t go to that school anymore.

162,"I have an issue with being obsessed with my best friend and often dont give her or me time to ourselves.

Im trying to cope with being alone and letting her have her space but i feel so alone and scared, does anyone have any recommendations on how to not feel so anxious and obsessive?",10Sep2019,1
163,"Despite the title I'm not sure that I would just refer to myself as a little confused. Mentally I've found myself confused in the sense of struggling to make sense of anything or discovering momentary happiness in the blandest of moments as I once did.

I'll just say that last year I started my first semester of college, I was already at a low point. wasn't making many friends, commuted everyday, did quite well in classes. Given my lack of friends I decided to spend my time outside of class focusing on mending relationships with family and fortunately I did that successfully. Despite not being completely content, I always got by in find these instances of momentary happiness. Appreciation of the nature around campus, the sun going down, being witness to a kind gesture, etc.  The smallest moment could conjure an immense impact on the way I carried myself through my day.  It wasn't difficult for me to find or seemingly conjure happiness quite regularly. Sure, I would have my days feeling down and anxious, but I was always secure in my clarity of self image and world view. Once i mended familial relationships and found I wasn't content in my school, I simply decided it was time to commit to a school in which I believe I would be more happy and be integrated in a way that would allow me to make more friends.

So I transferred and things really began to pick up and go the way I wanted. I moved in, developed close friends, met girls, maintained solid grades. It mostly worked out well. The biggest flaws in this stage were two things: firstly, I began drinking with no prior experience or knowledge of limits, secondly I had a roommate who constantly made me feel inadequate while simultaneously trying to help me in a way that made me ""more like him."" The drinking wasn’t the worst thing, I'd drink too much, go out, basically do things that for most part should embarrass people to the point of never wanting to go out again. When my friends would tell me what I did the next day, I would laugh my ass off. It was as funny to me as it was to them. There was no hidden pain, I genuinely thought these moments to be funny. Eventually these habitual decisions lacking in thought led to some bad situations at which point my anxiety slowly arose again. But i still felt I could maintain happiness and solidarity with myself. Despite a roommate who constantly would throw small digs at me, I couldn’t find it within myself to care because I didn't feel they were personal, I believe this kid genuinely wanted the best for me, but had a dickish way of going about it. But of course towards the end of that school year I found myself anxious and stressed. I had experimented a lot that year and my friends wanted to get high together before the end of the semester. Of course, I'd never smoked before this, but I decided that I would try it at least once. So we did, I woke up the next morning and everything was fine. A little groggy, that’s all.

However the next day my roommate came back with an edible for myself and our other friend to try. All three of us had a piece. That night I was freaked the fuck out. I was oddly twitching in my abdomen, everything was hazy, and despite feeling exhausted, avoided falling asleep for the longest time because I was having trouble breathing. Eventually I fell asleep. When I woke up everything felt off. Like my entire brain had been decentralized and I couldn't get a tangible grip on reality, my emotions or my own self image the way I once had. I began comparing everything to the way I perceived I had felt before and severe anxiety set in, along with an odd feeling of emotional imbalance and skewed perception. One key thing I feel is worth mentioning is following this, the only time I would feel most normal, competent and like myself was when I was lacking in sleep. I bugged for weeks after, my friends told me I should be fine, that it was all in my head. So I tried to ignore what I felt was the greatest altercation to my brain and mental health, but I can't really continue to ignore it.

From this moment forward I maintain a degree of awareness of who I was, who I wanted to be, what my values were, but I no longer felt attached to those ideas. Hell I didn’t just feel detached from those ideas, I felt detached from everything. It almost felt like I was lacking in emotion, like my normal emotional responses were no longer there. Like my brain would tell me I should be feeling X emotion, but I couldn't feel that emotion. I've always found empathy to be a strong suit of my caring and trying to feel and understand what others are going through, but now its hard to do that, almost like I can't. The only thing that made me relax and feel somewhat sane was watching some mindless entertainment. Otherwise work of any kind continues to distract me from my mental state.

I thought going on vacation with my family to one of the places I've always felt happiest might change something, but that detachment was still there. I didn’t feel emotion nearly as strong as I once had. I could still find the happy moments that were supposed to carry me through, but they no longer granted me that flood of happiness.

It's been 4-5 months since this lack of feeling has begun and I just don't know what to do. I've been completely sober in the meantime, I figured eventually it'd all just return to me gradually and I definitely do feel I've improved as emotions hit just not as hard nor as frequently as they once did. But it's been feeling incredibly difficult to move myself through each day. I feel lost and confused unsure of what to do or who to talk to. I feel broken in a sense, lacking any known medication or fix. I feel depressed in a way I haven't in a long time. If you think I'm crazy, I get it. However if you feel you have some understanding of where I'm coming from or some advice for how I might be able to fix this then I'd really appreciate it.",10Sep2019,1
164,"So I did a bad thing. I looked at the phone messages of someone who said they loved me. Apparently, according to her, these were just friends that she had. But something itched at me, and I had to look. Turns out she's been sending all sorts of nudes to one of them. Talks of oral sex and more. 

She told me that it was because she wanted a modeling gig, that she would flirt however she had to to get it. Thing is this was just supposed to be a friend. Friends don't send nudes to each other. Least not in my experience.

So now because I looked in her phone I'm being made to feel like the bad guy. That I'm being controlling and possessive. I've never once told her who she could or couldn't hang out with or talk to. I've maintained that philosophy our whole relationship.

She's always talking down to me, making me feel like garbage and calling me names. We are supposed to be in a poly relationship, the third being her first. She lavishes him with love and affection, and then puts me down constantly. Fat ass, stupid, ugly. All these I hear on a daily basis and rarely do I get praised for any, or told I'm appreciated, or made to feel loved. 

Am I the asshole for feeling insecure and looking at her phone? Should I have just let it be?",10Sep2019,1
165,I already cause a scar on my forehead out of anger. All because of a video game. I can't stand losing and losing often puts me into a psychotic episode where I just hurt others or end up hurting myself. I scratch my face out or bang my head again hard wood.,10Sep2019,1
