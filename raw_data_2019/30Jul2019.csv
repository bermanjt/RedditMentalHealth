4,"I feel like I can't be honest about my inner feelings, needs, personality, and thoughts. I'm afraid to reveal myself to people, and it's starting to get in the way of my happiness and makes me feel a type of hate toward myself and why I can't just feel normal. I always feel like i'm being too much, or i'm being annoying and immature by expressing myself. I fear judgment so much, but my harshest judgments come from my own mind, and I'm trying my best to change. I explained my feelings in this video, and i'm so afraid to show it. I just want to feel like i'm not alone in this experience.

5,"Hey guys,

I recently lost a good friend of mine and this is a simple way for me to give to the community. 

I’ll be hanging out on the #Headspace tag on Synqed if anybody wants/needs someone to talk to. We can talk about anything. I don't mind. It isn't much, but I just want to give myself to others.

It may be more for myself and my coping, but if I can brighten someone's day just by being the for them, it would mean a lot! Sometimes you don't know someone's pain until its too late.

Much love.",30Jul2019,2
6,"Leaving the house is a struggle for me, even just going out often enough to keep food in my cupboards can be hard, and my social anxiety is so bad that talking to a cashier for a minute often leaves me feeling physically ill, so the idea of talking to a person about my deepest issues for an hour sounds like literal hell. I've been living with severe anxiety for a very long time and I've gotten so burnt out on it to the point where I will start flipping out over even very minor stress (I have, on multiple occasions, started screaming and crying when I've made a cup of coffee and then realized that I was out of cream, I also dropped out of high school less than a month in because I found math class so stressful that it destroyed my quality of life, despite the fact that I was otherwise getting high grades in other classes and enjoyed school most of the time, also to clarify, I had previously been home schooled due to my mental health issues through elementary and middle school so it took less than a month of public school overall to break me), I'm genuinely afraid I'm at the point where the anxiety of seeing a therapist on a regular basis would send me to have some kind of nervous breakdown. How do you deal with it when you're too dysfunctional to even see the person who can help you become functional?",30Jul2019,82
7,"I'm really prone to feeling stuck and powerless.

I didn't work for years which made me feel stuck. Then I get a job I dislike and feel stuck. I have acne/extreme skin sensitivity and digestive issues which makes me feel stuck in my body. My financial situation makes me feel stuck and I feel like I can't ever spend money unless it's like the dollar store or something. I feel stuck and alone with no friends. I feel disconnected from other people and the present moment a lot. Ungrounded. 

It's this recurring theme of feeling stuck and like I can't do anything to change my situation. Basically feel hopeless anyway like ""What's the point"" ""I'm screwed"" type thinking. I feel stuck emotionally too and like I can't be happy. 

I have made choices based on survival and fear instead of what I feel like doing. That's when I actually make choices. Sometimes I just do nothing because I can't even make a decision. I don't even know what to do with my life &amp; if I'm alone and feel like crap then what's the point in trying. 

I looked in the mirror at the store and felt shocked at who I saw staring back at me. Sad skinny person",30Jul2019,1
8,"Honestly don't know where to start and just need to vent somewhere... 

Last week I quit my job because I was absolutely miserable going in every day and feeling the stress of sales quotas and my managers disappointment in my performance. I hadn't been making any money there for weeks (sales job, 100% commission). My parents have been fighting with me for months and months about money because they've helped me when I needed it. I feel like I'm drowning in student loan debt and payments that I can't even do anything about. 

Now, even tho I have solid interviews going on and should be happy about it, I can't help but feel alone and isolated. Other than two interviews today, I haven't really left my house since last Thursday. I feel completely stuck and every minute I sit here alone I just feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into a hole. 

The past few months I've lost so many people (5 deaths in my extended family) but the one that hurts the most is my Aunt. She was the one that understood how I felt and what goes on in my head. 

I don't have a lot of close friends and really don't have anyone that I can talk about this stuff to. I feel like over the years, I've pushed away everyone in my life and go through cycles of just isolating myself. And at this point I don't really have anyone close enough that I'm willing to tell all this too. 

At this point, the anxiety is just coursing through my brain every second of every day. I'm worried that I'm never going to make it in a job, I'm never going to be able to move out of my parents house. I'm so scared that I'm falling into a hole all over again and it's terrifying. 

I should be seeing a therapist and/or on medication but I lost my health coverage a couple years ago (most of the sales jobs didn't offer anything) and haven't been to a therapist since. Right now I don't think I could even afford one",30Jul2019,2
9,"I can be absolutely fine for days on end. I won’t get overly stressed or anxious about things, I won’t overthink, worry, or feel insecure. But then out of nowhere I get in these ruts that can last anywhere from a day to a week. In these ruts I feel terrible. I’m stressed, anxious, insecure, unmotivated, sad, worried, etc. 

And then the rut goes as quickly as it came. Why? What is that? Is that what depression is? Am I bipolar? If anyone can help me out, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",30Jul2019,1

11,"This drives me crazy &amp; I have no idea what to do about it. I don't know what causes it but I know that anti-psychotic meications exacerbate it. 

So these thought loops are any sentence i hear or read endlessly repeated in my head until I hear or read something else. It's like ""Hey Sunflesh, how are you?"" And this would be cycled through my head over &amp; over, I'll begin taking the words apart as if there's a pattern...It's difficult to describe because it's seemingly random in its onset &amp; it'll go away on its own. It's bad enough I will not be able to even hold a conversation, or go throughout my day doing anything.

13,". I’m concerned for my friend. He doesn’t talk to me at all but I know he hasn’t been able to have a job for over a year due to his anxiety and chronic health problems. He spends most of his time going to doctor appts and the other time sleeping for days at a time. He has tried outpatient therapy with no success and has been on an antidepressant for over 10 years. There is no history of substance abuse but he’s completely removed himself from society and sometimes does not leave his house for a month. I know you can’t diagnose or make any judgement calls with such little and vague information. However, I desperately would like to help him and I’m sad watching him sleep days away without eating which only exacerbates his health issues.

Do you have any suggestions for resources or is it appropriate to go to a psych ED. From my knowledge he has no suicidal ideation but has absolutely no desire to live and is just sleeping and not eating hiding in his house",30Jul2019,3
14,"I have been doing really bad lately. 

Self harming, more paranoia, drinking (not a lot), wanting to curl up in a ball and cry and in general, just wanting to off myself in just about every conceivable manor. 

I know exactly how I want to go out, but I don't have what I need. So it goes to my next plan. 

I think about people watching me through my sheet covered windows, through my phone, through secret cameras and who knows what else. I covered my windows eventually, because I got worried the crisis team (from where I see my therapist), was watching me through them.

16,"So, I recently filed for and was approved for disability from the VA at 50% rate.  This should be a good thing, it is an extra $860ish a month.  I initially claimed chronic back pain, mental health (bipolar) and right foot arthritis, only the back pain was approved, the others were deferred.  But in the couple days since getting approved, I have to say, mental health wise things have gone downhill a fair bit.  Just the idea that the US Government officially agrees that, yes, I will be in physical pain for the rest of my life, is fairly disheartening.  I'm happy about the money, but I'd rather not be in pain.  

Another aspect of my conflict is that I'm not your typical disabled person.  I run a lot, my standard loop is 5 miles.  I also hit the gym on a regular basis.  I am in considerably better shape than your standard American.  But every step hurts, it is like I have a handful of nails driven into my spine.  But I still carry on, it's what I do; I AM a runner.

In summation, I fear the implication that I will likely be in pain for the rest of my life, and wish that I were a more stereotypical disabled person.  Feeling like a pretender makes me feel unwell, and frankly, exacerbates my suicidal ideation.",30Jul2019,1
17,"I thought I was getting better. I’ve been cutting toxic people of my life, and even though the beginning of July was looking to be really bad, I got through it. I seriously thought I was finally becoming a nice company. At least, I stopped giving any f*cks about fitting and just act like myself with the people I love.

I thought it was good. People seemed to enjoy me a little more. I began answering back to the attacks. It seemed like an improvement.

Now my brother yells at me that he has been at our home (I don’t live there because of college) for only two weeks and he has heard complaints about me from _every family member._  Even from my mom, whom I told I was having a hard time because of my depression.

Apparently, having me at home during the summer holidays was hell to everyone. And no one thought of telling me I was doing something wrong.

20,"TW: suicide ?

Sorry for keeping things vague I just want to keep certain details private on a public site. I have a friend who has been spiraling in an out of a bad place for a couple of years. I am worried about their mental illness getting so bad that the worst case scenario happens (suicide.) It’s been pretty worrisome the past 6+12 months or so. They even mentioned to me in 2018 possibly being committed to a mental health facility of any sort but I wasn’t sure if they were to “that point” or how to nurture someone in that situation.
If you look at my other post my friend will sometimes show up to my house randomly. Usually at odd hours with odd motives or paranoia about something. Recently I am pretty sure they showed up to my house at midnight waking me and my kids/pets but in the moment I brushed off the pets going crazy because I was half asleep. Then a few days later they left something at my door. Sometimes they will leave me little quirky gifts or treats for me and my family at the door and leave. The thing that really worries me about this is their phone has been disconnected for a few weeks prior to these recent “visits.” I’ve been calling for the past few weeks and keep receiving an automated error message/call can’t be accepted. Something in my gut is telling me something is wrong and I don’t know what to do. We live a couple hours apart, the cellphone is disconnected, they haven’t been to their place of residence in a while, I have no idea where they could be or how to talk to them or find them.  I talked to someone close to them and they are worried too. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? I feel sad and worried.",30Jul2019,1
21,"This might come off as selfish or that I don't know what is good for me, however I'm struggling a bit with my adjustment from education to working life.

A bit of background, I started off very young with computers. 2 years old I got my first computer and I was sent down a rabbit hole of building and tinkering with computers. At 10, I discovered programming and knew this would be what I wanted to do when I was older. I tried different areas such as 3D modeling as I grew up but I always came back to software development as my long term goal. Growing up I found learning a struggle in school but generally was capable enough to pick up what I needed until early high-school. From high-school on-wards, I struggled to pick knowledge up like I used to and couldn't apply myself to the work. I still knew what I wanted to do but I failed to complete high-school, being delayed a year then finally kicked out before I could complete my final year without University Entrance due to poor grades.

Spent a year working, trying to find myself and finally decided, I would do what I always planned and try to get into University. I managed to get into an entrance course and then scrapped through to the main degree. Took an extra 2 years to finish the degree but I graduated with honors. I got a job at the first company I applied for, they're happy, got a promotion very quickly and things seem to be going well. But a year after finishing my degree and getting a well paying job, I don't feel great.

You could say I was really lucky to get a job right out of university. To be earning far more than most graduates right out on university earn. Most people I studied with are still job searching. The work is hard but I always enjoyed the technical side of it. I have a loving partner and we just bought a house together. Everything should make me feel happy. But I feel like I'm missing something in my life. 

In the city I work, the houses start at 10 times my income, not easy to swallow and causes stress thinking of if one of us lost our job, however together we earn enough to have some spending money on the side. But spending money doesn't really make me happy. You think I'll save up for something and buy it and make so much use of it. But then it sits in a box collecting dust. I guess it's a lesson that money doesn't bring happiness. It's held me back from buying stuff like new phones and such as I know it won't make me feel good. My life consists of 13 hours of work, 5 days a week, and then come home to life maintenance work. I don't get the time to play games any more and when I do, I don't find any enjoyment anymore. I think maybe I should buy my dream car, but then I remember spending all this money in the past and not getting any enjoyment from it. Plus it would cause financial stress.

The one area that I do find some enjoyment is when I go back to building software. But I generally don't have the time or energy these days to commit to a serious project. I have this whole list of need to do's. And when I take the time to do something for myself, I get no real happiness from it. I started diving into making a game and the whole idea and process of learning and building this game in my head gave me a drive that I had not felt in some time, but then I remembered I don't have the time to really follow it through, life distracted me with things that needed to get done and that was the end of that.

What I'm kind of saying is I don't know what to do. I had a goal for 15+ years of my life. I managed to achieve that goal. I'm not logically in a really good position in life, but I don't feel like I'm getting anything back. I eat, sleep and work hard on repeat. Coming from a poor family, to have money available now, I thought I could do anything I wanted. But now that I can to an extent, it brings me down and not up. I miss having a goal in life. A goal that is feasible without throwing away everything I worked for. 

I started to question, maybe I am depressed. But then I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed considering how good my life looks for someone in their 20's. That plus when I have trialed anti depressants, It only made me feel numb or worse. Making me apprehensive to consider that.",30Jul2019,5

Mr Carey,

I'm posting a link to an article by Jonathan Shedler, a professor of clinical psychology at Colorado State University, that has garnered remarkably rapid notice on the Psychology Today website with about 20,000 hits in two days.

 The article describes glaring conflicts between the manner in which the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is designed- as a collection of common terms to permit researchers and clinicians to communicate in consistent ways- and how it has been implemented, as a set of explanations of mental illness that gives the false impression that everyone diagnosed with, Major Depression, for example, is suffering from the same problem and is in need of the same treatment. 

I think it's a very clear and useful piece of writing.

23,Hey guys I have strange mixed addiction not only to returning phones but with other things too. If I spend too much I start to panic and think a lot of what should I do. It all started when my mom who now has stage 4 cancer had bought me a iPhone 4 when I was 15 and since then I started seeing how the real world works I worried one day my mom might not work anymore due to her being critically sick due to her cancer and I cried about that and decided that I’m going to help her financially by not buying extra or expensive stuff like the iPhone. Eventually I started doing a habit of buying sprint phones and returning them used very little since of a severe returning habit. I didn’t know why I did that and I still do today now in 2019 but less but I can’t control myself like it’s impulsive and it stems from the fact that I care for my mom but don’t know how to handle the financial situation. This has lead me to think about suicide a lot because I feel like I’m sick and need help. I go to therapy and see a psychiatrist and take meds but all those feel nothing if my mom is not health. I JUST WISH SHE WAS HEALTHY AGAIN AND HAPPY AND ENJOYING LIFE. NOW IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS GOING TO DIE ONE DAY AND DONT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT I WOULD LITERALY BREAK DOWN COMPLETELY AND KILL MYSELF. I’m sorry I’m having such a bad day and need god in my life I feel like giving up and need to stop this addiction and need to help myself.i need friends and I need a social life I’m alone.

26,"I am 16 years old. My whole life, I have been raised around a heavily christian family, with very opinionated beliefs, such as anti-homosexuality and a strict set of rules(I’m only allowed to listen to christian music, they won’t let me get a job, nor go out with friends,etc. ) I cannot express myself at all around them at ALL and many times they have made me feel like shit. A few years back, I began to explore my sexuality and inclusively found out I was bisexual. My mom found out and I feel like she has been so angry and dry towards me ever since and at the time I felt so confused.

During my middle school years, I was molested multiple times by my step grandfather but I never opened up about it in fear of my parents not believing me/the grudge towards them. There was a time that I hid having a boyfriend and I was secretly still talking to him even though my parents forced us to break up, and another time where I self harmed, I told my friend about it via text, my dad found out about both events and was more upset over me still talking to my boyfriend than finding out I self harmed. It really hurt me and haunts me still today.

I have always been a shy kid, but I feel like these past few years, I have been so hesitant to talk to people, especially at school. This is the most insecure I have felt in a while and I have no idea what is going on. I have been obsessed with looking at curvy models lately and wishing so much that I had their bodies, and it goes into a never ending cycle of me feeling like absolute trash and my mood swings down. I really want to get help, unfortunately my parents don’t “believe” in psychiatrists. They will most likely not talk me to a therapist and I have no idea who to turn to.

28,"I’m really struggling.  My parents are a complete drain on me emotionally.  And I need others thoughts on this.  

My mom and dad were not around when I was a kid, my dad was an alcoholic and my mother was a workaholic.  They neglected me and my brother, we saw them for like an hour a day.  They left us places, didn’t give us baths or brush our teeth. We had to fend for ourselves and figure it out.

Now my dad has severe dementia my mother won’t send him to a home, so now she is neglecting him and herself.  They don’t take showers or brush their teeth. Their house is falling a part, there’s a massive mold issue in the basement from neglecting to take care of a flood down there.  They don’t comb their hair or wash their clothes.  They smell. They don’t have a retirement fund, they put purchases on credit cards.

I am emotionally overwhelmed. They ask me to help but they have pushed everyone else a way.  So they look to me. But in the same token they don’t listen to me.  At all. 

Every time I go there I become completely overwhelmed and ridden with sadness and experience an overwhelming sense of responsibility. I can’t afford to help them, they are a complete drain on me physically, emotionally and spiritually, and financially.

I just spoke with my parents about reducing my medication and they didn’t fight me on it, which I’ll take as a sign that they see I’m ready to be more responsible.

I had a psychotic break two years ago and I’m finally in a good place, and I know how easy it is to mess that up, so I’m being cautious and taking all the necessary steps to reassure my parents and friends while also making sure I’m satisfied with my progress.

I must admit, I feel so good I almost stopped my meds cold-turkey, but my mom talked me down and I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in two weeks to further discuss this matter.

As you can see, I am very high-functioning and for once I actually feel in control of my thoughts. 

The end goal for me has always been to not need meds, and I think now is the time to test the waters. 

Of course I know things won’t be absolutely perfect so I ask that if anyone in this sub has any good coping strategies for psychosis that you please send them my way. I’ll need all the help I can get in this transition :)

I can observe that I seem to be having trouble socializing. I used to be very extraverted and loved talking to people but now it seems like I am trying to learn how to socialize again and I’m very shy. I seem very awkward now when interacting with others and on top of that, I feel very anxious when I’m left out, but since I’m not talking much and when I do it’s just really weird because I feel like I forgot how to socialize so I naturally get left out of groups. 

I had a couple of friends that I got into stupid little arguments with that I just absolutely blew up and cut them off. 

Sometimes I get flashbacks to some situation back from during the breakup or me confronting my friend that my girlfriend cheated on me for and it gives me a slight panic.  

I became a workaholic as a result to try and cope but it became an unhealthy addiction because I’m not taking care of myself physically and I seem to be talking shit to myself in my head for small mistakes. 

I guess my question is what do I do? How do I fix this? I’ve become a completely different person and what remaining friends I have left have noticed how different I am. Should I see a therapist or something? I’m kinda naive so I’m not sure what severity of mental issues I need to go to therapy?",30Jul2019,12

40,"Hi, so basically every single time I am not actively avoiding thinking by either immersing myself in a game or a tv show or some other form of entertainment my brain just makes me feel like shit.

an example is the other day I had just finished a tv show that ended on a nice romantic scene the guy and girl got together and were nice and happy.

this is where my mind kicked in and It is like ""what the fuck are you doing you fat waste of organic materiel no one will ever love you like that you will die alone with no one who gives a fuck about you"" then I feel like shit again until the next tv show and for those next few hours I'm not thinking and not feeling like shit.

I'm sure everyone will be like go to therapy and talk to someone and stuff like that but I don't even know why I am like this and think like this and I would have no idea what to say.

I don't know maybe the answer is obvious but what should I do going forward and how do I stop doing this?

any advice is much appreciated.

41,"I want to kill myself. I have no will to live. I'm constantly stressing to do everything to make others close to me happy, yet I'm treated as if I'm not doing enough. My partner is threatening to leave me every time he gets angry at me and making me live once again with a constant dread of impermanence and abandonment over me. I feel unloved and unwanted in life. I'll never have love, a life, a family, my partner will never love me like I love him, and I'll be wasting my time getting deeper into depression only to have it all blamed on me and be threatened and hated. I'm tired of living in a constant state of dread and pain and having those feelings diminished and exacerbated by others around me. I only keep living because it's ridiculously hard to find an easy and ideal way to kill myself, and I hope that things will change. But I can't handle another period of that kind of stress, and I know I've said it several times already, but *dread*.

""Cry yourself to sleep on the bathroom floor"" kind of dread. 

I don't think anything will magically change now, or ever. So I just want to die. But.. As stupid as this sounds, I just don't want to put in the work to kill myself, because I really don't want any of the options available to me. I'd much rather prefer to be in peace in a place where I can be treated, and where people won't hurt me. Somewhere that I can't just decide to kill myself if I get too tired.

I don't want to die, I just want to be treated well and be somewhere where it matters if I'm hurting inside or feeling suicidal. I just don't have thousands of dollars to spend again on inpatient therapy..

42,"I never thought I could feel like this again. I was taking the same anxiety meds for the pass 1 year and a half. This are the same pills I took in other occasions in the pass 10 years. Basically when I was diagnosed my psychiatrist gave me this pills that literally saved my life and the way I looked at life. Then there were points were I was good so the doctor gave me the normal procedure to stop taking them, but then à few months/years later my life come to shit again and I go back to him and I come back to the same meds. No big deal, we now that this makes me feel good.

Anyway, I did the go and stop like 3 or 4 times before, so I know how my body is used to this med and what it takes to stop it (venlafaxine). The thing is, I changed country in a phase I wasn't taking anything and I fell like shit again, so I went to my general doctor, explain my situation and told him I needed this pills to be good. He gave them to me and I was good till now (I start taking them again 1 year and half ago)

So right now my life is really good: have a good job, have and amazing boyfriend, amazing friends and really supportive family. And I only achieved all this things because of the meds, before I was in a really shitty position, not leaving home, my head always rushing with invasive thoughts, etc. But now I feel good so I decided: I think is a good time to stop taking meds again and go back to normal.

I went to the general doctor and told him this: I want the minimum dosage of the venlafaxine (37.5, I was taking the 70), but to the doctor give me like 2 or 3 months of pills so I can do everything at my own time and without pressure. He didn't undestood me and gave me 2 boxes with 7 pills each. I'm like: this will be to fast for my body, I know how this works on me and how the widraw can be terrible if a miss a day of pills. But I put myself together and tough: I can do it! Let's finish this!

Well I can't. I tryed, and my body is missing the pills like a drug (well it's a drug, no?), I'm not hungry anymore, diarrhea, feeling dizzy all the times. I knew this symptoms and I tried to hold them up, till today...

The anxiety is back. Is started to kick in, evasive thoughts, I want to cry with no fucking reason, etc. So I went to the doctor yesterday to ask more pills. It's close for vacation, he will only come back at the end of the month.

Panick, cry, pain, what should I do what should I do? I drived to work today crying. But when I arrived I drived back to the hospital. I'm at the hospital right now writing this and with my head thinking that maybe they will not give me the pills and I'll go back to the all suffering before. Wish me luck, I need this. I'm scared of going back to the shitty life I had before. With this I get to the conclusion I'll need this pills for the rest of my life or I'll never be happy again.

It started out as philosophical, spiritual conversations which is why I think I’ve been so generous with the absurd things he’s told me. But I recently realized that I’d be embarrassed to even tell someone else the things he tells me that he so firmly believes.  
He believes he’s “jumped ahead of his timeline” and has altered it and experienced his future multiple times. This comes with a slew of symptoms (which I 100% believe he struggles with)- derealization/depersonalization, flashbacks, deja vus- but he refuses to believe have any practical cause. He believes they’re a consequence of tweaking and experiencing his future too many times. But, when his past selves awaken (from the state of consciousness he was in when he was tweaking his timeline) he’ll return back to normal.  

The symptoms are consuming his life and he refuses to give credit to any practical thing I say.  He says that he’s considered everything, and he’s finally figured it out. It’s turned into me getting frustrated and him being upset with me for not believing/understanding him. I need space, I can’t keep sacrificing my time, sanity, and friendship just because I know friendships are healthy for him.

45,"So i have had depression for a good 10 years at this point, i have been on the end of my rope more times than i can count (surprise but its due to shit that happens with family half or more of the time) so im currently on meds to help the depression but my issue is that the medication causes me to have insomnia.

The insomnia can last anywhere between two and ten hours sometimes and it sucks because i have summer school (1 on 1 tutoring with a teacher really) so insomnia already fucks with that, then about an hour after i get home from school i just pass out on the couch from 11:00 am to around 8pm and can't really do much in my day.

One thing though, we have several cats (and chickens though that's a bit off topic)
and one of the cats only seems to want to be around me. This cat in particular will just sit next to me for 2+ hours just being there and i can't seem to figure this out but having her next to me does something to me because i find that during the early hours of morning (when she is right next to me) i can sleep.

I can't seem to figure out why, but i can sleep no issue when she is there and it feels so damn good to rest without crashing.

So my question is this:

Can i please get some help figuring out why this particular cat (out of six cats) helps me sleep and seemingly just makes my insomnia disappear?

46,"Hi everyone. I swear I'll try to be brief but I apologize in advance if any of this becomes hard to read as I go on. TLDR at the bottom, of course. 

As the title implies, I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have been hospitalized five times for suicide attempts between my sophomore and senior years of high school, as well as a seven month stay at an inpatient facility shortly before I graduated from high school. I have been on a laundry list of medications and I have never even had side effects from them (other than restless leg, thanks zoloft,) let alone actual changes in my illness. Nowadays, though, I have no health insurance and have not seen a real, licensed therapist since I was 18. 

Before you suggest, I have researched and sought out low cost therapy in my area to no real success. I'm not sure what exactly I need, but I didnt find it there. I have called hotlines and have had some pretty unhelpful experiences with all that I have tried. I am already relying (too heavily) on my small network of friends/support. My family is not safe and they aren't really a part of the situation. My father has always had inappropriate emotional boundaries with me, my mother is very distant and almost died when I was a teenager because of an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder, and my stepfather took advantage of her illness at the time to sexually abuse me for months and then emotionally and verbally abused me for a couple years afterward. 

My wife (also 23F) is one of the few people who I feel have ever actually listened to me and understood me about these things and she also has severe mental health issues of her own. We work very hard to maintain a good relationship. Our boundaries are pretty healthy (I think. She knows most of my lifes story and I know most of hers, we trust each other and neither of us have done anything in 3 years to make each other feel uncomfortable or unsafe. I also try not to lean too hard on her with my burdens while also being honest about them. It's a fine line.) We communicate every day about whatever we need to. As far as I'm concerned, our relationship is totally solid and safe and I love the shit out of her. 

Honestly, though, that's part of the problem to me. I want to spend the rest of my life with her but I also feel like a hollow shell of myself and still have suicidal ideation most of the time. She is aware of this and I talk about it with her when I'm worried about my short term safety. But I feel like things are closing in on me. I'm struggling to work even part time and she hasn't had a job in a month or two. I dont have the means to get into therapy and I cant seem to hold down a good job for very long because I want to die most of the time. How do I even start to get out of this horrible pit I'm in? How do I set aside everything I feel about myself and everything that's happened to me- my fault or not- and get on with my life?",30Jul2019,1

50,"There's so much. I'll try to cover them all.

I've made a lot of mistakes which can never be redeemed.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 years ago, I had a girlfriend . Now whenever I have a girlfriend it seems, there's crazy internal rage which I can't help but act on. I do not wish to harm others, what ends up happening is I get intrusive thoughts about her about me, about our relationship. &amp; i understand the thoughts are not real &amp; throughout it, however bad the thoughts get...I STILL KNOW IT'S MY MIND SNAKING ME. But what happens is...I ask ""What If???"" &amp; this only makes the intrusive thoughts get really REAL. Seems like there's a guy in my head who tells me ITS NOT REAL (ON REPEAT) &amp; another guy keeps yelling ""But What If they're real!l huh? huh??"" &amp; as the ""What if?"" factor goes on i begin to get more &amp; more enraged.  &amp; remember how i said how I cant help but act on it? Welp', starting when I was 15-16 i ended up severely  hurting myself (resulting in nasty scars &amp; lots of blood) on a daily basis to get the thoughts out when I was with my first girlfriend..   
I have a bad amount of slice &amp; burn scars, &amp; I used to punch concrete &amp; metal that didn't dent. Sooo, that resulted in a flattened knuckle (never had my knuckles checked but i for sure know my knuckle is flat...You know how you can grab the skin over your knuckle &amp; stretch it out? Yea, mine has no stretchiness). &amp; sometimes i get random arthritic pains in my hands. Also used to hit myself in the head with my fist, until i saw stars. Tbh writing this is kind of difficult because i trained my brain to FORGET A LOT. By deleting everything that would remind me of the past. But it gets me thinking (We're supposed to learn from history.. Right? &amp; not make the same mistakes?). WELL I CAN'T FUCKING HELP IT. &amp; no matter what I do, meds, therapy etc. I literally still cant control the rage at all. Continuing on from ""About 2 years ago, I had a girlfriend"". When i was with her for the first few weeks all was fine &amp; DANDY. just how i want things to be. it seems the more love i have for a girl the more enraged i get, and they never understand when i try to explain. They kinda just take it the wrong way &amp; get offended. But in reality, all i want is (\*Held in a cry\*) to literally be happy with a girl &amp; grow together. but every relationship I have THE SAME SHIT OCCURS. &amp; tbh im getting really worn out knowing i may never have a companion due to my fucked mental state during a relationship.  I value relationships so much, not just being with a girl but friends too. I do value being with a girl more though.  Due to the factor of love &amp; all things nice that come with it. ANYWAY I got off topic with that girl i was with 2 years ago, i experienced the rage &amp; it got pretty bad, &amp; i got really violent with myself, so out of nowhere the rage &amp; I decided smashing my Samsung Galaxy on my forehead would be a great idea. I always hurt myself, there has never not been a time where I haven't. Now i have a decent sized scar dead-center on my forehead FUUUUUCK. I began to coincide with all of the scars i have on my arms &amp; legs..I CANNOT coincide with this forehead scar though. I tell people i tripped with my hands in my pockets...I can't stand myself. yet I think I'm a great, funny, &amp; talented in whatever i put my mind to. (Took up music 3 months ago &amp; that's literally the only thing keeping me from being with myself. &amp; I think I'm getting exceptionally good considering when I first started I would stare at the screen &amp; say wtf wtf wtf wtf. But then one day i said ""JUST MAKE IT"" &amp; From there every song I've made has been getting better &amp; better each time).

&amp;#x200B;

Now for something that I can't get over, &amp; won't get over.

When I was maybe 5-6 or 7, We got another cat. Not an ordinary cat in tghe slightest biut (Ik people probably say that all the time) Here's why I think he was so unique. I'll give ya the low down

My Mom worked at a place where they would test on bunny's, cat's, rat's, etc (smaller animals). So what ended up happening was a mis-shipment came in, &amp; basically the company decided that they were going to put all of them down. Well my mom &amp; her coworkers said ""Fuck that shit"" &amp; had the company put all the cats up for adoption. &amp; since my mom worked there, she could see all the cat's personalities. Especially when they were let out for play time. Anyway, she'd observe them. &amp; she came across this one cat that was peachy orange &amp; he basically would never stop playing, even when he was confined. Seeing this, my mom thought he'd be an interesting fella to add to me &amp; my moms life. (No Dad, never had dad since he was always doing fucked shit &amp; winding up in jail (24/7 365)). His name became Riley (For he was always riled up). When we first brought him to out home he was dead scared of the other cat we had named Tabitha Who was of the ragdoll breed, lets admit they're not the brightest. but they're fucking soft &amp; cute asF. The litterbox was in Tabitha's realm (Kitchen). &amp; Riley would never dare step foot in the kitchen. Soooo what ended up happening is, Riley started acting all weird on the couch &amp; all of a sudden he takes a humongous shit right on the couch. You could tell he was holding it in for some time. So we laughed &amp; got Tabitha &amp; Riley to be good buddys quickly.  With not many friends, Riley ended up becoming my main mane if you know what mean. &amp; he was half indoor half outdoor. I'd go for walks with him down the road because he'd follow me around. He would look both ways before crossing the street. You could LITERALLY do anything you wanted to do to him. He was so lax. He would only bitch &amp; moan, never once were his claws drawn. He never inflicted any sort of pain, no matter what. He was also ultimately good with kids of any age, because you could do ANYTHING  to him, with no harm done. ever. 

Back to Tabitha because I just remembered a blocked out memory that typing all this has brought up

When it came to her older years, Riley was an adolescent by then &amp; he was outdoors with no flea protection...Guess what. 

FLEAS EVERYWHERE. Tabitha got severely infested &amp; quickly began to slim down &amp; not look so good. I was around 9 years old. So I didn't really have any control of the situation. Unfortunately. while we were trying to get the fleas out of the house, we put Tabitha downstairs. While she was heavily infested. &amp; this went on awhile. 

The day before she died, I went downstairs &amp; I spent a really really long time with her. &amp; when i left her I said ""I love you Tabby, this will probably be the last time i see you"". Then proceeded to go to bed, the next day after school, I went downstairs to say hi to Tabby &amp; I just saw her lying there. dead as a door nail. 

Remembering that just made me bawl my eyes out

&amp;#x200B;

Back onto Riley. So he was my absolute best friend, we grew up together, chilled outside. &amp; while Riley was still alive we rescued a dog from the SPCA &amp; brought home Ziggy dog. (We got him for nothing. Because he was in the kennel for so long &amp; nobody wanted him. He's a mix of boxer, bulldog &amp; pit bull. He's beautiful looking &amp; his personality may be high maintenance but that's beautiful as well. He gets along with pretty much all other animals besides dogs. That's the one thing that make him flip his lid &amp; go all attack mode. Well Tabitha is out of the picture at this point &amp; i was 16 when we got him. ) Riley &amp; Ziggy became tight af. Riley would take over Ziggy's dog food rather than eat his own cat f

 

I was 18 years old &amp; One day I was working &amp; during the evening around 6-7 my work received a call &amp; said i needed to leave &amp; call my mother...May sound fucked up but my first thought was my grandfather had passed away. I was ready for that but not what happened next... I called my mom &amp; she was crying heavily &amp; i kept asking whats wrong whats wrong!!!??? &amp; she says ""I ran over Riley, I'm on the way to the 24/7 vets. please meet me there"". So drove as fast as I could, not caring if i got pulled, because I wouldn't even pull over even if i ended up getting the flashing lights behind me.  go ahead chase me.

I got to the vets &amp; the vet put me in the room with Riley &amp; my mom &amp; said im sorry but theres nothing i can do. Then the vet gave us time to grieve with Riley in arms. After I asked my mom to be alone with Riley, &amp; i just said goodbye &amp; how i love him more than i loved anything  My heart began to shrivel &amp; my brain could not handle it. YO that was my best friend man. &amp; That opened up a deep thought, which was ""If I'd ever see him again"". Never was baptized or brought into a church setting, ever. Never religious or spiritual or anything. I believed Nature was God. But one thing Nature doesn't do as God is, have a heaven or hell or ANYTHING. Ya just die &amp; decompose. Now that though if id ever see him again OBVIOUSLY doesn't make me feel good with nature being God. because I would never see him again. &amp; that opened my eyes to believing in something rather than logic. I'm very logical &amp; for me to be like ""oh theres a god all of a sudden"" is kinda the only way I can deal with it. When you get something taken from you that was sooo special  &amp; loved. You just feel like screaming because there's so much pain but you can't do a single thing at all. Well with me anyways.

I mentioned Ziggy while Riley was around because another coping strategy of mine is thinking that Riley's traits rubbed off on Ziggy &amp; Riley lives within him still. &amp; IM SO AFRAID OF MY DOG DYING. I feel terrible being at work when i feel like i should be spending all my time with Zig. Or even hanging out with people. All i think about is seeing my dog &amp; the last remnants of Riley within him.

I'm 21 now &amp; after all that time I cry as if it had just happened.

I feel like i wasted 2-3 years being sad, motionless, defeated, tired, etc.

So there's more but i feel as if i typed the most detrimental parts.

Idk what I plan on getting out of sharing this, but maybe theres a window I haven't looked out of yet. idk. Things just seem far gone &amp; lost. I'm pretty much fucked. I can't have the two most loving things on this earth. The love of an animal &amp; the love of a human (WITHOUT IT ENDING)

Nowadays I just wish i didnt wake up just like how old people die sometimes, peacefully &amp; 100% dead. No attempts, no battles of wanting to be alive &amp; wanting to be dead. Just dead. Whenever i come across suicide in my mind, i can assure you I won't. just because my mind is too bitch to let me do it. So what i do is destroy everything thats good for me so i have 100% SHIT (Self Sabotaging), &amp; maybe. just maybe, i could kick my own bucket. But it never seems to work &amp; I just make my life 10\* more awful than it has to be.

If you can relate please. Please, let me know how you handle it, please &amp; thank you.",30Jul2019,1
51,"Let me be flat out here, I am an atheist, and at my most humble I am agnostic. A fear that has been with me for a few years now has become increasingly worse. As the more I notice the feeling of ""time flies"", the more I think about the inevitable death of myself and my loved ones. 

Recently, my dog passed away who has been with me my whole life, we had to put him down, he was too old and was constantly getting sick etc etc. Of course losing my best companion has made this so much worse, and I can only think of having to experience this happening to my parents, siblings, friends, SO, and dying myself. 

Just sitting down and thinking of not existing for all of eternity makes me feel so trapped, theres nothing I can do about it and it's coming so fast. The argument made that it feels the same way as not existing before birth isnt necessarily true. If our lack of existence is split up into 2 sections (before birth and after death), section 1 came to an end, but section 2 will go on forever.

Every couple weeks though, for a few days my mood will become super sour. I view myself as useless and as a plague to the people in my life. I snap at my friends and act generally more mean.

61,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: rape, child molestation/sexual assault, threatening, manipulation, intoxication

I should start with the fact that I haven’t been officially diagnosed with PTSD. I do have depression and anxiety, and plan on starting therapy hopefully in the new year and talking to a qualified specialist then about all of this for a diagnosis. 

Also I’m on mobile, English is my fluent language, go easy on my feelers if I make a grammar mistake please.

Long story, bear with me. TL;DR down below.

Names, apps, and locations have been altered because I’m still in fear of retaliation. Ages have not been altered.

——————————————————————————
The Story/Background.

When I was 13, I was on an app called Cool!. Back then, Cool! had an in-app webpage thing where you could connect with people in your area. 

My username attracted interesting people, my abuser  (we’ll call him Bryce) being one of them. He contacted me first, and I engaged in conversation with him a lot. I told him I was 18, but once we met it was obvious I wasn’t and I told him the truth. He said he didn’t care though, he said I acted mature for my age. He was 36 at the time. When we met, we agreed to meet one evening in a little sort of park area in my neighborhood. It was a private corner behind some tennis courts, so no one was really going to bother us. We sat in the grass and talked, he put his arm around me, and eventually before I had to go back home he got me back into one of the hidden corners of the park and pulled my pants down. I let him do it. I didnt fight back. 

After that, we still talked through Cool! and through various encrypted apps. As it progressed, he would be picking me up after school, taking me to his apartment, we would get high or drunk and have sex. Then he would take me home right when I asked him to. He was always good about getting me home on time, except for a few circumstances. That lasted for about a year. He didn’t have a job, and he had pit bulls he refused to get rid of, so he got kicked out of his apartments and packed his stuff and went home to Oregon for a while. 

He eventually came back to New Mexico and lived with friends, but ended up going back and forth between New Mexico and Oregon. His ex got ahold of one of his dogs at this point, and he had to give one up to the pound. He only had one left that he took with him wherever he went. I loved that dog. We were sneaking around then, since he didn’t live without roommates. Usually all we did was just get rooms at various cheap motels because that’s what I was, for whatever reason, comfortable with. 

After the second or third time he had to go back to Oregon, we stopped going to motels and he would just take me out by the lake or into the desert and pull off where there wasn’t really anybody and we’d have sex in the back of his car. One time, his car got stuck in a ditch along a desert highway, and it was too close to my curfew. I was in a dress, but I decided to just hitch hike and hope someone would come along and take me home. Thankfully, a mountain biker came around and went to get his truck. He brought me home, and I was safe. I realize how much more dangerous that could’ve been, but I got lucky to live in a place highly populated by religious peoples. 

Bryce and I fought over the fact that I ditched him there, but it wasn’t anything new really. We fought a lot and it wasn’t the first time. I slapped him a few times and he got extremely angry with me but he never hit me back. It was scary though. His angry face scared me. He would go weeks at a time without talking to me, just ghosting me and then all of a sudden popping back up with a “hi” text. I was always stupid enough to reply to his texts right away, but I knew if I didn’t he would just get angry with me. 

In summer a few years after we met, I hung out with a new friend group, and they made me actually happy. I had met someone there that actually treated me decently. I officially broke up with Bryce in early August, even though for months leading up to that I made it very clear I was uninterested, I no longer wanted sex so everything done was nonconsensual. From there, things just got worse.

He threatened me, would create fake phone numbers just to text me horrible things, faked a suicide on the phone with me, and guilt tripped and manipulated me. I changed my number at least three times, and eventually gave up and got a new phone completely, but he still got it through someone we knew mutually and texted me. I gave up, and kept him unblocked only because it was easier than blocking six numbers a day. It was minimal contact actually, maybe once every few months after awhile, and he continued to manipulate me when he did contact me. 

A few weeks ago, he called me in tears telling me he’s going to show me why I should’ve cared about him, etc etc, saying he’s going to kill himself and it’s my fault. I told him I didn’t believe him, and he wasn’t going to find any sympathy from me because he was constantly pulling guilt trips like this, saying he was going to kill himself. I blocked him and he hasn’t tried to contact me since. It shook me up though, and I decided I should just come clean to authorities about the entire thing sooner rather than later. 

The whole thing since I initially reported him has given me extreme anxiety and stress, I can’t sleep, I’m terrified of everyone’s judgement, I’m tired of living in fear of him going through with his threats against me every day. On top of that stress, authorities have failed to keep in contact with me regarding the case and it seems to have been dropped altogether. I’m afraid to reopen it because when I tried they yelled at me and made me cry. 

——————————————————————————
What Made Me Come to This Sub.

I’m afraid still of him coming to my house and harming me or my family, I know he has access to guns and I know he’s addicted to drugs and isn’t afraid of losing what little he has. I’m afraid of going out in my town in fear of running into him. 

At night, I keep myself up for hours on end thinking about everything he did to me. I wait for taps on my window or banging on my front door, for my dogs to go crazy. I give myself panic attacks just trying to do everyday things. 

If I make plans with anyone, or even for myself alone, I have to make a strict itinerary and back up plans and I try to always make a way for me to get out of the situation should I need to. I end up writing, and rewriting, itineraries a thousand times before the trip straight down to the socks I plan on wearing each day. Even if I’m going across the country, I get nervous about going to the airport in case he stalked me and somehow knows I’m going to be there at 5:38 AM to catch a flight to so and so to land at 12:19 PM. 

It’s just hard for me to do everyday things. Even driving through town if I pass the motel he had sex with me in when I was blacked out and unconscious, or down roads he took me to do explicit things, I have to go home and cry. 

I’m tired of feeling like this, like I’m just a fool who fucked myself over to begin with anyway. I’m tired of being afraid, of dragging down the people around me because I can’t get a grip. I can’t wait until I can afford to start seeing a professional to actually pick all this apart..

——————————————————————————
TL;DR.

When I was young and dumb, I met a much older man on social media who manipulated me for a handful of years. When I finally put my foot down, he threatened me for months. I relive a lot of the memories and I’m constantly afraid of him. It affects me heavily in things as little as trying to go across town or sleeping at night.",30Jul2019,1
62,"I'm trying to find information about olfactory hallucinations but I'm confused about a lot of the things I'm finding. I kind of want to hear more personal experiences with this if possible. Can anyone give me an in-depth explanation of theirs or the hallucinations of someone they know? When / why / where / how they start, how long they last, etc. I also really want to know if they can be set off by actual existing smells and just spiral from there. 

I'm having a really bad time with some smell tonight that no one else is smelling. I'm bipolar and I've had plenty of psychotic symptoms in the past but not olfactory hallucinations, so I'm concerned that it's a new thing that's starting up. It seems like it's making me smell actual things differently too (ie hand sanitizer smells horrendous to me right now and not like hand sanitizer at all). I feel like it might've been set off by the smell of onion in the dinner my mom made tonight but it definitely doesn't smell like onion anymore and I've also never had any issues with the smell of onion before.

I did text my therapist about this, so I'm not coming here instead of seeking professional advice, for what it's worth. I just really want to hear other peoples' experiences with something like this so I have a better idea of what might be happening.",30Jul2019,3

64,"I'm not sure if anyone else here is facing the same issue but sometimes I feel completely fine and my mind feels free but others times I am a mess and feel trapped and genuinely have dark thoughts (self harming etc). Anyway a bit of background info: My ex who was my first love and I was crazy in love with her broke up with me and now my life has fell apart. When I was with here everything looked good, I was motivated, I could see a bright future now its dull and I don't want to do anything at all, sometimes I feel nothing. It's been a few months since the break up but I still don't feel any better. my friends advise me to maybe try and find another girl but I really don't want that right now, I feel awful. I have a job and I am very demotivated because all I can think about is her. Often when I am feeling fine it's because im gambling and it takes my mind away from everything however I know this isn't healthy/stable but it just helps. I genuinely don't know what to do. I don't want to go back to the stages of self harming but I feel so shit right now. I only have like 2 friends who I have told about this and I am not sure I want to tell anyone else.

As of late I’ve been getting flashbacks of repressed memories. I was sexually abused in my childhood and as an adult. I do not want to be a victim anymore(A victim of the future nor of the past). I’ve written about my first encounter with sexual abuse but have difficulty in coping properly. I don’t want to kill myself but sometimes I do just want to disappear if that makes any sense at all. The pain and hurt I feel inside lingers and I’m a person who feels intensely. I used to keep my emotions in and now they either release in crazy spurts or they are repressed.

67,"I've gone through mental health and anxiety for 10+ years now and recently I had an issue with a friend that has been a huge pillar of support for me for the past 2 years

I was on holiday with a couple friends when I had a panic attack and started to notice one friend started to get fed up with me, sighing at everything I did, I tried to apologize for the panic attack I had but was met with a negative response that they didn't want to hear it and later that day they didn't want to be around me.

Upon getting back from the holiday they completely cut all ties with me ostracized from the friend group, pushed away. I turned to another friend for help and it seemed to be getting better. Though they cut ties again and had another big panic attack about losing a friend who has helped me out so much. 

I lost my job last year due to anxiety and have been struggling month by month financially since. I have been actively looking for a job to try and better my situation. 

During this panic attack I just couldn't take all this negativity and the pressure from them telling me to get a job. So I just said ""I'm done, I can't take it anymore. I'm terrified of working and the pressure from friends. I just want to disappear"" and turned off my phone so I didn't have to see it. I later got a knock on my door from the police after a friend called concerned about my life. I was honestly ready to end it that day

I got myself into a better place, talked to Samaritans, went to doctors and been referred to CBT to better myself. 

I decided to remove the friend who was causing all this stress from my life. I then get a message from the other friend who was helping me through this telling me I've been extremely manipulative and Its unfair what ive done.

I understand I'm an *** for doing this, I just need to get away from it. My friend proved they didn't want to be friends anymore and I don't want to harm them anymore so I removed myself from it.

Not sure what to really do in this situation. The friend that was helping me through this has now turned against me calling me the bad guy and being selfish",30Jul2019,1
68,"Being 17 and having autism is stressful enough on it's own, but over the past several months, I've been getting easily stressed with most stuff, especially around my parents...

There have also been a few random days in the past couple of months where I would feel empty, very irritable (more than normal), and have no motivation to do anything. I have no clue what caused me to be like that.

Another thing, I hate being on the autism spectrum. It holds me back from doing everyday things. There have been times where I would have trouble with one of those things (e.g. having a conversation with someone), and I would get upset that I'm like this, and I might even start crying.

Also, I've never particularly been suicidal, nor have I ever wanted to die, but when I'm upset I sometimes imagine myself attempting suicide (e.g. by jumping in front of a moving train). I'm not sure if that counts as a suicidal thought, but I thought I'd add that anyway, just in case it is.

Before anyone says ""See a psychologist"", ""Talk to someone"", etc, I'm currently seeing a psychologist (I only saw her once, because my previous counsellor recently went on maternity leave), but I don't feel comfortable talking about any of this. My parents found out that I hate having autism, and that I don't feel comfortable talking about my problems, but I didn't tell them anything else because I don't trust them. I only have a few friends, but I don't talk to them much anymore. I don't really trust some of them when it comes to this stuff anyway. Whatever I get told to try and help me, I'll just forget anyway. I also have ADHD, so my memory isn't great.

70,"forgive me because it is 230 am ... but, when I consider going to therapy I see it as so pointless. I see EVERYTHING predetermined by looks and extraversion. I used to be relatively extraverted at around 16-21/22.  I am 25 now for reference.I remember thinking I wasn't good looking but I had X, Y, and Z to make up for it. But now I am so certain that I know the truth.

But, ever since this new job I got, I feel so concrete in my views. I feel it to my very core that those things that used to make me special, either don't apply anymore or never did. I feel like I am leered at when I am in public, especially women around my age, however similar treatment is common among most of my peers (being leered at, cold indifference) regardless of gender. I have been left out of group activities so many times I just cut all my friends out completely, as I was already pretty much 'phased out' . 

I do not know what it is about me that pretty much dooms me for a solitary existence, but I feel like therapy would just be a cope for my already hard 4/10 existence as is. Life is so much more hollow without human connection, but I just accepted ' I am not cut out for it '.

I’m trying so hard to do better but nothing’s ever good enough. My friends and girlfriend keep pushing me so hard to eat more but thinking about eating all of that just makes me wanna cry, so I tell them to take it slow.

I'm a teen writer and gamer. I play WoW. I wanted so bad to get into role-playing (collaborative writing) with other players on it for years but my social anxiety stopped me. I met people who changed that. It was going so well.

I have deep, complicated issues with how I empathize and relate to people or personified things (e.g, fictional characters) and I honestly thought I had it under control, but I think I went wrong in accidentally playing a character *way too much like me,* maybe? It's more than that but I'm sure it doesn't help.

This is so stupid and trivial and pathetic and that's why I feel so sick in the head over it, but my character fell in love with a friend's character, basically, and was led on and then let down super abruptly. I could get into reasons why this was an extremely damaging event for said character, and why it shouldn't be for me, but I'll spare you. Also, no, I didn't know this was going to happen. We don't plan things, but maybe we should now.

I'm now feeling *everything* this character is. The hurt, the jealousy, the shock, confusion, the ""What could I have done differently? Why did I do this? I regret it."" And it honestly doesn't help that the character has a history of self harm and suicidal tendencies like I do. I'm in pain. I want to hurt myself. I can't sleep. I feel sick. I feel mad at the other character. (not the player, I know the line between fiction and reality, my emotions are just somehow tangled with my character's. The player of said character is an awesome person and I adore her) I feel betrayed.

I already plan on stepping away from my character and making changes so they're less like me, but the damage is done. His emotions are now mine for some fucking reason. This is stupid. I feel a like lunatic. ""Oh no my ChARACTeR IS hURT I'm HUrT nOw"" what the fuck? Who thinks like this? I'm better than that. I know fiction from reality. My character isn't me. I was never in love with this person.

I don't want to ditch my writing partners. I don't want to let whatever's wrong with me ruin a good thing. I want to beat this, but the damage is done and I'm so lost and it hurts so bad. I want it to stop. I want to undo what happened, but my partner isn't okay with just retconning everything and I'm not even sure that would fix it. And, sadly, this happened with her main character.

83,"I moved abroad to go to medical school in 2012. I always wanted to live abroad and I it really helped me find my personality and my identity away from my family. 

Up to 2015 things were pretty ok. I had a group of friends, multiple girlfriends, I had lost a bunch of weight. But I was also kicked out of med school for not passing classes. In my uni you have 1 year to pass or else you get kicked out and you have to reenter and attend all the classes of the subjects you didn't pass(meaning you can't just reenter and do the exams, you have to go through all the miserable classes once again).

In mid 2015 I had enough with my friend group. I found no commonality with them anymore, they would never want to go to places I suggested, I got tired of following them around and them not giving a shit about what I wanted to do or go to. I lost a bit more weight toward the end of 2015. 

In early 2016 I started putting on weight. I was the lowest weight I'd ever been at that point (95kg, \~20%bf). By July 2016 I was 110 kg which I thought was not that bad I'd bounce back. At the same time I had almost no friends, just the occasional hi from some portuguese guys and went out with them once for the whole semester. 

At the end of 2016/early 2017 I got kicked out again for not passing classes. The amount of study it takes to even come close to pass subjects like Anatomy, Physiology is surprising. It takes months. At that point I was very isolated even though in class I would always talk to people and try to connect with someone but it just seemed like no one gave a fuck about being friends. Everyone already had their friend groups etc. 

At that point I was so sad I just had to go back home and recover a bit mentally. I took some painting classes and was home for 3-4 months and was feeling better. By July 2017 I was 120kg. I reentered the university in Sept 2017 and worked very hard to make friends and I did. I still hang out with these 2 girls from my country. But there's not much commonalities with them I just have to avoid complete misery. Also I'm in my late 20s, they're early  20s which doesn't help either. It's like being in high school at times, and I don't mean that in a good way. 

I kept attending my classes (by this point this was my 3rd time redoing these classes which was complete misery, all I wanted to do were the exams but they don't let you so I had to waste 1 year attending all those classes again). By July 2018 I was 130kg (\~39%bf). I managed to pass 1 of my classes in Jan 2019 and I thought I'd do the same for the other 3. But now I have to pass 3 exams in the next month, haven't opened a book yet because of my depression and guilt. And now I'm also 136kg. (180cm). 

&amp;#x200B;

Extreme guilt is due to my parents paying 10k euro per year to attend university, plus another 10k to live here. I feel like I wasted their money, I don't think medicine is that bad it's just so time consuming and extremely difficult. You have to sit on a chair and study for 10+ hours for months just to have a chance of passing. 

I was also studying engineering back home from 2010-1012 and gave that up because physics was a nightmare so that reinforces my family's view of me as this quitter and impulsive person. I have a million relatives that will ask me every fucking time why I gave up med school, and that feels so bad. My parents are very difficult people to talk to because their reaction is very unpredictable. If I told my dad I wanted to leave I don't know if he would explode in anger or say you can do whatever you want. If I tell my mom or my sister about how lonely I feel they would blame me like they always do that I don't get out enough, even though I tried all the time talking to many people but it's so rare to click with someone. 

Should I just go back home? I am so tired of being miserable 24/7, feeling guilty for my parent's money and my exams at the same time, I haven't been close to happy in over 4 years (I'm already a pretty pessimistic person so I don't really know if I was ever that happy). What if I regret my decision? My relatives will constantly judge me and I feel like no one understands and I just can't take this misery for much longer. Since I've put on all this weight it multiplies all those feelings and I stopped wanting to have sex or relationships since I have back fat folds now and I'm just in this pit of misery where I know the only way is through but it just takes so much effort to do anything.",30Jul2019,1
84,"Hi,

So I've been severely depressed for the better part of the last two years, but I have always had some sort of depressive/anxiety disorder for the better part of this decade. I never liked going out, meeting friends or having the ""typical"" teenage experience. I was usually alone just searching the web mindlessly or playing a game. To be honest, Im not sure if I was depressed then because I felt fulfilled - I was in a community, played games, met some amazing people. However since then the community has died and I've slowly been going down a path of emptiness and I don't know how to get out of it. But I am most definitely depressed now, Im not longer excited about anything, everyday is the same, Im too afraid to try anything new and I just have a horrific self esteem. I feel that I'm too badly damaged to even begin to fix, I have no idea where to begin.

I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. I feel lazy with 0 energy. All I want to do is stay in bed, not be happy or sad and just browse the internet. I am in college but I find no passion in what I do, I just do it to please my grandparents who I live with to be honest. I'm in an absolutely terrible position and I've not got the slightest clue on how to fix it. I broke down in tears today because I feel that at 21, I've wasted my prime years and that I'm so far behind the rest of the world,  I just don't see the point in living or trying to get better. I wasted the best part of my life and I'm devastated. To add insult to injury, I've also become very bitter, particularly seeing successful people. I hate it, I hate the sense of jealousy I get from seeing how rich all these young people are, meanwhile I'm stuck in a rut, unable to find the slightest bit of happiness in my life.  I told my doctor about this last year, I was on 20MG fluxotine for about 6 months and I don't really think it helped.

You are all important. My name is Jason River Thompson and I am spreading Mental Health Awareness. So I decided to make a YouTube series where I talk to people about their Mental Health. 

The aim is to end the stigma and let the people know that they are amazing.

Staying hydrated can help improve your mood, your energy levels, and your ability to concentrate. Not drinking enough can make you more fatigued and cranky than usual.

I feel like my life is already over at 33... from now on, I'm going to get older and older and increasingly lonely. 

I have a job which is okay enough and allows me to live. I have met a guy recently and we have been dating. It's too early to say if its going to last... but I'm hiding my depression from him for now. I have this capacity of putting a happy face on.

90,"All my life, I've periodically experienced brief spells of the most intense depression I've ever felt.  I have diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder, but these spells feel different from that, and have no correlation with how well my mental health is doing overall.  I may be doing really well as far as my major depression goes, but these spells are still just something that happen.  

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I am having a great day.  I am doing well in my life, my mental health is well-managed, but I just had 2 minute depressive episode.  No psychologist, therapist, or psychiatrist I've ever spoken to has ever heard anyone describe something like this before.

&amp;#x200B;

These spells last anywhere from about 15 seconds to 30 minutes, but never longer, and are a mix of the physical and psychological feelings of depression.  Like my brain isn't having intrusive or depressive thoughts and I'm not actually sad or down or depressed, but I \*feel\* like I am for a short amount of time.  I don't know if this makes any sense?  It's almost a mixture of the feelings of intense depression, dysphoria, anxiety, and home-sickness all together for usually about 5 minutes on average, then it goes away and I go about my life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a small child, I called these spells the ""don't belong feeling"" because the feeling didn't belong and it made me feel like I didn't belong-for those 5 minutes or so, it almost hurts so badly that I can't bear it, and nothing makes sense, no one understands it or me, and it's not worth trying anymore.  I don't genuinely think any of things during one of these spells and the thoughts don't cross my mind, but looking back at trying to describe what these are like, these are some of the closest ""feelings"" I can think of to describe it.

92,"For a while, I had an anxiety issue. I saw a few therapists about it, and while they helped a little, I figured out on my own how to worry less about life to the point where I don't have the same deep anxiety I did. I was able to figure out what I wanted from college and my future, and I'm very happy I did that. 

However six months ago I injured myself pretty severely, and have been limping through recovery. Most of my hobbies were active, so this has been pretty tough for me, and my parents think I have some deep anxiety about my injury and want to make me go back to therapy. But I told them what I need is a sports psychologist who knows how to help athletes cope with injuries specifically. I guess I'm having trouble proving to them that it's my injury that's bothering me and not some deep-seated anxiety. 

My mom went so far as to suggest I shouldn't go back to school, which I think is ridiculous because after I transfered schools after freshman year, most of my anxiety vanished. 

It's hard to talk to them when they don't think I know myself. And I don't really know how to make it clesr, especially when my mom thinks mr sticking up for myself is me disrespecting her. What I need is for my parents to understand that I know me and what my flaws are. I need them to stop projecting an image of a different me onto my present self.

93,"I don't know where to start. My life has all the ups and downs but mostly downs. I started to hate myself/ my life. about to give up. 

Just a brief history ( apologies for my bad writing skills) 

My life wasn't the typical happy childhood til high school life. I always had no one to talk to or to chill with, Highschool was hell, as its always stressed at school with no friends and going home was another stress as I will get lectured for no reason or just get my family anger ventured on. 

Leaving home moving to a new country was something that I was excited as ill be here alone and it felt like a new start but problems followed from home. it felt like the same thing on replay. until I met my ex. she helped me a lot and opened my mind to this world, helped me with my suicide thoughts. 

but my family wasn't happy with her and started to trash talk. the worst part was they send my sister to where I am for her studies. This affected me so much as I hated them esp my sister. They even force me to stay with her which I declined over and over again ( which was successful) but they keep calling me and annoying me. Things I tell them not to do they do and at the end when they screw up, its always my fault. typical phone call would be like just full of trash talking and lecturing. 

Recently my girlfriend (ex) broke up with me due to my family being rude and annoying towards our relationship and her having no more feelings for me. We have been in a relationship for at least 3 years. All problems I had, they blamed on her. I feel so bad as I could not protect her. Ive tried my best to shield her from my families negativity. but I failed. 

We currently still live under the same roof but we are quite stuck in a complicated situation cause we are renting. We can't just terminate the contract and move out as there are some regulations here that makes us liable to pay rent until the agents find a new tenant. ( which is shit). Therefore from this I want to ask her to be together as I still have feelings for her. she declined and said that she can't. ( I know I'm selfish in this part). 

We did talked and another reason why she decline is that her friends keep influencing her not to, ( yes those are opinions but adding stuff like im the worst and don't deserve any chances). Also with them not understanding the whole situation.

I don't want to talk to my family as they will end up lecturing/ attacking me. I don't have friends that are caring enough to listen or I just don't want to bother them. 

I have no one at all now. I sit here all day, skipping class, no mood for anything. I'm at my breaking point.

I really don't know how to type this as I have so much emotions going through me now. 

All my bad thoughts are coming back.

I have seek professional help before but I find it useless. it didnt help with my suicidal thoughts at all. so I choose to stay away from these people. 

I just want someone to talk to maybe some advice on life. 

I do wish things will be better but its been so long already, more than 10 years. I am losing hope.",30Jul2019,1

I've made friends and went to concerts. I've begun looking seriously into going back to school, I started DBT, I have a great psychiatrist and therapist.

But despite all of that, I'm getting worse. More than half of my suicide attempts have happened this year alone. I started self harming, I've been admitted to a psych hospital, I've been more lonely than ever, I'm getting severe anxiety attacks.

96," This ones a long one...

My oldest brother is Bi-Polar Schizophrenic with depression through in for good measure. On the 29th must after midnight he starts acting funny, getting up and going outside repeatedly, forgetting where he put things etc... By 1am I know for certain he's having an episode, just before this point he's in his room and I hear pill containers opening and closing I wasn't certain if that's what I was hearing, but I go and check on him and sure enough he's gotten into his meds. His medicine is separated into 4 different (hard to open all at once) containers for all the ones he has to take at different points in the day, it's 1 weeks worth. In the past before his meds were managed by someone else (that's not me) he had a habit of accidentally overdosing on those medicines, he'd take some and then forget and take some more, and again, because I had to call 911 so often we were nearly on first name basis with EMT's.

On the 29th I had not even considered this as a possibility because meds were being managed and he was doing a lot better with this one thing. I thought he was having an episode: grogginess, slurred speech, excessive drooling, inability to get up by himself, seeing things that were not there or thinking things were going to happen when there weren't. This is normal for him during an episode, so after he tried to repeatedly get into his bed (and I did try to help him best I could but he's a very big, very heavy guy and I'm small and weak). I guess he decided the floor was close enough cause that's where I found him in the morning, upon waking him he was still very groggy and was still slurring his speak (still all normal for him), I mistakenly, for a while believed he could get up on his own and for a time I tried to keep him alert and trying to get up, he made some attempts but if I wasn't standing in the doorway talking to him he would have gone right back to sleep.

I thought maybe he needed more time to sleep it off so he dozed while I got ready for my PT appointment, while I was waiting for my ride I tried again to help him get up, I clasped his hand with my right hand grabbed doorknob with my left and made a few attempts to get him upright, needless to say it didn't work and I really couldn't do much because didn't want to re-injured my shoulder. I essentially ran out of time, I had to go to my PT appointment, so I went but not before telling him he needed to work on getting up and to text me when he did.

So after my PT I had errands to run and that's what I did, I was considering finishing the rest my errands for the week so I didn't have to go out again, but in the end I decided to go home because my anxiety was starting to make itself known, one of my fears is going out for something I have to do and coming home to find someone not breathing. I get home and my brother is right where I left him. I'm trying to encourage him to get up while I'm tidying around the house cause I am fairly certain I will be calling 911 at some point that day (another fear is people being in my home while it's a complete disaster), I only cleaned and cleared enough that the EMT's would have space to move around. In hindsight I probably should have called them right away, but I didn't do that and it's contributing to some the guilty feelings that I'm having.

So I call and they come and decide to take him to the hospital, I found out a while after that that they've admitted him to the ICU, sedated and put him on a ventilator. They really weren't sure what was wrong with him and after doing a bit of detective work with his meds my sister in law and I discovered he'd taken a weeks worth or nearly a weeks worth of his Seroquel. We were told by the doctors that since he'd overdosed A: he was probably going to be there awhile, B: it caused him to have seizure &amp; C: it's effecting his kidneys. What we don't know is if he was just really confused during his episode and thought he needed to take them or the scarier possibility that he took them all intentionally.

I feel guilty I didn't call 911 sooner.

My sister in law thinks he may need to go into a home for a while, the part I feel very anxious about is: he and I live at the same residence he pays rent and I pay utilities because neither of us can afford to live by ourselves: If he goes away for awhile what happens to me? Is that selfish for thinking about that when he's in such bad shape? I just really don't know what to do about anything anymore, I am so stressed out.",30Jul2019,1
97,"Hi, I’m (21, male) not sure if this is the right subreddit but I don’t know where else to post.

I know it’s quite common to mimic people you’ve met and mirror their mannerisms, however my case is a bit more extreme. It’s not necessarily copying, but I just don’t know how else to call it.

I have a weird craving to become a certain type of person, and it changes extremely often. For example: I’ll see someone tattooed and with lots of piercings, and I’ll suddenly want to be like that - not only in terms of visual aesthetics, but also their lifestyle, how they behave etc. The next day I’ll see someone being a hustler businessman and I’ll suddenly want to be just like them instead.

The main problem for me with this, is I want to **really** commit to one “lifestyle”, go all in and take it to the extreme. Currently I’m really into philosophy, and self-help content, but I also really like grungy and dark fashion.

Objectively, one shouldn’t prevent me from doing the other, but in my head, these things somehow clash. My mind is telling me that I can either be a grungy, depressed person and carry myself as such at all times; or be someone who reads a lot, drinks craft coffee and likes minimalist fashion.

* Depressed mood. Fatigue. Lack of motivation.
* Irritability, lashing out towards others.
* Mild dizziness.
* Inability to fixate vision. Due to aripiprazole, most likely. Appears randomly in the form of attacks in the evenings.
* Waking up at nights with gibberish-like thoughts.

Old, no longer existing symptoms:

* Pain in my shoulder associated with my heart rate.
* Extreme dizziness, hypochondria.
* Hypersensitivity to thoughts, ideas. Inability to control flow of thoughts.

an example is the other day I had just finished a tv show that ended on a nice romantic scene the guy and girl got together and were nice and happy.

this is where my mind kicked in and It is like ""what the fuck are you doing you fat waste of organic materiel no one will ever love you like that you will die alone with no one who gives a fuck about you"" and stuff along those lines then I feel like shit again until the next tv show and for those next few hours I'm not thinking and not feeling like shit.

I'm sure everyone will be like go to therapy and talk to someone and stuff like that but I don't even know why I am like this and think like this and I would have no idea what to say.

112,"My brother is 20 years old and dropped out of high school at 16 years old. He was suppose to be taking online classes to graduate with a diploma but he eventually stopped doing that as well. 

History:

The last 15-18 years was quite a hard time for our family. My mother was addicted to pills (ranging from vicodin to adderall to ambien). My dad worked mostly out of town as a truck driver, trying to provide for his family because my mother refused to work because of all her ""health problems"". My dad often times having to stay a night or two a week out of town, we were left to fend for ourselves. Growing up being the bigger sister of 5 kids, I assisted in helping raise/shelter/feed my siblings the best I could. I moved out as soon as I could but would do my best to help still whenever possible. 

Our mother would consistently fall asleep while standing up, leave the stove on and pass out, filed false police reports to get more pills, stole pills from family members and my siblings after their surgeries, she pushed me when I was pregnant with my now 7 year old, threatened us kids telling us we would be sent to separate foster homes and never see each other again if we told anyone about this because we were ""horrible kids and the reason I'm so depressed I have to be on meds"". Like the shit that came out of her mouth was horrible and the things we witnessed and endured between the manipulation, the physical aggression when we would take her pills and hide them/threaten to flush them and the threats were horrible. 

My dad/mothers relationship was horrible growing up. My mother would use us kids as leverage against him (you'll never see your kids again, I'll say you abused me, I'll say you raped me, etc). I witnessed him cry multiple times because all he wanted was to be there for his kids but he also saw no easy way out of this. I think he loved her also even though she treated him so horribly &amp; cheated on him so many times. 

My mothers pill addiction was traumatic to say the least. She would either be normal and look like she was going to be a real mother for a change a few times but I think she just got better at hiding it. Myself and my siblings had walked into her bedroom to find her unresponsive at least twice where we had to call paramedics. My father eventually divorced her 3 years ago and she continued on her path of destruction. She left my youngest brother to live with my father and never once really put forth the effort to have a relationship with us again. Instead she chose to surround herself with men who abused her and friends who would feed into her addiciton. This addiction eventually killed her last year, my sister walked in to check on her at her home and found her again for the last time. 

So as you can see, our childhood was not the best and my brother being the youngest was basically around that shit all the time. He would game so much (I think to escape the reality at home) and had no real set rules to follow. He did not respect my mother, nor did any of us really. I'm sure he witnessed quite a bit being home alone with her after my other siblings moved out but he never talks about it like it bothers him or that is what is on his mind. He has left the house a few times these last few years to stay the night at another game friends house sometimes but rarely does things in public anymore. 

The issue at hand:

Come to today. He hasn't held a job longer than a few days. He is in his room 22 hours a day either sleeping or gaming. He will come out of his room to socialize with family briefly, feed/take his dog out or to eat/use bathroom/bathe. He started seeing a therapist but isn't consistent with that and also is on medication but I'm unsure if he is taking them or not. (My siblings and I have a huge phobia of getting addicted to pills now). He refuses to get a job claiming his anxiety is too much to handle but requests money for games or a new headset, etc. My father I think feels guilty for the past with my mother that I think he gave in a lot to his demands but now he is trying to put his foot down and motivate my brother to get a job, go back to school or do something. Everytime this is brought up my brother either yells/screams about how he wishes he could be normal, threatens to kill himself, goes to his room/slams the door and locks it, or he just ignores him. 

What I've tried/suggested so far:

I am a nurse and work in the Emergency Department as well as have a history of mental health problems of my own so I try to use both experiences to help guide my brother on a better path. 

I've tried having conversations with him in a civil and calm manner. Tell him about my mental health issues.
-do one task a day to ease into things
-go for a walk with the dog to get motivated
-I have bought him new room decor/bedding to have a change of scenery to help motivate him
-offered job interviews
-offered small jobs to help me out that I'd pay for
-offered to bring him to treatment for mental health
-offered to pay for him to go back to school
-invite him to everything, even if he gets mad when I do
-suggest more time with the therapist (the therapist for the last year says baby steps is best??)
There are a lot more but these are the main ones.
All these ideas always either get shot down or he gets angry and when he is angry it is actually scary. I fear that if I/dad push him too hard that he will hurt himself in retaliation but he needs help.

Any suggestions on what you would try/do to motivate him? 

TL;DR: 20 year old brother refuses to leave the house claiming his anxiety is too bad to get job/go out in public. My dad wants him to get a job and get motivated but whenever the subject is brought up his mental health problems, suicide threats and angry yelling happen everytime. Unsure what to do now.",30Jul2019,2
113,"A man I work with, is well liked and appears to be generous.  

It’s a conflicting situation when you work with someone that everyone likes but your intuition is saying something else.

I have been assaulted in the past, so I feel a bit sensitive to how people conduct themselves on the job.  He acts friendly but he’s always trying to find ways to interact w me and eventually put his hands on me.  

Recently at a dinner he stuck his fork in my plate, and on another occasion, he asked if he could have a sip of wine, from my glass.  

These little actions have been adding up.  On another occasion when we checked into our hotel he followed me (hotel staff - we weren’t alone) to my hotel room - he claimed he wanted to see the view - which was absurd.    I told him again- he’s not welcomed &amp; thought the view things  was BS 

This man (after I’ve told him several times) continued to send me gifts after I told him NO THANK YOU.    

He did it again -  which I didn’t have the opportunity to hand it back - I will be sending it back via MAIL - so I don’t have to do it in person. 

he did several more things that crossed the line.   

His actions are Very subtle but was enough to warrant me elevating it up, and telling my bosses.  

I guess I’m writing to say-  before I was feeling anxious about saying anything but now I’m glad I did.    

We have to work together for one more month (including traveling).   Hopefully he will respect the boundaries I have been fighting for and stay out of my way.  

The Good  news is that my Boss will be traveling w us.  

Keeping my fingers crossed that he gets the message  from the Boss &amp; the rest of my job (that I love) will be problem free.  Maybe awkward but that’s no longer my concern.",30Jul2019,2

115,"Hi guys &amp; gals, I don’t really post that much so I apologise if I go off the rails a bit..

I guess I’ll start with where I can remember, I was 16/17 and smoking a hell of a lot of cannabis at that time (probably about quarter oZ a day), so much so, I couldn’t support myself financially and a friend suggested I go into supplying (which I stupidly did). 

At that time I was already suffering with anxiety and depression as-well as the cannabis messing with my head (which it did WITH ME - everyone’s different) .

It all came crashing down when I got arrested and charged with a multitude of charges ranging from kidnap to supplying class B drugs, I was found not guilty of all charges apart from supplying the cannabis which I plead guilty to (couldn’t really wriggle my way out of it).

I then ended up on a drug rehabilitation order as per the judges request and got clean for a year, went to probation for a year, got urine tested twice a week and I actually got myself into college around half way through probation.

This is where it got a bit awkward for me.. the same week my probation ended was the same week my exam was for college, I failed the exam.. I thought I’d aced it with flying colours but just crashed into a heap of flames, it reaffirmed in my mind, I can’t do anything right.. I can’t achieve anything.. I’m not good at anything?.. why me?? And since then I started using cannabis again (not excessively.. quarter oZ will last around 2 weeks now), constant cycles of self hatred, self loathing, anger, I just want to see the world burn? Why?? Because I’m a fuck up??? 

I’ve lost so many people because of how I am now, I’ve got no friends, even if old friends reach out to me, my mind just doesn’t want to know, it’s like my mind is comfortable on it’s own?? 


And my psychologist says I’m ok?! 🤔😳",30Jul2019,1
116,"Hello everyone.

I'm Cooky. I have been battling depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I just realized that what I had been doing to my body was more than just *starving myself out of self hatred* or something of the like. It was a legitimate eating disorder and I was just in denial since middle school about it.

Life at home is hard too. My mom doesn't believe in seeking help for mental health and that it's just something you need to ""Grow up and get over it."" She was, and still is, very verbally abusive. Due to this, I grew up naturally hating myself because all she would ever tell me is how many flaws I had and I grew to hate everything about myself because I didn't fit *her standards of being a female*. I'm very much a tomboy, but she believes that I'm not and that I'm a girl so I should act like one.

Ever since I was 4, she would tell me how no one would like me as I am and that no man would ever love me, that I'm not worth anyone's time because of my personality and that I have a vagina and not a penis so I should act like my assigned gender. The thing is I've just naturally been more on the masculine side. I played football in middle school, behind my parents backs, and got really muscular because of it. I find joy in having muscles and I want to get to that point where I'm muscular again since I lost all my muscle mass from my eating disorder.

I was also bullied from 4th-the end of 7th grade and lost my best friend to suicide in 8th grade. From middle school to halfway through high school, I had attempted 16 times. Music had prevented me from attempted a 17th time and it caused me to promise myself I would never attempt again. That was in 2016 and I haven't attempted since.

The reason I am sharing all of this is not for pity. I want people to know the majority of my story in order to understand why I am as messed up as I am. I grew up without the feeling of a mother. She called it tough love and that's how she grew up (she's from the bahamas) but that's not how things are or should be now. I know it's something I'll never be able to change but for years it's felt like I just had this woman in my house with me, not a mother.

Now that I'm entering my senior year in college, I have met the most amazing woman that I consider to be my on campus mom. She makes sure I'm fed, I talk to her about everything, and she genuinely cares about my wellbeing because she sees my potential where I can't. Her alongside the head of student services and the counseling services on campus have helped me push through some difficult circumstances on campus and I am so thankful to them.

I know that I am writing this on a whim, but I wanted to discuss this because even though I am trying my hardest to deal with all my mental health, I still feel like I'm not good enough. It stresses me out and frustrates me how I just can't seem to get myself to like myself let alone love myself. Why is it so hard for me to see my potential and all the things I can do well? What it is going to take for me to get where I want to be and how I want to see myself?

I could use some encouragement in my journey ahead. Being a content creator I tend to share my story on different platforms in hopes to help others, but lately I just feel like I've been de-progressing with each new post I make and it's visible that I am. Between the struggles of eating and my anxiety being off the charts, I'm just very lost and still stuck behind all these masks that I've put up to protect myself.

Any and all help or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and I hope have a wonderful days ahead.",30Jul2019,1
117,"There was a full white cop car in the parking lot outside my house ( had the city name and badge that would be on a cop car but no other markings ). Then a man dressed in uniform walked into our yard but left along with the car when he saw me looking at him. He didn’t leave any paper to notify why he was here / if we did something wrong, he didn’t knock on the door either. He only walked up to the door, stood in the yard for a few seconds, and then left. 

To make it worse I was getting over the feeling that I’m being watched / followed by the authorities. This completely reset that and I’m sitting in my yard now, shaking, keeping watch.  With every car that drives by I feel my heart stop.

118,"I feel incredibly torn on this one, for starters I'm not a fan of large social gatherings, they tend to trigger massive anxiety. However, I feel partially obligated to attend as two of my children are involved in the ceremony. My daughter as a flower girl, and my son is to be the ring bearer. If not for the bride, who stood with my wife and I at our wedding, it is for my children, and this moment in their lives, that I feel obligated to attend.

A few years ago I was fairly close to my in-laws, and was a regular attendee for various family events. In the past few years I've grown far apart from them, much of this coming about through my own journeys into addressing years of mental struggles. I'm really not certain as to the best course of action in this situation.

The thought of potentially placing myself in a situation which could easily result in a panic attack, or some other episode is disconcerting to say the least.

Any input or insight is most welcome. Though I do have an appointment with a psychiatrist next Monday to (hopefully) obtain a proper diagnosis, and begin treatment. So I'll be attempting to discuss this there as well. It's just something I've needed to get off my chest for a while and my current lifestyle has me somewhat removed from most aspects of life.

119,"I've been dating my boyfriend for about 9 months now. We were very good friends before that and I've known his family well for a while.

Just this month, his mom died after courageously fighting cancer &lt;/3 She was in hospice for a while and her death wasn't unexpected, but obviously it's taken a toll on their family and on me as well.

My boyfriend is still in high school, but he's handed everything so maturely. We don't talk about her much, but he always seems to have it together and it appeared to me that he was doing better.

Immediately after her death he became distant, which I totally understood. Sometimes he would seem really excited about coming over, but towards the end of the night, he seemed very disinterested in me and wouldn't touch me or try to hold a conversation, etc. This did upset me, but again, I understood. I just hate it when I can't make him feel better. I'm leaving for college soon, so I won't see him very often. Maybe that's upsetting him too.

After that, things were pretty normal. We've been texting a lot more and he's seemed happy. However, for the past week or so, he's been making allusions to depression and suicide that are very small, but I've noticed and I'm beginning to worry.

For example, whenever we have a long day ahead we'll say ""don't die"" jokingly. Earlier today he told me, ""I think I just died... not mad.""

Yesterday he was popping some mints in his mouth and referred to them as antidepressants (which I know he doesn't take.)

The other night he said something about it being ""time for suicide,"" then corrected himself, saying something like ""suicide time is all the time."" It just came out of nowhere.

He's just not one to joke about death or other serious matters, so I've just been a little concerned. I always offer up my help with anything he needs, even unprompted, but he never accepts.

Am I overreacting? He's always been the happiest guy. I just worry about him because he doesn't like to talk about his feelings, and maybe these allusions could indicate that he's having a rough time. I've been there before, and the dark jokes seem off to me. I just wonder if I should bring it up with him, and how to go about it so he's comfortable opening up. I really just don't want him to hurt himself or feel like he's alone. If he needs help I want to help him reach out.

tldr; my boyfriend's mom died and he started joking about suicide, should I be worried and how should I approach him?",30Jul2019,8
120,"Honestly to talk about myself (because I damn deserve it after dealing with so much bullshit). I'm not quite sure why personality disorders are so vague and misunderstood. I mean, unless I'm just defining myself incorrectly, I noticed I exhibit narcissistic/borderline traits.

Now I do have empathy, or at least I think I do, because I do certainly feel guilt, anger, fear, frustration, and sadness. I do love others, just that it feels like I can't really ""pull"" it out genuinely. Not sure how to describe it but I seem to struggle showing genuine empathy without feeling like I'm ""exposing"" myself or ""making myself weak or foolish"". 

I am seen by others as very calm and collected, polite, and even good looking given my body type for a guy. I have had people describe me as an 7.5 or an 8/10 (which is honestly something I'm okay with). But I've had this irrational sense of anger and bitterness towards others. It's impossible for me to genuinely love someone without feeling like an empty person.

If I were to describe how I feel constantly, it's a sense of emptiness with the occasional angry/bombastic rush I'd have. I fantasize about having unlimited control and money, being seen as a ""savior"" in a way since I do an incredible job at my current management position. But I always felt like getting revenge and torturing physcially those who treated me like I was worthless or pathetic. I genuinely say this from the bottom of my desires that would love to see them fucking get killed. 

I've struggled with money, constantly spending it recklessly on things for the sake of collecting, more than helping those close to me. And it pisses me off, while at the same time I can't really stop it. I fucking hate myself, yet I believe I have a God-given right to be above all others. I want to be recognized as a God, but the way life is structured, I seem to STRUGGLE with that.

The only person I ever fucking loved or had feelings for (it was a 2 year relationship(called me an absolute ""psychopath"" who happens to be psychotic and obsessive. Like who the fuck does she think she is?? I've had multiple relationships in which I may have unintentionally cheated on, and was considered as very dismissive or detached.

121,"For a bit of context, my parents scream on a daily basis.

I always never phased me, and my mom would always tell me to just ignore my grandma because that's just the way she is, but for the last few months, I've become much more reactive. I'd gasp and jump when hearing them scream, worry in my bed that I'm not doing enough and it's my fault in some way, or talk back to my grandma's rants.

122,"As I’ve grown into adulthood I’ve completely lost motivation or desire to improve my life or get to the point where I can support myself. It helps that I have parents that are supporting me (as long as I’m going to school) so maybe that’s making me feel more okay with doing nothing as I don’t have the urgency. But I still am confident that if I was kicked out I would proceed to be homeless and do just enough to get by.

I’m on Lexapro and it seems to get me to function day to day (enough to wake up and meet basic needs) but I still do not want to participate in life at all.

No desire for socializing at all. 

It seems like depression but it’s so deep in my thoughts and desires that it just feels like I’ve been robbed of a will to live or to have a future. It’s like a passive form of being suicidal. I think about buying a gun every day but it’s like I’m too lazy and also a little scared. I don’t want a permanent solution but I don’t want to live in my current situation.

Therapy only helped me from day to day, not with the more profound feelings.

123,"I guess this is gonna be more of a rant, TLDR at the bottom, I'd still appreciate any replies whether it's tips and advice or just sharing your similar stories.

I've always had a severe problem with social skills. Depression on and off since childhood. It tends to come and go in waves. Later in my teenage years I developed bad anxiety and panic attacks. And here's the problem. Ever since I got that under control, my social anxiety has turned into misanthropy. I ignored these feelings for a long time, until I graduated and started working in customer service. You can already guess that made my hatred towards people worse. I can no longer push these feelings back and pretend they'll go away.  I decided to face the problem, thinking that's the first step towards solving it. That's where I went wrong. I feel that now that I've accepted it, I'll never be able to go back.

big rant ahead, skip if you want to: 
Though I probably sound like I'm stating the obvious, the human race is so fucking toxic and shitty. I don't know why I'm still surprised by that. People go on and on about being nice, positive, equal, etc etc, then shit on other people whenever they get the chance. Bullying until high school was bad, but experiencing the same shit from grown up ass adults is what makes it even worse. It's unbelievable. And it's got to the point where even the smallest things that set me off - someone talking to me in a slightly different tone, people looking at me in a weird way, hearing jokes about me and my job (apparently working retail and doing deliveries makes me less of a lerson), customers yelling and calling me names then expecting me to respect them as if they're gods, friends leaving me for someone more outgoing and fun as if I'm some kind of a disposable trash, you name it. I feel like I've become a magnet for human hatred and stupidity. Everyone is so fake and only cares about trends and their social status. Relationships are built on stupid games, playing hard to get, useless texting rules and purposely being a dick to the person you like. rant over

I genuinely try to be nice to everyone and I don't think I'm overdoing it, I can never imagine being a dick to anybody. What goes around comes around, yeah? Bullshit.

I tried moving to a city far away from my hometown. Three different therapists. Meeting new people. Changing the way I see the world and people. No result. It always goes back to this sad, lonely, misanthropic way of seeing things. I can't cope and at this point I don't feel like changing it. And everyone comes up with shitty advice like ""just accept that, don't let it get to you, blahblah"" it. doesn't. work. period.

Quick timeline.

Age 4 - Parents divorce

Age 8 - molested by uncle

Age 10 - First suicidal ideation

Age 15 - First BF, disruptive teenage years. Fought with my mom alot - she took me to a halfway house but didnt make me stay, first anti depressant, first self injure, first pill/ER visit

Age 18 - Same BF (on/off) multiple partners in between, abusive relationship for 3 years.

Age 20 - Left BF, immediately dated someone NEW BF, became an alcoholic (drank every day to black out, abused xanx) repeatedly drove drunk, cheated, became the physical one.

Age 22-  Left BF for new BF, kept drinking, cheating, fighting.

Age 23 - DUI, got sober, stayed with (newest) BF

Age 25 - Lived with BF, broke up with him after 3 months of living together for new guy, started smoking pot instead of drinking.

Age  26-27 - Became an urban explorer/photographer. Slept with multiple people, had an array of gentlemen wanting my attention, continued risky behavior, climbing rooftops, hanging feet off 40 story buildings, bridges, exploring abandoned warehouses/tunnels/buildings, pulling all nighters to shoot photos, driving to trips on my own, no sleep go to work the next day.

Age 27 - Met my husband, got married and pregnant within 6 months. Fell into a deep depression during pregnancy, grilled him about his previous relationship/babymama, hated his guts.

&amp;#x200B;

Age 28 - Delivered son, traumatic incident in hospital, left with intense anxiety, couldn't sleep when son was born, was worried he was going to die, I have always felt since the minute he was born that something was going to take him a way from me. 

Now I'm 30, I love my son more than anything in this world. The one thing I'm good at is being his mother. I would do anything for him. My husband and I are still together, we have our ups and downs but we are working on things. I go back and forth from adoring him, to annoyed of him. Nothing he does is ever good enough for me, I constantly pick at him. I dont want to be this way. I dont know how to stop, but he sees the ugly in me. He sees what I try so hard to hide. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is committed to helping me, as long as I help myself. I'm trying. I still smoke weed (only at night to help me sleep) I am completely faithful to him (though the beginning i just wanted my old life back). I feel like I know right from wrong so I try to always make sure I'm doing the right thing.

But my every day life is so hard, my constant mood changes, I can feel good in the morning, bad by the night, or vice versa, or all day up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I make a lot of home cooked meals, sometimes I cant even bring myself to start the oven for a frozen dinner (but I still do bc kids). I find some women to idolize on IG for a few days/weeks were I try to imitate how they would be and than return to my old boring depressed self later. I cant concentrate, I'm forgetful. From November - March I was taking my family out every weekend for grand adventures, playing tourist or doing a ton of activities, drinking redbulls non stop every day. March - coming down, seeking help, quit redbulls, started medicine, has been a constant up and down since started medicine. Dont feel like its helping. In the begining I was feeling SOOOO GOOD. Even connected with ex babymama and became friends w her, even thinking she was the greatest to eventually hating that I thought that baout her and wish I didnt even extend myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so lost, but I want my son to have a stable, happy, healthy mom. I want my husband to know that every day, is going to be the same loving stable women. Not this, what am I going to get when I get home women.

129,"Does anyone here feel like they have been misdiagnosed because of a medication that they’ve been prescribed?

I feel like the industry is set up to fail at effectively treating a patient because they trust the medication more than they trust the patient. 

My story, if you want to read it (not necessary... I really just want to know if people have had experience with this):

I was taking two antidepressants (Zoloft and Wellbutrin). One is known for increasing anxiety and I was struggling while on it. I went to a psychiatrist to help me figure out the right meds for my dysthymia and GAD. 

Psychiatrist took me off both meds and put me on Paxil. Paxil caused mania and I took myself to the hospital because it scared me and I was having impulsive thoughts of self-harm, which is not me AT ALL. I’ve never been suicidal until that day. 

Then he took me off of Paxil and put me on Lamictal. Told me that Paxil hates me and that I am bipolar type 2 (first time anyone has ever said this to me).  I had never, ever had mania in the past. 

Lamictal makes me feel even more out of my mind. I’m unable to sleep, no appetite, no happy thoughts, only thoughts of wanting to die, etc. My senses explode and I can barely wear clothes or handle things even touching me. My muscles are tense all day which is causing bad joint pain. 

I tell the doctor the Lamictal is not working. He then tries the following medications in order without taking me off of anything (except the Xanax). Xanax, Trazadone, Ativan, and finally Zoloft. I begged to be back on Zoloft because I have a long history with it working well. 

I tell doctor I want to get pregnant (which is true) so then I start weaning off 4 medications at this point. I’m almost done. Lamictal has about half a week and then Trazadone. 

If I wouldn’t have been prescribed the anxiety inducing med to begin with, I never would have had to go to a psychiatrist who kept piling medication upon medication on me. 

On top of it all, the psychiatrist doesn’t believe a word that comes out of my mouth. He won’t remove the bipolar diagnosis and doesn’t listen to me when I say I’m not. I guess I don’t know what is going on with my own brain. 

How is it that I go from a fully functioning person who had dysthymia and GAD into a bipolar mess who can barely function in life without having a massive meltdown? I feel like it’s the industry’s fault and I made this post wondering if anyone else has had the same experience.

Planning to start therapy soon but I am having some anxieties about how to discuss suicidal fantasies and thoughts. 

I doubt I would ever be suicidal so I would start with talking about the things that would block me from ever doing it. 

But I also want to talk in great depths about how I think suicide makes the most sense for me, I don't see it as morally bad, research I do into the logistics of it and non serious plans for it.

My fear is my therapists gets the wrong idea and thinks I am serious about it. It would ruin my life if somehow my employer or family found out about any of my mental health issues so I want to be sure this doesn't happen.

Does anyone know of the risks here, who could a therapists potentially tell, should I censor myself a bit and not talk about everything on my mind, constantly reassert im not serious about any of it. 

Also wonder if i should mention I want to talk about suicidal fantasies and thoughts at first contact guess this would be on a phone or initial consultation or just say depression as an umbrella term and then talk about suicide while i'm in the session.

Particularly interested in UK therapists but would be happy to hear thoughts from anyone",30Jul2019,1
131,"Killing myself would be easy, and I don't deserve that. I deserve all the suffering that I'm going through.

It is my fault that I didn't pay attention to my health earlier.
It is my fault that I'm wasting my life.
It is my fault that I'm not able to help my girlfriend with her psychotic episodes.
It is my fault that I get too emotionally attached when she tells all this stuff about how she isn't ill, even though I know that she'll probably not even be able to recall that in two weeks.
It is my fault that I hate myself.
It is my fault that I stay in the bed all day.
It is my fault that I'm 20 and haven't earned a single cent in my life.
It is my fault that I'm not able to appreciate all the oppertunities that I'm given.
It is my fault that I can't have a good life in what objectively are good circumstances.
It is my fault. Not yours, not anyone else's - I'm the baddie. I am what is the worst thing about my life.

I never achieved anything meaningful on my own. This is my fault as well.
I'm not going to give up, but it's not like it matters. I'm still just as useless. Especially to her, who is in such an awful state. She doesn't trust me in anything I say, but it's not like I can blame her. I'm still baffled that she doesn't have to puke every time she hears my voice.

I'm trying to be supportive, but what use is a broken person to someone who can't comprehend their situation? Near to none at all, looking at my experience.

I know it is not her fault, but it hurts so much that she can't put any trust to what I'm saying.

I don't know what I can do anymore at this point. I'd just let her absorb the little life force I have to cure that shit if it were possible.",30Jul2019,4
132,"Hearing family/friends talk about the person they knew who committed suicide, I’ve heard a lot of things like “he seemed to be doing better” and “he was going out there and getting things done finally” or “he was planning out his future and seemed happier”. 

Why is that? The other warning signs are all something negative - depression, anxiety, loss of interest, irritability, humiliation/shame, agitation, giving away prized possessions etc etc. But relief/sudden improvement is (or should be) a positive thing. So why isn’t it a positive for somebody that’s suicidal? How would family/friends ever really know that this is a warning sign too? I personally don’t understand why this is a warning sign in itself. I’m not saying it *isn’t* a warning sign, clearly it is with how often you hear the things I mentioned in the first paragraph. 

Having those thoughts myself, and just with mental health in general you have good days and bad days, and sometimes you have really really bad days. But I never truly “improve” or feel “sudden relief”. So what is this warning sign actually? Is it truly sudden improvement? Or is it the suicidal person coming to terms with their upcoming death and not caring as much? Or is it something else?",30Jul2019,7

I start opening closets, looking under beds. I start hearing voices and seeing shadows that aren’t real. It’s terrifying. I go through these attacks and literally have to lock myself in a small space to calm down. I am absolutely convinced I am being followed and someone is in my home plotting to kill me and my family. Or that something bad is going to happen to me or my daughter. I’m embarrassed and mortified.

135,"Hi guys, how are we all? 
I'm just going to dive straight into this. 

I suspect I have BPD, like my moods are so stable and it's exhausting to the point that there is a strain on all my relationships and I'm so unpredictable. My brother is not talking to me and in general I feel like a shitty person and I am aware of it but I can't help it and I don't know how to stop. But at the same time I would describe myself as being nice enough like I try to treat everyone fairly, use my manners ect... It's kind of like there are two of me and i don't know how to change it. I often feel like I'm not wanted like no one has time for me and like I don't feel like I belong anywhere, I'm so awkward because of this. I'm honestly so confused and I don't know who I am. I also don't feel like a person. This sounds weird but when I look at photos of myself I look like a doll, like a little lolita doll. 

I want to die. Like I welcome death and I feel like it would be sooooo much easier if I disappeared. I don't feel like things can get better or change like I think I will always feel this way and that scares me.

Or like life would be better if I was skinny (idk why) like if I was super skinny then maybe people would actually want to spend time with me. (I'm 90kg btw and a girl, 19 years old.  I don't have an ed even though my relationship with food sucks. 

I use to think I was bipolar but I don't know.

I know I probably should go to a doctor but it's hard because if I was to be diagnosed with something it would crush me to be honest.  

I don't know what do you think?",30Jul2019,1
136,"Hi everyone, I’m not really sure who or where to go with this but recently I’ve had these feelings where if I don’t do something a certain way I feel like something terribly wrong will happen. For example if I don’t pick up a coin a certain way or flip it on a certain side I feel like something awful will happen to me or my family. This happens with numerous things. I was wondering if it could be ocd related or if it is a link to any other disorder or just a stress related situation. I’ve been diagnosed with “emotionally unstable personality traits, bipolar affective disorder (not otherwise specified) “ and have been told I have manic and psychotic snippets from a two day period where I convinced myself that I shouldn’t take my medication because the government was trying to kill me. 
I really just want to know if anyone has experienced similar things to this. I know this isn’t was this app is for.

139,"I really need help...  


I struggle with narcissistic abuse syndrome. My parents were psychologically abusive to me for my entire childhood and on into my adulthood. Due to this I suffer with depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and most recently diagnosed with panic disorder. I struggle with panic attacks regularly and self harm in the form of hitting myself, mostly my head.  
I am seeing a psychologist. I am only on my 4th appointment with her, but I do like her. I only get to see her every other week.  


My anxiety causes me to get ruminate constantly and eventually lead to panic attacks, and my panic attacks drain so much out of me so I sleep all day long. I have constant nightmares every night.  


I lost nearly a dozen jobs due to my illnesses. I would either get panic attacks before work and be too anxious to go, or get a panic attack in the middle of work and have a breakdown.  


Now I run an Etsy shop. I rely on this for my bills, and it was easier because I didn't have to go anywhere physical and could make my own schedule. I have been doing this for a year now.  
But now in the past several weeks I have been struggling to start work. I am so physically and mentally exhausted from my nightmares and morning anxiety attacks that I sleep the day away. I am falling very behind on my work which makes my anxiety higher. I can't seem to break this cycle and I worry about feeding myself and paying my bills next month.  


I am no no medications (though I have a doctor appointment set)

140,"So I recently had my first therapy session in years with a new therapist. It was rough and we didn’t even cover the tip of the iceberg as far as my background goes. It was very rough talking over some past things again and we had to slow down on a particularly sore spot due to going over time.

I cannot for the life of me concentrate on anything- mainly work. This is really not good since I am new and being trained in complicated things I’ve never done before. But I’m just completely obsessed with the things we talked about. I can’t get them out of my head. I’m also keeping track of things I’d like to work on in therapy in my notes. 

Thing is, my next appointment isn’t until two weeks. She did say that I can see her weekly at first instead of biweekly, but weekly is too expensive. I just feel so raw and I’m realizing things about myself and my family that I didn’t realize or thought were more normal than they were. I’m often on the verge of tears which is very debilitating and inappropriate at work.

144,"I was 9 when my mom was in a car accident. I remember my little sister crying, my neighbour telling me it was okay to be sad and my older sister being cold and distant like she always is when something doesn't go her way. I also remember not crying, caring or feeling anything. It's weird, as I was only nine and the only thing I could think about was that I didn't want to live in my dad's house because I liked my own house better.

I was 16 when my dad got diagnosed with cancer. He had to have a liver transplant and my mom didn't think of telling me until after he almost died. I remember thinking ""At least I don't have to tell him I'm gay if he's dead.""

I'm 18 now. I'm not a psychopath. I care about animals and I have friends. I don't love my parents, my mom has been diagnosed with narcissism and my dad hasn't specifically done a lot of bad things now, but used to scream a lot/get angry when he still lived with us. He loves me, but I don't care much for him after everything he's done. I think I love at least three of my friends. I'm not sure what love feels like exactly, but that's normal right? I'm sure nobody really knows, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm also an 18 year old so I know I don't know much of anything anyway.

I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 12. Mom didn't feel like following it up with treatment after learning of it, so we didn't really do anything with it after my diagnosis. It's just something a doctor once told me that I've completely ignored afterwards. Recently, I've started reading about it and other people's experiences with it. I've also come to terms with the fact that I have it.

I think a lot about people dying. Like legit people who are in front of me, I just suddenly imagine a car flying into them or me killing them in a graphic way I don't feel like delving into. It used to always leave me distressed and guilty, so I know I can't be a psycho/sociopath, right?

But I've always felt disconnected. Horrible thoughts that stick to my brain and my eyes that once terrified me, don't do a lot now. I can think of graphic and horrible things about people I care about, but instead of worrying about it as I once would, I force myself to think about it longer, visualize it better, pick apart the details etc. It feels like torturing myself, pushing my boundaries and forcing them back. Like pulling on an elastic wristband and seeing if I can snap it harder and harder. 

I'm kind of scared. I'm kind of bored. I watched knee surgery videos on jomi.com yesterday even though knee injuries make me extremely uneasy. I'm pushing myself to do things that I don't like and I don't know why. Sometimes I think because I'm kind of bored. I don't know what's happening to me and I'd like to know, but every time I contemplate going to a doctor, the thought of having to talk about the fucked up things I'm thinking about makes me not want to go. The fact that I've normalized the thoughts terrifies me. What if a doctor thinks I'm a psychopath anyway? Would I feel bad if I am? I don't know. I can't be, I've cried a lot of times about my deceased cat. I just want to know what's wrong with me, but I don't want a doctor thinking I'm a bad person.",30Jul2019,1

Note #3. I know the best solution to my problem is therapy. However therapy is not available for me because of various reasons. 

TL,DR: I noticed I have an anxious attachment type and it's ruining my relationships. What do I do?

Some background information I think it's necessary: on one hand, a mother who wasn't consistent with her affection and love. She believes the best way to punish somebody is to ignore them. She withdrew her attention from me (even at a fragile age) if I did something terribly wrong. I understand her motives and rarely question her good intentions since my father had some problems with alcohol and law enforcement. I understand she doesn't want me to become a man like him, BUT since they divorced when I was a toddler I didn't have a father figure, I didn't have nobody to go to if my relationship with my mother was temporarily rough. At this point in time I try avoid every conflict with her (sometimes completely succumb to her will) and keep my issues from her, not trust her etc. On the other hand, I had a relationship with a girl when I was 16. I consider this affair to be a turning point in my life for various reasons. It was that kind of love one will never forget. But one day, out of the blue shit hit the fan, she broke up with me for absolutely no reason, then we agreed to mend things but she started seeing somebody else in the meantime. I was so devastated by this that I even attempted suicide and became depressed. Here comes my mother again, seeing I'm a shadow of myself was heavily preoccupied with me, but expressed this in a completely inappropiate way which made me feel like every happening is my and only my fault. Since then I had problems with commitment and romantic relationships in general. 

Here comes the main issue.

A few months ago I met a girl (25) from a different country. Volunteer at a local non-profit association, staying until at least next April. A few weeks ago I just dropped her a message. She invited me to a coffee. And the next day too. It were these two occasions which have drawn us together and eventually started a relationship, sort of. I, not really feeling at my best because of various problems (including being anxious about my present state, future, carreer and relationships), felt like in heaven, redeemed. She understood my ideas, my issues, generally me, as a person. We are on the same page on intellectual and emotional level, however I'm having some doubts about day-to-day compatibility, slightly overthinking this aspect. We agreed to give this a shot, keeping in mind however, that she might go home in April. I was so attracted to her because of her inner and outer beauty, view of the world etc, I sat down, thought about it and decided to commit to this despite knowing it will end at some point. But since the discussion with her on this topic, constant anxiety has caught me... I looked up attachment types and I figured out I have an anxious attachment type. I identified some symptoms during the years, defining some of them as issues, some of them, mistakenly apparently, as personality traits. These include:

- feeling anxious whenever I'm not physically close to my partner. I observed I usually start fights and am generally more prone to an unsettled state of mind when I'm farther away from my partners. Day-to-day activites are generally fine when I'm around them, I'm emotionally stable etc. 

- a strong feeling I'm not good enough and they will potentially leave me. The girl I'm dating right now left for a week to a different city for a scientific conference. I accepted she can't always be on the phone since she's busy and somewhat calmed my brain to accept it. However, one day she met some street musicians, clicked with them and they went out for a drink. She said she felt very good in their company. My asshole brain responded to this with a burst of jealousy and a fuckton of questions. I know she didn't cheat, however the ""what if one the guy is far better than me?"" pops up. Alongside this, I'm always questioning why would somebody so wonderful be with somebody like me. I'm afraid she will leave me, completely out of the blue. 

- a fear of expressing my needs and asking her to do certain things, not disrespecting her boundaries and independence obviously. This include asking her to not stop a conversation so suddenly so I know she's actually busy and isn't plotting against me. 

- a fear of my needs not being satisfied ever and a strong feeling she doesn't care about me. I can't really say she doesn't care about me. I know it and observe it. She does it her way. But when the anxiety kicks in, I cannot properly evaluate her actions and words, feel severely and neglected and feel that the relationship is doomed. 

So I'm asking you, dear Redditors. What the F do I do know so my romantic life won't be a mess during my whole life and I can actually enjoy my relationship and instead of anxiety I feel love and loved? Any help is appreciated.",30Jul2019,3

157,"This will be very hard to read, and believe me, it's much harder to write. Ripping of the bandaid- Both his feet were crushed, the left foot had to be amputated and he will need few more surgeries to avoid losing the right one. He also had compartment syndrome in his right shin (very, very long recovery) and he's not allowed to put any weight on that leg, meaning he's bedridden at the moment. He started the recovery at my place but now he's back at hers and I'm seriously afraid for his mental and physical wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go on any tangents, I have to explain how important he is to me. He's not just a friend, he's the brother I never had. This also ties to why his girlfriend is a terrible influence, especially in this situation. Some people say they would die for you, well he literally died for me. Few years back I was roofied in a bar, he confronted the guy as he was dragging me out and got stabbed. He was dead on arrival but they managed to revive him. My family always liked him but after that incident they started seeing him as their own. We are his only family and they call him their favorite child. We've been inseparable for over a decade and some of his girlfriends found that weird so we just tell them I'm a lesbian. I'm actually bi but have never been in a relationship with a man.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to his girlfriend. She likes to consider herself a micro influencer, basically she's doing nothing but spending his money for instagramable pictures. She has this notion that only weak people can be victims and it's his fault he got stabbed and nearly died years back. You can imagine how dangerous she is for someone recovering from an amputation! They had a very toxic relationship from the start. They would fight non-stop and all I could do was comfort and advise him. Once he let slip I'm actually bi, she threw a tantrum and became a whole new level of jealous. They fought even more, eventually she became physically abusive and he finally broke up with her. He packed his bags and left around 4-5 in the morning after fighting for almost 24 hours. The adrenaline wore off while he was driving, he fell asleep and that's how the accident happened. The hospital called me cause I was his emergency contact, I had no idea they'd broken up and desperately tried to reach her. She didn't pick up so I sent her a text saying he was in an accident. Her reply infuriated me, she said she doesn't care if he drops dead.

&amp;#x200B;

He took the news of his injuries better than anyone expected but was going crazy in the hospital and they discharged him under my care. I talked to everyone I could think of, psychiatrists, occupational therapists etc and we came up with a strategy. We hired a fulltime caregiver that could transfer him to a wheelchair (he's not allowed to put any weight on his remaining leg) and adjusted the house so he can move around and at least go to the bathroom on his own. The occupational therapist came around few times, he had physical therapy every other day, he had regular sessions with a psychiatrist and 2 more surgeries during the time he was staying with me. He was unbelievably positive about it all, loved when people came to visit him and enjoyed going out in the sun. I died inside every time we saw someone staring or turning around for a better look but he would say in few month people won't even know he's missing a limb. We even started fostering a litter of kittens. We always talked about the future and the next steps. He wasn't particularly bothered even when the fitting for a prosthetic limb got delayed. He applied and was approved for participating in a trial for a new walking aid that puts all the weight on the core, meaning he would be fully mobile way before his right leg was fixed. He made a list of everything he wanted to do and even that was lighthearted, the first thing was helping me with a chore I'm famous for hating. He was in a very positive environment and he talked about his feelings instead of bottling them up or lashing out.

&amp;#x200B;

Then a bombshell, he decided to get back with his ex. I never told him about the text and in hindsight, that was a huge mistake. After a week or so he decided to move back in with her. I asked her for 1 thing only, to adjust their place so he can have the same level of independence he did in my place. He left and I had no contact with him for 2 days. During the first week she fired the caregiver, then the occupational therapist called to tell me they're not picking up. We were only communicating trough texts and eventually he told me that he keeps his phone on silent and only texts when she's not at home cause she's jealous of me. I went berserk! It's extremely dangerous for him to transfer to a wheelchair on his own, yet she's leaving him alone for hours at a time. I didn't sleep for days, I was wide awake and waiting for the next time she goes out with her girlfriends so he can text me. One time I begged him for a video call juts to make sure he's ok. And what did I see? He looked miserable, like he had lost 50 pounds during those 2 weeks. There were no bars in sight, his bandages looked haphazardly changed and there was a full bedpan on to the bed. He tried to convince me he finally has true independence and he's happy with it. I asked if they're fighting again and his reply was ""eh, the usual"". I can not explain how broken he looked. Today I had the final straw. His prostetist called me to check if everything is ok cause he missed the fitting! I was calling him like crazy, eventually he picked up and said he didn't feel like going that day! Meanwhile, his girlfriend is spamming her social media profiles with his sob story and acts like he's her stuffed toy.

He went from thriving in a very positive environment, all gun-ho about the future, to this. I don't know if he got tired of all the positivity and needs this to get back in whack. Maybe she's just enabling him, or she's making his life miserable and considerably slowing down his recovery, if not putting him in danger. I talked to everyone I know and they all think we should do something. But everyone I know also knows and loves him so we all might be blowing this out of proportion. I need a stranger to tell me I should raise all hell on her and get him back to a safe place.",30Jul2019,2
