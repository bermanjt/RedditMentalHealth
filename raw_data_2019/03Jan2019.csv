I am tired of being around people.

I am tired of trying to be better.
I am tired of trying to not hate myself.
I am tired of trying to stay positive.
I am tired of myself.
But most importantly I just feel alone, defeated and tired of life. Not in suicidal sense, but just.. exhausted. The worst thing is nothing is really helping, so maybe I'm simply destined to be tired all my life.",03Jan2019,1

2,"and fortunately, he's been very lucky all things considered. He was diagnosed with two different forms of cancer but both were caught early. He completed radiation treatment for one and had a lobectomy which treated a lung tumor. 

We can be happy to say we think he is now cancer free. 

But even after the success of the treatment and surgery, it seems my dad can't get out of this funk. 

It almost seems like this has turned him into a hypochondriac. I may be using that word incorrectly. But he now finds every little issue and thinks it's something serious. He has a headache? He think it's cancer related. His ear hurts? He thinks it's cancer related. He feels a little dizzy? Well, you know the drill. 

This entire experience has weighed on him emotionally and physically. And I can't say that it hasn't affected the rest of the family either. Every day, he comes home from work, I rush down the stairs to greet him and he never looks happy anymore. 

I have no idea how to help him. ",03Jan2019,1

5,"Not sure if anyone is going to read this but I figured I want to get some of what’s going on off my chest in writing, so thanks if you do take the time to read/reply, I appreciate it - I know it’s gonna be a long read 

So I’ve struggled with depression for the best part of 2 years now. It started when I was with my ex girlfriend, who also suffered with various mental health issues. She had depression, anxiety, eating disorders and psychosis which made her see and hear things which weren’t actually there. I loved this girl more than I’ve ever loved anyone, I had my life planned out with her, she was my future. 

I tried and tried to do what I thought was best for her, I was there when she needed me, I made sure she was eating, I made sure she knew I loved her and was there for her, however, she was struggling and it wasn’t enough. I couldn’t do it alone and I was spiralling fast. Although all I wanted to do was help I was pushed away and accused of not caring about her. I think this is what broke me the most. All the time spent, staying up all night looking up her disorders and seeing what I can do to help. All of the horrible things I had seen, self harm, suicide attempts, they hit me like a train each time. I fucking cared more than anything, and it angers me that she would think otherwise.

I look back on the end of the relationship and I feel incredibly guilty about what I did, even though I know to some it was a reasonable option and maybe the best thing for my health. After she was in hospital numerous times after attempting suicide, I told myself I couldn’t do this anymore and I broke up with her. I look back and ask why the fuck I did this, why I was so fucking selfish when she was in such  crisis.

As previously stated, I have struggled with depression for a couple years and I’ve always tried to remain strong, I haven’t let it affect my daily life too much, that is until recently. I’ve dabbled in drugs and alcohol for a while but recently it’s gotten worse - I woke up in hospital after a ketamine overdose after a particularly hard night, which to this date is the lowest I’ve ever felt. I’ve always kept my mental health quite private, my close friends know what I’m going through but my family have never had a clue, however, suddenly, it was all out there. My drug use, my depression, everything. It was incredibly hard for me to explain everything to my parents however I am now going to get the help I need. I’ve seen a doctor who has prescribed me some antidepressents and I’m on a waiting list to go to therapy. Since the overdose however I am at a very low point. I have been having suicidal thoughts and have begun isolating myself and keeping away from social situations which I would usually go to. 

I guess if anyone has any tips to deal with this shit until therapy is available that would be great.

If you made it this far thanks for reading, and if anyone else is going through a hard time, I really wish you the best. I’m not a religious person however for what it’s worth you’re all in my thoughts and prayers. Mental illness is like a cancer of the mind, and we need to work together worldwide to make it less of a taboo subject

6,"Ok hi, I am writing this letter because I will not express what I am thinking aloud, and please read this before starting questions. I am coming to you for help and feel this is this best way. Feel free to ask any questions as I will not be shy to answer them.


I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety by pcp 20 plus years ago. But I want to get real help. I have been to therapists and it usually just ends up with us staring at each other. I believe I do have a problem that needs addressing. I’m a 44 year old male and know I have potential.


So background, I believe I have social anxiety and it hinders me. I have had one girlfriend that I married out of convenience for both of us and we have a 10 year old son. I make a decent living at $100,000 a year, yet have no money and and always have to find a way to pay bills. This is due to me always spending money in the moment to make him happy and me.


I can know something is coming up but will put it off. Example; ski trip in month that will cost $2,000; I will figure out how to pay the week before for necessities to join and payback who I need to when they demand it. Car needs to be fixed, I will drive it to the ground and just buy another one. Not driving nice cars, paying less than $1,000 and hope they last.


I really don’t know that I care for people. Had my best friend die and it did not bother me, but there is more to that as it was my brother in law. We had known each other since we were six.


I self medicate with benzos, weed and alcohol.  When I am off them things go great and then I figure I can enjoy them again. I can’t and things go rough. I control them enough to keep my job. I’m good at it and employers overlook it because I make them money.


Anything I have an interest I do will and then get bored of because I am good at. Except my job because I know I need to make a living. But I do let my job slack and then take it a notch above everyone to keep job.

8,"Hi guys, I'm lost for help and I thought I'd come here on a community that could share some advice.

I recently had my heartbroken by the man I thought I'd spend my life with, which I know for people is a terrible experience, but I struggle with psychosis - personality disorder, major depression, anxiety, paranoia - should I carry on? 

I'm a very easily influenced person, so when he broke up with me, I lost it. Self destruction, crying and screaming every night, denial, seeing things, hearing things - the whole package! It's been driving me crazy, I don't feel like myself, I'm now underweight, I disassociate constantly, my PTSD is back again. As you can probably tell, I feel like my life has ended. I'm always borderline on the edge and I used the suicide hotlines a lot, this has been going on for 3 months and I'm still not better. I feel utterly betrayed and at my very end. Psychosis is a cruel bitch, but so is life. Yuck.

I don't need therapy, I need friends. I'm so lonely almost all the time. We even went to a party for new years. I didn't make one friend. No one said more than hi before they walked by, even after saying hi first! My feelings are hurt because people don't like me, they don't even give me a chance. It makes me feel unworthy of friends.

10,"Hi!I’m Lux,21 and I currently live in Italy.
In this post I wanted to explain androphobia and all the things related to it.
It all started with my father’s absence and a lot of shit talking from my mother on him, like really bad.
But what had really broken me was an attempted assault I had when I was 17. (I’ll tell this story in another post)
My androphobia really became suffocating me since you know that Italians have the tendency to touch people when they speak, to stay really close in a completely non-sexual way but it was really oppressive for me. My familiars now think I am disrespectful towards them for avoiding their touch or kisses and I’ve lost all the friends I used to have because I have difficulty spending a normal time with them.
I don’t feel safe when I go to University because there are plenty of men in my courses and I can’t avoid them in anyway or also when I go to work.
I have a job where all my colleagues are girls (I work for a small and private museum by the way) but the visitors are both men and women. Whenever I get to guide a group with men in it and I am alone through the museum I feel like they could assault me.
I want to make one thing clear: I don’t hate men. They make me feel threatened and extremely anxious. And when I feel threatened I have two reactions to it:
-I try to get away from him
-I attack him ( verbally, never going to touch them)
There is nothing in between.

11,"So, this is the first time im really trying to get my thoughts written down coherently and not in rambling texts sent to my girlfriend at 3 am hahaha. 

So, I started University last year (2017) and I was living maybe 2/3 hours away? For the first few weeks it was brilliant, I was going out making friends ans going to lectures. But at some point, i dont remember when, i started to go to lectures less and going out even less than that, i'd stay in my room by mself playing video games and eat shit food. If i wasnt doing that i was with two of my flatmates both of whom smoked an insane amount of weed every day, eventually I began to smoke a lot with them, this had untold effects I will speak about later. But I really dont remeber much of anything specific between october to december, which worries me.

Around December, when the due dates for my assignments crept up I kept procrastinating by doing nothing at all until 5 days before my due date. When it came to this close to the deadline I didnt sleep for nearly 3 days to finish all my assignments and managed to finish them, I submitted these and went home for a month (christmas break). I hoped I'd be more productive and happier in the 2nd term,  I was wrong.

I came back in january of last year hoping to be a better student and a better person, but my life crashed around me. I started a job in january at a cinema but this only stressed me out. My sleep cycle from january until may was a mess and i would frequently stay up all through the night, sometimes i'd have a panic attack and i'd just be crying sitting on the edge of my bed, i was not happy but it took me a long while to tell anyone which definitely made things worse.

For the rest of the academic year I was largely the same as i was in my first term, i did fuck all until the last week and then i rushed everything out, passing, but not happy with myself.

On to the more pressing things that worry me most, I smoked a lot of weed last year, none of it being very good quality and a lot of it being very bad for me. There was one particular moment which i believe broke me, i smoked and something snapped in my head, i had an internal monologue constantly critiquing myself. For example id say a joke to my friends and i would suddenly think to myself ""you're only saying that because you want validation because you're pathetic"". These thoughts mainly only came when i was high and they were not very fun. The more pressing and permanent thing thats impacted me is my lack of enjoyment in anything anymore. i will watch movies/tv shows/play games and be very painfully aware that actors were indeed acting and nothing really mattered. I couldn't lose myself as easily and i hated it.

I also have some serious self loathing issues currently which definitely stemmed from being away at uni. As mentioned, i ate a lot when i was livinf alone, i put on a lot of weight ( i have always been quite thin toned) but i noticed i could no longer fit in my clothes and had put on weight in my face which i hated because i no longer lie how i look. I am also extremely lazy and procrastinate with nearly everything in my life which i hate and want to change so badly, i want to be able to settle into routines and get up early and have a good life where im happy but im not and i cant force myself to. I'm a very proud and stubborn person and i want to help myself but i hate to appear weak to my family, my girlfriemd and my friends, i've transferred unis so i can be home but i dont do any work still and i am still not particularly happ with my life

I need help and i don't know where to begin

I also need to get medication for what appears I have is ocd intrusive thoughts and therapy as well...when that’s underway I plan to go to job corps to have a peaceful place to stay cause things have been in disarray at home. After a year I could have career experience plus I will have 7 grand saved in total for a place plus I will be able to get my first real job to sustain myself at my place and pay bills... then I want to start going to youth groups to get good friends people I can spend the rest of my life with and maybe get a girlfriend in the process!!!

14,"I'm on mobile. Excuse the formatting.

I just feel so fucking frustrated today. I've been off work since the end of September due to a mental breakdown. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, General Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression. My psychologist is also considering Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia but, she is waiting until she knows me and my history better.

I used to be a capable business professional who had it all together. Who was dependable, got things done, and could do it all, plus more. Now, I can't even grocery shop without having someone else with me and I can't even leave the house by myself. I can't focus on anything for more than 10 minutes and I feel like a failure. The thoght of a crowd of people sends me into a full blown anxiety (panic?) attack. I feel like a shell of my former self.

I hate being like this. I hate waiting until I feel better. I hate not being capable. I've been on a new dose of my meds (Cipralex 20mg) since Nov 27th.  I don't feel like it's working. I see my primary care physician tomorrow.  I don't want to say this med isn't working, then I have to start all over. Again. But, I won't feel better unless I say something.

19,"...when that friend is being a total a-hole to me in the process? Long story short, a friend I've had for many years had some bouts with depression years back along with a physical health scare and we were worried he was going to harm himself. We all rushed to be by his side and did what we could to help see him through it, myself included. I don't think he ever fully recovered psychologically, and has never quite seemed like himself since. This was a guy I enjoyed being around for many years, and the feeling was mutual - we would hang out and have a good time. Nowadays, he is going about getting help, but is very hush-hush about the means he's taking to do so.

Anyway, over time, he's gotten the idea in his head that I only care about myself and constantly takes jabs at me about this. I believe he's basing this on a few seemingly minor events where he needed me to show I cared about him by doing him a favor (that's the test he gives everyone), and apparently I failed. I explain those situations since I do believe they're explainable (we were running late for a movie one time and I couldn't make a detour, for example), but he constantly brings them up, neglecting to recall that I was there for him in his darkest time. I'm not even sure he remembers that.

Either way, if there wasn't a group context involved, I would probably suggest he and I go our separate ways - neither of us needs the toxicity. If I try to have a convo about it, it would be passed off as being said in jest, but a few times when drunk he's been more serious about it, and I can tell it's legit. Quite frankly, the feeling is mutual at this point, and he's being coddled by others in the group since they feel sorry for him and are worried about what he might do if called out for his antics. I'm pretty much done feeling that way. He basically asks to be coddled, as his big thing is the group looks down on him and the only way to show you care is to abide by his requests for favors. I tried for a long time to be sensitive to his issues, but I'm not interested in doing this or coddling anyone. I'm also very different personality-wise as he seems hell-bent on spreading misery to others, whereas I'm someone who would never unload my grief on anyone.

Saying I don't want to be around him would ruin a group dynamic we have with others who are very close to me and who don't get together all that often. They wouldn't accept us alternating hang out sessions, and me coming out and saying I don't want to deal with it would just throw a monkey wrench into this group thing, that is important to most involved as we are lifelong friends. We also chat constantly as a group over text...so yeah, I'm really not sure how to go about handling this without potentially blowing the whole thing up.

I have had thousands of hours of therapy, in and out of mental hospitals and went from unstable to stable. I have managed to root out roughly when all my problems started. Age 12. do too extreme bullying-Some doctors suspect i have PTSD from the bullying. I managed to put it all behind me (so i thought) until my mental breakdown at age 21. The thing is, my memory simply is... broken, from all the bullying in homeschooling age 12-14, i simply dont remember. I can track the root of my issues, the lack of self worth, the anxiety, the depression, the mistrust, the desperation to be liked by everyone, the fear of criticism to age 12. I have one friend from middle school who remembers the bullying and a lot of details, yet i... i simply dont. I mean i KNOW i was bullied, i have a few memories but mostly its just ""i was made fun of"" or ""i was beaten up a few times"", i DO remember going to bed crying praying for death, i do remember having almost no friends. But thats it, which is the main reason i even know my bullying was bad because why i go to bed crying praying for death if it WASNT. seriously. My friend from middle school, T, said he wasnt surprised when i mentioned i may have PTSD from that time, he would talk about how bad it was. He could tell me about these horrible things that happened to me, and to me he could be making them up, but im positive he isnt. I have tried to straighten my life out, i live on disability and have become stable. But i cant manage to make any more progression. I have hit a point of simple apathy and stagnation. I suspect some of it comes from feelings of not thinking i deserve to be happy and a bunch of other stuff, all of which stems from self worth which was mostly affected in middleschool. I have tried to simply accept that im an adult (now 30) and that i should be able to make/change my life and become happy, but its like building a house in a swamp. Everytime i try and build, the foundation gives out and i end back at square 1. I dont know if its possible to move forward without rebuilding everything from ground up. But at this point... i dont know how. How do you fix issues that formed who you are, to the core, when you cant remember it, and HOW cant i remember it? you would think things so important would be easy. My memory is one of the worst i have ever met, I dont remember when it got so bad, but even things from last week i tend to not remember, stories from past my family tell me i dont remember, highschool i dont remember much, my one relationship (5 years) has some memories but i would expect id have more- but again, its REALLY hard to compare if i have a bad memory or a normal one, because everyone is different. to me it FEELS like mine is terrible. I have been in and out of dozens of mental hospitals and again, its like a mist. I Know the facts that i have been there, but i cant tell you many stories from them.

To go along with my memory is my attention, which also is almost 0. But not from like ADHD, i just dont... notice things or keep a thought.

My eyesight is still 20/20 - I was just tested in the past couple of months for something unrelated, but I can't trust my eyes as much anymore.  I will see something, like a garbage bag in an alley, and something about it will trigger 'danger', and that fear makes me register the object as something else.   Could be an animal or person or just an unknown object all together.  Thing is, I never straight up 'see' something, it's not a visual hallucination in that effect.  I just can't see what is really there.... I'm not sure if this makes any sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind of like that specific object is blurred out and my mind is just guessing at the shape, without overlaying a new visual for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been tired ALL the time.  My wife and I went on a mini-vacation (kind of, it was work for her, vacation for me), but the entire time I slept in the hotel.  I literally could not get the energy to go out.  

&amp;#x200B;

And when I sleep - which would be all day every day if I could have it my way - my dreams are more and more vivid, but terrifying.   When I was younger, peaking at aprox 15-16, I use to get what I would call 'waking dreams'.  The feeling that I was suddenly somewhere else entirely.  Example, walking down a sidewalk and suddenly feel pulled away, that I'm riding on horseback in the dark in the rain with a torch and a few other people, following some trail.  I can hear the rain, smell the damp earth, feel the wind and temperature.... it's bizarre.  Sometimes so strong I'd almost lose my balance.  It's hard to be in two places at once.

&amp;#x200B;

These went away as I got older, and have been completely absent for so many years.  But it's coming back, I had my first episode in years again the other day.  I want to be alarmed by it, but I also welcome these 'waking dreams', as they kind of energize me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho.... I don't get to talk about this much with anyone, and thought I'd reach out to reddit to see if anyone else out there can relate at all, heh.

Going from I love you to I hate you. Never any threats, or I hope something bad happens to you. More along the lines of you really hurt me. Like I could probably fill a book. I'd hate to know how many I sent her in total.

My actions were definitely not ok. Not gonna go into the details of the relationship, because at the end of the day, she told me to stop texting her and I didn't. The first couple weeks were daily, then it was every few weeks. I honestly feel horrible and sick to my stomach for doing that. I feel really sick when I run into her. 

I'm not looking for anyone to tell me it's ok, I know it's not. I should've listened. Just this is surprisingly the first time I fell in love and while my friends tell me I'm good, it happens to everyone. It's so unlike me to lose control of my emotions. I'm scared it could happen again.

38,"Well, I don't how to start. My life was completely destroyed in the past year and a half. My first girlfriend ever turned out to be psychopath (diagnosed) and she suck all vital force of me. Since then, i've only been with women 3 times, terrible times. 

Socializing has always been a problem to me. It got easier when I hit 16 years old. My social circle forcefully expanded (people came to me to become my friends) and that gave me so much comfort. I was learning to be friends with people. 6 years after that, I lost most of that friends and kept only one good friend. 

I was the kid that likes books more than people. The kid if things don't go my away when socializing, I wouldn't socialize at all. I was always following my routine and my habits, there was no space for others. 

I was the teen bullied. I was the nerd. I was the teen awkward enough to never talk to any girl. I see other people in my class with girls and boys, and I had no idea what to do.

Before I met this devil woman, I was a year without  contact with girls. She made me feel.so safe that all my trust issues were gone. And now they are chronic.

Well... I was the kid and the teen extremely smart, but terrible socializer. I am the man who can't find women attractive anymore, because it appeared to have died with my fucking ex. And was recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and social phobia.

39,"Hello, around four months ago I began having issues which were later diagnosed as panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The first panic attack which spurred all the issues was prompted by a feeling of painful happiness. The bodily location of this feeling is hard to pinpoint, but I would say it occurs at the bottom of my neck/throat and top of my upper chest (the point where the two meet). In a sense, it feels like excitement/an anticipatory happiness feeling that has gone too far and hurts. This feeling would come out of nowhere, and led to a lot of discomfort/worry. This symptom still occurs every day or few days, both when on meds that resolve the panic attacks, and when off meds. I was wondering if this is something that anyone else suffering from anxiety/something related also deals with, and if you knew how to avoid it/tips for dealing with it.  I am still new to all of this so I apologize if this breaks any rules!  Thanks!",03Jan2019,1
40,"I'd like to be supportive to my housemate, who is going through a very hard time at the moment. She is a lovely person, with a really good heart. A close family member has passed away and she's dealing with an abusive BPD ex. I feel for her and I want to help.

She's having trouble leaving the house, keeps her room dark and has been ordering a lot of takeout food. I can hear her crying from the next rooms during the day some times.

She is seeing a therapist on a regular basis.

However, an enquiry into how she is doing if she looks upset can lead into a 45 minute plus monologue, with many many tangents. It's really draining to listen to. I've given it a shot but sometimes I don't have the energy to be a therapist. It's like she's piling all her stresses and anxietes on me, and I'm being slowly crushed under the weight of it all. It can really impact my mood and eat up a lot of time. It's really hard to keep her on track / get to the point of her long, rambling, detailed stories. I want to be a supportive friend but I don't have the energy to listen to her for hours every day. She doesn't seem to register that I might be in the middle of something when she launches into one of these epic stories. 

And perhaps this isn't a crisis, but something she does all the time? I haven't known her for more than 4 months but the whole time she's been in the house, it seems like some major shit has been going down in her life. I can't tell if she is genuinely suffering or perpetuating drama at this point.  I find it hard to understand this pattern of behaviour / emotion processing - I'm more of a represser myself and I'm aghast at the thought of imposing my emotional turmoil on others.

Can anyone offer some words of advice, or suggestions, on how I can help my housemate without getting sucked into the spiral? Or help shed some light on her way of dealing with things? I feel like such an asshole when I avoid her and run to my room and I feel like she could really use a hand.

Also when I read it back it seems inaccurate, like I don't believe I actually feel that way or whatever I wrote actually happened, there's some truth to it, but i'm exaggerating it's impact on me. Up until recently the only problem I've had is bad social anxiety (to the point where I just don't respond when spoken too most of the time), maybe depression, and some issues with feeling unfamiliar with a familiar place, like I'm somewhere I haven't been before but I have a map. None of those problems were too bad, but recently it's all gotten so much worse. Maybe it's constant social anxiety because I've tried to open a lot recently and I constantly worry that someone might try to text me or I'm not texting my gf enough, etc. The problem with that is that I've felt a little more confident, I can share my opinion more, I'm more nervous than I used to talk with friends but less nervous to talk with random people.

42,"So basically there is one day I think I lost my key at the condo gym, I was trying to go to the management office to figure out if I should get a new key or not.

The time is 12 am - 1 am, ok, I know this time is lunch time, but I am only trying to talk to the lady inside the management office for quick 1 min to 2 min about the key situation, they I will just leave, I am not going to completely interrupt her lunch time. (later on I talked to the lady asked her if I was rude, I wasn't)

And then this security guard from outside looked at the camera then talked to me extremely rude ""It is lunch time, blah blah blah"" very rude gesture, not even a freaking please.

After I talk with the management lady, I went to the security guard place, I talked to him, I said I am looking for my key.

Then he respond with ""So...? How does that related with me? Again, kind of rude.

(The situation is every time usually when someone loses their stuff, if some one found it they will turn it in at the security guard place, that's why I need go to the security guard area to find my key)

I said ""I think I lost my key I want to find the lost and found box"" He said ""That box have been sitting there for a long time, no one has ever been turning recently""

(There is 3 security guard at my building, so there is a chance some one might turn the key in, that is why I want to do a double check to see if my key was there)

So this situation got me extremely heated, in the security guard head he might think I am a stranger, but every day I drive my car to the building he should recognize me, and when we talk each other about this key bullshit it really got me in the head, I even said some negative word to him, every time I see this security guard I want to punch his face, like today when I walk by the security area he even stared me again, he still think he is a punk ass tough dude.

Like even if we fight I don't think I am win because this security probably have his own weapon. I mean I am taller than him and more muscular than him, if he finish his shift and walk into the build and saw me I really want to aggressively attack him.

My solution to this is simple, security guard makes just little more than minimum wage, in the end I will find a way better job than him, I am not going to waste my fucking time with this kind of low level pathetic human being.

43,"TL:DR I cannot stop myself from eating when I’m anxious and depressed and can’t force myself to work out either. What should I do to at least lessen the problems I’m causing for my body? 

Ever since I started having mental health issues I have had a consistent eating problem. It’s often the only thing that offers me some sort of comfort and happiness. When I get anxious my body has trained itself to get hungry because that’s when I eat. I never want or even force myself to eat better food options because it doesn’t fill that void for me. On the same side of that, I have absolutely no motivation to lose weight. I can not force myself to go to the gym. Every night I get myself all worked up and make myself sick worrying about how long it’s going to take for my boyfriend to leave me because I can’t stop gaining weight. He’s an incredible guy and is very understanding and loving, and has never really made comments about my weight, only that he wishes it was a habit he could help me work on. I don’t know what to do at this point. My doctors warn me that it’s bad for me, and I know it is, I weigh a ton. But they never give me any actual ways to work on this problem.

b) I have the attention span of a goldfish.

c) I struggle with putting thoughts into words. Forget words mid-sentence. Forget what I was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, 

At work once (I'm an aviation mechanic) my supervisor explained to me a task I needed to do. Step by step. I swore I was listening and understood everything she was asking of me. Got out to the plane and I was completely lost and couldn't remember what she asked me. I did what I could remember and when I went back to ask for more instruction, and explained what I did thus far, I had done it wrong anyway because I couldn't remember what she explained/wasn't paying attention the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife will ask me to do some chore before she leaves for work. If she doesn't text me to remind me, I won't remember to do it.

At the barber today I was trying to compare Black Mirror to The Twilight Zone. Could not remember twilight zone. It came out like this...

Similar to that show the...erhm...I can't remember what it was called...uhm...its older in black and white?? Eventually, I remembered. (Actually, a lot of people do that too)

And people notice, when I say something strange or something in just a slightly off tone or timing I notice people noticing. I didn't at first but when I did I became extremely depressed, but only for periods, as soon as I started talking to somebody it would dissappear, and I had a very upbeat and energetic personality and I was also VERY immature. so I would act stupid and then think about it later and then realise how stupid it was and become super sad for a while and shut myself out from for like a week or two and the process would repeat and get progressively worse and worse and the isolation periods would be longer and longer. During this time I would also not brush my teeth, shower for months at a time, be on the computer until the like 2 or 3 am and not eat lunch, I instead opted for sweets and such. I've tried to understand why I am like I am forever.


Usually I come to two conclusions, I am really stupid But the thing is I've been told that I'm smart since my childhood and throughout (I mean they can be wrong, only I have actually experienced all of me and I know alot of stuff and I can be wise but I have a hard time seeing the bigger picture).or I have autism that have lead to anxiety and deppression (I know it's bad to self diagnose). But every time I would interact with someone socially I would leave the interaction exhausted because I kept up a facade that was probably not that good to begin with or if it went successfully I'd memorize the reactions people gave me and memorize what I did and re tell it to my friends, usually not but sometimes. I love to have things organized. Sometimes when people made fun of me or act like I did something wrong, I would legitimatly not understand at all what I did that was ""wrong"". And I have a few interests that I know a lot about, like a ridiculous lot. 


 I went to a therapsychologist, I don't know what it's called, and they didn't even mention anything about me having autism. And they diagnosed me with deppression, anxiety, intrusive thoughts and ADD. Since I was only under investigation for ADD and they noticed all the other stuff surely they should've noticed the autism. But for a while I legitimately thought I had such severe autism that they hid it from me so I wouldn't be devastated. But I've started to drop that thought.


 However Highschool(starts at 15/16 here) I viewed as a fresh start, so I tried to actually better myself. After a year I sort of succeeded, I could atleast view myself as aalmost normal and normam is all I've ever wanted to be. and it's only went better after that as of now I would percieve myself as pretty swell to be around, atleast that's what I gather from people. HOWEVER, HERE comes the part that this all have been building up to, I started to regain these feelings of being autistic, but without much solid ""proof"" to myself (ie I havent been weird). 


But I'm still convinced there's something wrong with me, but like inside my mind, obviously autism is also a diffrence in the mind but I view my problem as lying elsewhere in my mind but that anomaly being viewed as autism or something like it from outside. I thought I might have schizophrenia for some reason but I probably don't because I don't recognise any of the symptoms.

Hi redditors,

Recently I got into a physical fight with my dad. To be honest, it was more like me, abusing him physically.

I think there was a long built up to this point, frequent fights; him yelling, hitting me (when I was young), and else.

I don't know if this is necessary, but let me tell you how the fight started.

So, I lost my wallet and had to buy a new one. Me and my dad were looking at different wallets via my laptop.

We were looking at couple of brands he suggested and he boasted about how he was helping out the company when it was at its infancy and how important he was.

So I said, ""you are fine with this one?"", and there he changed his tone saying that he dosent have enough money to offer such a wallet.

Before thinking that I am a spoiled kid beating my dad, because he refused to buy me a wallet, the problem is not that he refused it. Rather, it is the way he talks. Conversing with him is often convoluted and very stressful to me. In fact, the wallet that I was using was a 20$ wallet from amazon, and I was proud of how cheap and good the wallet was. I was suffice with that wallet. It was him at the beginning, who said 20$ wallet is too cheap. (I asked him for a price point, and he refused saying just show me some wallets so I showed him wallets from every price point imaginable)

Anyways back to the story, I was little bit annoyed at how the conversation was going. My dad, sensing my frustration said angrily, ""Why are you mad at me? I am buying you a wallet. You should be grateful"". Knowing how such a conversation goes (he said something like this all the time. How I only like my mother. How I don't like him despite the fact that he is buying me stuffs). I went to my room and locked the door. I started overwatch, trying to escape him. He banged the door and yelled something (I couldn't hear him because of the earphones) shortly he turned off the internet, shut down the power, and dressed up with a room key. He proceeded to try to kick me out of my house. He did the same thing to my grandmother, when they fought. My grandmother now lives with my uncle instead. This is another long story.

Something just snapped in my brain, and I became crazy. Maybe it was the fact that he always used to say, I am so scared that you may hit me (I never hit him in my life), while he was always the one who got angry and screamed, threw my stuff, and hit me (at least he dosen't hit me anymore, maybe due to my size.)

So there is that. I hit him. I choke him. At first he was screaming, ""kill me kill me!"", and later he apologized. Then I stopped. I locked my door after that incident. Since then, I never saw him again. I feel disgusted when I see him. Its not anger or hate, I just feel sick in my stomach when I see him, or even when I think about him. I don't go to the house as often, because of the fear that I may see him.

I got a news from my mom that his left leg's tendon got little weak because of it. Also, he is re-doing his eye surgery today. It's been a week since that incident and I am not sure if the fight caused it or not.

I haven't had a chance to talk about it, till now.

I dont know what to do, or who to talk to. It's a horrible thing to do as a son.

Maybe Reddit may help me. After all, you guys helped me with a lot of things in my life.",03Jan2019,1

62,"I'm a 21 year old male and I've decided to dedicate whole 2019 to get better. 

I've been dealing with mental health problems since I was in High school. Depression, anxiety, self harm, solitude and hating myself in every way possible. Dealing with all this things alone was devastating.  My mom was diagnosed with  leukemia, she needed all the love and support from us so i stepped aside because i thought my problems weren't important enough. Now i have  really close friend, that means world to me, the love and support that she gives me is unbelievable. She convinced me to seek therapy, to do more things, go out and enjoy life. Even though bad days happen to me, with thoughts that i wish were long gone I know things will be better.

63,"I'm worried my father may have some sort of mental illness. 

At first it just seemed like he was prone to getting upset about money. Growing up he and my mom would fight often about finance. He used to be a heavy drinker. It was a huge issue in our family. When he would get drunk he would often act rude to everyone, and that caused a lot of tension between him and the other members of my family.

After his 3rd DUI, he cut back on drinking. Honestly, he's been very good about it. Occasionally he has too much, but overall I'm very proud of him. His bouts of anger still exist though. 

He's usually triggered by money, and if he isn't he brings it into the argument almost immediately. He often claims my mother and I are leeches who only use him for money, and that we contribute nothing to the family. My mom has a full time job, and I work part-time as I attend college. He also claims that we do nothing around the house. My mom does all laundry, dishes, and cooking. In fact, I could easily argue HE does nothing, but that isn't the point (he contributes in other ways, like car-stuff and house maintenance). I'm barely home because of college.

He has a hard time accepting responsibility or acting like an adult. He flips out whenever bills arrive (even though they are paid monthly), and he constantly starts projects around the house without finishing them.

Sometimes he is fine. It's almost like he is a different person. He gets into these moods were he's so rude at the slightest provocation. He says how much he hates his job (he claims his coworkers are rude to him and he is irritated that they do their jobs inefficiently). He wants to go back into business for himself again.When he tried this before, he didn't have enough money or knowledge to run his own business. It was very hard on our family, and it made money tighter than ever. He can be so toxic and angry, and it is always something little that sends him over the edge.

Sometimes he skips work and sleeps all day. Literally he sleeps all day (18+ hours). This is becoming more frequent, and is one of my biggest concerns. 

I'm not sure if I should be trying to get him help. I'm worried about him, but I'm also worried about what will happen if he is fired or quits his job. My family relies on his income, even with mom working her own job. It's true money is important, but I honestly don't understand why he acts like we don't appreciate him for it.

I want to know if I should pursue trying to get him to see a professional. Does this sound like a mental illness, or is it just something personality-wise. Any ideas on what it could be? Any general advice? I'd appreciate it.",03Jan2019,1
64,"I'm currently living at home while I go to a local university. This is my first year in college, Im 18, and I'm planning on moving out in 2 years. I just don't know how to manage my feelings right now, which is weird for me because I'm used to being able to manage my stress and anxiety pretty well. I have a lot of conflicting feelings right now that I guess I need perspective on/just need to vent about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start out by saying I have great parents. They are incredibly supportive of me and my goals. They genuinely want to make my life better. I'm very grateful for that.  However, this has been my main issue lately and I don't know if I'm just an asshole for feeling the way I do or if this is normal.  For a while now I've been feeling guilty about the help that I'm receiving. They've been very supportive, letting me use one of their cars to get back and forth from campus, which is about 15 minutes from my house. The thing is old and needed a lot of work before I could drive it. Most of this work I didn't see, let alone help pay for. Same goes for on going care for the car. If there's any problems with it, my parents are the one's who usually handle it. From what I gather, they're also planning on letting me take it with when I move onto my university's main campus, for my last two years. I've been feeling pretty guilty about the help they've been giving me. I have a bad habit of trying to be smallest burden on people, especially my parents, both emotionally and financially. I don't  understand why someone would want to go out of their way for me  the way my parents do. I totally appreciate the support, but don't understand why someone would want to do so much for me. I'm paranoid that I'm lazy and free loading even though I have a part time job, had a really good first semester that I worked hard for, and help out around the house when they need it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I've felt pretty bad when I am at home. During the semester I'm no up to very much, usually studying, working, or playing video games. Most of my time I spend at home is spent in my room. I feel bad spending this amount of time in my room, and feel like I don't spend enough time around my parents. However, this again causes a problem. I'm probably the asshole for this one, but I haven't been enjoying spending time with them lately. I'm mostly home at 9pm+, at which time their usually watching TV. This is usually pretty boring to me but don't mind watching some TV. They're the type to be pretty vocal about their politics, which I unsurprisingly disagree with. I don't really care to talk about politics after I'm finished class and work. I get anxious when I'm sitting down with them, hoping to avoid anything that could get them going. It's a walking on egg shells type of feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty about all the help my parents give me and how I can't bring myself to stay out of my room for more than an hour a night. I feel like such a burden to them and don't know if I'm justified feeling like this. I never want to me a free loader and try my best to get good grades and have my own life/ save money to be independent. I can't tell if I'm a bad person or not. They really care about me and all I can do is feel bad about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;",03Jan2019,1

For context, I'll explain everything I can first. About two or so years ago, one of my parents started acting completely different.    Strangely it all started after an ""eye infection"", ""fibers coming out"" of their eyes, doctors not finding anything wrong, and self-diagnosing on Google. After all these years, it almost seems like it was mostly hallucinations? It was like they did a 180 mental switch.  

They didn't sleep as much as usual and would mostly just seem to be in a daze, not paying attention when people are talking to them and delayed or unrelated/incoherent responses.  They always leaned towards argumentative but now snap over any little thing, causing serious confrontations in the house. Even then, I wasn't too concerned, just thought it was stress related. 

About a year ago, they began talking about electromagnetic/radio waves and hearing voices (people cursing at them, a woman saying they were going to fight them, usually threatening voice) or sounds (beeping, buzzing, etc). They smashed and changed phones constantly because they were ""hacked"". Occasionally, they would unplug certain appliances, like a microwave. They said someone supposedly hacked our WiFi so we would have to change the password (and couldn't say what it was aloud) or were sitting in the driveway with some sort of laser device listening in on us. They wouldnt talk to us sometimes because they thought someone was definitely tapped into the house listening.

 Very often, they walk around wearing earphones blasting full volume, sometimes crumpled pieces of aluminum foil as earplugs. Their room is always trashed, they use those thick, car foil soundproof liners all over the wall, dozens of mirrors on the walls. At night, they occasionally spray the windows  with alcohol. One incident, they've hit themselves and mentioned a bleeding spot on their head (I never saw because they had a good up) and claimed something fell on them. 

Often, these episodes don't start until about a day or two after not sleeping and then they switch. It's hard to discuss it when they're not going through and episode because they just vehemently and througly deny it and get upset, but during an episode, it causes a huge argument and sometimes nearing psychical altercations. 

The police recommended we have them evaluated but never gave any bit of help or resources. I am over 18. How can one go about getting their parent evaluated? How can I convince them to get checked willingly? I'm at a lost and just want to do what's the most helpful. We are decently poor so we wouldn't even know where to start for treatment. For privacy reasons, I didn't include my state or city, but you can PM me and I can further discuss that if necessary.

66,"Hi, This is my first time posting on reddit and I'm the kind of person who doesn't like burdening loved ones, and need to get this out of my system, so how about total strangers on the internet who won't care and won't feel burdened by this.

Sorry if there's an odd structure to sentences or grammatical errors, since English is not my first language.

Also, this has been written on my phone.

I'm female (22) and have struggled with depression and some anxiety since I can remember , but have neve been taken quite seriously (told I was faking it, to get over it, the usual stuff). 

Now I have taken a huge step towards my dreams and I'm in another country, studying abroad for a year ( I'm now on the vacation period as my first semester here has concluded). 

The thing is, I'm feeling VERY out of place, I'm struggling, I feel I don't deserve to be here, that I don't belong to such a prestigious school (in this country, it's considered the top University). 

I'm also struggling with money matters, since I'm on a scholarship, but it has not been enough to cover all my expenses (everything in this country cost 3-10 times more than in my home country) and have almost ran out of money, I haven't told anyone because I don't want my family to worry. 

I'm in a really bad place now, at leat mentally, can barely sleep and when I do, I don't want to get up. 

I feel like a failure since I have not been able to secure a scholarship for the next semester and don't know what to do, I'm planning on starting to work, but legally, I can't until March, so my future terrifies me. 

I'm sorry if this is long, I just needed to get some of this fear into words.

/rant/ 
I was excited, planned it so my mom would accompany me and everything was fine. Then I get a call, turned out to be the therapist. She seemed nice but after greetings cut to the point of how I needed to change my appt due to the New Year. My mom is a secretary for a neuro so I understood and changed it to today (in lieu of Monday). But after I hung up, my mood soured completely and I keep thinking about whether or not today will hopefully get me answers and help but worried. I could sense the therapists' hurried tone with a hint of ""please let this new patient understand its the holidays,"" vibe--which I do, 100% as the daughter of someone who has been treated poorly by some not nice patients; that much I am extremely a pushover.

69,"I had sorta severe situational depression - crying every moment I was alone - but time and meds helped. I got better and decided to quit the meds for several reasons. (Drug interactions with antidepressants are too much of a pain in my ass given how I am functioning okay most of the time)  I feel mostly okay, sometimes happy, but sometimes I get overwhelmed and can't do anything even though I know I have so much that I need to do, or I just feel kind of numb and lethargic, and every now and then I get incredibly sad for no specific reason other than everything feels terrible. I can always tell when that's gonna happen (I feel it right now), and sometimes I can distract myself out of it but not always. Maybe 50-70% of the time I feel like I'm doing all right. Its not bad enough to go back on medication for me. I've always had a constant, low level of anxiety but that ramped up when things got bad. It still flares up but the episodes of sadness are more common. 

My question is, is this what ""normal"" people feel or am I still mildly depressed? What does ""normal"" feel like? 

There's meds to treat an anxiety attack. I would love it if there was something that could treat the bouts of sadness the same way without having to be on constant medication. ",03Jan2019,1

Now for the basis of my post: does anyone else have moments they feel like they're just being shoved under water by some otherworldly force? It sounds silly, I know, but last year was hard. Really hard. I have 3 children, one really struggling. We've been in and out of the hospital, she's bounced from Dr to therapist and back again with little answers and less results. The frequency caused me to have a slew of short term jobs which for someone who at 32 decided to go back to school for a better life, is defeating. No worthwhile employer wants to see 3 months here, 2 there. I landed a job outside my chosen path in August that I ended up loving. Things were great. My daughter has been on a good path the past few weeks. There was a lot of hope. And January 1st I get to work to find out when I clocked out at the end of my shift, there was no need to return. (Trying to save money by minimizing staff unfortunately.) And I'm just struggling to stay positive and focused right now. I'm a very ""will do what I have to person,"" BUT. I live in a town where the options aren't that vast. And the biggest employer is a factory, which I worked at for years before going back to school, and not somewhere I want to be. They hire rifraff, it can be a very toxic, unsafe enviornment. Not where I want to be, and the fast realization that I'm not going to land a job in an office or as a phlebotomist, and I'll most likely end up there, is absolutely defeating.

She's been working with two therapists to pin point her diagnosis. However, her doctor didn't refill her meds, assumingly because it was the doctor's last day. I've told her to go to the emergency room, crisis unit, anything where they will refill them but she refuses to do so much as to make a phone call.

My SO at the time came and got me in the middle of the night and I went to live with her, two states away.  


These are all clear signs that, even if I'm wrong about my mental issues (which is possible, since I'm not yet professionally-diagnosed and simply going by my own research and the observations of people who HAVE been professionally-diagnosed) that SOMETHING is wrong. I don't BENEFIT from making any of it up. In fact, it's hurt me, and put my life so far off track that I'm not sure I'll ever recover...  


So it just baffles me how my family seems to think that just telling me that ""I can do it"", or, ""It's not that hard""/""Not that big a deal"", will make any of my problems go away. They act like I can just 'man up' and do things when I essentially have brain damage inhibiting me most of the time. I can't IMAGINE, as practiced as I am at 'playing normal' that my issues are well and truly unnoticeable, especially since my mother is the most intelligent and perceptive individual I know.

Hello all,

So first of all I want to apologise for this post as it will inevitably be long.  
 I have been with my husband for 13 years. We are both 28.  
 so a little background first.  
   
 

I suffer from clinical depression that went undiagnosed up until about 5 years ago. This put my husband Matt through a tremendous amount of stress as he had never had hands on experience with this sort of thing. I used to self-harm, had awful mood swings and was generally not a nice person. Fast forward to now, I am mellow and clear headed (mostly). I am on antidepressants that work for the most part. I have been through various therapies. And Matt has stood by me and encouraged me this whole time.

Now for the point of my post; Matt has always struggled with his own emotions and has said on previous occasions “I don’t understand emotions, and I wish they didn’t exist”. He is very intelligent and super logical, sometimes to a fault.  
 The other night, he came home after drinking and admitted to me that every time he does something wrong/upsets someone/has an argument his first thought is “I should kill myself, I am worthless”. He then went on to advise me that he talks himself down from this and has this internal argument where half his brain says “why are you down, you haven’t got anything to be depressed about”.  
 Matt says he wouldn’t act on this notion of killing himself so it’s fine. I explained to him that having that thought process is not positive to himself and I think he should speak to someone. 

Matt refuses to speak to anyone or get any support, because in his own words “I looked it up and I am ok now”. He has previously said that although he supports counselling/seeking help, he personally won’t do it because it’s a weakness.

I don’t know what to do. It breaks my heart that he has these thoughts, because he is such a good human being, but I can’t force him so get help and he won’t talk about it when he is sober. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you",03Jan2019,1

NICE ~~GUYS~~ (PEOPLE) *DO* FINISH LAST – BUT  THAT’S NO REASON NOT TO BE ONE

By: Simon Templeton

  

I’d always thought that I’d been suicidal before… Until the night I actually was. In the midst of a sticky divorce situation, navigating a complicated but incredibly passionate and healthy relationship for the first time in my life. Dealing with parenthood, and the issues of navigating the custody battle while remaining cognizant of the dangers his mother poses. None of this is new, however. I’ve been navigating the separation and the issues its caused for almost two years, now. But that night it just… got to me.

I’m no stranger to mental health battles, either. I’ve struggled with depression since I was very young, as young as seven. I’ve dealt with many, many obstacles in my life. My parents short-lived marriage. My mothers first battle with cancer. Bullying. Self-esteem issues. Poor grades. My mothers second battle with cancer and early death. There have been people that suffered the same or similar trials. Even those whom have had far worse lives than I. However, a recent meeting with a counselor with he department of Veterans Affairs looked into my past a little deeper than other counselors had – and I was diagnosed with Severe Catastrophic Anxiety

I’ve known about my anxiety issues for a long time. Most of my life, in fact. I told her the truth – I used to suffer crippling stomach aches thinking about things. If my mother was late even 5 minutes I would think ‘’oh god, she got into a car crash and died, I’ll never see her again.” In fact, that’s the reason I believe I was able to navigate her death more deftly than my sisters. I had been worried she would pass for over ten years at that point. And living with her, taking care of her 24/7, balancing graduating high school and managing her health and treatment had prepared me for the possibility of losing her. Really, when she passed it was a relief. Not that I wanted her to go, but finally her suffering was over.

My point is, I’ve been seeing counselors for over twenty years by the time my first brush with suicidal ideation. I learned recently, at that point, that there is a serious difference between ‘’thoughts of death’’ and ‘’being suicidal”. And there is. This can’t be stressed enough. It’s normal for the brain, even one that isn’t depressed much if at all, to consider what the world would be like without it. ‘’What would happen if I died?” “Ugh, this would all be easier if I just wasn’t here anymore.” “God what a relief that would be.” These aren’t even on the same map as being suicidal. In fact, the thought first came to me right smack dab at the beginning of a concerted effort to improve my life, my self, and by extension my depressed state by getting back into the gym and being active and responsible.

My girlfriend and I had made a decision to get back into losing weight, improving our fitness and working out every day in the month of January. Then, after some light frustration at with her for being hard on herself and my slacking performance in bed – blaming it on her having gained some weight, I was having trouble sleeping. I had eaten relatively well that day. A little too heavy on the lunch, I was hangry when we stopped at chipotle for some relatively healthy food. In response, I had chosen not to eat any dinner that night. Things with her weren’t bad, I just was a little frustrated that my sexual performance was so affected by my depression – I was even having trouble masturbating. I was sad that she was feeling guilty for my own B.S. I told her goodnight and continued to watch Netflix for a bit – vowing to sleep when I was a little more tired. This spiraled into some hunger, and a little extra depression than before.

It even spurred me to make some incredibly unhealthy snack choices, causing even more bad juju in my mind… My 4-year-old son got up, as usual (a little earlier than usual) and I put him back to bed. But I knew that at this point he wasn’t going to stay there long and I’d better get to bed. I still didn’t though, and it was only when I heard him making his way back downstairs that I decided to go to bed. I grabbed him up, gave him a few sips of water accompanied by a reminder to get up and go potty if he needed to pee, and donned my CPAP machine as I turned the TV off. I settled us in and closed my eyes. I was certainly tired enough to sleep. My mind wasn’t overactive – a well known cause of lack of ability to sleep for me – and I began concentrating on my breathing.

“What if I just put a gun in my mouth and…”

Whoah. What. The. Fuck.

That came out of nowhere. I was rattled… I ripped my CPAP off and laid there, wide eyed and breathing heavy. The dread came over me like a nasty, sticky warmth – my skin burning hot, flushed and hyper-sensitive.

My son hadn’t moved the whole time, he was already starting to doze. I turned and put my arms around him and he cuddled in… But for the first time, it didn’t steady my nerves. Now, when I alluded to thinking prior to this point that I had been suicidal before, my one claim of strength was that I may have *thought* it, but I had never really considered it. *Hence the statement about the difference between thoughts of death and suicidal ideation.* I’d always stopped that train of thought by thinking about what it would do to my family. And when I was married and had kids to take care of them, thoughts of them and their safety rallied my senses.

But tonight those thoughts felt… Empty. Forced. Ineffective. I think that’s what scared me more than anything.

My son stirred, asking to snuggle more. I grabbed him almost *too* vigorously, panicking  now. I figured if I snuggled him harder I could squeeze out this fear of that stupid, fleeting thought I just had. But I couldn’t… For the first time in my life, the thought of my loved ones didn’t bolster me.

I should be clear – at this point I wasn’t having *more* thoughts of suicide. And I’ve got such stupid, ridiculous anxiety that there is a chance this was just all some weird falling-asleep-brain thought that didn’t mean anything and now I’m working myself up WAY more, but still.. I was scared. I lay awake, cuddling my now-restless son, alone with my thoughts – as I’ve always been afraid of being.

After making myself throw up, a let-me-rectify-this-eating-mistake-because-i-clearly-need-some-shock-and-awe-methods-to-get-my-mind-right act, I decided to shower (another classic mind-rectifying method for me). I masturbated there, but it was pitiful… My mind wasn’t into it. I got very little pleasure. It was… Hollow – the same way I felt about every feeling I had since that strange thought.

\-

The reason I’m writing this is… I’ve always been overly empathetic. Horrifically so. I used to write lyrics an poems and use word-play in my mind and I would always come back to calling myself em-pathetic (with emphasis on the pathetic). I almost can’t function because I am constantly worried about everyone else’s feelings and sacrificing my own. I’ve always been told by women I’ve had love interests with, friends an family that I’m incredibly nice. That I’d do anything for anyone. And I will – if they ask. Often even if they don’t. I’ve been urged by counselors and friends to stand up for myself. To make sure my needs get met too. For the most part, I’ve been working on that. But the events surrounding my divorce, and every shitty relationship I suffered through in the past always led me to be a little hard on myself… Like.. Fuck. I guess nice guys really DO finish last.

Yet looking back on it… I don’ think I would change a thing. Sure, I could be more functional in the way I address the world and the people around me, but I’ve won in the long run. Hence the title of this work… (updated for the truth of its universal appeal) Nice people DO finish last… But only in the battles that don’t really matter. The races. The competitions. The Bullshit…..

Nice people win at life.

  

Now, I am in no way comparing myself to Dr. King, however when you look upon the most famous good people from history – you see that they faced adversity. I mean, to call the unbridled hatred, racism, discrimination and assassination Dr. King faced adversity is a tremendous understatement. That being said, I believe it to be Dr. King’s continuing to uphold his beliefs and his character during all of these to be the greatest sign of a truly good person.

In fact, it’s easy to be a good person. Most of our parents spend time trying to teach us to be from the moment we can walk, talk or use our hands. Most of us have, in one sense or another, some understanding of the generally accepted ethical and moral  agreement that humans have collectively made. You say excuse me. You hold a door for someone. You help someone that appears to be in need. The tasks involved with being a good person, a nice person, are not difficult. What *is* hard is continuing to be one when life and the people around you give you every reason not to be. *True selflessness is* *the single most powerful state* *the human spirit can attain, and one we should all* *strive for throughout* *our short lives.* 

And the truth of the matter is it is not a battle that is won or lost with a single decision. Mistakes are always made, opportunities missed and decisions rushed or affected by external and internal sources. Just like the  way nice people lose the battles, the more important goal is the war. At the end of the day, it’s about accepting these losses and *not letting* *them*  *jade* *you into giving up the fight*. 

I’ve been telling friends whom are suffering hard times themselves for years – we are not our mistakes. We are not our scars. We  are who we make ourselves with those scars on us. And you are *not* your mistakes. You are who you continue to try to be knowing you made those mistakes in the past. You can’t let your luggage define you. That’s what depression is, in my unprofessional opinion. It’s when you let your baggage take the wheel and drag you downhill. You give up on your beliefs or your desires and you justify them away - telling yourself that you never had control over them anyways. Or why try to be good when you keep getting screwed over?

The simple fact of the matter that It’s *easier* to be a bad person. And it’s just what other bad people want. All of us have a million reasons to be bad people. Or even just to be ‘’okay’’ people. Yet there’s only one reason to be a good person – it’s the right thing to do. At the end of the day we, or rather the world and those around us, reap what we sow. Certain belief systems call this karma, some call it fate, but realistically the world is what *you* make it. A smile can change someone’s day, or even their life, and it cost you nothing at all. When we put good in, we get good out - that’s the bottom line.

Bad things will happen. You will lose loved ones, we will find reasons to be hurt. This is the price we pay for sentience. We’re just animals that became far too smart for such a bleak existence. So why would you waste your time on empty self-gratification in being a bad person. This is the exact reason people are so depressed, so nihilistic. It’s so easy to be even just an ‘’okay’’ person, and all it cost the people in your world were a few sleepless nights, a few tears. But these people are not rewarded. They suffer their brief time in this life, beginning to end – and often alone (in one way or another). We lie. We cheat. We Steal and kill and rape – but mostly we ignore. We think of this as being nice to oneself, but really it’s just selfishness. We don’t act right, and therefor we don’t have what we truly want. Because we don’t have what we want, we act like the universe owes it to us – so we treat the others around us in a negative way. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I’m still here… Awake. Shaking from the fear of what just happened to me. I’m scared, and I think I need more help than I’m getting to get through this… It’s all new to me, even though I’ve suffered these afflictions before..

But I think the key is… I WANT to be alright. Not that those whom have lost their battle with depression or given in to suicide as a release didn’t, I just… I want to empower myself to be able to handle this on my own, and to be able to ask for help when I need a little extra push.

Be good to one another… This whole world needs a little extra good in it. ",03Jan2019,1

Like, maybe I was so used to that mood that it made me feel like I ""Need"" it for some reason after losing it for so long now. It isn't healthy I know. But these thoughts come up from time to time.

Some of the stuff I would never outwardly express pride in but take solace in knowing I did it are sabotaging a roommate's laptop a week before a final project that he had spent all semester on, getting a coworker fired for looking up inappropriate stuff on a work computer, I stole thousands of dollars worth of lab equipment from my university, I poisoned a different roommate with a microdose of food which he was allergic to before he was about to leave for his thesis presentation (it only gave him a migraine and put him out of commission for a day), I stole some of my TAs research lab notes and sabotaged the tests she was running, I put screws in my neighbors driveway on the path they drove over, and many more things (these were just the first to jump to mind).

I don't really feel bad for any of this as I never did anything to someone who didn't deserve it.

Because of everything I've done in the past and my honest view of the world being very realistic, in a way that most people would disagree with, I don't want to open up to a therapist because I think they might put me away.

83,"Hi everyone,

My situation is kind of weird, but I have been having a hard, hard time coping with it. Over this past semester I was studying abroad in China. During a midpoint in the semester I had to give a very large presentation to around 100 students. 

Now, before I continue, let me preface this by saying that before this incident I have always been a very good public speaker. I spoke at my high school graduation to an audience of over 300 and have generally felt very comfortable speaking to audiences before this incident. 

Back to the story - I walked up to the podium, began to utter the words that marked the beginning of my presentation, and then had a sinking feeling that I'd never felt before in my life. It was so strong that it brought me to a kneeling position behind the podium followed by a complete loss of words. For the rest of the presentation I was frozen. I couldn't utter another word - I was completely and utterly stunned by the mistake I had just made. For four or five minutes, I struggled significantly to mumble the rest of my presentation with only my group members pulling me along to the finish line.

Ever since this incident has occurred, I've had this reoccurring sinking feeling that leaves me speechless in every. Single. Conversation. It doesn't matter if it's my best friend - I feel some sort of panic overcome me when I try to converse with people. As a very social and outgoing person, this has been extremely distressing and I don't know what to do. I can barely even muster up the courage to talk to my college counselors about things because I'm scared I will have a breakdown mid sentence. 

Any advice would be extremely helpful. Thank you.",03Jan2019,1

86,"Idk if this is the right sub, but here’s the situation: I’m on a cruise right now. My parents and I are sitting around, and my dad all of the sudden says that I’m having a meeting with my doctor soon and we’re going to talk about therapy options. 

The background info: I’ve tried therapy twice before. I hate it. I think it’s a waste of time and there’s no point to it, I’ve been fine without it. Last time I quit therapy, my doctor prescribed me anti depressants and I have been feeling great with them. 

Just now, my parents started taking about therapy again. I’ve suffered through it twice just for their sake and the last thing I want is to go again, but now they were saying that they wouldn’t send me out of state if I didn’t go to therapy (I think that’s a bluff, they would never do something so drastic). I applied to 4 out of state schools and have been accepted to 2 so far but have only applied to one in-state school and haven’t heard from them. That school is nowhere near my top choice. 

They said I don’t have any choice in whether I go to therapy or not but I turn 18 in February and i don’t think it’s legal to send me without my consent once I turn 18. Correct me if I’m wrong. 

They also said that the main reason they want me to go is that they think I’m suicidal and that i would kill myself if i went out of state without therapy. I’m not suicidal and I’ve never mentioned anything about being suicidal. 

Is there anything I can do to get them off my back about going to therapy? If I did go I would only be doing it to please my parents, cause they don’t seem to understand that it really doesn’t help me at all and I’m fine with just antidepressants. Maybe some sort of compromise would be good. I don’t know.

92,"Howdy Reddit. I came here just to ask this one thing.

So I USED to think I was fine. In fact, more than fine: I thought I was one of the (seemingly few) mentally healthy people out there. I love life, enjoy my friends, have a happy marriage, no real troubles. The issues in my life are so small compared to those I see all around me, I am in a constant state of gratitude for what I have. And so I thought I was fine.

But... a good friend of mine (now lives about 2000 miles away) is stuck at home sick, and she recently posted about how lonely she is... how loneliness is a form of torture, with solitary confinement used to break prisoners' spirits... and so after I cheered her up I got to thinking: huh. There must be something the matter with me, because I have ZERO problem with being alone. ZE. ROH. Nix. 

In fact I have never, ever, that I can think about, been lonely, bored or homesick. Wherever I am, that's where I like being; whatever is happening, I take an interest in it. I used to think this was because I'm creative (I actually am an advertising writer) and could easily amuse myself with imagination. I thought it was a GOOD thing. 

I can be alone for as long as you want to leave me that way. Those scenes in the movies where the prisoner is alone and going bonkers never resonated with me. I mean, if there were nothing else to do, I would just make up a whole bunch of songs and poems. It's ok if there's nobody around to hear or read them-- making them up is the fun. And so I went, blissfully along in life thinking I was fine. Until....

I read a person on Quora asking about ""Schizoid"" mental illness and how its hallmark is *not feeling loneliness*. 

**So question: IS THAT ME?** 

Reading more about this disorder, the rest of it doesn't sound like me at ALL. I don't have anhedonia, I don't dislike social interaction, I have never been hindered or held back in life... \*that I know of\*. 

But I also read that lots of people with this disorder have no problem with it. Apparently the problem is the way other people around them feel? Or something? Anyhow now I am curious to know: have I been suffering from a mental illness all along? 

Oh well, if I have it then I have it. Life's been good so far and a new label won't change anything. It's just... well, it sort of makes me disappointed in the world.

I don’t trust people at all, so that means I don’t really forgive them. My family was pretty toxic, like they’d make fun of me and then tell me I was overreacting when I got upset. This was always the case, from the time I was small. It only got worse when I got older, of course, because “that’s how the world is, nobody else is going to care about your hurt feelings”. That’s basically what they’d say. Just put the children down for being “too sensitive”. In high school I just reinforced those ideas in myself with how I treated others and how they treated me. I had a lot of toxic friends and I was toxic too. 

Now I’m 24 and I don’t trust people and you can’t forgive without trust and vice verse. It takes me forever to tell somebody I’m upset. I forgive, but not really? How do you forgive without forgetting the past and keeping a score?? Like I thought that was just normal. Guess it’s not. 

I think part of it is that I forgive when I don’t want to because I’ve learned from my family that fighting back doesn’t work and I’ll lose anyways so just forgive now and more on, but never trust them again. But that’s not forgiveness.

If I want to arrange a meet-up with friends I always feel as though I will be getting in the way of their plans. I tend to read into simple things and analyse them multiple times.

101,"Hi there. Long time lurker, first time poster. I apologize for my formatting since I’m on mobile. I need to figure out what the hell is going on with me. First off, a little bit of backstory, I guess. I’m 18 right now, and when I was 13, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma of the lung. 

Before her diagnosis I dealt with a little bit of anxiety, mostly separation anxiety. After she became diagnosed, though, this anxiety transformed into a panic disorder and agoraphobia. I also was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD as time progressed and my mother became sicker and sicker. 

It was... really bad and really traumatic to say the least. I was one of her primary caretakers at age 16 and 17, since my dad could only take off so much time before it became leave without pay. She was in so much pain, and so ill, and I was faced with it every hour of every day. Had to drop out of school at one point to take care of her. 

She died in May of 2017. Throughout this whole process my anxiety had been getting progressively better with therapy, and my depression was always pretty bad, but manageable with medication and therapy.  The PTSD and depression were my main issues, the panic attacks still came and went, but I had pretty much knocked the agoraphobia out. 

So fast forward to a month ago, December 3rd. I was on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Tampa (where I go to University). This was only my 6th time flying, with my first time flying being around Thanksgiving time. So, my flight experience started in 2018.  Anyway, this flight ruined me.

The whole flight was pretty turbulent, but thanks to Ativan, I was okay. We start our descent to land, and we reach about maybe ~700 feet from the ground, and the pilot takes off again. It was absolutely paralyzingly scary. It was storming in Tampa, apparently, and the pilot couldn’t see the runway, and had to do a go around. Everyone I’ve spoken to, including pilots, say this is rare, and it is fucking terrifying. 

I had a lot of anxiety about planes to begin with, but this changed something in me and now my agoraphobia, panic attacks, and general anxiety are back. I don’t know what happened, I was doing so well, and it’s so discouraging to feel like I’m a million steps back in my growth process. Has anyone had an experience even somewhat similar, or have any advice? The counselors on campus are generally unhelpful, and my therapist that I love is back home 7 hours away. 

TL;DR: Scary flight reverted my anxiety and now I’m an anxious mess and can’t get over it. Help. ",03Jan2019,1
102,"I wake up anxious, I stay anxious all day long.  It's been going on for 2 plus years now.  I've been to the ER 3 seperate times, each time with a short script for a benzo that helps until it's time to adjust the dosage or renew the prescription and then I can't find a GP that's willing to deal with it for whatever reason (maybe because it's not an easy fix and throwing benzo's at people isn't what they want to do, i get it). 

My frustration is that my current insurance doesn't cover ANY thing that can be labeled therapy, no psychologist, no psychiatrist, nothing of the sorts.  I'm currently PLEADING with my current GP to adjust my dosage of Klonopin (.5mg x2 daily) to something that will even touch the anxiety.  I've been on this dosage for close to a month now and at first it ""took the edge"" off but now I'm basically at square one, yes I know how tolerances work.

I'm afraid to look like I'm an addict seeking pills, because I'm not, and I'm tired of doctor shopping hoping because I know that they can see what's going on and will only assume that I'm an addict looking for a fix.  

My grandmother suffers the same plight, but luckily (for her) put her on a dosage of Xanax that does the job for her (she's much more elderly and I'm sure the ""risk"" of abuse is considered lower for her.)  She says one of my aunts is the same way, anxious from the time she wakes up until she finally falls asleep when her brain finally gives out.

106,"Hello r/mentalhealth

I've never had any symptoms before, this wierd thing just happened to me a few minutes ago and I'm scared. I need to know if it's something to worry about.

I was watching a documentary on YouTube about the 9/11 attacks and 'the flight that fought back', and it contained some very emotional scenes in it. Now I would consider myself not as a very emotional person, but it got to me and I actually got a bit teary-eyed.

I went to the bathroom and began properly crying thinking about the people in the plane, but just a few seconds after I started crying, I stopped and became normal again. I went from proper crying to poker face in a matter of seconds. I would like to know if this is something I need to look into.


I would also like to note that my sleep schedule has not the best, as it's the winter holidays. For the past month I've stayed up till almost 5 am, and woken up at 2pm. I don't know if that's a contributing factor but it's out there.",03Jan2019,1

And I dont mind leaving my human habits behind.",03Jan2019,1
109," 

I am writing this as an attempt to get some order in my mind about something that happened to me when I was a kid. My parents only had me and divorced when I was four, and my mum got a new boyfriend who I had a good relationship with. He had a son who was six years older than me. I’ll call him M. I stayed one week at mums and one week at dads until I was 18, when I moved in with my dad. My dad was a great dad, but also an alcoholic. We lived in the same house until he died seven years ago. I still live in his big apartment. 

I remember things from my childhood in small fragments, but like most kids I guess I couldn’t store too much information. I read somewhere recently that we have tendencies to save the most traumatic events, but that its easy to forget details and perhaps other experiences similar that were considered less traumatic. 

I remembered that I adored M. He was older and cooler, did hip hop dance and martial arts, he was a very boyish and quite handsome. He would spend weekends with us and I would follow him around like a puppy. I have vague memories of him playing with me when he felt like it, I feel like they were boyish games like making traps for me (that were kinda dangerous) and the general feeling I have of our relationship was that I mostly annoyed him and sometimes he would be fun and nice to me. I also remember once being in a park with him in winter time, I was small, and I picked up a huge rock and through it at his head. Im not sure this is a real memory, I haven’t asked my mum about it. But I wasn’t a violent child at all, why did I do that?

So the traumatic memories I have are two clear ones. The clearest one must be from when I was prob 8. We were all in my mums house, she and stepdad was watching TV in the living room, and me and M was in the dining room next door with doors closed. He had a friend over, who’s face I cant remember. They made some kind of fort out of chairs and blankets and we were all inside there, I dont remember how it started, but I am sitting on the floor without underwear and my legs spread wide. The two boys are crouching down taking turn licking my vagina with their tongues sticking out in a silly way as if they were eating an ice cream. 

I dont remember what I was feeling, but I dont think I was upset. I actually feel like I probably thought it was exiting, and sort of fun to get this attention and be part of the the big boys playing. I dont remember how it started or ended, I just remember looking down at my little hairless vagina and seeing their tongues sticking out like that. I cant remember any physical sensations, like if I enjoyed the stimulation or not. 

The second memory is from a party at my grandparents house, I am wearing the national costume, maybe xmas or 17 may. He is steeling me away taking me into my grandparents bedroom, door closed, lays me on the bed and gets on top of me. I remember fumbling getting into my pantyhose, but I dont remember what kind of thing he did to me. I dont think it was painful. 

The frustrating thing is that I had these memories for a long long time, but it has been bothering me more and more the older I get. Now I am 36 and at the moment I am completely obsessed by it. I have an on and off fascination for macabre documentaries about murders, child molestation etc, and lately I got into the whole pizzagate story and something kind of changed in me.

My perspective of the human mind and human condition keeps evolving as I grow, so what didn’t seem so important now suddenly seems huge and life changing. 

I actually had a sexual relationship when I was 8. With a 14 year old boy. I dont remember much of it, but it happened. I had feelings at the time I have no connection with today, but still they have been a part of my emotional development.  

Was I “in love” with him? Did I hope for things to happen between us? What did those things that happened make me feel? Did I tell no one? What did he say to me when it happened? Does he remember more than I do? 

I think the first person I told was my ex boyfriend, when I was maybe 26. He took it seriously and we discussed in a good way that made me feel safe. My mum and stepdad broke up after a while, but stayed friends, and I continued having a good relationship with him. The idea of him knowing what his son had did, scared me a lot and I also never really considered telling my mum for a very long time. When my dad died I went to a lot of therapy, and finally I told one of them about the episodes. I had seen her for years, and we had talked about a trillion other things in my life, and it felt weird that I hadn’t wanted to bring it up, when it finally felt so right to talk about it. 

It was natural that I stopped being around M and almost never saw him. The older I got the more I tried avoiding events when he was there. My mum kept in touch with him, and I always felt horrible to be so “uninterested” in that part of our (ex-step) family. Finally a few years ago I told her. She took it pretty badly, I mean she got really sad about it and I think she blames herself a lot. I have been explaining the story to her and my closest friends as something I have already sorted out and come to peace with, like that they dont need to worry about me, I just want to share it with them.

A month ago my and mum were talking about it, it doesn’t happen often but its not like a taboo or anything. She told me about something she remembered. Once my dad had discovered a hickey on my neck when I came to his house, and he had confronted my mum about it. When they asked me about it I said we were only playing. My dad had told my mum to keep and eye on M, and make sure he didn’t do anything to me. In the moment she told me it felt like a small story, but the more I thought about the more fragmented memories and thoughts appeared. My mum prob feels horrible knowing that conversation happened, and maybe subconsciously she needed to tell me. And my poor dad who actually was onto something and tried to protect me unsuccessfully. 

The creepiest thing, was that when she said hickey I remembered that. Either the feeling of him sucking on my neck or seeing the bruise, my mind is trying to put together a game about him making the marks. It wasn’t necessarily a sexual thing, but it still feels uncomfortable to think about. Because that was my body, and both good and bad stuff happened to me, but I cant remember which is which and it feels confusing. What else dont I remember? 

Suddenly now I feel closer to him again, like he is a part of me. Like other men I have been romantically involved with in my life. I had long-term healthy relationships in my 20s but since my dad passed I have been single and struggling with my mental health. I am a freelance artist, and the last few years I pretty much stopped working. I sleep all day and stay up all night. I smoke a lot of weed and even though I have a lot of good friends I dont like going out, dont like drinking, don’t like drunk people. And I dont like most men. The men I have been involved with have been all super tricky, like too young or just too eccentric, and the men I am sexually attracted to are usually very closed of emotionally. 

I have always been very sexual and can remember masturbating very early. Prob before M came into the picture. I was curious about porn early on, and spent a lot of time masturbating in my teens, and I still do. I lost my virginity at 16 and experienced a bunch of slut shaming early on so I became very careful about who I had actual sex with. I would make out with like seven guys at a party, but before I had a boyfriend I only had sex with a few guys I thought I felt safe with. With my boyfriends I had great sexual relationships, but they all escalated into more extremes during the relationship, mostly on my initiative. From early on I liked roleplaying, rape games, anal sex, latex clothes etc. But it was always within feeling very safe with that person. Its also worth mentioning that my first real boyfriend was 12 years older than me, when I was 19. 

Now Ive been single for 8 years.I am mostly ok in my life, but I know I am occupied with thoughts and worries that are not considered “normal and healthy”.  I almost never have sex or physical contact with people, being around kids make me cry. I am on a low dose of antidepressants. I have been through suicidal ideas and scrapped them, I have been hysterical, calm, stoned, sober, motivated and surrendered, right now I am just so tired of worrying about myself and I envy my friends who have kids and family and dont have time to worry about their childhood trauma. I am so deep into my own mind and trying to figure out where I am failing, and I cant escape it, even when I am around other people.

My question, I guess, is would it help me to confront M about what happened? Does anyone out there who managed to read through my whole text have any similar experiences? I dont think I want to see him, but I have been thinking about writing him. I dont want him to feel attacked, and probably he remembers and feels icky or bad about it. What I think I want, is to know if anything else happened beyond what I remember. Was there more times? Did he do other things, and if so what? I know it sound awful, but if lets say he would masturbate me regularly, that could make sense for some of my weird sex hang ups.

Would he tell me what he remembers, or would he be too ashamed? If I ask him to tell me everything he remembers, will that be too confrontational for him? Do I have to share with him what I remember? I dont know if I want to do that, I feel like I want him to tell me about it how he remembers it. I dont know if its even a good idea to be poking into this, should I just try and let it go and put it all behind me? I would really love to hear from anyone who had similar experiences.

114,"I feel like a bag of untreated mental issues.    


My history is that I felt depressed since I was 12. I don't think anyone knew or they probably didn't think it was serious. I had a breakdown and felt empty for years after that, to the point I didn't think I was human. I was functional, I studied well, but the future was a black hole for me. I didn't feel love or happiness at the time. I wasn't even glad to get into university, but later deluded myself into thinking it was a ""new start"". The start of a new, successful me.   


It wasn't. One week into starting uni, I showed kindness by helping a  guy in class. He started pestering me, visiting me every day since we lived in the same dorm. It's so cliche, but he got beyond all of the walls I've built over the years, I fell for him  in a matter of  a few months despite not enjoying any human contact or company for years before. I was supposed to focus on studying, but I felt empty for so long in my life that this love I had was the first fulfilling thing I've ever felt. He was optimistic and funny, my complete opposite, I thought he liked me because he pursued me,  but he tossed me a few weeks after I let him kiss me. He didn't even tell me, let me follow him around and just acted cold towards me, but I had no experience in love and didn't get the hint.   


When I realized what was happening, my depression surfaced again, and I started avoiding him too, but it wasn't even the worst part. It was maybe just a month after my realization of being rejected that he came into my room in the middle of the night, climbed into my bed, and .. I struggle to remember the details, other than that I begged for him to stop and chanted how much it hurt,  but I was frozen, I couldn't control my body at all, and all my mind did was scream at me that this was wrong while he just said ""shh"" in response. I had to leave early that morning and left him in my bed, I didn't even cry. I went to meet  my friends, maybe I was still in shock but I acted 'normal'. I don't remember much after that, other that I closed myself off from the world, and became deeply depressed. I obviously couldn't tell anyone. I blamed myself for not being able to stop him too. I never got an explanation, no closure. There was no confrontation. I found out in a roundabout way that he was completely drunk (I didn't even notice that he was) and he didn't remember a thing (I don't even know if that's true because he acted normal, and I didn't think anyone could act normal after what they did). To this day it bothers me if I think about it. It makes me cringe. I feel guilty, ashamed that I let that happen to me. I was always the girl who thought you had to be stupid not to spot such scumbags in advance. In reality, he was the nicest guy I knew..  A year later he reached out to me, asked me to meet him, and apologized for ""everything"". I regret that at that time I never asked what exactly ""everything"" was. I pretended I didn't know what he meant and continued to explain to him how he was long forgotten. Now I will never know the truth. I will never know ""why"".  


After this I spiraled out of control.  I went abroad, stopped contact with all of my friends and family, and jumped into the arms of another horrible man, who emotionally abused me for a few months. It looks like a short period of time, but maybe because I was already depressed, I managed to hit a new low when I returned home. I lived alone for half a year, closed of from the world in a coffin-like room. I didn't go outside for days, living of toasted bread and tea, because leaving my room even to reach the kitchen caused too much anxiety. I missed all of my lectures. The gaps left by that made me realize that I'll never make it in the field I've chosen. I was at the bottom. I flat out told one professor that I won't send the final project because I'm too depressed. He reached out to me. Talked to me about professional help, said he was depressed his whole life too.  


Thanks to him, I finally reached out to a family member. He, in turn, asked me if he could tell my parents. The family was shocked, and I feel bad that I put them through this even now. I never got therapy, just medication, that I struggled with as well, because life didn't feel better. I became a functional person again, but nothing came out of higher education for me. I have no actual skills to find a decent job. I tried to learn other things but nothing came to fruition, maybe because I only went for things that could be successful fields, but I never liked them. In the end, I feel like I've wasted years of my life and yet still can't snap out of it. I feel inferior to everybody, including my amazing SO who is doing so well in life that he got a new job abroad, and expects me to follow him, learn a new language and ""make it"" there as well. All I feel is anxiety. When we're together, I take out my stress on him because that's the only way I can pretend I'm not depressed. When I'm alone, I sink back into this helplessness. I can't even force myself to eat. I feel like every year, for the past 5 years, I've been telling myself that it's a ""new start"" but it never worked out. I don't trust myself to succeed in life. I feel like everyone secretly thinks I'm a failure so I want to hide even more. I just want to make them proud, so I can't even show any signs that I still have a problem. I nod my head and smile, when my SO happily talks about our future. Meanwhile, all I can see is myself giving into another delusion that I can become successful. I feel like it's draining my life force.   


The only time I felt truly happy was when I had my first decent job, but it was a short-term contract and one in a million kind of a job. It didn't have high requirements, and the pay was double the average. I felt worthy for that short while and actually enjoyed life. Now I'm back at 0, facing life in a foreign country, and all I can think about now is that I'll never find a good job again or it will take years to do, because I'll be even less there than I was here. I don't even know how to deal with myself. I feel like I'll disappoint everyone, because ""new starts"" never worked out for me before. It feels like I've just been buying more time and avoiding the truth that I'll never amount to anything.  


Today is just one of those days for me. I know I'll go back to being 'normal' again, pretending it's just how life is, ups-and-downs, until the next time it hits me again. Maybe by that time I'll have the ability to go to actual psychotherapy and figure something out. For now, I needed to let this out somewhere, because I feel alone. So sad and alone. ",03Jan2019,1

I feel like I’ve got social anxiety bad, and maybe depression but maybe not. The depression symptoms have gotten a lot less severe and frequent since I quit drinking, so maybe I just feel mopey at times from the anxiety. 

I hate leaving the house to do anything. I feel awkward and stay quiet during family gatherings, I can’t think how to describe it other than feeling awkward around everyone. And plus my whole family is all doing alright on their own, married, own their homes and all that.  and I’m the only one in the “failure to launch” kind of situation so I really feel like the black sheep of the family.

I don’t like being in public, I don’t like to ask for help. If i can’t find a place that i’m looking for while driving, or a product I’m looking for in a store, I’ll just leave and go back home.  I don’t like to talk on the phone I worry I won’t know what to say and will just embarrass myself.

I especially can’t enjoy large public events like parties, concerts, conventions, parks and stuff like that at all. I don’t really get claustrophobic in tight spaces, but if I’m in a big group of people I do. I usually start to feel jittery and short of breath and just get out of there quick as I can. 

I used to drink when I was feeling depressed cause it kinda made me forget about it for a while but that was a terrible idea. I turned into a heavy drinker for a while, ruined some relationships with my long time friends and my now ex gf. I’ve since quit drinking and I don’t feel as pathetic and useless anymore. I’ve started a new job and I’m trying to get my shit together and stay positive about it, although I’m deeply in the hole financially. It seems hopeless at times but I try and not think of it that way.

Really now I just feel kind of lonely at times. I have 1 friend who I used to go fishing with and stuff, but we don’t do much together anymore. And no one else to text or talk to and share about our day/week or whatever.

Certainly no prospects of a gf with the social anxiety, afraid to go out and meet and talk to people, the large amounts of debt which will consume 99% of my income for prolly years to come. and the fact I still live at home with a mediocre mechanic job. Nobody’s gonna want to date me. 

I suppose the thing I need to do is get insurance and see a professional about social anxiety and try to get help with it so I might feel more comfortable and be able to go out and do things and make more friends. I just came here to rant about myself I suppose. I hope that’s alright.",03Jan2019,1

122,Basically when I was a kid for several years I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. I remember it started happening when I was 4 but I could have been even younger because at 4 is when I have my first memory of it. It didn't stop until I was about 12. It would happen almost daily and at least once a week in the 8 years it went on. I never told anyone but my girlfriend because when it happened and I wanted him to stop but he wouldn't I'd try to tell but he would hold me down and sometimes suffocate me a bit to stop me. I never really thought it affected me that much but after talking about it a bit with my girlfriend I realized it has. I get depressed randomly even if nothing is wrong but I easily get depressed at anything that stresses me out a lot. I don't really have a lot of hard feelings towards my cousin but I hung out with him about a week ago and ever since then I've been feeling randomly depressed and have been waking up feeling super panicked and not being able to feel at ease for hours sometimes. I think these feelings might be because I have suppressed my feelings my whole life and never dealt with the trauma of being sexually abused for most of my childhood. ,03Jan2019,1
123,"I have psychotic depression, but I don't take any medications for it. I take medication for my ADHD and insomnia.
Even when I feel happy, there's always a bit of depression lingering in the back of my mind. I also have GAD and being depressed has a tendency to cause stress and anxiety in my life. For the past two days, I have been so anxious that I slept a total of 2 hours. When I don't get sleep, my body stops working. I drank a tiny bit of juice this morning and I threw it up almost immediately. My asthma is also really bad when I am tired. Everything hurts and I don't want to be trapped in thisb vicious cycle anymore. I have been thinking about killing myself for months now and even when I happy, the thought lingers.

125,"It would usually be in the morning after I’d gotten out of bed. I’d be watching cartoons are playing video games and a distant faint scream would build up in my head. A single voice. Not sure why but I never told anyone. I’d close my eyes and try to focus on making it go away and sometimes it’d get to the point that I’d be screaming into a pillow to drawn out the voice. Anyone think this was mild schizophrenia? I haven’t experience since I was 10-13 years old, I’m currently 27.

126,"I have OCD. It makes me do weird things. The things I do don’t seem normal to ‘normal’ people. Normal people don’t understand. Having OCD means that I get thoughts that aren’t mine. They don’t belong to me, and I can’t control them. I get these thoughts and they tell me to do things, otherwise something will happen. Normally, something bad. One analogy I have for it is thus:
Imagine someone comes up to you and holds a gun to your head and tells you to give them all of your money, or they will shoot you. What would you do? You could comply, and give them your money, and they would leave you alone, you wouldn’t get hurt. Or, you could try and fight them and possibly get shot in the head. Is it worth the risk? If you only had five pounds on you, you might just comply, it's really not worth the risk, is it? What if you had £100? £1000?
This is like OCD. It makes me do things I don’t want to do just to avoid the danger/ fear. Sometimes it is only little things, so it makes sense just to give in. Sometimes its much much worse. Then you have to think, is it worth it? Sometimes the things it comes up with are so horrifying that you would rather be shot in the head.
Another analogy is thus:
Imagine your brain. A nice healthy brain. Then, a parasite infects you. It clings onto your brain stem, feeding off of you. It tells you to do things, and when you do them, it grows, and when you don’t, it releases toxic chemicals to make you feel scared and uncomfortable, but when you don’t do what it says, it starves. If you give in it grows and its tendrils spread through your brain. It pollutes your thoughts and makes you wonder how much of you is really you anymore. How much of my thoughts are mine?
I cant sit still without my eyes darting around the room looking at things that its telling me to touch.
I cant type without it making me go back and delete things and write them again and again until it feels right.
I cant write without having to draw random lines and dots and fill in the loops and mess things up and rewrite them over and over.
I cant walk through a shop without having to touch random objects until it feels right.
I cant walk anywhere without touching the floor with my fingers, or putting both hands flat on the floor.
I cant watch a video without waving my hand in front of my face in a fist.
I cant type without turning caps lock on and off incessantly.
I cant watch a video without every so often having to press the power button.
I cant look in a mirror without checking it isn’t one way glass.
I cant look in my webcam without covering the camera over and over.
I cant hold a flag without tapping it on the floor.

127,"I have lived my life haunted by something that happened in my past. I do my best not to let it get to me, but some nights are harder than others. Last night was one of them. No matter how tired you are, you can't fall asleep when you feel the sickening, irrational feeling that something will get you when you close your eyes. You know it won't, but your fear response doesn't listen to logic.

When this happens, I need to make noise. I need to distract myself, listen to music, go somewhere, anywhere, that has decent enough lighting and doesn't feel dangerous. It can be a challenge at 2am.

When it gets to me, I find myself feeling the need to apologise for my own fear. I reach out to loved ones, just to say that it is getting to me. They all say that it is fine, and it is better that I let them know what is happening, but i still feel like I need to apologise. I feel like I'm weak for letting it get to me. I feel like I'm selfish for burdening my friends with my trauma. More to the point, I feel like people will see how damaged I am and decide I'm not worth the trouble.",03Jan2019,1

Wasting money is kind of a big deal for me right now. I’ve read that 10,000 LUX is necessary for noticeable benefits? I found one on Amazon for a decent price with decent reviews.

130,"Probably a dumb question but it seems valid to me. 
Over the past year or so I’ve noticed “new” behavioral and emotional tendencies such as self isolation, feeling like something is seriously wrong for no apparent reason,  general uneasiness (spiritually and mentally), and most prominently, literally nothing makes me happy anymore. I’ve always been melancholic and I’m pretty sure I’ve been depressed for a while but there’s always been a light at the end of the tunnel. Lately though, the light is hard to find. My hobbies and outlets don’t work as well if at all anymore. When I spend time with friends I’ll wish I was alone and simultaneously wish I could be as carefree as them. But I can’t? There’s just always something in the back of my mind telling me nothing is okay. That I NEED to be worried. That something bad is GOING to happen and I am running out of time. 
I remain hopeful that I can pull through and that this is only a phase, but I’m a very deep feeling person and I often worry that all of my life experiences and traumas have just built me up to be this anxious, lonely person forever.

132,"Just before I get into this I’m just gonna say sorry for the wall of text. I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this stuff at the moment in my life and I’m beginning to find it increasingly difficult to keep bottling it up and pushing it down. I feel I just need to get the words out, if even for the sake of straightening things out in my own damn head. 

I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me and it’s driving me insane. I’ve had god damn diagnoses of everything from borderline personality to schizo-affective disorder and everything damn thing in between. I understand that there are a lot of issues with labeling what something is and how it can be detrimental, and I suppose in a way the incessant need to label everything is a large contributor to why I’m so confused and feeling singled out now, so I guess it makes sense. I mean, if labeling issues like this was never a thing and it all just fell under the one category with a list of all the symptoms, then maybe things would be easier, but what the fuck do I know. At this stage, after seven fucking years of all this shit, I’d honestly just like to be told in a straightforward manner, “this is what’s wrong with you, this is what it means” and so forth. I just feel because I’ve not been boxed up in some category I must be the god damn outlier who’s just completely batshit, which I know logically isn’t the case but that’s just how it feels. So god damn lonely. 

Recently in my life things have taken a bit of a turn, and more so than ever I feel like I’ve literally got nobody to talk to whatsoever. I just try and ignore it as best I can and then everytime I think of it I get this hole in my stomach and shit just spirals. What’s the worst is that the only time I’d tell people even a little bit of it is when I’m fucked drunk, and then the next day I feel so god damn stupid for spilling my guts and making a fool of myself like that and how annoying it must be for them and how they think of me that it literally just exacerbates everything. 

I’ve got a therapist and all that shit but honestly I feel it does nothing. I’ve been to so many of them over the last few years that it feels more like a damn routine physical than it does a safe place. 

For seven years now I’ve been going through this. That’s not to say I haven’t had good time and stuff. Some of the best times of my life have been in the last seven years. But what sucks is that whenever I try and communicate how difficult it’s been the fact that I have had a good time is almost used as an argument against me that I’m overreacting or exaggerating. 

In the last year more so than ever before I think about killing myself. I’d never do it. I’m terrified of dying. Yet for some fucked up reason nine or ten times a day I think about literally just ending it all. I can’t understand even how I fantasize about it so much when the idea of actually dying terrifies me, but there it is anyway. A friend even came up to me one day a couple weeks ago and asked was everything okay because I’d been making more suicide jokes than I usual would. And it’s a total defense mechanism thing I understand that. I joke about everything I feel it just makes it easier to deal with, but then suddenly it just bites me in the ass when I realize that it’s undermining the validity of the shit when I do want to talk to someone about it. Yknow, as im sure you’re familiar with the whole “dude you’re not depressed you’re always laughing and joking around”. 

Since I started college and started drinking things are even worse. I literally drink as much as I can sometimes in the hopes that I won’t wake up or at the very least sleep through a god damn night (which happens maybe once every two weeks). I’d take any drug that’s handed my way and I don’t even know why. Somehow while being terrified of dying every action I take appears to be in direct contrast of that feeling. Even when I’m at the god damn bus stop I feel the need to stand right at the edge of the road where if a car were to swerve I’d for sure be fucking crushed. 

As well as all this shit I’m constantly trying to lose weight. Since I was put on ability four years ago I gained a shit ton of weight, then when I was taken off it because it wasn’t helping, I managed to lose some of it. Then when I started drinking a few years ago it’s just all back on again. I barely even fucking eat yet still gain weight. I know it’s the drinking but I mean it’s also just basic science that if I have less calories in then I do out weight should be dropping but no that doesn’t seem to apply. 


Anyway I’ll leave it there. I’ve a lot more to say but honestly I feel sick just typing this shit out. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

134,"Hello all. I have a brother-in-law (BIL) (m26) who I believe needs treatment/therapy. He has always displayed a lot of signs of Asberger's/Autism spectrum: very quiet and reserved unless the topic is one of his interests, does not pick up on social cues, rarely makes eye contact/smiles etc. His girlfriend (f22) has recently reached out to my wife, BIL's sister, stating that BIL has been scaring her lately (saying hurtful things, not spending time with her, making rash life decisions, not being himself etc.). She is worried because in the past he talked about being depressed and how, at times, he thought about killing himself and specific ways he would do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: the girlfriend has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so it is possible that some things she tells us may not be 100% accurate.  


There is tension in the family, between BIL, his girlfriend and his parents. His girlfriend reached out to my in-laws awhile ago when he first talked about his depression/suicidal thoughts and she felt like they didn't take it very seriously. I think my in-laws have a somewhat dismissive attitude about mental illness/therapy and they thought they could help him by checking in with him more and spending more time with him. BIL's girlfriend rarely comes to spend time with the very close-knit family and the in-laws take this personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: As far as he knows, his girlfriend is the only person that knows about all of this. He knows that his parents know he went to therapy because the bill was sent to their house but I don't think they ever talked about specifics or reasons why he was going. We are getting a lot of 3rd hand info from his girlfriend.  


The girlfriend has had her own past with depression including a suicide attempt and she sees the red flags in his behavior right now that scare her. At one point she showed him a list of Asberger's symptoms and he agreed that it sounded exactly like him but when she told him it was for Asberger's he got very offended and thought she was calling him slow/dumb. She got him to see a therapist several months ago but he stopped going after about a month because it cost too much (nearly $1000 in about a month) and according to him ""they weren't getting into anything serious"".  


I'm looking for advice on 1) How to get him to be more open to therapy, 2) How to find a good/affordable therapist, and 3) Any advice on handling the awkward dynamic between the in-laws/girlfriend.  


I am seeing if the girlfriend can get us his insurance info so I can try to find somewhere he might be covered.  


TLDR; My brother-in-law has a history of (un-diagnosed) autism symptoms, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I'm looking for advice on getting him to open up about the idea of therapy and advice on finding a good/affordable therapist.

135,"About a week and a half ago (Christmas Eve actually) I started to feel nauseous and generally not right. This continued for about a week, and I had really intense stomach discomfort and diarrhea (sorry for the TMI). I never vomited, but I suspect that this is partially due to my intense anxiety around getting sick. I'm a generally healthy person with a strong stomach and I LOVE to eat- so I was extremely stressed and uncomfortable throughout the whole process. My sister and mother both had norovirus the week before, but I wasn't sure that was the problem until my boyfriend (who took care of me while I was at my worst) vomited a couple of days ago. He's already recovered, but I still feel so off. I'm beginning to suspect that my lack of appetite and acid reflux is actually being spurred on by my anxiety. I even start to feel a sense of dread when I take a bite of bread, and If I think about it too much my stomach begins to bother me again. Has anyone else had this experience before?

137,"I feel the need to write about this year..  Because this year was awful and I feel terrible. 
 I’m sorry about my English, it’s not my native language. 

I started my final year at the university. But it didn’t went well. I was exhausted and overwhelmed. 
In June me and my boyfriend, who where living together for a year and have been together for 3,5 years, decided to buy an apartment together. We went through the whole process, looked at apartments, found a really great appartement in one of the best streets in the city, we went to the bank, got a loan and even signed the papers. I was in heaven because I have never had a “home” and I was so happy and dreamt about our future. But two days later, after a normal day where me and my boyfriend went grocery shopping for the whole week, my boyfriend start crying and goes outside because he needs to think. He drove to his moms house and came the next day back with a truck and took all his belongings and was gone. He wasn’t happy anymore... 

So without further explanation he was gone and also my whole idea about my future. 
We arranged that he would buy the appartement by himself. And now I haven’t spoken to him since September. 

It really crushed my soul. I feel like I can’t trust anyone. 

The past six months where terrible. I literally haven’t done anything. 
My thesis is a real disaster. 
I lay on the couch all day. 
Cooking, grocery shopping, showering,... it takes all so much energy. 
I am also worried about my dad because he’s an alcoholic and apparently there is physical abuse between him and his girlfriend.

139,"I met this girl online when I was a depressed, suicidal, kissless handholdless virgin. I was 20 at the time and she was 19.

I thought she would be my manic pixie dream girl that would save me from my misery. Meeting her for the first time felt exhilarating. I had my first kiss, we held hands. But I soon realized that I rather fell for the idea, not the actual person. I didn't really love her, couldn't feel ""the butterflies"", but I liked the carnal aspect of it all. But I didn't told her the truth, because I wanted to lose my virginity to her. She knew I was a virgin and she was one too. A perfect scenario for not-so-attractive young male as I was. I was thinking that I couldn't let the chance slip. I stuck in a long-distance relationship with her for sex and out of fear of being alone, even though she had a fair share of her own psychological issues (mild BPD, self-harm, suicide attempts in the past etc) and we didn't click as good as I thought we would.

Two and a half years later she cheated on me multiple times with some guy she met through her friends in her home city. She said she also kissed other guys (and girls), one of them way earlier, when we were 1.5 years into the relationship. It's strange that I felt devastated even though I didn't really love her. Can someone explain this? Am I a narcissist? Possessive? Or maybe I did love her, after all?

Anyway, for my own sanity I cut all contact with her. Shortly after that she had a suicide attempt. After leaving the psychiatric ward, she tried reaching out to me, asking for forgiveness and wanting to ""be friends"", but I had always stated that I didn't want to keep in touch. But I also felt guilty for not being honest with her all along. So last time she contacted me, I told her that I hadn't really loved her and I apologized. She was a bit upset and even spiteful in response, but then said she's not angry with me. Me, on the other hand, can not really forgive her nor forget what she has done, even though I am no saint myself and would have probably cheated on her as well, given the chance. I guess I got what I deserved.

What bugs me is that telling her the truth didn't bring me a sense of closure. Every time I reply to her, I feel like she gains some power over me. I don't want her to know that I somehow still care. I instantly feel much worse. I am scared to death to admit any weakness before her. I still feel humiliated by her. She clearly has no respect for me, since she keeps contacting me even though I don't want it. Is she manipulating me?

I feel like a total human garbage now. Why am obsessing over something that shouldn't mean anything to me?",03Jan2019,1
