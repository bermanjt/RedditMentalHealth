I am 19 (F) who's birthday is on new year's day, I always end up going out and celebrating my birthday on new year's Eve because there is always a party or something on that night. 

This year it happens that I am extremely ill and cannot go out or do anything for my birthday or the foreseeable future, it also happens that I suffer from Bipolar disorder, OCD and depression and have done for a long time. (Being physically ill on top of the above mental illnesses is always extremely difficult). 2019 was also the hardest year for myself personally and the holiday season is quite difficult also.  I am just feeling very low and dissapointed and stressed right now.

If anyone could please share some tips on how to feel a little better or even little tips on how to pass the time until the end of the holidays? I would greatly appreciate",31Dec2019,1
1,"First of all, Id like to acknowledge the fact that Im only 18 years old so this is probably going to be extremely naive and stupid of me but I just want to share something thats been really bothering me lately and hopefully someone can give me a better perspective on the matter.

Lately Ive been noticing how fucking awful everything is more and more. Theres nothing specifically bad going on in my life but I see it all around me. Not necessarily with people close to me but also just hearing about things online etc. As someone who doesnt believe in any kind of afterlife, Ive always been really afraid of my own death. Ive tried thinking of life from so many different perspectives but the only one making any sense is this. THE ONLY THING we have is our experience of life (basically what we feel and think). When that ends, we have absolutely nothing. Its the only possible thing thats anything at all and just knowing that at one point its just going to end is absolutely terrifying and crippling. I completely believe that it is absolutely impossible for someone who doesnt believe in an afterlife or reincarnation to truly accept their mortality. People just cant think of it properly Imo, because I know that its something completely impossible to even comprehend.

Couple this dread with constantly seeing people commit suicide, die in an accident or get diagnosed with cancer etc. A close friend of mine told me the only thing stopping him from committing suicide is because he doesnt want his family to suffer through it. Recently a childhood ""friend"" (who I havent been friends with or talked to in over 10 years) died of an overdose at the age of 18. A young artist Ive been following got diagnosed with cancer and apparently has about a year to live. People constantly telling awful things on forums about how theyre suffering with things I couldnt even imagine. And then Im sitting here, feeling bad even when there shouldnt be a reason to. It just makes me really angry and sorrowful to see how fucking unfair everything is.

So I feel like Ive come to a conclusion that life is fucking terrible and so is death. I feel like theres no true feeling of content that you can reach without closing your eyes from all the facts. Life is like a quick glimpse of hope that just eventually ends with you being completely alone, with all the meanings you created throughout just disappearing because the truth is that they dont fucking matter.

Please someone give me a better perspective and justify it logically.

TLDR: Life is fucking unfair, death is terrifying and accepting it is impossible, everything fucking sucks. Please give me a reason to think otherwise",31Dec2019,1

3,"The holidays are really hard for me because I usually go to the hospital around this time. This is the first time in 2 years since I've been home for Thanksgiving and Christmas and I was proud of myself. Well turns out I was just stuffing my emotions down to make everyone else happy. Things started to get bad I'd say about a week ago and my mom and sister have been the only people to see it. It didn't get ugly, they just listened to me cry and rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my sister got into an accident a while ago and I've been driving her around, hasn't really upset me because I know no else will take her to hang out with friends. Today was different. I agreed to take K to her friend's house, but my mental health has slowly but surely getting insanely worse. (crying out of nowhere, no appetite, insomnia, not wanting to get out of bed, etc, etc) We had this planned since last week and I stick to plans, especially since I don't want to get out of bed since I feel no obligation to leave my bed. I wasn't in a great mood and I will say I did snap at K when she asked what was wrong. I feel horrible about it but little did I know my sister would instantly get upset. She said she didn't want to go anymore because I wasn't in a good mood and that upset me even more. I said we were going because that was the plan and I wouldn't stay, well she thought I was staying and got MORE upset to the point of crying. She didn't hold back. She talked about my ex, how no one in the family wants to invite me to things because they think I hate them and how sad I am all the time. It really hurt and the funny part is, I bite my tongue every time this happens. I don't comment on things I know she's sensitive about because that's low. When we argue I tell her why I'm a disappointment and how I can't exactly wish my depression away. It's horrible, I hate arguing with K. She is my best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I take her home and drop her off because I need to take a drive to calm down. When I came home, I went to my room and chilled out. My mom comes in to talk to me and tells me my step-dad is furious with me because I made K cry. I am shocked because I cried too, she made me feel horrible and IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T FEEL OKAY. I'm the bad guy because I expressed myself in a radical way, I'm the bad guy because I cry too much and can't say how I feel without exploding BECAUSE they didn't want to listen to me when the problems are small and haven't eaten me alive yet. I've been the bad guy for years and years and years because it's easier because I'm more emotional than everyone else in the family. It's funny, I know I'm having an episode when my family all gangs up on me. I'm not very nice when I'm having an episode and instead of asking me what's wrong (because they know I get easily irritated when I'm really upset) they scream at me and say how they can't handle me. They don't try to help until it's too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so tired. I am so done with them. They say they want to help but they don't listen at all.",31Dec2019,1
4,"|Basically a list of the fucked up/ traumatizing shit I've experienced|  
It started with my parent's divorce in 2009 where I witnessed my father choking my mother while he was on top of her (no he wasn't raping her.)   
Weeks go by and my father gets into a wreck which causes him to get into pain killers, resulting in me seeing him pass out while eating spaghetti, dropping his head into the bowl.  
After Christmas of 2009, father's siblings decided now is a good time to rob us, also poisoning all of our food, and pissing/ruining clothing.  
Life is meh for a few years until 6 years ago. 2013. This is when my mother marries an emotionally/ semi-physically abusive man.  
The first time he lashed out was when I left a cup on the table and he proceeded to yell at me, then he picks me up and throws me to the ground.  
Another time where he got mad at me for whatever reason and decided it would be a great idea to grab me by the back of my neck and scream in my face. He's also a smoker so you can imagine for yourself how he smells.  
Time for stuff not associated with family  
A few months ago during the summer, I stayed at my friend's brother's apartment, this is when said the brother's friend shoves his penis in my face while I'm sitting on the couch. He's much older than me and I'm a 16-year-old male at the time of writing.  
But nothing tops what happened in the months of February to March. Specifically March 13th, 2019 on a Wednesday.  
A week after Valentine's Day I asked this girl out that I've known for 6-7 years.  I thought nothing bad could happen since I've known her for so long and we get along great.. Oh, how wrong I fucking was. Anywho. Our relationship started off fantastic until March 12th when she broke up with me out of the blue. I understood and was pretty sad about it. That sadness was nothing compared to what knowledge would be bestowed upon me.  
On, March 13th, 2019 the fateful Wednesday. I was told that she went around the school spouting off that I was her stalker, she hated me, we weren't dating. (later on, I was informed that rape was mentioned). This, of course, devastated me. Already being in a bad place that whole day. I broke into uncontrolled sobbing while violently shaking, I was also hyperventilating. I was told by a good friend of mine that I was mumbling suicide.  
So yeah, I do admit that it does feel good to get this out there to the public where I can hear feedback and advice. Thanks for reading to anyone who got this far. I do really appreciate it!

It doesn’t happen right away, it takes a few hours but once it hits it just feels awful.

Mother and Father have both been committed to the psych ward temporarily. My Father has recently started medications and is wonderful to be around. I am scared, embarrassed, nervous, however excited to get evaluated next week. I think at 31 its finally okay for me to admit that I have a mental health issue. I honestly thought I was just a pussy whole life because the people around me are so tough. However after seeing my 69 year old father almost kill himself for no reason, I think its time i get evaluated. Also I am very involved in trying to self medicate myself, with psycadelics. However I think i need a councelor at least. Also I'm drunk and rambling but this is exactly why this sub should exist.

I'm gonna go to a therapist soon I just don't know if this is something I should bring up. I think of suicide somewhat often, about 2-3 times a week. It's mostly just a little voice in my head that will bring up the idea if im in a rough place mentally. I almost always shut down the thought because I don't wanna put my family through that. I have a good life, just a kinda sucky mental state. Nothing too bad though. I don't wanna go to my parents because I know they'll get really worried. At first I wasn't concerned, but I did talked to a therapist and when she asked if I think of suicide I lied and said it didn't happen often, she still took that seriously. It only got serious once a year ago. I'm so sorry if i'm being irrational, I just wanna know if I should be worried about this.",31Dec2019,1

24,"I have been considering suicide for a LONG time. It’s a daily thing. Even on “good” days there will be a moment where I’m alone and the thoughts come back to me. I’m slowly losing interest in all my coping methods. I used to rely on digital art for comfort and now I can’t remember the last time I’ve even drawn something. Recently I have picked up gaming (currently playing RDR2 on PS4) and as much as I love it, it’s not exactly great for me. The burst of dopamine I get from listening to Arthur Morgan during cutscenes is quickly outweighed by the stress of realizing it’s 3 AM and that I’ve been playing for 8 hours and haven’t eaten or drank anything the entire day. If I’m being honest, I don’t think I have felt genuine happiness for a couple years. All joy I experience is momentary and will probably have some negative effect on me later. Like when I eat something I love and then immediately feel like trash afterwards and all of a sudden never want to eat it again. I honestly feel so useless all the time. I can’t imagine myself being irreplaceable in any way. Sure, someone may say that they love my sense of humor, but anyone else can be that funny. Maybe my boyfriend would miss me, but he could find another girlfriend in seconds. He’s a cute basketball player, any girl would eat that shit up. I know my mom enjoys my presence, but she also enjoys my three other siblings who could take my place easily. I don’t have to worry about any friends missing me because they all either do not care about me, or would do better if I wasn’t around to ruin their lives. I have a really sweet friend and I love her so much, but I’m such an asshole to her because I suck at responding to affection from others. Honestly, any time I feel like I may have a chance at having a good relationship with somebody, there’s always that moment where I say/do something annoying and I can feel our connection break a bit.

26,"I don’t know if this is possible since it seems like it wouldn’t make sense. But I had some bad things happen and I just denied it until I was able to shut out the pain completely and move on with my life, and function at normal capacity. If I’d let my feelings fester I would have become a depressed mess, may have had to quit my job, and would be in a far worse place now. 

It seems like other people in my family are still sad and struggling though they don’t openly show it. Meanwhile I’m not struggling one bit. I know it isn’t good to be shut down emotionally but it’s allowed me to continue functioning when I otherwise would crash and possibly commit suicide. 

I feel like my mental health is only getting better. I’ve struggled with depression symptoms for many years and am constantly learning how to cope better. Sometimes I have moments where I feel like I’m going to break down and everything’s about to go to shit, but I know how to deal with those moments. I’m able to use mental exercises that bring me back to reality and calm me down.

30,"I know the short answer: Im lazy. I know thats most likely the case and I worry that my mind creates these complicated excuses or reasons to not work just so my laziness can feel justified. But if that is the case then how tf do I break out of that if nothing seems worth working toward? And the longer I work toward something the more pointless the work seems. 

Ive been looking up this question around the internet and all the answers have been generally the same. I need to find my purpose, find what I love doing and pursue that. Except to be completely honest, the one thing I enjoy doing the most is escaping the world and my problems. Ive based everything Ive done around escaping reality. Ive obsessed over videogames that could immerse me in a world id rather be in, listened to music that took me away. It feels like im just constantly chasing a nostalgia high and thats the only non drug-related thing that makes me feel happy. And theres no way to make a living out of that.

Ive tried to pursue music to try and create my own atmospheres that could take people away, but the actual work part has burnt me out to the point where it doesnt feel worth doing anymore too. (Not to mention how discouraging it is to make a career out of being a musician.) 

Another answer to my question I see is “Where would you like to see yourself in 10 years.” But I literally cant, or dont want to. Idk why, maybe its because I dont know what I want to do or because I dont want to do anything, but I cant imagine at all what my life would be like in 10 years

31,"so ive been living in hell since 01. wont get into details of it all but ill just tell the main points. I was 10, had the worst week of my life, and ive had no will to live since then. I realized just how shit life is capable of being when it destroyed my one dream. 

fast forward to 09, the realization that im done with high school. 8 years of torment in school done, only 50 more of life to go. Or I could just call it quits now. I came up with a suicide plan, more complicated than it needed to be. But the goal was to not just die, but disappear. I didnt want to give anyone the satisfaction. But I was not old enough to acquire everything needed. in 10 in the middle of a breakdown I let it slip. and all everyone could think was that I had an evil master plan to guilt them into maintaining me. in 11, a decade to the week of my worst week ever my family abandoned me. now broke, homeless, and helpless I figured id give up on my plan. A friend who I trusted to talk with asked me to move in with her. she gave me hope in not just myself but my future. so I left the country, and illegally emigrated.  

Strike two. As expected, I just became someone elses burden. but now, finally lost where id never be found, I couldn't do it to her. she had tried everything she could to help, even lost my virginity to her, in what I could only imagine to be another way of getting me to find something to live for. in 2012 I came back to my country. she broke my trust by talking to my family. I told her it was a lost case but she wouldnt let me leave without going to them. 

in 13 I had what I needed. I had the income, and the age. so I got a gun. not knowing anything about them. realized shortly afterwards I should have gotten somethin more powerful, I wanted to be dead, not die. if that makes sense. I didnt want to have a chance at surviving, but I had gotten something small enough to hide only. 

by 14 I had saved up enough to get something more suited. then I got kicked out again. this time forced to find a place to live before hand. Forced by making my life even more miserable, and then came the trump card. Guilt tripping me. I moved to this place, roommate was a decent guy. we were sorta friends, I did have the few friends from highschool I had reunited in my life. But I was dead set. 

what I had planned to be my final time with them I smoked with them for the first time. finally something that numbed me enough, that gave some sort of joy ive always been lacking. It kept me around. They've been offering me to smoke with them since 07 and it took being at my lowest to try it. Well maybe I can ride the numb train and something good is bound to happen eventually right?

around this time it started. my teeth started falling apart. by 17 I looked like a meth addict. multiple exposed nerves. Pain that can not be described in language. The same pain known to those who suffer from Trigeminal neuralgia, and they call it suicide disease. At this point smoking weed was the only thing that made the pain go away. I felt trapped. I barely made enough to cover y expenses and got myself into a lot of debt trying to fix my teeth in vain. I hadn't spoken to my family in ages. 

Strike 3, when they saw me they sent me off to get my teeth fixed. They were beyond that. I went through multipe surgeries to have them removed, and wear dentures. Rather quality ones though. now more guilt ridden than ever, I fell into another bout of hope. That id change careers and do something better. I went back to school. Struggled, hard. Somehow bullshitted my way into my dream college. 

Hope, that most cursed of emotions. Worse than any desire ive ever had, that never fruited. it drove me to this new town. immediately, I realized I made a mistake. and im too deep to do anything about it. 19 was a year of struggle. Not just with school but with myself. It became obvious then, more than ever, that im going to be alone and indebted to others. And my struggles are leading me to more hardship. The story comes full circle, the hope I had of my family understanding has vanished. They never changed. Im still an evil mastermind to them. Even through my ways of trying to not be a burden they find a way of making me the bad guy. I have enough struggle on my plate to pass around, I dont need this too. 

So where does this lead? I dont know, what I do know is 91, 01 and 11 have had the roughest times of my life. 21 looks to be bringing more of the same. but alas im stuck. my own fucking niceness wont let me do it. Heres to ending 19 at rock bottom... again.

I haven't felt brave enough to talk about this to my friends even though I know they would listen, but I don't know how they would react. Trust me, I'm really not cynical most of the time, but i just don't know if anyone really listens to or cares about me. I feel lost, scared, and hopeless. I'm tired, stressed, and broken.

33,"Recently I've hopped back on the merry go round of prescription drugs in an attempt to help my mental health. So far I've tried Lexapro and retried Prozac. Prozac caused elevated mood to the point of random euphoria, it also made me a bit more paranoid. I stopped taking my Lexapro prescription recently on accident but then just let it go because I noticed I felt less emotionally volatile, after the initial missed dose at least. It has been a week now and I'm feeling better than when I was on a daily dose of Lexapro. I know it's still in my system and I'm expecting a depression wave to settle in when it's totally gone but even when I stopped Prozac I felt very stable for a while until it was completely gone.

Has anyone else experienced this grace period? Mood disorders run in my family and I'm wondering if I have some form of bipolar like a few immediate relatives. I hope to address it further once my health insurance kicks in this week but looking for insight if anyone can relate.",31Dec2019,1
34,I have had a history of fighting depression and anxiety but for the past two months I had been doing really well. Recently I also adopted the idea of growing out my hair and my family shot the idea down hard and I don't think they realize that they are the people I get support from most. Since then I've kept to myself a lot more and just been less motivated to do things because even though it seems trivial I was looking for support and didn't get it and if I can't get support from my family can I get it anywhere?

37,"hi.

im a bi-polar schizophrenic

meaning when i go crazy, im not only hallucinating, but at a few days or another i feel as though im a god.

this is probably my symptoms at its worse.

now adays because of my new medication these symptoms are coming off as a slightly edgy attitude.

heres an example.

i was going out with a girl at work.

she at first expressed heavy interest in me.

so i started gifting her and we exchanged ""i love yous""

then one day she said she'd take her day off to swing by my place but never did.

i later found out she hooked up with this other co worker of mine that showed her dick pics.

i felt heartbroken and i needed to know what was going on between us.

i then exploded my heart to her to the point where i knew she felt guilty for what she was doing.

she then threatens the relationship and tells my boss that im harassing her.

i was shocked, i felt betrayed, i felt violated because her initial approach to exchanging our private information started off with her physically touching me in a flirtatious manner that if perceived wrongly violated a company policy.

and so i stood my ground and flipped the whole situation on her. no way was i going to be a victim of this. this is something she started and wanted to end on this note? so fine i decided to hold my ground and have her job at risk of termination.

that day and the next. she had this look of just sheer sadness and pain.  it actually made me feel bad for doing this to her. I almost felt as though i should have lied and just taken the fall for it. but at the same time i feel as though i wasnt going to be some kind of push over that she could dispose of.

i quickly came to my senses and realize that if i truely did have feelings for her and if i did mean what i said to her when i told her i love you then im going to have to fix this. I dont want to see her miserable.

So when the HR director shows up and interviews me i totally tried to defend her and did my best to make sure she doesnt get fired.

either way that day i defended myself i realize that when i become defensive i can seriously hurt someone i care about.

it made me think twice now on how i should properly defend myself because usually i find myself defending myself from hostile/hazardous scenarios so my natural instinct is to do as enormous amounts of damage to the targets forcing me to act defensive.

in this case it wasnt hostile/hazardous... it was more like my job and the security. i had to protect it. this was the first time my job was truely in jeopardy and so i went into my impulsive behavior of wanting to defend myself with the intent to inflict as much damage as possible.

how little did i know the harmful effect of it when i saw her face these last few days. im still learning. i realize i have something dangerous when it comes to protecting people i love. which started with myself and my family. she was second. maybe i should have thought of her first. but instead i decided to secure my future and inflict as much damage on to her as possible.

I still havent realized the power of my persuasion when i am defensive until just now.  before i took it as a hobby deliberately setting up baits and traps to lure stupid people in so i could destroy their evil egos.

but with this girl. i realized her evil side is also something im attracted to. and so i decided at the last minute to instead go with a transfer instead of having her being terminated and keep my mouth closed on the subject.

still though im trying to avoid contact with her around the work place because thats what my boss told me to do if i wanted to secure my job.  so i try my best to put on a good face and avoid as much eye contact with her. maybe mutter a few messages under my breathe when she comes near me and no one is around.

all i can do now.

i realize what i did out of defence and protection for myself in return really hurt her hard inside and im assuming she doesnt want to go back to how things used to be between us.

thats fine with me ill find a new girl eventually.

thats just how life goes at my age.",31Dec2019,1

40,"A good friend of mine was admitted yesterday at the local psychiatric hospital. I don’t know the exact circumstances for which she was admitted but she has been very obviously depressed these part couple of months. 

She has her phone with her and we have been texting here and there. I asked if I could visit her during visiting hours and she said I could. 

Is there anything I can bring her? (I was thinking of buying some magazines, chocolates and a bird game - any other suggestions?). I’m also a bit nervous about meeting her in these circumstances - should I ask her how she is doing? I don’t want to appear insensitive and Ignite the elephant in the room, but I also don’t want her to feel pressure to talk about something that she may have 0 interest discussing (or that may be too painful).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",31Dec2019,1

42,"I always turn to reddit when I'm at a low point. I guess I have to today as well. My boyfriend called me three days ago and told me we could not continue anymore. He told me we weren't working out bc there was no chemistry. I really requested him to tell me why he was really doing it because I have health issues and I thought there could be more to it, so he told me his parents did not like that I had mental health problems. He said he would date someone else if he wanted. We decided we would continue for 2 years in college exclusively but end it after I graduated.

I later texted my boyfriend that I thought it was very unfair of him and he is showing no strength whatsoever in the relationship. I told him he should not be so weak and fight for us. I was very upset and could not believe he was doing this. Did the relationship mean nothing to him? He had told me he felt connected to when we started and I tried to remind him of that with hope. What hurt most was him saying he can date other girls now and that I should find someone else too. But I still did not lose hope because I knew he was stronger than that. He tried to fight his parents after talking to me but his parents were a lost cause. He told me they weren't accepting me because I took a certain medicine. I stayed with him as he fought with them. We were texting and it was slowly becoming clear to me what a huge mistake I had made in life being so hard on myself and trying to achieve so much perfection that I now had health problems and people did not want to accept me because of it. He told me in the end we can still make it work and that always thought we could make it work. He said that we will follow a plan where I would do daily exercise and cut sugar out of my diet so that slowly I can go off medication too. 

If I hadn't been so hurt in life in previous relationships none of this would have happened. If I had been more confident and more positive in general, life would have been so good today. I used to be so good at everything. I was driven and motivated and really positive about myself. And now I can't help but feel like I have really let myself down. I need to really love myself and feel good about myself again. I really want to bounce back and feel like I am loved again. I never felt loved. And now I have to work to be loved again. I am shattered.",31Dec2019,1
43,"TL;DR at the bottom, i just need help!

Ok so about 30 minutes ago (its currently 12:18 am as im writing this) i saw my sister leave her room and go downstairs. Were good friends (im only a year older than her and a guy) so i went in there to sit on her chair and do a weird pose and say ""ive been expecting you.."" to be funny. And she came in with toilet paper, nothing weird bc i saw earlier we were almost out, and her room is one of the entrances to our bathroom. But she was acting super SUPER weird and nervous, like she was hiding something. After a while of jokingly, but kinda lowkey seriously, interrogating her, i kept noticing her looking everywhere and talking fast. Shes normally chill and laid back so this was weird. I decided to take a final look around before i left and saw a razorblade on the floor. Now, there was an open gift card on the floor, but there was red stuff on it. I jokingly, but again seriously, said ""are you cutting yourself?"". She said no and showed me her wrist, but wouldnt show the other. I then saw drops of red on her shirt. I told her that i would tell our mom tomorrow if she didnt and she started telling me things like ""if you dont tell her ill show you"", ""you better not tell her"", etc. what the hell do i do? Im super worried for her!

TL;DR: i think my sister is cutting herself, what do i do?

He says he will tell me if it’s too much, if he’s too emotionally exhausted. But I worry that there are just behaviors I have because of depression that I cannot control that are hurting him that he won’t tell me about. I have no reason to think he’d want to leave me, but I just feel like a shitty partner. We’ve set some goals for us as a couple next year that include changing how we talk about mental health and it makes me hopeful. I really want to change for him, I don’t want to make him my therapist. I plan on starting medication but it’s so scary. I have to trust him to call me out, and it’s so scary.

I feel like I'm being melodramatic and indulging myself until things get really bad because I want the attention or something...Idk if that's even really how I feel, I just don't know why I can't get my shit together when I know everything that I need to do.",31Dec2019,1
48,"Only reason I’m still here is the crushing amount of guilt I feel thinking about the end.  Life is too boring...  society has made it too difficult for men to live happily outside the stereotypes and corruption that is everywhere.

New Years Eve tomorrow and I’m sitting on my couch typing this because I can’t sleep.  I can’t sleep because I’m angry and frustrated.

I’m so angry and frustrated because I’m the only one who wants to talk about the things I want to talk about-no matter the subject.  I’m interested in things like science and technology.  I like video games and making cosplay.  You’d think that there would be SOMEONE in my life willing to discuss SOME of that at some point....nope....nothing...my wife only ever wants to talk about things like ‘what are we making for supper’ or.....you know what?  There’s not really much else.... she’s depressed as well, but making zero attempt for any kind of recovery while insisting she’s ‘trying everything’ but seriously not ever doing anything but sitting like a bump scrolling Facecrack.  Then I bring up the issue that we don’t spend time together and instead of any sort of effort towards any kind of forward movement or change, I get the increasingly boring and overused ‘I’m sorry’ then a catatonic-like state of complete self loathing and pity for as long as it takes for me to comfort her into believing that the world isn’t ending, I’d just like to actually DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN SIT HERE DOING FUCK ALL!

I’ve tried making new friends...I joined a local cosplay group and none of them are interested in anything beyond group appearances-none of my family has ever supported any of my interests, and at events they don’t even talk about me mostly, and certainly not about cosplay, or video games or anything I like at all.

My wife’s idea of ‘spending time together’ is being in the same room-that’s it.....we’ve had fights where I tell here I feel like I’m a wallflower or just an accessory because I literally just sit there all the fucking time....of course she gets upset and insists that’s not the case but she’s still unwilling to get up and do ANYTHING with me!  And even in the very rare event I convince her, I’m lucky if she makes it 20 minutes into it before she’s distracted away by-I have no idea because she says she just gets distracted.

I was born in the wrong place....I feel like my whole life is wrong.  Everything is wrong.  Nothing works like it’s supposed to, or like people raised me to believe it should...

All of the wrong people are in charge.  You actually get farther by being an asshole to other people than being a nice person.  I’m proof.  I’ve always endeavoured to be the nice guy, and EVERY time, I’ve been taken advantage of, and the favours are NEVER returned, ESPECIALLY when the nice guy needs it.  You look at almost all of the ‘leaders’ of our countries-assholes who take advantage of the people and commit illegal acts for money and get away with it because of legal technicalities....

If you aren’t already super rich, corrupt or set up for success than you’re pretty much fucked on this planet because of how it’s all set up.  Those of us who have to work are financially screwed by the people who control all the money because they want even more money, and it’s fine because it’s legal.

I can’t even get my own fucking life in order no matter what I try!  I’ve been fighting to find some kind of happiness in my life here.  People always say ‘you have a wife and kids, you should be overjoyed’.  Ok great-wife and kids-wife who doesn’t share a single interest and will not invest any time in your interests be they hobby, or intellectual interests.  I can tell you pretty much anything about The Walking Dead-but I don’t like The Walking Dead-my wife does-so I asked her questions and listened to her rant about it, etc. because it’s something she’s interested in and I wanted to relate to her more.  She doesn’t watch.....anything anymore, actually....nothing she’s dedicated to anyway...

I’ve tried counceling, I’ve tried pills, I’ve tried reaching out to family, I’ve tried rekindling old friendships, and making new ones...

I just....was not meant to be here, at this location, at this time....

And every day I really really REALLY wish I could hit that fast-forward button....I’m so bored and so lonely....

53,"So I don't know if I'm asking for advice or if I just need to rant somewhere. I'm 22 (UK) and currently, I believe I have no friends left. When I was 17 I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. 

During my teens I was very social, I'd stay out most days drinking and smoking with friends, sometimes skateboarding. It was very up and down, I'd self harm by punching myself a lot while drunk and do stupid stuff. I got bored of that lifestyle, I miss the friendships and social experiences but I couldn't couldn't handle all the smoking and drinking. I quit smoking at 19, still to this day I don't do it. I barely drink either. 

Even though I may physically be a lot healthier, mentally I'm not. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, I've been outside maybe 5 times this whole year. Only when a couple of mates ask me to hang out. But I can feel it dwindling, and I have trouble asking people to meet up. Because whenever I do it's always resulted in rejection, or nothing ever comes of it. When I was an alcoholic stoner I did lots of dumb embarrassing stuff that made people draw away from me. I don't take it personally, I know people are busy and have stuff to do. It is what it is and it's still upsetting me. In high school I was very clingy, so I try to keep to myself, but it's resulted in me being alone. I can't reach out to people because they ignore me and it makes me feel worse. I have terrible anxiety and the thought of going outside with no plans to meet anyone makes me have a panic attack. The people I used to connect with have all neglected me and it hurts so much. I used to think to myself ""Maybe I should suffer, maybe I wasn't meant to be happy."" I could acknowledge it as a depressing thought and disregard it. But now I genuinely believe that. I always seem to disconnect with people and haven't gotten anywhere. I'm 22 and have no one. No work experience or income, no ambitions or passion. I wonder if I'm just screwed? I don't want to be alone forever. And right now it's the only outcome I see. I'm scared I'll never have anyone to tell me they love me.",31Dec2019,1
54,"And it's not just Reddit. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...I spend several solid hours lying in my bed, taking turns opening my social media apps, just to scroll through the feeds endlessly and mindlessly, repeatedly, with no interest in what I'm looking at. That's all I'm doing, looking at it. It is the minimum requirement for temporary distraction: something to hold in my hands with unlimited things to view. Unfortunately, I don't find pleasure in anything I find, any where (online and in the tangible world around me). 

Nothing is interesting. The boredom I experience most days is nearly painful, but not as painful as the idea of getting out from under my covers and doing something productive. I just can't seem to find a reason to give a shit about anything. I need clean clothes, so I should do my laundry. I know this. Logically, I comprehend the task at hand, and physically I possess the capabilities to accomplish it (and probably in a timely manner). Motivation, however, is what seems to be lacking. 

The frustrating thing is, I want to WANT to do things. I miss being passionate about something outside of myself. I have spent some time reflecting on this, and a recurring thought I can't seem to shake is my obsessive fear of failing. Its not uncommon, for people to be so afraid of failing that they don't even try, but I am struggling on a level deeper than this. Am I afraid to fail at doing the dishes piling up in the sink? No. I should be afraid of failing NOT to do the dishes, but it's almost like I don't find myself important enough to deserve clean dishes. 

Obviously, if I were expecting a guest, I can count on the fear of them judging me as lazy being a priority over not caring enough about myself to perform basic self-care tasks. 

This fear of failing is not a new issue in my life, but it has never been so crippling and inconvenient, and I'm not doing much to help myself at the moment either. I have spent most of my life learning to live with my mental illness in a way that will allow me to participate in society, and I work hard to stay self aware and open minded. This is difficult to do without financial support. 

Therapy costs money. Meds cost money. Psychiatrists cost money. Tests cost money. Transportation to/from the appointments cost money. And with my mental health slowly declining (despite the surplus of pills I was prescribed for the last four years), it has become very difficult for me to maintain a job for even just a few months. As a result, I can no longer afford the care I need. I am currently in the process of applying for government assistance, but it is a lengthy process with lots of loop holes. 

I've realized how much I have typed and I am fighting the urge to just backspace out of this page and forget it. I have been struggling. I needed to put this down so it is real, for me, not for anyone else.

Almost like im converting sounds wrong. Example, when I hear rain dripping off my roof, I can sometimes hear unintelligible conversations, same with the dryer running. Maybe I'm just tired and sleep deprived. It definitely happens more when I am tired/haven't slept.

Similarly, (and this is *only* when I'm tired/sleep deprived) I will see small-ish translucent spiders/flailing arm-like structures in circular patters (like a flower with long and finger-like petals moving) on my bedding or walls. This has mainly occurred after an all nighter and happens less than half the time compared to the auditory ones, but it still kinda freaks me out.

I have never experienced psychosis, nor mania as I only have Bipolar 2 and have the cyclical depression. And my depression does not affect these occasional experiences.

57,"Bit of background; I've had shifts and gaps since I was 12, but diagnosed at 14 with Dissociative Identity Disorder. I'd already been through a lot by then, knew I had depression, and was just trying to survive. So when a school psychologist tried putting in the paperwork for it, we hid. 

I put in a lot of work to get all my others communicating, and we created a new persona to hide behind with a treaty of baseline rules on how to act around others so they wouldn't know.  Over the years, the only people we've clued in were those we wanted to spend a life with. Until recently, it's worked.

I know it's not a common condition, but I want to know how others have dealt with this condition. It's getting harder to maintain the mask, and frankly, we've spent so long trying to cover the condition up that no one believes us now until something extreme happens  (i.e. total takeover). Even then, it's just seen as me acting out. I think its time to change tactics, either to hide it and function or at least out maneuver others ignorance.. not like most people recognize the warning signs I use.",31Dec2019,1
58,"I’m tired. I’ve pretty much reached my limit, I feel like I’m going to lose my shit. I am not happy, I feel marginalized, I feel cheated by my own fucking brain chemistry. And as much as I try to focus on healing and trying to remember that it is indeed not linear, I often feel defeated and wondering why life is so hard for me.

I push back against the thoughts that creep up sometimes that suggest it might not be worth continuing to fight for my best life. I know that’s not the right way to think though, so I fight it.

I sometimes think of the little girl in my baby pictures. That poor child had no fucking clue. Who encouraged my poor soul to come here to get shit on like this? I’m tired of lying to myself, trying to think of what I’ve been through as blessings in disguise. As if my life has the potential to be a flawless diamond, underneath this horseshit that’s been my existence thus far. I’ve had enough of this life as it is. 

I don’t feel like I have any real reason to be here anymore, not at this moment anyway. My dreams of being a loving wife and devoted mother are dreams deferred, pending proper healing and alignment, I suppose. But what if I can’t do it? I’ve been trying to heal and move forward for so long... but I often feel like I’m going nowhere. Sometimes I feel like I’ve come a long way, in certain ways. Still have a ways to go in others. Sometimes I get triggered and I’ll trip and I’ll feel like I’ve undone the work that I’ve done to center myself. And then I feel guilty and like I shouldn’t keep trying because maybe I’m not worthy of the vision I’ve been given for my life. But I do keep trying. The vision was put on my heart so I fight for it. Even though the fight sometimes feels futile. I absolutely I want to be healthy and whole for the family I dream about having. But...sometimes it feels impossible. The clouds close in and I don’t feel strong enough to be who I’m supposed to be.

If I can push through these next few days, and hopefully come out of this feeling more positive, I will commit to my healing wholeheartedly in the new year. If it’s not healing and loving and edifying and nourishing, I don’t want it. 💯",31Dec2019,1

I’ve done MDMA before, those experiences are among the happiest and best in my life. Over the past year I’ve been tempted to “roll” just to give myself some respite, some joy, something... but I thought it best to indulge if/once I improve.

Well the other night my good friend is going out with some acquaintances and offers me to join. I decide enough is enough, I survived the worst year of my life, I’m still depressed, and can’t see when I’ll improve... I could use this. 

I dropped, I know what to expect, and like clockwork it hits... but this time it’s different. I really tried to take in the evening, surrounded myself with my best mates... but still, I just felt empty, hollow, worthless, hopeless. 

If I can’t even feel happiness while using a drug literally called ecstasy, a drug that has given me some of my happiest, most care free moments... am I fucked?

69,"In my experience, New Year is a completely crap time for mental health especially if you are exposed to all the self improvement junk like new year-new beginnings, intentions(a masquerade for resolutions) and so on. Here are a few tips to take care of your mental health during New Year:

1. Remember, it's just another day- A lot of pressure during New year comes from the hype created by the market. Remember, it's just another day, similar as the days passed previously. You don't need to do anything special just because it's a New Year.

2. Keep warm- If you live in the Northern hemisphere, you should be encountering freezing temperature. Keep warm by wearing socks and gloves, drinking tea, wrapping yourself in a soft quilt. Eat chocolate, almonds, dry fruits like pistachios, cashew nuts.

3. Reflect on what you'll like to carry forward from previous year/ decade- Instead of making a resolution on what you'll like to change in 2020, reflect on what you'll like to carry forward from the previous year or decade. It could be the curiosity when you suddenly become interested in astrophysics or it could be the grace you found in music when you were down in the dumps.

4. Avoid information overload- Instead of reading the hundredth self improvement book in the year after watching a super inspirational Ted Talk, stop. You don't need all these people telling you what to do. You've survived these many years, you've got all the tools to hack the algorithm of your life. Take my advice, instead of listening to a self help podcast, lose yourself in good fiction. (I've observed that genres like mystery, thriller and horror engage you enough during mental illness instead of slice of life, love stories, coming of age. Also beginning a series like A Song of Ice and Fire is also helpful).",31Dec2019,1

85,"Hello everyone, I've recently dropped out of college for the second time. I'm currently 19 years old with only a highschool diploma to my name. I was in IT College in 2018 and attended sales college in 2019. 

I dropped out of both courses. In 2018 I just.thought it was because the course wasn't right for me, but now in 2019 I realized it was my own mental health that was in my way. 

I've recently started seeing a psychologist, and she has helped me a lot already. But I cannot figure out what to do next. I'm still not motivated in to anything, I haven't got any hobbies aside of watching YouTube on my phone for the whole day, listen music and watch more YouTube or Netflix on my PC, oh and sleep. I do go to friends often and do stuff, as I do try to keep myself 'active'.

My dad isn't very supportive of me as he feels like im not depressed because I always seem energetic and happy, my mom tries to not have too heavy of an opinion on it, but she seems supportive.

I have been thinking about my options a lot lately, and I really can't figure out what to do.

I either go to college again in September of 2020, and start working for the months in between. The problem I do have is that I don't know if I'd be motivated enough to work and am also not sure if college will go well this time. 

I've also been thinking of just finding a hard labor job near the village I live in, and when I have saved up enough that I'd move into the city and try to find a 'nicer' job there, and skip college all together.

My main block on the road is myself, as I really don't know what to do. And I'm also scared that I'll fail at doing things like this. Or that my depression rises to an all time high somehow. 

I don't really know what else to say as if now, but here's my problem. I don't know if anyone here has an idea what to do, but I'm interested in feedback or help!

11 years later, I am 31 and still very anxious and in a crappy entry level accounts job. 

I'm regretting my decision so much as it meant that I did not push myself to grow. This is highlighted by the guy I am dating who is a doctor and he said he had really bad social anxiety but going to medical school helped him to develop and push him out of it.

90,"If you have a few minutes to read this, I would appreciate any suggestions as to how I can improve my mental health

&amp;#x200B;

I recently finished a grad degree and moved to a new city with my girlfriend. I'm looking for a full time job and working \~20 hours a week at a part time job that I enjoy but which doesn't really pay the bills, even if it was full time. 

My financial situation isn't awesome because I have a bunch of debt that I need to start paying down in the next few months, but it isn't desperate because I have a decent savings account from working for several years between undergrad and grad school. 

I've contemplated suicide periodically for at least the past ten years. Never made any concrete action toward that end and have never had a ""crisis"" of any sort. I do frequently fantasize about dying; cancer, getting hit by a car. I feel enough responsibility toward the people in my life to not kill myself but I wouldn't say I have any real intrinsic feeling of value to my life. I frequently think to myself that i would ""like the coach to take me out of the game."" 

I meditate pretty regularly and have been on several retreats. These have been positive experiences in a lot of ways, but they also seem to make me much less focused on ""doing what I need to do"". More and more I tend to just accept that I don't have a full time job or that I'm powerless to change the circumstances of my life.

I'm currently on medicaid, which means that while I have access to healthcare it's probably a month or two before I could see a doctor in a non-emergency setting. That would be a gp. A mental health professional would be longer. 

I have very little optimism about my job search, mainly because I don't have any real confidence that I could do a good job in any of the positions I am applying to.  

Thinking about the people in my life, it seems that just like people are different heights, some people are born happy and others unhappy and I got a bad dose of pessimism and apathy.

Is there a particular type of doctor or mental health professional I should seek out? 

I'm particularly concerned about my inability to do the basic things I should be doing. Currently that's applying to as many jobs as possible and continuing to improve skills and work examples. Historically that's been projects at work, homework, social activities. I can easily spend an entire day watching tv.

tldr: things aren't particularly bad, but there's nothing good and I don't really know how to address the sort of existential problems in my life. Just looking for new ideas to try in improving my life, particularly in terms of mental health.

There's  something inside my head making me feel bad, I'm not sure why is this  happening but I don't want to keep feeling like that. I feel this way  all day long every single day, when I have company, when I'm alone, it  doesn't matter if I'm ""smiling"" I'm just constantly thinking that I'm  tired, that I'm feeling really broken inside.

Several  times a day I have to hold my need to cry, doing anything: waiting on a  place, talking to someone, showering, eating, being alone thinking...  some other times I just can't hold it. It's been years of this but  everyday is getting bigger and bigger.

I  live in Venezuela, in a tiny town, so tiny that most venezuelan won't  heard about it never in their life. I don't know if you know what's the  situation of my country but to keep it short it's pretty bad. I swear  I've been trying all my life to accomplish something, I have tried a lot  and been trying hard, but now I'm just too tired to do anything.

I  don't have too much people to talk, I'm really shy so It's been really  hard for me to make any friend or something. I know people who I can  interact with but not everyday and just a little.

I'm  really thankful I have a girlfriend and I'm pretty sure she is the only  reason why am I still here, she is my everything I pretty much only  talk to her, but I still feel almost the same being with her. It's like,  I'm good with her but that doesn't do anything with how tired I feel  inside.

I'm on my twenties (closer  to the thirties actually) and I haven't done nothing with my life, I  pretty much don't talk to my father even tho we live in the same house,  the relationship with my sisters is even worse, we have years we almost  don't cross words and they are in the room next to mine.

This  country hits you hard, It's not only that it's hard to accomplish  something (I know every country have it at it's level) it's the  everyday. It's dealing with can't afford for all the food we need, with  power outrage everyday several times damaging the little food we can  afford and breaking the little things we have on our houses (You don't  know how lucky we are with our refrigerator is still working).

My  mom's a teacher, she have a degree, works like 2 hours away from home  but the thing is that is in another tiny town so there are almost no  buses working and if they were she couldn't afford to pay that everyday  so she have to ask for a ride to truck drivers everyday. Waking up  really early, getting in danger because no one knows when a driver could  be not only a driver, dealing with thieves that assault the school when  they want, all that for just $14 a month, that make me feel even worse,  because I can't do anything to help her.

Some  days (too many more that I would like) I have a thought about a rope  tied to a girder in my house, and that's scares the hell out of me  because I think about that too much and I don't want to do anything that  will hurt my mom, my girlfriend.

So what am I supposed to do? Would hospitalization help me or just make my situation worse? Do I just need to suck it up, and then if things do really go to shit, follow through with suicide?",31Dec2019,1
101,"My lack of understanding of what this is really limits me. But basically, my room mate can't really spend time thinking about how situations will play out in a way that is healthy. It's sort of like intrusive thoughts I guess but not really. At this point they don't spend time thinking about ""How things will play out."" because it isn't grounded in a realistic estimation of what will actually happen.  


My room mate steps on a lot of peoples toes unintentionally because of BPD but really only learns after stepping on said toes and reflects on why the situation resolved poorly. I've asked my Room mate (Who I will call T for brevity from this point.) if they think about how a situation will play out before entering it and trying to estimate the outcomes of what could happen but every time T does this they end up in an intrusive cycle of making unrealistically pessimistic outcomes and becomes anxious or lethargic.  


So T doesn't spend any time thinking about how things will play out because it leads to a negative thought cycle and T is usually pretty rational when dealing with non-social information (Very organized, keeps calendars, plans their day a lot) and is noticeably hindered in their functioning this way with estimating everything but social circumstances.  


I guess I'm looking for what this is called? This inability to think about socializing with others ahead of time or making realistic judgments about how people will act or respond. T is very social but has a really hard time respecting boundaries and guessing how people will act. T used to be under the impression if someone said yes to something they are not allowed to resent them because they consented (No matter how coerced the consent was) This was usually in the form of rides places (T doesn't drive) favors or volunteer labor.  


Example: T has a meeting, T pushed their objectives too hard in the meeting and wouldn't compromise their goals to the point where whoever the meeting was with was exhausted and had to directly tell T that they were pushing too hard. T doesn't want to be in situations where they need to be told that. T can't think about how people will respond to what they're doing ahead of time because if T were to do that the thought pattern is ""They will hate my ideas, hate me, and not want to deal with me at all."" When realistically T just needed a softer approach and the person didn't hate their ideas. Just how they were so aggressively pushed. But ""Choosing"" an approach to the situation is hard for T because T won't spend time thinking about how they will be received because T's mind feeds them negative outcomes 100% of the time pretty much.  


What is this called? Social Dysphoria? If this phenomenon has a name then I can point T in the direction of resources that could help manage it. But it's such a vague situation that I don't know what this is called? Because T does have intrusive thoughts but social foresight basically doesn't exist for T because of it.",31Dec2019,1

I get pissed over minor inconveniences and feel like I’m never going to be well again. I know I am being dramatic and that I am overreacting but this shit crushes me down. I had a phase recently when I was thinking that I was an emotionless machine that didn’t have a personal opinion and whose thoughts were shaped by other people, normal people. One day this got so hard that I left school early to come home and safely break down in tears. I live with my mother and I love her but she doesn’t seem to understand me at all. I don’t have a lot of friends. Actually, I have one friend with whom I tried sharing my thoughts once but it didn’t turn out good and I just felt bad for sharing my problems with my only friend because they seemed not worth his time and ultimately minor and silly. I also think I had some type of harm ocd because my mind flashed some disturbing images about people I love when I was near them. And the most stupid one, I’ve been feeling that I am in a Truman show as there were a lot of coincidences in my life. I try really hard to forget these thoughts but sometimes they come back. Now I just feel lost and don’t really know what to do. I am trying to accept the fact that I am a regular person but I have a hard time with that.

104,"Hello,

  
I need some help to figure out what's going on with me recently - I have just been feeling very bored and lethargic and I'm not sure why. I have tried doing stuff that I used to enjoy such as playing video games which I used to like and although it does pass the time, I don't get much enjoyment out of them.

  
I figured that perhaps I was just bored of all of the usual stuff and so tried various new things such as playing my guitar again, learning some digital art and seeing friends however I feel just as bored doing them as I do when playing games - the only difference is that these new things make my brain feel more tired because I'm actually learning new things, not just repeating things I already know how to do. Even when I'm socializing with friends it doesn't feel like I'm having fun or anything, more just passing the time before I can go back to sleep.

  
I just feel completely lethargic towards everything and the idea of trying anything new just seems overwhelmingly tiring.  
I have been on several different antidepressants for about 2 years now, none of them have worked. I am currently trying a new one (fluoxetine, have been on it for about 2 months and a bit) so perhaps it's a side effect of that?  
I also find that I'm struggling to be engrossed in anything - like a film or a story game or anything. It's like I'll get about 10 minutes in and just get so bored and disinterested.

I think the antidepressant has helped with my overall mood, but could it be possible that it's causing or at least amplifying this boredom with life I'm feeling?

Thanks in advance,

107,"Hi, I am currently in High School and been wondering if my behavior is strange or indicating an underlying mental issue. 

The thing is that I get overly attached/obsessed with my teachers. It’s not a crush or anything sexual at all, I just see them as an authority and inspiration. If I really like a teacher I get to the point where I research. I look on their Facebook, find out what relationships they have, their number, where they live etc. 

Even though I’m attached to them I don’t show it. I seem distant and cold, and don’t interact with them even though I really want. I’ve actually never spoken to them about anything personal in my life, it’s purely school related. 

When I don’t please these teachers I get mad, sad and frustrated. I often times turn to self harm and get depressed. I feel like they hate me and my school work is bad (It’s all mainly about my work, I need reassurance that what I’ve made is good otherwise I doubt myself) I am doing very well academically so it’s extra pressure. 

I always analyze what they say to me, their face expressions and body movements. Even though they seem normal to everybody else I convince myself their tone or that one look they made means my work is bad and they hate me. Sometimes I even get jealous when they are nicer to other students.

During breaks I miss them. I get annoyed and sad if I don’t get a class with them. It’s just pure agony. I’m seriously overthinking everything about their actions and my school work. 

I’ve noticed that these teachers only are males. My dad is an alcoholic. He never abused me sexually or physically but a lot emotionally. I never had a father figure, maybe that’s the culprit of the problem? I forgot to mention that I have Health Anxiety, OCD, sometimes I struggle with eating, I also get depressed and self harm. Could my attachment/obsession be a sign of a mental illness? And what should I do about it?",31Dec2019,1

My brother and sisters are more sensitive to her words than I am, and they would be upset/angry/sulk, then they will not talk to each other, sometimes for days.

126,"I used to have a huge self harm problem in high school. My go-to is burning myself because I feel like it hurt worse than cutting and it helps me repent for whatever I did to make me feel guilty or worthless. When I was in high school, it mostly tied into the feelings I had surrounding a lot of emotional and mental abuse from my childhood. I have an entire column of the burn scars from high school on my forearm that are long healed, and I lied about them for a long time. It stopped around the time I entered college. 

About two years ago, I ended up in a psych ward for suicidal ideations and anxiety. I had been misdiagnosed as bipolar, only to find out I have PTSD, general anxiety, and major depressive disorder. I had been on the wrong medication. Since then, I have had one relapse about nine months after I got out of the hospital, and then I just had a relapse almost two weeks ago. The burns are almost healed, but I did four instead of my usual one/two. I tend to decline drastically during the winter, especially since my dad died in November three years ago. 

What I’m worried about is all of my burning since high school has surrounded me trying to punish myself for the way I treated my fiancé, whether I yelled at him or left the house during an argument. We’re still figuring out our communication especially when it’s surrounding my mental health. He tends to push me to talk, which leads to me freaking out and running, which leads to him trying to block me in the house, which leads to me screaming at him. This last time, I sprinted from the house and drove for about two hours before I self harmed and decided to go home. I don’t know for sure where this behavior is stemming from, but I don’t trust any psych I’ve met so far to help me. I usually end up lying to them about what’s going on and leaving it be. I’m just worried that this behavior is going to damage my relationship with my fiancé. I honestly don’t know what I would do without him.

I started going back to school but I had to consult the school nurse who said I should see a professional but I was too scared  and I was always crying in the bathrooms. I hated life so much and just wanted to kill myself, I self harmed but all of a sudden I'm just feeling so happy. 
I made some new really nice friends, and maybe that's what's making me so happy. I stopped self harming , I'm just really happy and seeing the good things in life suddenly.

134,"Recently, maybe the past few weeks or month, I really don't know how long it's been, I have had a huge loss of appetite. I haven't felt excessively hungry like I should. It's either that or I don't notice it or I forget about it. Dispite knowing I need to eat and take care of myself, I often don't eat unless we go out, which is not often at all; or my parents cook something, which also is not very often because of a few family things that they're busy with. Rarely I'll take the initiative to eat something but it's probably just something small like a single piece of bread, milk, or some hodgepodge throw together mess of different small snacks. I just don't feel motivated to at all.


Various times in the past I have struggled with this same issue for long periods of time. My parents had to force me to eat by making me plan out meals, threatening to take away my phone until after I've eaten, ect. 


I don't think anything severe is going on with me mentally. But sometimes I am quite harsh with myself about my weight. Dispite the fact that I am within average rage of weight for my age and height (I'm fourteen and tall). I don't believe that it is enough to cause an eating disorder though. I think that the reason for this is merely because I don't feel motivated to. I don't know why I don't feel motivated to but I don't think it's consciously because of my body.

Though, sometimes, not often at all, I do actively try to not eat much because I feel like it'll make me gain weight/make my stomach look larger. But those times it's mostly just when I was about to eat carbs. I know that they make my stomach poke out more than I'd like. 


I also looked up some other symptoms of anorexia and do feel like I am more sensitive to cold and have been down/moody. And obviously the other things that I have stated in this post.

Maybe it isn't necessarily anorexia though because although the eating factor is the main thing, I don't feel motivated to do anything else either. Nothing is seemingly wrong with anything else that has been going on so I'm unsure of the real cause of this.

This is my first time telling my problems to someone in my life. I have been struggling with anxiety and other phobias issues since when I was 13. (Now 23)  
As a young teenager my parents was always worried and  care for me alot. So I didn't go out and interact with people like other kids usually do. Normally I will just stay at home and watch TV or read books as a growing teenager. My parents are very nice people is just that sometimes they are pretty strict on me and as a kid it made me quite stress. As a teenager I was a slow eater. So normally I will be the last to finish my meal. My parents will always say things like "" why do you eat so slow?"" Or something like ""faster eat !!' And slowly slowly when I know I'm having meals with them I will be quite stressed about it. All of that was okay till when I was around 13 years old. When the school just starts and I didn't know a single person. Eating with people that idk or new friends  makes me feel like stress and uncomfortable. And I normally before the meal with my school friends or family I will be extremely nervous and nauseous, Gagging alot before I eat. But I always just try to hide it as a cough if they were to ask what happened . 
And after finished eating my friends I will finally feel relieved that everything is over and I will slowly feel better. That time I was still young and didn't think too much I thought it was just me overthink and being nervous too much. Everything should be alright when I'm older. That's was my mindset.
But no, it happens from that point onwards almost everyday till when I was 16 to  When my mindset and was more positive and I was used to my friends and environment. But when I go to college at around 17years old. Things got alot worst. New school new friends and new environment. The anti social me that usually stays at home reading books and playing games was super nervous during school orientation. But to me that was still okay because it's the first time I think to myself. 
But eating with new friends after 3 years in college still didn't make any improvement. I was always afraid of eating with my friends especially in crowded areas. I will be feeling awful before meals being extremely nervous and feeling very nauseous. That problem resulted me eating 50-70% of meal portion making me quite a skinny and scrawny kid. My normal routine in my college days was to attend lectures and go home. Unless there is any projects or late night presentations. If not , my life in college was pretty plain and boring because I was afraid of social interaction due to my weird issues. 
After college I went find part time jobs while waiting for the enlistment to serve the army. 
I found a admin part time job typical 9-5 job so that I make sure I'm not wasting my time at home doing nothing. Before heading to interviews or work as always I will be feeling nervous and nauseous that it just become a norm for me. I just try it anyways. From there my supervisor introduce to to my colleagues which are the same age as me. Long story short I met a girl there and I fall in love with her and we had a relationship. I did told her I have this weird issues and she just listens and knows but never really ask or care about my problems. Our relationship ended 1 year later due to different mindset. We both agree to end the relationship and wish the best for our future endeavours.

Fast forward to 1 plus yearsater when I had to enlist to the army. The day before enlistment I still can remember I was so so so nervous till I was gagging and vomitting in the toilet . But after I was really inside there, all the work and  things I need to do let me forget my problems. I was too hungry and tired to even feel nervous about eating with my army mates. And surprisingly for the first time in my life I feel like myself. Everything went quite smoothly. I even begin bodybuilding a year into enlistment and starting gaining around  20kilos. Going From 45kg to 68kg. I was having more confidence and feeling alot better about myself. I also did tell my parents about this problem that I had and they were understanding and cared for me. Beside bodybuilding I even went to volunteer at a mental health  center where elderly people suffer from mental issues stayed there for treatment or long term. I made many friends and become alot more social. 
Everything was going well till around another 4months later when I started to feeling anxious and overthink during meal times with my friends again. Basically a relapse?? The problems and issues started to come back and eating and gyming started to become harder and harder everyday. 1month before I finished serving the army I started to realized the problem had become alot worser than before and I started planning for my future in case I wanna work and home to earn a living. 
So I after I finished serving the army when I was 22 I started to make my own online business plan. I focus on that and stopped gyming because the gym fees was stacking up and my nauseous was affecting my mood and performance in the gym so I quit gyming and focus on my career of online business first. Because my parents themselves are not earning much so I wanted to work right away after my army and earn money for them and myself. 

After around 1 to 2months I did make some money here and there but In the end the business failed. I invested around 2k in my business and I thought to myself it's okay I just try do something else on the web. I just stayed at home everyday looking at laptops and my condition got alot worst. 

Right now 6months have past since I finished serving the army and I'm unemployed because my condition went from nauseous before eating to nauseous after eating and makes me always feel like vomitting. I went online to research and find out more. And I think I have this condition called  emetophobia (fear of vomiting) . Because of this issues I avoid going out. Which made my social anxiety even even worst. Like talking to random people , sitting at bus or standing at trains make me feel extremely nervous and uncomfortable. And if I full, going out is almost impossible because I will fear that I will puke on public places and embrassed myself. Recently I also realized I have fear stairs too. Because while climbing the stairs I will be constantly filled with thous like : "" what if I fell down and embrassed myself"" so walking down and up the stairs now is extremely hard. For now I usually avoid stairs and just Cross the road straight with any traffic lights. 

I didn't feel suicidal or depressed. Because I have dreams in life. I know exactly what I wanna do and what I wanna be. It's just that these issues are preventing from even living like a normal person. And I had enough of it. I just wanna solve these issues but don't have enough money for therapy sessions which are extremely costly in my country. And I'm unemployed because I know if I would to find a job I wouldn't be able to cope it.
Please please give me some suggestions. 
I really really appreciate it.

136,"Hi. I'm a 28 yr old female. I've struggled with some anxiety and depression in the past. Nothing serious and nothing I couldn't handle. Recently, my husband got a job offer and we will be moving 2.5 hrs away next month. We have been wanting and manifesting this for awhile. I have no real family where we are other than my grandmother who will move with us. My husband has toxic family here that we have been dying to move away from. Starting Monday 12/23 I got nauseous and vomited at dinner and figured it was a stomach bug. I stayed sick through Christmas. No more vomiting just nausea and diarrhea. I was having anxiety with it but nothing out of the normal. Friday 12/27 I began having extreme anxiety. Intrusive thoughts. I had a panic attack but it was stranger than any other panic attack I've experienced. My mind did a good job recognizing and staying calm but my body was betraying me and panicking severely. I had a .25mg xanax so I took it to calm my body. It helped and put me to sleep. Every day since then my body is experiencing anxiety symptoms: nausea, digestive issues, insomnia/constant waking, weakness &amp; fatigue, appetite loss, rapid breathing/heart rate, sweating, trembling and muscle spasms. I'm normally a very aware person and can take control of my anxiety by taking all the necessary steps and none of it is working this past week. I truly believe it's due to my body fighting the change of the move but I dont know what to do fix it. I've spoken all of my fears and anxieties and talked them through. I haven't had any caffeine. I try to exercise and get up and move and clean. Nothing is working. Smoking marijuana has ALWAYS helped if nothing else has and this past week it has not been helping but making things worse. As a mother of two and someone who has move coming up, I don't have the luxury teen me did to lay around and try to slowly heal. I cant stay like this much longer but I don't know where to start. Do I go see a therapist? Do I need to get a a prescription to an SSI? I never enjoyed them when I was younger and they made me a zombie. Do I need an anti anxiety? The xanax helps but makes me sleepy. Or is this all something that will heal itself after/during the move? I've never been one for medication. I currently don't take anything other then zofran and xanax this past week. I just dont know what my next step should be. Thank you for reading ❤",31Dec2019,1

I guess I feel kind of weird now seeing my life for what it is and how bad it's gotten. I'm so isolated I have no friends, I barely have any social skills and not a lot to talk about that I feel comfortable sharing with strangers in real life because I've just been staying in bed.

I don't really have anybody to talk to about this, so I just joined to vent. I've been suffering from some form of depression or another off and on ever since I can remember, but the last 3-4 years have been pretty good to me, I guess mainly because I was investing all my energy and attention into a hobby: creating music. About 4 years ago, I bought an instrument (a keyboard) and decided to teach myself to play using online resources. As time went on, I started a band and got the idea that it would be great to publish a whole album of original music online. Well, that's a really time- and energy-consuming project. Thinking about the various aspects of making an album - from actually composing the music to matters related to promotion - has been on my mind prety much during every waking moment these last few years. Well, my interest has waned a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and this - couple of with the fact that things really slow down at my workplace towards the end of the year - has caused me to feel anxious. I try to keep myself together by staying active, jogging, etc. but I guess I've gained some insight into what makes me tick and I have understood that these massive undertakings such as learning to play an instrument, etc. has been a way of avoiding reality, loneliness, etc. It works quite well as long as I'm fully invested in such a hobby, but when I lose interest (even just a bit), I kind of fall apart, I wonder if anyone else has noticed this pattern in their behavior?

143," I'll give it here and now. 
Today was one of the roughest days of my life, but I'll tell you that later. Here's what you need to know as of now.

  My name is Vincent, I live in a small rural town in Ohio thats full of drug addicts and substance abusers and abusers in general. I have been sexually, verbally, and physically abused and manipulated since I was 4, and I recently got the guts to speak about it, as the person who had r**ed me and many others close to me are now in jail.

 One of my friends has forced me to take drugs, smoke, have s*x with them and others, they have made me do things I've never, ever, wanted to do. My body is scarred beyond what medicine can do. Every deep wound is puffed up.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, and I have been suffering from schizophrenia, DDNOS (dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, its like an umbrella.) bipolar, and major depression. I know it sounds like im an attention seeker, and I know it sounds like this is all made up, but it's not. 

this town has made me so insecure, i cant go anywhere without being paranoid and hearing 6000 people in my ear whispering about how I'm not and will never be good enough. I hate how i lash out at everyone. I hate how i dissociate. I hate everything about me and what its caused me to become and to think ill never have a normal life.

I have multiple personalities that I have used to cope with and talk to since I was a little boy. I know this isn't normal, but they're the only ones that understand.

i dont know what to do and i scare away anyone i ever talk to. I cant talk to anyone anymore in fear of me hurting them. 

please, please does anyone have any tips. At all?

I already discussed this with them, three times actually, but the problem persists.  
Today (fuck, its new year's...) it happened again and I started having suicidal thoughts. Nobody ever thinks about me. I'm always the second choice to everybody, they gather and don't mind if they didn't even inform me.

I'm okay with being alone, I've been lonely for years because I was (still am) a weirdo in my younger years.

147,"Hello. I am in the 9th grade studying in South Korea. Apologies in advance for my crap english, not my first language. I hope you don't immediately associate me with the stereotypical teenagers haha. Coming from a shit school, I had recently transferred into this prestigious school. Sons and daughters of known businessmen and rich people. My mother busted her ass to get me here, because I dreamt of being put in an environment where people are sophisticated and actually know how to act. My childhood was definitely not ideal to grow up in. Abuse, infidelity, and vices are just a few that were/are very apparent in my life. 

Anyway, I got in! After 2 years of dreaming and working hard to get in, I got accepted on my first try. I thought to myself, hey! I can finally start fresh, a new beginning. But 5 months in (currently on Christmas break), I feel drained. I don't think I have and will ever adjust to this; this lifestyle the people here lead. People who are wealthy from generations ago and those who have recently acquired their wealth are very different. The people here are lowkey but nonetheless lavish. Think Ctazy Rich Asians. I know it's a given but it still shocks me. And deep down, makes me feel insecure (my mom is single handedly supporting us 3 children with my 2 siblings in college, and her ex husband, my deadbeat dad without a job). Their families are great and they are well off. I met this fellow new student, and she is very down to earth. However, there are times when she makes me feel like she doesn't care. She also makes personal jabs at me and does not stop until I make it clear that I am NOT entertained, even then, she goes on. Now the students here are generally nice, say a few people. There is this one guy always messing up my hair. Funny at first but gets real old. Even though they are nice, they are very exclusive, and two faced (or so I've been told). It's like straight out of an American movie. Like ""you can't sit with us"" type of scenario. The beginning of the year, if you eat with this group of people, you are bound to them for the entirety of your stay at that school - that type of thing. I have made friends and am comfortable, but this ""exclusive"" thing is, what's the word.. limiting? I just feel so tired and unhappy with everything.

And for the academic part? It was supposed to be expensive as hell, but how come my old high school, costing less than half my current tuition, is more advanced? Technologically and academically. Not to mention, AIR CONDITIONED. Their academic system is so weird and I'm having trouble adjusting. My grades are shit compares to my honor roll grades in my old school. I was too ambitious. Everyday I go to school, I'm just hit with ""You are not good enough. You will never be as great as the people around you"". I know I shouldn't be feeling like this. All these feelings of insecurity and FOMO (which is even more strong now that I am a teen), but it's easier said than done. I just don't know anymore. If I tell my mother I want to transfer out, it makes me feel so ungrateful. Our break is coming to a close and in a few days, classes are back. But I don't want to go. The vibe the school gives off is bleak and depressing. The novelty of being the new student wore off and everything had gone to shit.",31Dec2019,1

149,"I'm writing this right after a bad outburst of mine, because I'm starting to realize the negative impact of how I'm acting is having on my family and friends.

As a child, my family could only describe me as a joyful, outgoing, extroverted kid. I was always on the bright side, and made everybody's day. As I grew older (namely middle school) I began to slowly isolate myself from others, and I stopped being social. I developed an anxiety in social situations, started obsessing over my health (hypochondria), among other things. At this point, I have developed so many perceived issues that I am dysfunctional as an adult. I had unexpected outbursts to seemingly small situations (ex. I'll be perfectly fine, and say I accidentally stub my toe or hit my head. It hurts like a motherfucker, and I feel like any normal person might curse under their breath or something. I, however, have done what I consider to be irrational things afterwards, like shoving my entire bed to the other side of the room, throwing small objects in random directions, screaming curse words, etc.) I find myself incredibly agitated in situations where my mother, friends, or other family members fail to understand my point of view in situations regarding my mental or physical health.

In summary, what I'm trying to say is that I believe I have all these problems, like Anger Issues, Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Bi-Polar Disorder, Depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, Hypochondria, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, etc. My mother contests me on all of these things, claiming everything is in my head. This is what I argue with her about nearly daily, with her claims that I've been known to ""sway the opinions of other easily"" as if my description of Anxiety and my fear of living are attempts to get attention rather than bring to light actual problems I think I may have.

I do not know whether I have any of these problems. I have had no medical diagnosis, but my School Psychologist and Doctor have suggested the presence of Anxiety as a general statement. While in the custody of my father (parents are divorced) both my father and stepmother abused me, perceptive to me, for the entire 7 year period I lived there. My father is famous for being condescending, and having a short temper, as my Mother and Grandparents like to put it. He had this ""good cop bad cop"" attitude when it came to punishing me, where he would act as if nothing was wrong and then suddenly explode, which caused a lot of fear. Sometimes he would beat me, not severely, but enough to leave marks or to cause me to lay in a fetal position for several minutes to hours as a result. My stepmother would intentionally provoke me just before a family event so that when I had an outburst, they had reason to exclude me from whatever they were doing. (i.e. going to the neighborhood pool, going to the waterpark, watching a movie, playing a boardgame) and my punishment was usually being required to sit and stare at a wall for the entire day. I probably spent about 4 total years of my life just staring at a wall. I was also sexually assaulted once by my neighbor, who was about 6 years older than me. I was sexually assaulted by my best friend while in the first year of middle school, who also spread rumors about me with a large group of people, bullying me in addition, which made me very very uncomfortable with being myself in public, or talking to anybody for that matter. 

I went to therapy for about 3 years, between the ages of 10-13. At this point, none of my severe anxiety problems had really set in. I was still relatively social, and even though whatever abuse I had was finished, I never really woke up to it or realized the negative impact it would have as I got older, until I actually got older. I started having really really bad angry outbursts when I was 14, and then I became social anxious, and then I just started being paranoid and freaking out about everything. In 10th grade (16 at the time) I attempted suicide twice because I was both fed up with life, and absolutely overwhelmed with the several negative emotions I was having at the time (which continue to this day). 

My mother strictly believes everything is ""all in my head"" and that the only real reason she can think of my lack of confidence is that I was sexually assaulted by my best friend a few years ago (it's the only situation she has had a first hand witness of my fear and the whole police report I guess brought to light it's seriousness). Every time I talk about needing therapy, or discuss my perceived mental problems, it turns into a big argument that leaves all parties involved pissed off. 

About two weeks ago, I went to the doctor for my yearly physical. I described all my perceived problems to him, and he provided me with a questionnaire and a guarantee that I will be able to get help. This is a step forward, because the entire school system has failed to provide me the resources they said they would (tri county counselor isn't doing much to actually assess my mental health and is rather on my ass about finishing FAFSA and other required documents to graduate) and the school psychologist has such a large frontline of students at multiple schools that she cannot consistently focus on my wellbeing. I'm supposed to go to the doctor this Friday, as a follow-up, but I'm not sure where it's going to go, given my mother's lack of following up on her part. (I have no car or any setup to be actually independent, so it is my mother who manages appointments and the like, and who has been for years. I am objectively dysfunctional at this point, and trying to figure this stuff out stresses me out beyond belief.) 

Sorry for the ramble. I'm just trying to provide some backstory to my issues, line up what I think is wrong with me, and leave the question up to you all: Is there something evidently wrong with me, just based on what I've provided you with? Or am I just freaking out for no reason, and do I need to just go for a run and forget all this?",31Dec2019,1
150,"Hello! 👋 

I’m looking to hear about other people’s experiences getting prescribed medications that have been helpful to them. 

For me, I started out having panic attacks and memory-related issues. I was then given risperdal and sertraline and I became more depressed and started to have auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations. 

I stopped taking those. Visual and tactile went away completely. Auditory persisted and went away sometimes. 

When I stopped eating and got down to 140lbs, I was given Ativan. It helped me feel calmer and less paranoid. I was hearing voices. They stopped giving me Ativan. 

Then I was given halidol. It caused chest pain and my hand wouldn’t open. These feelings and symptoms went away after I was taken off it. 

I was given since then risperidone, olanzipine, and clonazepam. (Together) 

They caused excessive weight gain (almost 100lbs), and I became manic and had delusions of grandeur.  

Eventually, I had a heroin overdose due to meeting a drug dealer at a psych hospital. It felt really good. Not healthy, but it felt good. I almost died. 

————

I was diagnosed with three different diagnoses: schizotypal personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and “unspecified psychosis” with the latter being the most recent. I have no idea if any of these are correct.
———

I am currently taking nothing but cannabis. And I have no hallucinations, delusions, suicidal thoughts, or anything similar. I’m still fat, and I still get tense/anxious, no panic attacks. Just not where I want to be. 

I was recently offered Geodon after asking for Ativan. I declined because I fail to see how another antipsychotic is supposed to help me. All they seem to do is make me have mental issues. I really wonder if the doctors understand that. After all, they started after taking risperdal.",31Dec2019,1

It's exactly new year as I write it, and I'm alone at home, (not happy or joyful at all) the only one awake to face his feelings and emotions. Don't get me wrong I like being alone, I'm an introvert, but I feel like I don't experience happiness anymore, I can't recall my last real time I felt truly happy. I never do any new years resolutions usually, but I want for this year to sometimes feel true happiness.

I think the word I'm looking for to describe my feeling is apathy toward anything, like nothing really matter, like it's all just a game/movie someone else is watching.

The more depressing thing is that the last thing that made me happy was a dream and I rarely get those, half a dozen a year maybe.

154,"Hey everyone, hope everyone's doing well, atleast better than I am right now.

To make a long story short, I'm out of options. I'm only 20 years old and I feel nothing short of a major disappointment and am seriously considering suicide. I've attempted in the past, and regained mental stability, but now it's again too much to handle for a multitude of issues.

I cannot afford to see a doctor, or therapist, and being such a large town, all of the free ones are being used up at a rate where I would have to be on a waiting list for weeks before even getting to say hi to someone. 

I, with a passion, HATE inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. I've been inpatient atleast 4-5 times, all of which were like prison to me. They just pump me full of useless meds I've tried before, and send me on my way with a 6k$ bill. Not to mention the ER doctors and nurses you have to be screened by do nothing but judge you for wasting their time when they could be helping someone from a car accident or something. 

Either way I'm at the brink of extinction, and there's a small chunk of my brain still holding on that wants me to get help, and to live, but unless I see a mental health professional soon, I fear for the worst.

156,"I [16M] have a friend [15F] who has schizophrenia. I’m the only person besides her therapist she really opens up to. We were planning to hang out for New Years but she canceled last minute and said she’s rather be alone. I knew this wasn’t a good sign but I prodded her asking her what she was gonna do.

Lately, she’s had the idea in her head that she’s infesting another persons body. She has wanted me to stop calling her by her first name, which she thinks is the name of the body, and has asked my to start calling her by her middle name. I’ve been doing this.

Today when I was prodding her over text she told me she has a plan to make her body hers again. I was very worried and asked multiple questions about this. She said she isn’t going to kill her self, or her body, and that she’ll explain it more to me when we get back to school on Monday. I took this as a good sign. I asked her if she was gonna hurt herself and she said she’d be fine. I asked her if from my point of view she’d be doing anything bad. She said no. 

This was all about five minutes ago over text. Is there anything else I should do? Should I prod more? What should I do?",31Dec2019,1
157,"We always hear that we can learn from our past. While this is true, one should be weary of becoming infatuated with “what could have been”. Our thoughts can sometimes drive themselves, taking you on a journey back in time, through your mindful memories.

Sometimes the smallest things can trigger a memory- big or small, sad or happy. Memories bring forth not just events, but the emotion tied to the events as well. With emotion comes an inner strength that can be a force all on its own.

Tonight alone, I was brought back to a time where even when everything seemed to be falling apart, there was still some good present in my life (before that too was torn apart in time). But, while my mind and thoughts flooded with good, happy memories, I began to eventually come to the events that brought an end to that chapter of my life.

When things go wrong, a common reaction is to try to fix things…

This is where I eventually caught myself present in a state of “What If” thinking… a toxic mindset that can cause one to become stuck in the past, on things that have never been and would never come. While it is nice to dream, one must aim to dream of the future and what they have to come; be cautious when finding yourself caught dwelling on how the past could have turned out differently.

A favorite quote of mine is, “Hindsight is 20/20”.

Once the past is written, it is solidly there in the past… unchanging and stationary. Experiences build learning opportunities which should be cherished and acknowledged, never ignored. You may not be able to change what has happened, but you can plan for the future, and take measures and actions to drive yourself closer to the dreams you imagine… aiming to build a reality you desire.

A new life may not happen overnight; but, with desire and perseverance you can accomplish anything you set your mind too.

All you need is one thing…

158,"This year has been pretty shit and it has ended with me feeling much more suicidal than I usually do.

Most new years I have felt like harming myself mainly but the last few months this year, I have thought about it all a lot more. I know this is bad but I'm looking for the ""last line"" to tip me over to actually go through with it. I've never ended a year and started a new year with the thought that I will actually do something worse than I have done to myself. I have thought about several ways of how I would but they all still end up with me surviving and disappointing everyone. So, I'm left to feel stuck, empty, numb.

Thinking about it makes me crazy anxious but I still want to do it.",31Dec2019,1
159,"The thought of suicide terrifies me and I dont think I could ever bring myself to do it. I dont wanna die. But being here just fucking sucks. Doing the same shit everyday, feeling stuck. Hating the way i look and sound. Being paranoid and anxious over the dumbest shit. I feel like I'm holding myself back from being happy but I dont know how be kind to myself. I dont have it bad, I know the people in my life love me. But it doesnt help that I grew up in an environment where we all clown on each other and are supposed to take it lightly, or as ""we're family you know we love you"". My sister pokes hella fun at my insecurities about my face and sometimes so does my fiance. I've let them know it hurts me but they just keep doing it like they forgot I ever said anything.

163,"I don’t mean the usual up and down I deal with sometimes. Out of the blue, I feel as unstable as when I was off of medication. I’ve been taking care of myself all as usual, medicine on time, I’ve been improving my diet this past year (and have lost some weight), I go for walks for exercise and sunshine, I stick to daily routines to keep myself on track. I was diagnosed in 2009, and had the absolute worst time trying to find the best medicine combination. I’d finally found one with my psychiatrist, and had been doing better and even more this past year but not tipping over to manic or mania. I’ve been suffering this drowning and suffocating feeling of mental instability the past couple of days and no known triggers happened. I’ve been trying to “ground” myself with DBT and CBT methods I’d learned years ago that usually help me. No big life events or changes, nothing traumatic, nothing out of the ordinary. Just a switch that got flipped somehow and I can’t stand this feeling. I hate the trembling, the restlessness, tossing and turning, avoiding eye contact, the sensation in my head that actually feels like my brain misfiring, I hate feeling I’m less in control over my body motions, my instant irritability, then immediate crying. Could even be over nothing. My life was finally turning around after a decade of struggle and torment. And now I feel like I was teleported back to square one. I feel bitter as it’s unfair. I’ve done everything. Been taking good care of myself. Being mindful of triggers and situations. Grounding myself when I felt unease. With something so intricately agonizing that people can’t see with their eyes like a broken leg, I don’t know who to turn to. I can’t tell my psychiatrist because I refuse to go back to a mental hospital like I did in the first years. I can’t tell my family because we’ve grown a little distant carrying our own lives across the country. My husband has reacted, poorly, but I suppose it’s good he can tolerate me in this state. I have no friends except online, and I can’t entrust this burden of trying to help me to them because I don’t want to lose the few friends I do have. I’ve read that a relapse doesn’t need a reason to happen (I imagine it’s the same as a panic attack in that sense). Feeling so alone in this, I don’t know if I have the mental strength to go through it again. I had to face so much of it alone before. And complaining to strangers on the Internet? Yeah. I’ve reached a new low.",31Dec2019,1

166,"Hey y’all.
My mother’s side of the family has always been abusive and toxic to me. Everything short of physical abuse has transpired in our “family” for as long as I can remember.

When I got married this year in April, I decided to try and forgive the past and look to the future to try and have a good relationship with them, assuming that, since I’m an adult now, they wouldn’t have so much hold over my life and I could control the stress.

Well, the month after my wedding, my beautiful mother passed away. She took her own life.
What should have been a time of mourning for all of us together ended up being a shit show full of their worst behavior since I was a child. Screaming matches, guilt trips, gaslighting, infighting, petty arguments and general childish behavior over literally everything we had to do.
My sister and I had to shoulder the brunt of the responsibility over planning in order to actually get anything done in a timely manner and in a way that would honor mom.

By all means I should be healing and working through my grief. But now that mom is gone, my sister and I suddenly have the brunt of their attention. They just can’t leave us alone. They’re so convinced that we can’t take care of ourselves, that we’re going to fall off the deep end too, or that we’re going to find out that our husbands are abusive (even though THEY’RE the ones that have been abusive and manipulative toward us all this time, AND we have fought SO HARD to leave that all behind us and break the cycle).

It’s been especially bad around the holidays this year. Every time we say no to going to a family event, or don’t answer the phone in time, etc.
They freak, and start accusing our husbands of cutting us off from the family, talking behind our backs in group chats about how it’s soo weird that we wouldn’t answer our phone or wouldn’t want to go to a family event or, god forbid, just not want to associate with them anymore.

Mind you, before Mom’s death, our lives didn’t matter to them. They don’t even know me as a person anymore. They’ve never really known me. At least not since I was a kid.

I’m going to cut them out. I’m sick of being anxious all the time, I’m tired of the nightmares and the lack of sleep and having it all haunt me throughout the day at work and at home. I feel restless, and paranoid anytime I get a text or a call or even just hear their name. It’s like I’m expecting to be attacked at any minute.

I’m looking for advice. If you’ve ever cut off ties with your family, how did you do it? How did it go? I’m really anxious about this process, because I know they’re going to fight me dirty, every way they know how.",31Dec2019,1
