With no friends or family left to love. I'm too much of a coward to tell anybody about this, and that's why I decided to come to the internet, great idea, shaz, but if anybody at all is willing to help me, please, I don't feel like myself anymore.",15Dec2019,1

3,"So I (19 M) definitely have a fear of abandonment and I know why, I just don't know what to do about it. It affects my relationships with people I date/speak to and it's horrible to deal with myself as well. 

I recently got broken up with completely out of the blue after dating for 2 years. I was already terrified of being left and the fact I was broken up with so suddenly and unexpectedly made me freak out. I wanted to kill myself because I felt so hopeless, I'd lash out in anger at him at completely random and often inappropriate times or have anxious breakdowns to him. 

I have a history of anxiety issues and I'm very sceptical of the people I love. I think that my partners want to leave me, that I'm unlovable and my mood turns very quickly if they even say something in a tone I don't like. I over analyse everything and keep myself up at night over the tiniest thing. I latch onto new people very quickly because I want someone stable to love me and not abandon me like my mum did when I was a kid. I over idealise new relationships and have certain expectations that I will lose my temper over if they aren't met. 

Basically I know that my thinking patterns aren't healthy and that my behaviour at times can be toxic. I don't like how this anxiety makes me feel and I'd like to think I'm very self aware about it, but I have no idea what to do to make this go away. I'm hesitant to go to a doctor because this isn't a 24/7 problem and I worry that it's not serious enough to waste doctors' time. Any suggestions?",15Dec2019,1

5,"I'm lost

A few years ago I was diagnosed with depression and it got better after I took antidepressants (after, not while) and it really seemed like life was easier

today it feels like depression is creeping up on me again and I feel like I'm being swallowed by this

I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm drowning. college is really fucking me up and the traumas are coming back because it's that time of the year and I'm lost and I have too many things to take care of and I've been having more suicidal thoughts than ever. I barely get excited for things anymore, because I either don't think I'll achieve them or because I feel like I don't deserve them anymore

I don't want to see a doctor so they can prescribe antidepressants because I'm afraid of the effect they'll have on me (being unfocused, tired all the time, and making me feel like shit in general) and I can't afford to have these effects on me right now but I guess it doesn't matter if I just die

I'm also afraid to actually go to a doctor because it feels like as long as I don't get medical confirmation, it's not really there (and I'm afraid of the truth, and reactions)

I feel like I'm failing everyone and useless

I'm so tired to pretend like everything is okay but behind closed doors the first thing I do is cry for hours

I don't know if I should try and get over this, but truth is I don't even want to fight, I just want to give up, I'm so tired",15Dec2019,1
6,"Brief story: about 10 years ago I tried to tell a doctor I was feeling overwhelmed and depressed and I was told I was making mountains out of molehills and to work on relaxing. 2 hours later I had to be talked down off a roof. I learned to just cope, sometimes barely, but I kept going. 

When I had post-partum depression it was mostly ignored. When I had pre-partum depression I was brushed aside again. Another bout of post-partum was sort of followed up on (fortnightly meetings where I was asked how suicidal I felt). 

Now my mental health is worse than ever, I'm hardly sleeping, there's a lot of stress with my kids, husband, work and the fact we've been trying to move house since March. I know I need help but I'm terrified of asking just to be brushed aside and ignored again.

I ruminate on all the shit I’ve done, the bonds of trust that I have broken.

The pressure of pretending, the trauma of all of the lectures and berating I’ve received as a result of “falling off the path of the truth,” it’s exhausting. After dinner at around 6, I always get lethargic and exhausted, and I begin to feel depressed again. I have no connections (my parents never let me form any meaningful bonds), I have no idea how to make connections, and I simply wish all of the pressure and pain would go away. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything and probably never will be, it would all simply be too much of a hassle for something that would ruin my college career.",15Dec2019,1

I know it’s wrong but I don’t understand how. I can be absolutely terrible but love myself for it. I don’t understand. I need to be disliking those things so I can change. But I don’t know how.

10,"I’m sorry if it not the right place to ask and sorry for such a long title.

My question, as stated in the title, is the following:

How come every single thing that happens to me feels a lot better in my mind as I reminisce and not when I actually experience it? Is my mind just playing tricks on me?

For every event, every experience, be it a lunch with friends (or just a meal by myself), a trip to the movie theater, a walk in the park, a gym workout, etc. For all kinds of activities that I enjoy, there is this feeling, when I look back, that I should have been so much happier than I was! I had such a great time, didn’t I? I should have been just smiling and laughing all the time, why was I not doing that? It kind of feels like a wasted potential, like I’m not living to the fullest. And then next day, I will be looking back again and thinking the same thing about the previous day! And so on and so forth.

I guess my main question is whether it’s a normal reaction/behaviour?
Has anyone experienced something like this? And what did you do to mitigate/fix it?

Hey,

I have a friend who I've been friends with for about a year now. He's very quiet and doesn't engage in much of a conversation. I'm in my second year at university and we are neighbors in our block of flats on campus. I know a lot about social anxiety and I don't think he has social anxiety because he does not avoid things and doesn't get hot/sweaty etc, and he can become argumentive...

When he does engage, it usually comes across as rude and even critical. In fact, the more I've thought about it, the more it comes apparent to me that when we talk he is only criticizing me or even being rude or being hostile.

For example, whenever I made a mistake, he will comment on it. I'm a very positive person and even when I've complimented him, he's looked at the issues.

For example, in a presentation we did as a team recently, he barely added anything to the powerpoint slides in the prep. He only looked over my shoulder and whenever I made a typo, he would quickly comment on it. It doesn't feel much of a friendship, but more of a nasty shadow over me at the moment. I added a ton of details to the powerpoint and made it look nice with GIFs. Unfortunately, there was a slight error during the presentation with the GIFs seemingly lagging the presentation - my friend smartly thought of a solution that fixed it during the presentation. I complimented him for this, for his quick thinking. I thought it is good to compliment someone who is quiet and thought of a good solution.

But after afterward me complimenting him, he would go start to on about my GIFs and ""no thanks to you...all those GIFs..."" (this was not done or said in a jokey way or manner, it felt very rude and hostile.. I'm very confused; when you compliment someone for doing someone thing.

Earlier today, I was upset over something and spoke to him, and he sided with a complete stranger by saying ""yeah, you should be sorry and then XYZ..""

I'm trying to work out the person in front of me.

Is it possible he has a specific type of social personality? I would struggle to ask him such a question because a) I don't want to come across as rude b) I do not know pretty much anything about him on a personal level since he keeps to himself a lot...

Thank you for your support in advance

Kind regards,

Dom",15Dec2019,1
13,"I took 5 grams, ate all my vaped weed, smoked two bowls and sat in silent darkness for about an hour. I talked to the mushrooms and set an intention to be a better man and asked them to help me figure a way out of wage slavery. I sat in a dark room blindfolded with earplugs. I don't remember much of what I experienced but some of the things I can recall were scary faces learing at me, strange noises, a feeling of a malovent presence, and a seperate feeling of an alien presence. At the same time though I felt like I was safe.

After that I went to the next room and laid down with my girlfreind and watched tv. She is the love of my life and we had a great relationship. I recall that some people on the tv looked like aliens and others were artificial like robots. At some point I blacked out but continued to talk to her. I admitted that I have been going to massage parlors and recieving handjobs and that I have urges to have sex with other women. She forgave me and  we moved on. 

Since that day I have been microdosing and I feel like a normal person for the first time in my life. I am no longer suicidal. I am optimistic, more social, and more sympathetic to others. I am working on starting my own buissness that will inrich myself and others. I am repairing burnt bridges. I now have goals and dreams.

I have been a deadbeat dad. I have been ducking my child support. I have a son I haven't seen or spoke to in well over a year. A few nights ago I reached out to his mother and asked her for forgiveness. It was so hard but we ended up talking and laughing for three hours and she forgave me. When I have my life together I will reconnect with my son.

Today I went to a massage parlor and was offered oral sex. I didn't turn it down because I wanted it. Then I asked for sex and  I got it. I am beyond ashamed. I am ashamed that this will break my girlfreinds heart and destroy our relationship. And I am ashamed for participating in human trafficking. Afterwards I thought maybe I could do some good and asked her if she was a victim of this and if she needed help. She laughed and assured me she wasn't but I have my doubts. I recognize that I am a sex addict and will be seeking professional help. 

I want to be open and honest. I want to be true to myself and others about what I am. I want to get better.

Psilocybin for me added something that I have been missing my entire life and I feel whole. It's like coming out of a fog into the sunshine. I believe it is natural medicine and not a drug. If you decide to go down this path I encourage you to do some research on your own and make sure you have a trip sitter.

This is my testimonial and I hope it does some good.

Tonight I will show this post to my girlfreind.",15Dec2019,1

It’s so frustrating not having a support system, with the exception of my best friend, who completely understands that my anxiety and feelings of sadness at times are out of my control.

20,"I might be posting this in the wrong place, but I'm not sure where else to put it (I'm not a frequent user).

Short question: What sort of mental disorder might manifest itself in short (3 days at the most) but intense depressive feelings/symptoms that have no obvious cause and I'm left feeling 'normal' after they're gone? Said depressive episodes are virtually impossible to stop, but certain people can somehow alleviate all or most of the symptoms, leaving me feeling fine. They don't know they have this ability and I don't know why they have it.

More information:

This will take a bit to explain (sorry).

In the past few months I've been experiencing short periods of fairly intense depressive symptoms, but since they never last more than a few days at the most before going away, I'm not sure it would be classified as actual depression. Everything is hopeless and I don't want to eat and I'd be better off dead for around three days at the most and then I'm back to 'normal' and everything is fine! During those days, I've noticed my trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling, it sucks) gets worse. I was diagnosed with anxiety-based trichotillomania around four years ago but I never showed any signs of actually having anxiety so it was changed to a habit-based diagnosis. Nothing has been consistently successful in alleviating the hair-pulling, but that's a whole different issue and I'm not here for that.

When I'm experiencing the depressive episodes (might not be the correct name but I call them that), one of the earliest symptoms is increased noise sensitivity, which is not great to deal with at a school. I work with the school band and their noise doesn't bother me (still haven't figured that one out), but anyone talking even slightly louder than normal can easily startle me and I'll flinch away. It will also start to feel like there's some sort of weight on my chest or that I want to breathe out far enough that my chest will cave in. I can feel myself shutting down and wanting to retreat from everything. Due to my being relatively important to the functioning of the band, I can't go hide in a quiet place, but I don't mind because I know that if I did run, it would just make it worse. Isolation makes my episodes worse but I can't help isolating myself from my friends and doubting if they really care about me because they believe me when I tell them I'm fine. 

I'm a good liar.

All the adults in my life have no idea this is happening and I hide my issues under a bazillion layers of sarcasm and jokes so my friends don't realize how much it's actually affecting me. I have no doubt that if I went to a therapist, I would either downplay my symptoms or lie to their face with no remorse.

Certain friends of mine ('anchors') have the mysterious ability to alleviate or completely banish my symptoms. They don't know they can do it. I don't know how they can do it. One of the individuals is a percussionist and practices quite loudly on a pad, which by all logic would aggravate my hearing sensitivity, yet I seek him out even when he's practicing. Just talking to him, and not even about what I'm going through at the time, will take the invisible weight off of my lungs. I don't understand how that works; shouldn't depression stay depression? How could someone manage to banish it? Sure, it's not a life-long solution, and the 'anchors' will change over time, but how does it even work as a temporary solution?

I've done some research but haven't been able to find anything that could explain my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? I'm willing to provide more information upon request.

Once again, sorry for the long post, and if this violates any rules, notify me and I'll take it down.",15Dec2019,1
21,"My older brother has anger issues, and takes his anger out on me a lot. He says he loves, and cares about me, and in a way, I know he does deep down, but at the same time he will tell me I'm a selfish person, and that I lie all the time. I can't even talk sometimes because I'm afraid I'll get yelled at by him. If I answer in a tone he doesn't like, he screams at me, and tells me to stop talking, so I change my tone, and will say something like, "" Yes, I understand. I'm sorry."".

 It's not good enough, it's never good enough. I'm not good enough! I'll never be good enough. He always says, "" I study Psychology! I know you're fucking lying to me! I know how you are!"".

23,"So I just got off the road from a long drive from a rock concert in Portland, OR. I had an amazing time given it was the first show I've been to sober from alcohol in 10 years. I quit drinking for good only about 2 months ago, and that was after scaling way back from my heavy party days of total 100% high drunkeness. I have always been a self medicater. Fucking medical and especially mental health system in this country (USA) is such a fucking JOKE. Anyways, I'm a little bitter because I was just told by the local mental hospital that I couldn't be scheduled for therapy or medication until JUNE. This is after I was just discharged after a suicide attempt. I felt abandoned. Still do. 

But I digress, I am sitting at home now, relaxing with my two doggies, and I am also for the first time (after 3 mandatory groups a day for my inpatient stay + independent counseling recently) I am clearly identifying and seeing in myself the symptoms of my latest bout in this vicious mental cycle I'm in. Like, I am *horny*. But it's not like that *'golly guess I'll go wank it to some kinky porn'* horny; it's the crazy horny that wants desperately to be gang banged by 5 hot well endowed guys high on coke and not GAF kind of horny, *horny.* 

I have been having *some* clarity these past few days, but I can see that was just a short reprieve while my trauma got ramped up for its next lovely takeover of my personality. I can also see that my personality changes with each swing of the cycle. I can also also see now *that do I have cycles*. I have been in such denial for so long, like admitting that I cycle from manic to severe depressive to hyper sexual to raging angry to suicidal to flat to OK to hyper vigilant to hyper anxious to hyper weepy to just HYPER theeennnn back to manic depressive; and so it repeats. 

I honestly still felt and can see how close I still am to suicidal. But, even though I was extremely moody, cussing out the night nurses in fits of rage, cynical, whathaveyou...I can see now that those seemingly stupid group therapy sessions did actually trigger my brain to thinking about my cycles, identifying triggers, and using that to try and break the cycle. I also have an LGBT sexual assault advocate who calls me once or twice a week just to let me vent and check up on me, and being able to verbalize my crazy thoughts to someone who *actually* responds in a validating way is so, so amazing. 

So, I honestly don't have the first fucking clue how to *stop* this next cycle of hyper sexuality, or any of the other ones for that matter. I will continue to try and find a mental health program for people with severe PTSD, but it is hard to find anything I can realistically afford. Although I am prone to impulse buying when I'm manic, I do also budget the other 90% of the time and do well with what I have. Still, I can't afford to pay $2000 up front for a 4 week inpatient program, and inpatient at the hospital just means zero stimulus (so fucking boring, not even real coffee) and no focused individual therapy just group. Plus my insurance only covers 2 days then you *have to be actively suicidal or mental* to get further days. Lucky me I was waking up screaming in the middle of the night and deciding to fight the night nurses (big guys, bless their hearts). 

Anyways, I'm done writing. Thanks for reading. I live in the pacific northwest (WA) so if you know of any programs for bad ptsd cases in the Washington/Oregon area please let me know.",15Dec2019,1
24,"Hi, I don’t know how to start. I have never posted anything on reddit at all before. I just know that there are a lot of advice and help columns so I thought I would try it. I just turned 19 years old, I have had a lot of things happen to me in my past, growing up and stuff that have probably helped me become the way I am today but I have manic depression, PTSD, anxiety and panic disorder, OCD, ADD, and a really bad eating disorder. I was medicated but none of the medications were working and I have been trying different ones for different things since I was 3. I haven’t been in therapy for a while, it never helped me and frankly just makes me feel really angry and patronized. I am single as of a few months ago, I didn’t have a good reaction to that, he thinks I’m crazy and after everything feels relief to be rid of me. I have one friend he’s my best friend.

I guess I’m posting here because I feel stuck, and hopeless, and I hate myself more than I could hate anyone else. I guess I’m “crazy” according to the definition of it. I feel everyone’s pain on top of my own, that is also part of my diagnosis (very high emotional IQ) and I am very sensitive, I have gotten to the point where I feel like I can’t be fixed, I don’t have insurance so I couldn’t even afford therapy or any really good help, I don’t want to go to therapy anyway because i need real help not what every therapist I have been to gives. I feel like I’m going to be alone forever, I feel like I’m going insane if not there already and as the years pass I seem to be getting worse and worse mentally and emotionally. I drive everyone away, even the people I never thought I could. I understand, I wouldn’t want to be around me either. Basically I need help I don’t know what to say or how to say anything I feel like no one understands what I’m trying to say not because of them but because I don’t know how to explain it, I feel heavy I feel nostalgic, depressed, panicked, paranoid, angry, up down left right all of the diagnosis above are mixing together teaming up and attacking my mind and emotions that’s how i feel. I’m constantly living in the past. I just want to be fixed I need to be fixed I feel i can’t do anything in the condition I’m in I feel scared, the only person who I have who really loves and understands most things is my mom. But I feel horrible because I drive her insane too sometimes. I don’t want to go into a mental hospital, I don’t want my life to pass me by in there and then I come out and everything is different but I will be older without having progressed in life at all. I don’t want them to never let me out, I don’t want a label on my back for the rest of my life, I already have that in the town I live in. “Crazy”. I am scared to post this I don’t want people trying to find me and take me away. I just want to know what to do, eventually we are all left only with the relationships we have made with others. One day my mom won’t be here anymore and I will be alone, and just stuck with myself my own worst enemy. I’m sorry this is all probably hard to read there’s not even a question implied really but, I just need some hope but not false hope, real hope of a way that I can actually be helped a way to change what is in my future at this point, a way to get a break from my mind constantly eating away at itself/me.",15Dec2019,1

26,"As a kid, I lived in the ghetto part of my county that had the shittiest people and shitty houses, etc. Up until age 8 we lived there and were too poor to afford basic things and that's really left a mark on me. My mom was an alcoholic and abused drugs with her drug dealer creep boyfriend until he went to jail for reasons that aren't important. Fast forward to when my mom meets my step dad-- she met him online and only knew him for 3 months until they decided to move in together and get married.

He didn't seem that bad when we first moved in with him, but when i got to my second year of 4th grade (i was held back a grade) he started to show his control freak side. I remember I was obssessed with anime and i guess he thought it wasn't appropriate for me so he went out of his way to do anything to make sure I didnt watch it. Fast forward to 5th grade when strong signs of anxiety started to show-- i started to dissociate heavily and have panic attacks. He blocked the internet and all music access from my touch screen track phone. Fast forward to middle school-- wasn't allowed to use internet, download apps that had chatrooms in it, music apps, YouTube, etc. Fast forward to 9th grade-- still not allowed to do anything at all and at this point its humiliating.

Not only was he a control freak, but he also would verbally abuse me and my biological siblings and even tried to beat one of my older sister's. He bullied my oldest sister into dropping out of high school, and verbally abused my second oldest sister into getting baker acted. I've had many s*icide attempts because of the anxiety I get from going home and seeing him. Despite all of this my mother refuses to leave him. I've since moved out and moved in with my aunt and uncle and cousins and its a much healthier environment, but now I'm starting to develop new things that i guess I never noticed I did before from when i was with my mother.

I apologize when i don't really need to, I get extremely upset when my cousin tries to help me with my math when he says things like ""this is simple math you can do it"" (not in a negative tone), I'm super jumpy, I get paranoid easily, I feel like I've developed seperation anxiety, etc.

I've been thinking too much about the fact that my step dad probably doesn't give any shits about how much trauma he's caused me-- I definitely do not feel like the same person I was when I left. I'm absolutely traumatized. I feel so god damn awful. And for what? He doesn't care. He doesn't care about all of the pain hes caused me for almost 10 years of my life. I know I should move on, but living with my mother and step dad has made me develop the fear of never getting better or having nobody care about me. I feel so hopeless.

I'm always afraid of being a burden on people because apparently that's only what I was to him. I hate him so much for what he did to me. And I can't believe after all of this my motjer is still with him. I went from being mentally healthy to wanting to die every other week. I don't know what to do to move forward from this-- it feels like im reliving it when the smallest inconveniences happen. I never used to be so sensitive before--   he absolutely broke me.",15Dec2019,1
27,"I'll try and describe it the best I can; usually after something shitty happens and I get upset, or even unprovoked sometimes I will get ridiculously overheated and red, can't cool down at all not a wet rag, walking outside doesn't help, I look and feel like a chili pepper. Then I start sweating profusely, I will easily sweat through my bra, shirt and jacket within minutes regardless if it's 68, 80, or 20 outside I will sweat. Idk how to describe it but it feels like my heart drops, or you get a pit in your stomach or free falling 20 stories whatever that feeling in your chest/ stomach is I get it HARD, I get that feeling every 2-5 seconds this happens it makes me nauseas sometimes. My stomach gets frothy, best way I can describe that, I threw up one time in the middle of one of these and straight foam came out, white foam. I shake ALOT. But that constant stomach dropping feeling makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. Today this happened after something that made me upset happened, but this is a daily thing. Sometimes once a day, sometimes 3. Some are mild and some make me feel like I'm going to die. The stomach dropping is the biggest thing, it doesn't stop until whatever this is stops. I don't know if I'm having panic attacks or what, someone please tell me if what I described is anything similar.",15Dec2019,1

She proceeds to say she wouldn’t actually hit me but it makes her feel like that. Then another party adds their opinion saying they agree and i feel as if now everytime i shake my head in disappointment at someone or disagree with them im going to be assaulted.

Lately I’ve been having adverse physical issues like heart palpitations, EXTREME fatigue, sensitivity to cold, headaches, memory loss and more.

35,"I've been going to therapy for a couple years now, and just recently my spouse had commented on my improvement in overall mental health.
I went to my therapist to tell her how I had been feeling lately, and how I want to start making bigger commitments (purchasing a home, having children).  She suggested I may not be ready, and when I asked why she brought up a lot of trauma I didnt know I had.  She suggested that because of things that happened when I was a child, she can draw clear evidence of s**ual a**use in my family.   Suddenly I started to suspect every little weird thing growing up, and now I'm freaking out because I feel like there was definitely a**use happening, but I cant figure out who it was.  I have been in a nonstop whirlwind thinking about this ever since.  Over analyzing every encounter I had with parents/siblings/extended family.  I'm not showering, brushing my teeth, eating, or getting up really.  I'm just freaking out.  My sibling and mom acted strangely when I was a kid, they never directly ab*sed me but I was s*xualized at a very young age.  Some of the s*xualizing behaviors leads my therapist, spouse, and now myself to believe that my mom and sister were most definitely ab*se victims at some point.  My therapist believes, from their behavior, it was a female non-relative.  I'm freaking out on the inside, and I feel like I need some sort of help before my next appointment.",15Dec2019,1

But basically, i can’t remember much of anything involving that side of the family. I have such vague memories of them but when it comes to everything else in my life, I have a very sharp memory. (Ex. I can remember moments from when I lived in a different state at the age of 2).
I just learned of a week where I stayed with my grandparents and I cant remember much of anything from that trip. However when I was told that I had gone there, my brain instantly clicked to a moment where I was sitting at the dinner table and I had this GIANT fear. Fear I’ve never felt before in my life. And all I can remember is that feeling of being so scared. My body physically reacted to that fear and I started shaking even though it happened 8 years ago. But I don’t know what I was afraid of. I really don’t think I was abused? I just remember being so scared. But maybe it was because I was so young and I was in trouble for something? I don’t know. I don’t know where I’m going with this. I think I need to go to therapy but like I feel like I could be wasting the therapists time because my “trauma” might not even be trauma. Could anyone chime in? Maybe give me some insight?

40,"For starters, I'm in high school and I've been diagnosed with Depression so life is quite tumultuous on its own. My problem starts with this girl though. A year and a half ago I was lonely and shy and had never had a girlfriend but always wanted one. I met this girl who seemed into me and we started dating. It became obvious she was quite troubled from the start but she was sweet and attractive and I didn't really mind. We dated for two weeks then she broke up with me for undisclosed reasons. I was naturally pretty bummed out as I had grown to really like her. Two weeks later we got back together but it only lasted another two weeks before she broke up with me again for the same reason (I later learned it was because she still had feelings for her ex). During that time she was also severely depressed and stopped going to school, staying in bed all day. We stopped talking for a few months. I spiraled out of control, handling it all very poorly, abusing painkillers for a while. Around that I learned she tried to kill herself but failed. I eventually ran out of pills and my friends refused to sell me any so I became sober from those for a while (that was just the beginning of my drug problems but that's a different story). We started talking again, just as friends and we would hang out, but I was still hurt and still holding onto feelings for her. I held out hope that maybe we would get back together at some point.






That was during the summer of 2018. That November she started dating an old friend of mine (I wasn't friends with him anymore, we lost contact and when he reentered my life he turned out to be a horrible person). That hurt me a lot because my feelings for her never went away. He ended up cheating on her and after he admitted it, they still stayed together. This year around April or May I got sober from all drugs and wasn't able to take the pain of seeing them together anymore so I cut contact with her for a few months. Fast forwards to August when she texts me pleading me to answer her, saying she has nothing left anymore. I concede and we start talking again. She had broken up with him and was in a very bad place.






This is where shit gets really painful for me. So it's been over a year and I still have feelings for this girl I dated for like 4 non consecutive weeks for some reason. Even though her and her ex boyfriend had broken up they were still having sex with each other because she was very suicidal at the time and it was the only thing that made her feel better. After learning this I became jealous again. Something you'll realize after reading this is I'm a very jealous person. I wish I wasn't but I really can't help it. Last September, after she hinted to me about wanting to become friends with benefits, I asked her if she would be down. She says yes and things were looking up. To accurately paint the picture I need to explain something. I'm a virgin, and lately that's been bothering me a lot. I've been told I'm quite attractive and I'm a decent, tall, considerate guy, but I honestly have no idea how people get girls. I have very low self esteem and the though of asking anyone out terrifies me beyond belief (I never asked this girl out, we just kinda started dating). I know that it's my fault I've been single but it's due to a lot of problems I don't know how to fix. All my friends around me, attractive or ugly, nice or mean have gotten girlfriends and gotten laid quite a bit. It seems natural to them and though I try to put these emotions aside and not let it interfere with out friendships, it hurts. I'm very jealous.






So as you can imagine, for someone in my situation, to become friends with benefits with a girl who I had had feelings for for over a year, I was excited. Plus it would mean she wouldn't have to have sex with her ex and I was hoping her would be out of her life. But nothing ever happened. I kissed her once and that was all. One week, she tells me she had sex with some guy at a party and freaked out and ran off and cut herself quite badly. She changed after that. That prompted me to relapse and start doing drugs again. (I'm sober once again though, don't worry). We stopped talking about being friends with benefits after that and she spiraled back into depression. A month or so ago she tried to kill herself once again but failed. For a good 12 hours I thought she was dead and it really fucked me up. I was still holding out on the slightest hope that we would have sex at some point. There was one situation where if I would have been able to get a ride somewhere, we would have had sex. But I couldn't.





My sliver of hope was destroyed a week ago when I reached my breaking point and told her everything, how I felt and all that. She responded essentially apologizing and telling me that she was going to try again with her ex boyfriend. It's been a week and the pain is still as strong. I've been very very fucked up over this. I can't think of sex or anything sexual or even take a piss and see my own dick without an intense feeling of agony. On top of all of this she is still highly suicidal and guess what? I am the one person she feels can understand what she's going through. She says I help her more than anyone. I wholeheartedly believe that if I were to just cut her out of my life for my own sake, she would kill herself. I can't tell you how many times, including in the past week where I've had to talk her down from a fucked up headspace. They are dating again and it fucking kills me. I feel like he got everything I ever wanted. He got to date her, he took her virginity, he has had sex with her more times than I've probably jerked off in my life (and exaggeration but you get the idea). I know I'm obsessed, I know my mind state of sex and the intense desire is stupid and detrimental, I know that it's not all it's made up to be in my head and that I'm putting her and sex on a pedestal but knowing that doesn't change the way that I feel. I'm in a constant state of agony at this point, I'm not sure how I'm still sober.





For those of you that may want to give me advice, I appreciate it, but the following things are not applicable: ""Tell her parents or someone that she's feeling suicidal"". They know. Her therapists (plural) know. She's been in therapy her whole life. There isn't anyone that can do anything. Except for me.





""Go to therapy"". Been in therapy for years. My therapist is great and he knows everything I just told you all, but he has no solutions. He's doing the best he can.




""Try to move on from her"". I have. I spent the better part of the year trying to, I'm frankly obsessed.




In short, the only person I can talk to (other than my therapist) is the one who's hurting me. A lot. And she knows and feels horrible. I'm also the only person she can talk to and I'm honestly the only thing keeping her from suicide. I know this is a horribly toxic relationship but there's no way out. I still have feelings for her, and 70% of my thoughts are about sex and how I'm not having it and how everyone around me is, and it torments me, and I don't think I can find any semblance of closure until I have it. Being friends with benefits with her seemed like the last chance. If you read this all that means so much to me because I feel so alone in all this, so thank you from the bottom of my heart if you did. I hope you're feeling better than I am.",15Dec2019,1

I don't know if this fit the sub well but I think it does because it affects me a lot in my daily life.

My sister is the most obnoxious person I have ever met, she is a total narcissist, who at the young age of 26 still throws tantrums when the call her out, has a daughter who never takes care out and gets mad when her daughter doesn't want to spend time with her. Like her daughter needed uniforms and she instead bought herself a cellphone.
It got to point every time she starts to get in that you can't tell me what to do, cash me outside how bout da kinda attitude, I get a rage induced panic atack, and being around her long enough gives me this urge to smash her toothless face; that's what I did today my father separated us and gave me a sermon that you have to suck it up because she lives here and no one has somewhere else to go. I told to my other sister about my urges to kill her and again told me to suck it up because there's nothing we can't do.
I can't handle it, it's getting harder and harder every day I just want to kill her or kill myself fuck it.

44,"Philosophical thought of the day

People can never kill themselves.
“Uhh, suicide?” you say? Well, did you really choke yourself to death? Or stab yourself with your nails until you turned cold? Most likely not. You need something else to kill you- whether that’s a rope, a knife, a gun, or drugs.
So literally, people can never kill themselves. And when people commit suicide, physically, something else does the job for them, and mentally, they are killed by something other than themselves: depression, anxiety, and isolation. Mental disorders are capable of killing people, just like any other disease.",15Dec2019,1

I didn't get to make my own decisions, to find out who I was. I haven't made mistakes that I regret. Nor have I done anything I'm proud of. And doing all that, making difficult decisions and being stressed, that's how you grow up. How you find out who you are and learn how to live in the real world.

And sure, I'm still young, It's not too late for me to learn these things about myself. But I don't want to do it alone. I don't even know if I can.  When you are in high school. Everyone else is going through the same things. The same journey of self-discovery and coming of age. I didn't get that.

I want to have someone to talk to about what I'm going through, and they can understand it because they just went through the exact same thing.

 He experienced a lot of trauma im his childhood (e.g. witnessing his brother's attempted suicide as a child, father's alcoholism and chronic illness) and adult years (every girlfriend he's had cheats on him etc., Academic struggles etc.) He is an alcoholic though doesn't think so (college culture) and struggles with self awareness and emotional maturity.

I excused myself to the bathroom and just couldn’t stop crying. I tried so hard to calm down. I sat in the bathroom crying for 30 minutes before I decided I needed to go home. I clocked off after my boss let me leave. I uncontrollably sobbed in my car, all the way home and didnt stop until I got into my pjs, got back under my weighted blanket at home, and started distracting myself and my mind. One of the only ways to get myself to calm down is major distractions. Get myself out of my own mind. 
Nothing that I can tell triggered it. But I’ve been hopeless all day. Crying off and on, had a sad nap, and my parents tried to talk to me but somehow got frustrated with me for numerous reasons. They don’t know how to talk to or deal with a seriously depressed person, which is comical sometimes considering my mom is an ER Nurse. 
But as much as I need a shoulder to cry on, they basically brushed me off. They love me and I love them but my mental health has always been such a hard conversation point. Always. And I become a wreck whenever we try and talk about it. My communication when I’m so down like this is trash and I get snippy or hard to understand when I really don’t mean to. I can’t see my therapist till January plus it has been hard to really connect with her as well as feel its helping at all. I also just recently got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and ADD, along with my already diagnosed anxiety, depression, and PTSD. 
Long story short. I feel hopeless. I’m overwhelmed. I can’t figure out why I am so incredibly sad right now. I’ve gone back to self harm and have suicidal ideations all the time lately. Never want to do anything. I thought about calling the hotline today. But I hate phone calls and I was safe in my bed so I didn’t. I’m supposed to go in for another 9 hour shift tomorrow. I don’t know if I can. I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to keep breaking down at work. I don’t want to LOSE my job. I can’t. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to think.

60,"Falling asleep isn’t scary because of the fear of not waking up. Sleep is scary because of the fear of waking up and having to live.

To be honest, I was emotionally dependant on him to ""fix"" me like the movies show us. And I also expected myself to magically ""fix"" him. 

These 5 years have been a lot of good happy memories but also there was an underlying emotional dependancy which I didn't realise till recently, when I started meeting new people. I have surrounded myself with friends and work and ambition which has worked out well for me. Him, on the other hand, has been having financial troubles and feels lonely most of the time, and all the bad childhood memories he keeps revisiting.

I’m ashamed of myself for the inabilities I possess. Like being able to have a “normal” day with her or my kids. To be able to find joy in anything other than specifically what I need or want to do. I have instant hesitations to do even the slightest things, like eat, sleep, smile, go anywhere, do anything outside of my comfort zone which is basically sports, music, or nothing.

I’m afraid to speak to anyone. I’m afraid of committing myself to an outpatient clinic. I’m afraid to speak to a doctor. I’m 31 years old, and I’ve ALWAYS been this way. I’ve always had these levels of anxiety. This is the farthest I’ve gone in publicly communicating any of these instances. I don’t know what to do.

I’m afraid that I’m subconsciously teaching these habits to my children. I’m afraid that they’ll end up the same way, and I’ll know it’s my fault. I’m constantly self-deprecating. I consistently think that I don’t need to be here anymore, but I know I wouldn’t commit suicide, because I’m a coward. I know that’s not the best response to that situation, but it’s always been my standpoint.

65,"Hi everyone - I'm just looking for some advice here.

I just feel so numb and empty all the time. It's not even sadness, just this crushing nothingness. It feels like someone has cut me open and gutted me so there's nothing left inside but a heavy fatigue that's settled into my bones. 

I don't find happiness in the things that used to make me happy - not even music (my favourite thing) makes me feel the same way it used to. I just feel empty. 

Next year is my final year of school and all my friends are excited to graduate but I'm dreading it because it means having to go to university and get a job and work just to make enough money to survive. It feels so hopeless and overwhelming. I feel sick thinking about it.

69,"Hello

For 5 or so years now, I’ve been suffering from maybe a few mental disorders and am looking for a proper diagnosis. I’m currently 17 now, but will be turning 18 in a month. I’m wanting to see a therapist for help in just dealing with a few issues and discussing them and I also want to visit a psychologist or psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. I don’t want to see a GP because I feel they will just diagnose with depression and call it a day, but I feel as if it’s something more. Also just dislike my GP in general. Would also like for my family to not find out because it’s a sort of a stigma in my household, and would like to get a few things figured out before I go to college so I don’t end up as an irreversible mess

Am I able to get a referral from a therapist or does it have to come from a GP? Or can I just go to a psychologist without a referral? The whole process is confusing to me, honestly.",15Dec2019,1
70,"Alt account because I would never admit this to even my best friend of 15 years or even my parents.

Ever since I moved out to college, I feel like I’ve started to really notice how different I’m just always going to be. I’ve been diagnosed with ASD/Asperger’s (high functioning) and ADHD but but I’ve recently put together that I have OCD and then something in the range of anxiety and paranoia. 

Over the years, I was generally pretty content with dealing with what I have with the methods I’ve developed (most of which just come down to riding it out). As a kid, I had a pretty nice friend group I could hang out with, but I constantly think about all of the obvious signs they were showing that I missed which makes me constantly think that they hung out with me out of pity. Once my family moved across the country, though, I mostly stopped trying to be outgoing within a couple years. By the time I was 11 or 12, I was spending every waking second I could playing Minecraft, which hasn’t really changed much even now that I’m 18. I didn’t realize that it wasn’t a normal thing for teens to completely avoid any social interaction outside of a few people.

I’ve always been aware of my ADHD and ASD, as I was diagnosed really early on; they didn’t really affect how I thought of myself for the longest time. The past few years, though, I started to develop other traits or symptoms or whatever, such as obsessive counting (that I can only really combat my messing myself up, which is hard since I usually keep some kind of beat going with my steps or breath), constant paranoia (I always feel like somebody might be watching me or judging me if I’m in public, which is only made worse when I think about how it might be obvious that I’m autistic), and general anxiousness about almost anything that happens (there’s other stuff too but there’s not really a reason to list everything).

When I was around 15 or 16, I found a friend group that was partially in my youth group through a couple of friends there. I felt like I was really starting to fit in after a year or so, and I found out that a couple of them also had ASD, so I felt like a normal member of the group for once! By the 1.5 year mark, I’d even say I was making my way into the core group (the overlap between some semi-separate groups that all knew each other). Of course, though, I got in to a good school with a full ride scholarship that was 3 hours away. And because of the way that I am, it’s become extremely hard to keep constant contact with all of my friends back at home, so sometimes I feel like I’m back to being isolated again like I was when I was 14 or 15.


Moving out to college constantly made me feel like an outcast. I have almost no friends (apart from my roommate who, by some miracle, shares the same weird ironic humor that I like, but I’m constantly hearing from their friend group in discord that they’re all gonna share a 4 bedroom apartment or something together which would essentially kick me from the group) and I struggle with interactions even more than usual now that I don’t have any kind of safety net, and it doesn’t help that one of my nervous tics is finger guns (it’s so embarrassing when I notice I’m doing it). It doesn’t help that I constantly felt like a disappointment to my straight-A parents (to be clear tho, they’ve always been super supportive and are really proud that I’m even able to handle classes on my own) by going from a 4.23 HS GPA down to only 2.75 in my first semester. Nobody is telling me that I’m not doing good enough outside of myself. Everyone praises me for doing so well in the context of what I have, but it always reminds me that I’ve always been and I’ll always be held back in a number of ways that I’ll never be able to leave behind.

Like I stated earlier, a lot of my coping was done in Minecraft. The theme here is just things on my pc, though, since I generally like to spend my time watching YouTube or playing something (usually Minecraft, sorry if it’s getting repetitive by this point) since it’s something to help cope and distract I guess. I’m still sorting through the normal things I do and the coping mechanisms I do, so I’m not really sure which category most things I do fall into (sorry if it’s rambly and ranty by now). I recently asked my dad about getting VR so that I could easily get a change in scenery without having to go anywhere (because I still can’t drive even at 18) and he’s hinted/made it completely obvious that I’ll be getting it as a Christmas gift, but I feel like I want it more and more as an escape from the real world in general at this point (which I look forward to with genuine excitement, as sad as it is).

All of this is constantly making me go into a depressive spiral and is killing my self esteem or self worth or whatever, and it feels like I’m just watching it happen sometimes. At this point, I can’t see myself ever getting a job or finding someone who would like me or just ever being successful in any way because I can never forget that there’s a number of things wrong with me.

My only constant friend has been my best friend. Me and her (I’m a guy btw but we’ve never dated or anything, just always best friends) have known each other since before I really remember anything, and she’s always been an amazing friend. I always feel bad though, since I feel like I can’t even open up about anything even to her. It makes me feel like a bad friend because it makes me feel like I’m not trusting her or something, which is a total lie, but it’s always a nagging thought. I don’t know where I’d be if it wasn’t for her. I guess I’ve also really likes having cats too.


TL;DR: I had everything given to me and was set up for success with a great family and whatever, but a collection of disorders and a lack of social interaction of any kind is constantly depressing me and making me wonder why I’m even here.",15Dec2019,1

Now I'm not so sure, and I've got nobody to prove to me that I have issues or I'm just making them up in my head. For all I know I've given myself anxiety by fearing that I have anxiety.

- I struggle with showing my emotions to other people
- I feel like even the people that care about me secretly wish I wouldn't bother talking to them
- I feel like I'm always dreaming or disconnected from real life (but the anti-hypochondriac inside me is saying it has nothing to do with disassociative disorder)
- I have to stave away panic attacks by using breathing exercises
- My chest always feels tight
- Some days I feel extremely tired for no reason
- I have a really hard time crying, even when I want to and I think it will release pent up feelings

Yes, my therapist knew) my old therapist dropped me as a client. They claimed that they were so busy that I was considered an inactive patient from missing three appointments in a row. They further said that I needed to wait on the waiting list and go through intake all over again. Yeah.

It took a year to find a new therapist, partly due to insurance, partly due to high demand and few doctors. My appointment was supposed to be Thursday December 19th. I called the office last Friday because I wasn’t familiar with the area and wanted to know if there was a free public parking lot or metered-only or paid garage parking. The receptionist was very confused and repeatedly asked for my info, then put me on hold.

She comes back a few minutes later. She sounds very flustered. “I finally found you in the system. In the referral section with a note ‘make appointment 12/19 @ 9:30’. Unfortunately, no one ever made the appointment and we don’t have any appointments until mid-January.” Yay.

Why do I even bother trusting doctors with my health when they repeatedly fail me? I had undiagnosed endometriosis for 20 years, classic gall bladder syndrome for 8 months, etc. The aforementioned therapist office that dropped me and cut off my psych meds cold turkey so that I had the fun time of withdrawal symptoms while processing my mother’s death AND being assaulted by her mother in front of my child. 

I haven’t slept well since Friday, and not at all last night. I guess the only good thing is my PCP (newish) is actually quite sympathetic and has agreed to fill my meds until psych takes over, if that ever happens.

A few months ago I smoked with my friends and up until this I had done it a few times and it was just the normal high type of stuff but this was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life, it makes me feel really dumb to say because weed is known as being so safe. Almost immediately after I hit it (we used a bong) It felt like all of reality was tearing apart. I saw myself in 3rd person, like a video game but from the perspective of my friends roof. I kept thinking and doing the same exact motion over and over again and I did not think I would ever be back to normal. There was a different part of my mind telling me to slam my head into the toilet seat to kill myself when I was throwing up. I passed out in a puddle of my own vomit and if I hadn’t of fallen asleep I probably would’ve begged to be taken to a mental hospital, I for some reason thought my entire life was fake up until that moment 

after this I did not feel normal for weeks, I didn’t even feel like myself. anxiety also came with this (which I did not have before, or at least not that much) it was so bad to the point where my mom forced me to see my doctor because of depression and anxiety and I was diagnosed with GAD and offered meds but don’t take them because my family is weird about that sort of thing. This was probably about 3 months ago but in the last month I’ve also started having panick attacks, leading me to skipping classes where I fear I could have one. These last few days have been even tougher than normal as I have barely been able to sleep, probably about 1 to 2 hours a night.

And now the feelings of my life being “fake” or at least different than it was before keep coming back, if I even think about being alive and the process of being alive/ being aware of being alive it just doesn’t make sense to me, there’s no way this is actually happening.

To put it simply, over the last couple of months I feel like I've become less and less important to people and more irrelevant in general. Not being invited to most parties or gatherings is the best example of this. I dont want to get into the nitty gritty but there's a house party coming up, around 50 people coming which includes all my friends, but i didnt get invited. I spoke to the host and she said ""So so sorry but i just have too many numbers and parents would be mad :("".

Normally I can move on and accept this as I used to have this ""Oh well, nothing i can really do about it i guess"" sort of thinking. But after missing out on the past 3 or more social events im starting to really sink into a self-destrcutive depressive state and im really worried for my mental health. I know for a fact that if i could just come to this party i would instantly feel better. One of my friends who was going tried his best to plead for me to come (considering every single one of my mates are already invited) but she kind of played it passive and said ""Ill see what i can do""

I feel like that is basically just a delayed rejection. What can i do to get her to say yes? I mean i just cant see how ONE more is at all a big deal in the grand scheme. Plus how is it fair for me to just constantly put up with not being invited and suffer emotionally? At worse her parents get cross cause she added one more, its not fair.

In  the letter he states that he has been instructed to continue to attempt  contact with myself with the aim of getting me to agree to take  medication. They have made an appointment with me for 17th December.

He  also states ""I explained your current situation of that I believed you  lack insight into your illness but was not at the time presenting with  any risks that would warrant an escalation in care.

By this I mean a mental health assessment and if detained compulsory treatment.""

In my opinion I'm quite stable mentally and there is really no reason for this.

I haven't taken any medication for about 5 years. This is a completely new approach which has come out of the blue and doesn't seem to have any logical context with wout any regard to how I conduct myself in my everyday life.

While I don't have perfect mental health (who does?) I'm quite certain that I'm not of any risk to myself or others and my mental health is very likely to get a lot worse as a result of the trauma that will be caused by this aggressive stance.

For context, I was sectioned about 6 years ago for haviing an untidy flat and because the nurse at theat time didn't believe that my diet was sufficient.

I was told while in hospital that I would be compelled to take anti psychotic medication so I ""voluntarily"" started a course of Amisulpride.

I stopped taking this medication about 6 months after leaving hospital as it scrambled my brain and made me fee lifeless and dead inside.

My mental health without medication has been much better though I feel like I'm still suffering from ptsd as a result of being sectioned.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

98,"Background: 24 y/o from America. I was diagnosed with both depression and anxiety as a child; It runs in the family on both sides. Been dealing with it ever since. Graduated university in August of 2017 but  couldn't really find a job pertaining to my degree due to a lack of internships in college. Decided I'd try something different than most people who are unsure of what to do after graduating and that a new environment might help kick-start something inside me, so I moved across the world to Taiwan and started teaching English.  
It's been a year and a half, with a change in prescription halfway through that seemed to help alot, and the depression is back worse than ever. I don't want to go home, but am contemplating it because I need help and I'll be on my own insurance wise in America once I turn 26. Here are my issues.

1. I've always had trouble motivating myself to do things, even though I want to do them and even find them enjoyable when I do. I try to make lists on apps on my phone and check stuff off when it's done, but hasn't helped. This has stopped me from pursuing things I enjoy and actually have some talent with (singing and photography) beyond the point where I have to start practicing to improve. It's stopped me from regularly exercising, even though I want to lose weight and I feel good after I exercise. I'll tell myself I'll do something over and over, make plans, set aside time that day....and still don't do it. This compounds my depression because I remain overweight, don't get things done, and feel inferior to the people around me because I don't think I provide anything interesting. 

2. I overthink EVERYTHING to a detrimental point. Even when I'm doing something with friends and enjoying myself, I'll sit there thinking 'well this will be over soon and it's back to normal' or the nature of existence or how shit of a human I am for not having any talents or motivation like everybody else. There's no ability to shut my mind off. Ever. 

3. I get incredibly dejected by small roadblocks or insignificant things. I feel like I've been struggling at my job and have no clue what I'm doing. It gets me super down. My friends and coworkers that have been in country teaching for a long time have said 'Don't be sooo hard on yourself, nobody really knows what they're doing for atleast 3 years' and I've only been here  a year and 5 months, yet I feel like a complete failure. Anytime I feel like I have a bad class, I'm depressed for the rest of the day.

4. I feel hopeless for my future. I don't want to teach forever, but if I go home I don't really have any skills to find a good full time job (which I'll need for insurance purposes). I still don't even have a clue what I want to do 

I just want to be able to find the motivation to do things, improve my self, and become happy. I don't know what to do.",15Dec2019,1

103,"So this starts off a few years ago at University. Around exam times I started getting really sick with stomach ulcers. My grades started going down as I was avoiding thinking about the exams that were stressing me out so much and in turn I was also worried about what everyone would think of me doing poorly so I started avoiding my coursemates.  I ended up failing my final year and tried for another year as an external student. Bad move, I hadn't worked out a way to cope better and ended up doing just as poorly. 

I  felt the need for my family and friends to think I was doing better though as I just couldn't face disappointing them anymore so I started lying about my progress. I went to see a counselor about my anxiety but my stupid need to progress ended up with me lying to them after a few sessions when I wasn't doing as well as it seemed I should. 

This has now escalated to the point where I told my family I completed the course and my parents think we're going to a graduation ceremony in a few days. I actually only have a diploma instead which has no ceremony. I know I need to tell them before the day (Tuesday the 17th) but everytime I think about telling them I immediately feel extremely nauseous with stomach cramps and I feel like I'm going to vomit. I don't feel like this is something that I can take to my friends.

I do not know how to cope with minor stress- not to mention, I am a perfectionist. I really get disappointed easily. At age 19, I was clinically diagnosed with Chronic Depression with Mild Psychotic Episodes (yup! Its hard seeing yourself fail each day)- an overachiever who became an overachiever; an ambitious young woman, who is now contented with her mediocre works. I took antidepressants and anxiolytics for 2 months after I was diagnosed. By then, I stopped and sought counselling/therapies. I had it for two years. For the past 6 months, I have not gone to my psychologist for therapies, as I feel like its not helping me.

I was afraid to go outside, with panic attacks multiple times a day, having conversion disorders, uncontrollable crying and reaching a weight of 50kg (110 lbs), sleeping for 4-6 hours a night, while actively ignoring everyone who wanted to talk to me.

Mom is in pain because dad blames her for our family financial losses and is emotionally absent. How can we (me and my siblings) help our mom?

Need suggestion as to how I can help my mom get better.

**What’s the current situation?**
My mom is in her 50s.
She is suffering from trigeminal neuralgia. She get frequent “Triggering” in her head due to it. When I saw triggering imagine getting shocked right in the brain.

They are very painful and I have heard my mom say multiple time’s, she’d rather die than go through another episode of triggering.

But here’s the thing. I have noticed she gets these triggering only when she is stressed.

Let me explain:
Dad is irresponsible with money.
Goes to grocery shopping with $x, buys stuff we already have and hikes the bill to $2x. 
Whenever these things happens, She get triggering.

I am irresponsible with time. (Trying to make my self better now) she asked for some stuff to get done like plumbing or fixing something. I usually end up doing until it months after mom asking me to. She gets triggering.

Something happens in the news, and if it has the potential to harm our family, community or country. She gets triggering.


**Past life.**

One episode from our life.
Dad worked in transportation. Had 20 years of experience at this point. And always felt comfortable in a job. He wanted the company to pay the insurance, yearly flight, (we lived abroad most of the time), and yearly visa fees.

He knew almost all the roads in the country (for privacy reasons I can’t say which country we lived in, but it wasn’t our home country) been a truck driver himself, and went up the rank to be his company’s transportation supervisor.

Since he know is field better than anyone (his subordinates would call at 2am while On the road, just to ask my dad which was was quicker, this was before google maps) Mom suggested to invest our money in a 16 wheeler truck head, and start his own small business.

Long story short, he spend almost half of the money my dad inherited from my grand mother, bought a 16 wheeler truck head. Hired a driver. Made money for 3 months or so. And in forth month, the truck driver accidentally killed the repairman while the truck was in shop.
The truck driver panicked and ran away. Police said it was a pure accident, but since the driver ran away, they put my dad in jail, and confiscated the truck.

Dad was out in 2 weeks, but never went back to get the truck. It was a really bad experience for us all, and the poor mechanic’s family who lost his life.

Lost a lot of money there.

That’s just one of many ways dad lost money.

Now I have a job, my Younger brother has a job and we are both supporting our family. It’s not about loosing the money.

It’s about accepting the mistakes.

Now every now and then, dad says it was my mom’s decision to buy the truck instead of investing the money anywhere else. Hence it’s because of her poor choices, and it wasn’t his fault. He did as his wife asked him to do. 🤷‍♂️.

And she gets triggering.

**why am I posting here?**

I need help.
I know for a fact my dad will never change. 
My grandfather was always rude to all his kids and it’s evident how my dad and his siblings turned out. They are always stressed and shout at their kids for no reason, just like their father.

When I was 20 I was luck to go to a boarding school, away from my dad.
When my brother was 17 he started hanging out with his friends and found multiple jobs, came home after mid night only to avoid talking to dad.

I know my dad and he won’t change. 

I love my dad and he loves us. But he was never appreciated in his childhood, hence he doesn’t know how to appreciate people.

Everyone goes through financial loss in their family and eventually everything turns out for the good.

Now my dad is retired, and my mom is suffering, suffocating and is in pain.

How do I help her?

I get anxiety attacks really, really easily, especially when I'm in an already weak mental state. The littlest things can set me off and all of the sudden im curled in a ball hyperventilating and crying. There's a couple reasons why I've been getting them so often recently but it can mostly just be chalked up to a lot of stress from school. 
My house has always been my safe space, whenever im home i can just forget about the stress of the day and relax for the night. The problem is my mom doesn't seem to understand how easily i get them or how severe they are so she just says things with no second thought that will send me spiraling. 
Basically all i want to know is how to better bring up the fact that what she says hurts because my anxiety will take what she said and run with it, so when she says stuff like ""i have to do everything around here"" or ""its the simplest things with you people"" i immediately start piling on phrases like ""you're worthless,"" ""the things you aren't good enough,"" ""you're just an inconvenience to everyone,"" and if its bad enough ill start feeling like i don't deserve to live.

I'm writing to find out if anyone knows how to access mental health services in Portugal. My friend lives there and is having one of the most horrific medical experiences that I can imagine. If anyone is in need of outside support and therapy, it's her. Unfortunately, from the sounds of it, her family doesn't believe in having mental health problems (""just try harder - think positive"", you know the type) and she is extremely reliant upon them right now; she's is currently living with them and unable to drive. She also only moved to Portugal to be with her family after her accident, so I don't know how well she really knows the country and its systems. She is open to therapy, but thinks it will be impossible to get. I don't want to doubt her assessment of the situation, and I don't want to overstep hers or my boundaries at all, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience in the system there and possible contact numbers which I could give her. Knowing how badly I suffered with my own little set of problems, I can't imagine how she's making it through.

I really appreciate any help you could give me. I should clarify that again, I'm not looking to put her into therapy because that is 100% not my call - I just want to see if there are options for her if she comes to the conclusion that she could use it and is willing to go against her parents' opinions.

So far, i was beginning to have a little more stability on the ground with my mental health situation. I sadly, know i won't be human from now on, permanently.

I was doing well, hopped on an online app. Made a few buddies which i socialised and made a connection, with be as transparent as possible.

I met this lovely individual, who had her own problems, which i made sure i was always there to support her with. No matter if it was fake or not.

I did all these small things, i have no idea if she properly noticed how much i actually did for her.

But over time of observing, i noticed i befriended someone, who'd get jealous of others if i talked to them. Who'd be hostile to others, rude, but keep it under wraps, until a few people approached me saying i should talk to her about it.

As i did, took on the responsibility. But i held back, anxious and not sure on how to approach them with such information. Turns out i did it at the wrong time. They were at a very difficult part in their life, supposedly becoming homeless.

With all the research, the supported files, getting her to maybe get a job, or speak to a facility or company which had housing. They never did it.

Rejecting all my help, but they were always online, sitting texting, telling me about their situation.

I felt awful for them, i still do.

but when i openned up to them about what i have, it immediately backfired and i was soon being asked constantly to open up, let her understand me. My illness had become my definition to her.

Time went by, and a few days ago, i had a talk with her, about her behaviour and demeaner towards people.

She didn't give herself time to read, nor have a think over before she began retaliating. I felt like it was going to explode into drama.

I was generous, saying I'd still be here for her, give her some time, to sort things out. She gave her word of not being in the right mindset and wasn't going to continue texting/retaliating. But went back on her word and kept going. 

I managed to shut her down and gave her the choice of contacting me, instead of the other way around.

I feel awful for such thing.

Before even this incident, i could feel myself declining again.

glitches of delusions seeping through.

drifting inbetween two realities, all the while I'm carrying somebody else who has no understanding, no will to properly care. Not even able to search up the word for such mental health illness.

I don't believe she properly cared.

129,"I was wondering what lays beyond depression and anxiety?.
 Is there anything spiritual to achieve by going through such times ?  

I acknowledged that actually I subconsciously wanted to be alone and I wanted to go through dark times. And I got this by moving alone to another country for studying right after a painful, dramatic breakup and family problems. Probably I've been longing for introspection, which I have achieved pretty much. I'm thinking that the reason I longed for such times was the fact that I developed a social phobia, and I neglected and suppressed my feelings for too long and I needed time alone to recover somehow. I look at my situation as objectively as possible.

But one year has passed and I kinda got bored of that lonely, depressive and anxious mood.
The point of my  writing is that I tried a couple of times to get over that, to set some goals, to change my attitude, etc. But each time it lasts for a couple of weeks and than it hits me again and I don't know why is it coming back to me.

I'll point out that I don't have a job and I don't have a constant real life contact with other people.

So, how can I get out of this ? 
Will getting a job and having constant contact with people help me out ? 

Each time it comes back I assume that I just didn't understand the reason I'm in such a mood and that there is something more than a simple state of mental exhaustion.

Each time it gets better for a while I feel like I am loosing the touch with myself and I have to get back to my cave. 
The feelings of happiness feel like something intrusive.

I have developed some psychoanalytical skills while being in such moods and reading philosophy, psychology but I feel like something is missing anyways, something I don't understand, and that thing that I don't understand is the key of my cave.

I don't know if I should go on reading some hardcore philosophy like Jung, or as simple as bible in search for more answers
 OR
 if I should adopt some superficial positive emotions in order to try a few more times to fake getting out of cave until I'm actually out ?",15Dec2019,1
130,"I struggled with depression, the family doesn't have good relationships and fights a lot, and I smoke pot to cope. Kaiser recommended that I needed to be institutionalized to ""get the help I need"". In reality I was being sent to the mountains to live with kids that constantly were in a crisis breaking everything, screaming, and having no choices whatsoever were a part of daily life. I just had to sit there and the staff didnt really know why I was there. I spent 4.5 months at the first one, 3 or 4 at the second, about 3 months at the third one and 4 or 5 months at the last one. I have been back in the real world for about a year now and I have had a hard time reaclimating to regular life. I often just sit there and feel like spacing out. I have constant anxiety and I am generally in a state of dysphoria. I'm not sure how living at mental kid prison was supposed to help and I just feel damaged and empty.

137,"i'm 14 and i always thought i just had self esteem issues but recently i came across bdd and it sounded exactly like what i go through so i'm just gonna list what i go through and maybe someone could tell me what is. 

I really don't like the way i look, i think about it all day long to the point where it takes over me. when i'm at home ill spend so much time looking in the mirror checking how i look but when in public i avoid them at all costs, like for example after pe ill go to look in the mirror but then immediately look away because i don't like what i see and it stresses me out, i also feel like people see me looking in the mirror and think something bad about me to themselves, if that makes sense, i might sound a little crazy but its true. when i open snapchat i make sure the camera is always pointed to the celling so i don't have to look at my self, and hate taking pictures with all my being. when i do have to take pictures, ill look at them and i hate them so much to the point it sends me into a depressive episode. 

For me what i hate the most is my nose and my thumbs, i know weird but i have clubbed thumbs, and more recently my legs but nothing really affects me like my face. the one thing i feel like i can control is my hair, i make sure its done all the time, i rarely leave the house with my natural hair, or makeup for that matter, i cant it stresses me out. i hate going to school because of my appearance, i feel like everyone notices it and its all i think about. i find my self starting conversations that would lead to reassuring me about my appearance, like ""i look so bad today"" or ""My hair looks awful"" in hopes they will say ""you look fine"" or something along those lines. and even if they do say something the relief only lasts a little or something in he back of my head convinces me they are lying, or its a pity thing. 

sometimes i will look in the mirror alone and be happy but come back in an hour and hate the way i look, or love the way i look then go in public and feel bad about it. Like many of my piers i spend a lot of time on TikTok and instagram where i constantly compare myself to people, i also compare my self to people at school and just in the general public, i couldn't even tell you the last day i've gone without a negative thought running through my mind. it was probably during the summer when i stayed in my room and didn't have to see anyone. 

it makes me hate going to school and i cant enjoy anything there. its also hard to feel happy when you don't feel happy about your self and i often find my self feeling depressed with no motivation to do anything. it so draining. i seriously consider plastic surgery and have looked up prices, which are less expensive than my braces, and i often think to myself if i could trade in straight teeth for a straight nose i would do it in a heartbeat. 

i feel like ill never be truly happy and alone forever, i just hate myself.

so if you have any advice or think i have bdd please leave a comment, i just want to know whats wrong because i just wanna be happy you know. if you have literally any questions just leave them and ill be happy to answer.",15Dec2019,1

You know what’s really disgusting about hearing  “it gets better”? It’s the truth. But it’s a pathetically oversimplified truth.

Burns can worsen in degree, but imagine if they could do the reverse. So one day you have a third degree burn and the next day it’s second degree. Wow, it got better. You were in a lot of pain yesterday and now you’re still in a lot of pain today. Yay. :) 

When things get better in hell, you’re still in hell. Hearing that dumb af statement does not make me feel better or want to keep living.

I don't even know how I'm going to fucking get there because they've booked me in like two towns over from me and I dont drive, its bullshit. Theres so much uncertainty I hate it. 


The thing that fucks with me the most is that i know I need to do this and I. Am. Terrified. I don't want to do it. I want someone else to do it for me or my mum to write me a sick note so I dont have to go. But I'm just spiting myself if i dont force myself to do it.

140,"So they asked why I'm taking Abilify. I told them it was a mood stabilizer and they went, ""I don't think you need that, I don't think you have bipolar"". Except I go all hyper on antidepressants, even when I'm on a mood stabilizer. My doctor never told me I'm bipolar to be honest, though they mentioned cyclothymia once, not as a diagnosis but as a way of describing my behavior. Their words were: ""I think your behavior sounds much more cyclothymic now than before"". I think they suspect it alongside my aspergers. I don't think I have Aspergers to be honest though. Not that I think I have something else, I just don't think I have Aspergers. I've already asked my psychiatrist about my diagnosis, but they've been dismissive saying ""you need the mood stabilizer's for aspergers"".

I'm having a lot of brain fog and weight gain issues lately and can't really focus on anything right now. It's all too confusing and I want to quit meds. But then I remember I tend to get psychotic (self-referential). Is quitting my meds the right thing to do? (Meds because I also take Topamax and Trintellix, alongside Abilify). Or is my friend wrong there? They weren't close to me when my mood started to become all over the place. Our contact happens basically via text, when it does.

Anyway, I don't remember how I used to be anymore before meds, because I'm taking meds for three years already. So I don't know if the meds are helping (I do feel like a zombie though). And this, the lack of a diagnosis that makes sense and being questioned makes me think I should not be taking meds. 

Wait... I now remember I had an experience that like like erotomania before (though no one really believes me when I say that, they are really dismissive), and I had some mental breakdowns. But none of them are ""extreme enough"" for close friends to believe me. I think no one will really believe me until I do something stupid.",15Dec2019,1

Because of this I started censoring my emotions as to not cry that much and not let my father have this power over me. 

As a result I feel like I'm not in touch with my emotions. Most of the time it feels like I'm just guessing which response I logically should make when something happens and the only emotions I feel I genuinely have from time to time is happiness or anger. However, that's quite seldom.

A few days ago the love of my life left me. She has bipolar and borderline personality disorder, and is possible a sociopath.

I spent 4 years with this woman and we dated on and off and we fought constantly. She always made me feel like I had to prove myself to her and I didn’t walk away because I didn’t want to be alone, I didn’t want to have to find someone else and with time I ended up falling in love with her and I shouldn’t have. She treated me like garbage and had not the slightest damn expression of sympathy when she left. I asked her that we had been together for 4 years and she was just going to leave me like that, and she straight up told me, word for word “yea I’m an asshole, Hannah, but it’s not my problem” someone I took care of and put my heart and soul into and they just treat me as if it all meant nothing, when she meant everything to me.

I’ve been throwing up and dry heaving nonstop, I don’t have the motivation to eat or drink, I feel lost and hopeless, I don’t know what to do with my life or where to go from here. I know it was an abusive relationship but I grew to love it, I feel like I deserve it. I don’t feel like I deserve to be happy and in my mind no matter how she treated me, she still knew me and I didn’t have to explain myself to her and what I like, dislike, etc. I don’t want to have to explain everything to someone new again, I don’t want to fall in love again, I don’t want anyone else and now she’s gone forever and it’s the most soul crushing thing I’ve ever experienced, I hate this.

This year I began to stop caring about almost everything I do in my life for example with my grades having full marks doesn't make me feel anything but emptiness and responsibility like I can't go lower than full  because it feels like everyone expect  it from me my mom, my teachers and classmates.
I am a loner at school I only have one friend who isn't even in my class no one really talks to me and when I try to talk to others it just feels awkward and hard I either end up silent or ignored.
Yet when we get our grades everyone suddenly cares and if it's not high  they all keep saying how bad that is , maybe next time or I am surprised you didn't get it and stuff like that.
It makes me feel like everyone pays attention to how good I do and it feels like so much stress.
And when I go home I just get mom looking sad or somewhat disappointed. Sometimes  she would make a running joke about my grade or if I am feeling confident about a lesson brings up a time where I didn't get a full mark in it.
Or the teachers would keep saying how surprised they're and expect better next time , even if I don't see getting in the 90s or 80s out of 100 as that bad.
School , studying and exams just feel more like a responsibility to avoid disappointing everyone I didn't get a single full mark this year I know that my classmates probably don't care as much as Imgane it but I just can't stop it, and it's annoying me how I am not doing it for myself just out of fear from my mom first now it is even my classmates.

After my last SI I scared my mother and grandmother so bad that I told myself “I would never do that again!” That was 9 years ago; and I thought I had it under control. Little did I know the consequence of not getting help led to two divorces, broken family ties, and a years long continuance of depression. So on November 17th I cleaned my home at around 11:30 and I got up and took the train to my crisis center and said I need help! After a hospital stay visits with my psychiatrist, I’m currently in an outpatient program, which I believe is truly helping. The issue is the outpatient is Monday - Thursday, which leaves me vulnerable Fri- Sat. And when I tell you these weekends make me feel like shit; they make me feel like the entire world is going to come crashing down on me shit! And I cry and I think I have the help I need, but I tell myself I don’t and I become upset and manic then I find myself on the floor sad and depressed wishing I could stop the madness in my brain!

I developed an eating disorder 2.5 years ago and had a short recovery attempt just to learn that I had to switch high schools which made me relapse. I don’t want to tell any numbers but I was very sick. Switching schools (I went from a private one to a public school due to some issues with the school administration) really scarred me and although I did not realise it at first, a year later I started having a really hard time going to school. I could not pinpoint the issue but I physically could not force myself to go and would have tantrums/panic attacks when I was forced to go. I seeked comfort in food as I was deprived of it for so long but I was too scared to gain weight which made me develop bulimia. Right now I am on medication but none of the therapists I went to actually helped me resolve anything. I feel like I am stuck between two worlds as I miss my life and friends in my old school like crazy and although I do have friends jn my new school I do not really belong there. I just do not get many of the things they enjoy and this is not related to it being public or private, we simply have different opinions and ideas so I have to force myself to socialize and even when i do my best I know that %90 of my grade does not like me.

155,"In the world today, unhealthy options when eating are readily available to us and often it's harder to eat healthy than it is to choose the unhealthy options. However, there are many reasons to eat healthy and I wanted to focus on not only how this affects your physical health, but mental health too, something that doesn't get enough attention.

If you prefer to watch, here's a source video version of the benefits, and I've got the written summary below (in bullets to make it easier to read): [https://youtu.be/OJxulIjNz4E](https://youtu.be/OJxulIjNz4E)

**Weight Loss**

\- The most obvious reason to eat healthy is that it helps you lose weight if you eat a balanced diet

\- This can in turn also help reduce the chances of heart disease, poor bone density and some cancers

\- Eating whole vegetables and fruits will have a lower intake of calories than most processed foods, which is important for someone working to lose weight

\- In addition, Fiber is one element of a healthy diet that is particularly important for managing weight

**Health for Future Generations**

\- Many often don't care enough for themselves, but will go to great lenths to care for future generations, such as their kids and grandchildren

\- However, children learn health related behaviours from adults and specifically parents, so if you eat healthy, it's highly likely your children will pick up the same habits

\- Other benefits of eating healthy at home is children have been found to be less likely to eat out and sugary foods when they eat at home with family

\- In addition, children who participate in gardening and cooking at home are more likely to make healthful dietary and lifestyle choices as they are educated in healthy food

**Improve Mood**

\- Studies are regularly showing that there is a close relationship between diet and mood

\- For example, in 2016, researchers found that a diet with a high glycemic load may cause increased symptoms of depression and fatigue

\- This would be a diet that includes many refined carbohydrates, such as those found in soft drinks, cakes, white bread, and biscuits

\- ...whereas vegetables, whole fruit, and whole grains have a lower glycemic load, thus improving your mood

**Improve Memory**

\- Studies have shown that a healthy diet can help slow or even prevent dementia and cognitive decline

\- By including vitamins D, C, and E, omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids and polyphenols into your diet you will help improve your memory

\- The Mediterranean diet incorporates many of these nutrients and is well known for it's health benefits

\- But most diets where the focus is on balanced, natural and nutrious food will have similar benefits on your memory

158,"I have a friend with a very low quality of live who I think would really benefit from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. They show signs of AvPD and depression (obviously not my place to diagnose a friend but that's what I think). 

I brought up CBT as something different from talk therapy that they might like to try and they said it sounded interesting. But part of being avoident and not believing that they deserve or can be helped is that this person will probably never look for a therapist on their own. If they do go and try someone and they don't click they will never go again. I feel like there are one, maybe two shots at this and it has to be easy and go well. I know people have to be ready for therapy and I believe this person is but they will absolutely continue being miserable rather than seek help.

If I did the research on psychtoday and picked out a few people would it be inappropriate or be seen by the therapists as some kind of busy body behavior if I called and asked them a few questions like a patient normally would so I could present my friend with say, three good options to choose from? 

My friend hasn't been diagnosed with AvPD and finding people who treat that is hard. I would feel like an asshole bringing up my lay diagnosis but also it's an important consideration on how to approach this person. I'd love to know your thoughts.",15Dec2019,1

I often have very weird thoughts popping into my head, can't explain where from, can't explain what they are, not even to myself.

They are so bizarre and out of this world, it really makes me confused. 

I'm trying to figure out what this is but it's really hard to explain.

This isn't really related but thought I'd put it here anyway; Sometime's I can smell scents that shouldn't be there.

He is diagnosed with depression and OCD but has refused to be medicated since 2007, and he has extreme anger issues off his meds.

166,"I just learned that after you have been a stressed out adult long enough your brain will protect itself by maintaining a constant state of some level of anxiety to prevent huge shifts in your emotional state. So when you try to relax you still feel that sense of urgency and worry. At that point trying to fight it will just result in a tug of war inside and stress yourself out even more. 

I've been wondering if binaural beats and hypnosis could be the key to tricking my brain into a calmer resting state. On YouTube there are videos for guided hypnosis that do different things. Binaural beats are supposed to help shift your brains frequency to a calm, euphoric, meditative or focused state. It's supposed to help with sleep, anxiety, depression and give motivation. This sounds way more promising that just listening to simple ""relaxing music."" Because if I'm understanding these definitions correctly your brain doesn't have much of a choice wjen you use hypnosis and binaural beats.",15Dec2019,1

169,"I was with a woman for almost 4 years, she would have complete breakdowns, hit me, verbally put me down, but i'd stand by her through all of it, then she'd apologize and cry, and I of course forgave her.. She was after all sick..   
And no matter how much I did, if we were out doing stuff 2 weekends in a row, and I just wanted to actually recuperate from work the 3rd, she'd complain that I never want to do anything, no matter how much I tried.  
I had depressive episodes on and off before her, but I could manage it with working out and hanging out with people that gave me positive vibes, but she made it MUCH worse.  


After a while I just lost all my energy to do anything, I didn't even have energy to call my mom after work, I just wanted to sleep all the damned time.

While she sat at home during the days, getting bored, then getting mad at me for not having any energy after work.

This resulted in me having so much anxiety over going to work that I literally threw up each morning, ending up in ruptured blood vessels and throwing up blood. 

So I was put on sick leave, but instead I was expected to work my ass off to please her, when I barely had the will to get out of bed.  
I lost all interest in having sex with her, it became a chore, and I felt so shitty about it... Because I loved her with all my fucking heart.

I was a fucking shell.

Then I started to get better, getting my energy back, and she rips the rug from under my feet, she broke up... After all i've sacrificed to make it work.

Then she moved on QUICK.  


Generally I feel better, I have more energy, I actually talk to my friends and family again, most days i'm pretty satisfied actually.

Yet, when I get reminded of her, I get this gigantic burning lump in my stomach, I start shaking and feel like a bag of wet garbage.. I feel betrayed.

WHY?! Why can't I just move on, and be happy that i'm on my way back to having an actual life?

I don't want to be this whiny mess, I don't want to miss her, I don't know why I do, because even though we had a lot of good times, they definitely don't outweigh the bad.

I shouldn't miss her, I shouldn't care about her at all...

170,"It started when I was in grade 8, I would steal money from my parents I stole nearly 800 dollars over the course of a few months. I loved to steal when I was really nearby them, like in direct view. When they wouldn't notice me stealing even in such a obvious way it would make me feel almost high. They caught me once I stole nearly every bill from his wallet a day after he filled it. Once they caught me it made it harder for me to get my fix. We went to Canadian tire and I stole a multi-tool. Walking through the doors I was so scared of the alarm going off. It made my legs feel like noodles. But when I made it through it was the same high as before. I continued stealing money from them on a much smaller level for a short while but started to hate myself so I stopped. I went nearly a year without stealing things until grade 10. I was getting into drugs and I would raid all my parents rooms trying to find new types of drugs. I stole Oxy, codeine, antidepressants you name it. I stole bottles and bottles of wine. But I didn't know what to do with the empty bottles. They searched my room and found everything. That was 4 months ago. They keep me on a tight leash now after all my offenses. But my school is near various stores. I go out with friends and steal things from them on a weekly basis. Rotating stores every week so as not to get caught. I'm not a hardened criminal, I just steal candy bars and maybe some bottles of cough medicine every now and then. Yes I know I need some serious mental help. I've tried to kill myself multiple times. But I've always managed to clean up after all my attempts. Never got caught. My parents are the type to yell at you if you said you were depressed, like : ""What is all the food we buy for you not enough?!"", My dad doesn't even think depression is real. This is a throwaway account obviously. And no I'm not suicidal right now. Stealing is enough to keep it at bay.",15Dec2019,1

This led to a very bad mental tick whereby I’m constantly fixated on identifying the worst possible thing I could think in any given situation. With my family, it’s incest. With any POC in the picture, it’s a terrible racial slur. I never had any thoughts like this at all before this happened ... it’s so far from who I am that it causes me absolute agony. It can only be explained as a masochistic impulse. I’ve never told anyone about this because I’m so ashamed, but it’s fucking killing me. It’s making it so that I’m not sure I want to live anymore, because I don’t think I’m doing a tremendous amount of good here and I’m so scared it could get worse and I could start being hurtful to people out loud.

Maybe how and why you did it, how your relationship with your family was and is now. Did it make you feel better or do you regret it it any way? Do you miss them or is your chosen family better than they ever were?

I’m a non-drinker due to anxiety, and I got ‘drunk’ on my wedding day. I had a great day, but I beat myself up so bad for drinking too much (multiple people I trust have said I was fine and I wasn’t wasted or anything) but my guilt ruined the beginning of my small honeymoon. 
We then got home from honeymoon to find my cat almost dead. £2,000 and days of tears later she seems to be on the mend, but my nerves are ruined now and I find it hard leaving the house.
My sister-in-law then passed away after a long illness, and my husband is a shell of a person (understandably) and I’m trying to keep the house in order while helping him recover all while watching my cats every movement. 
I’m due back to work this week, which I think will be good to have a routine again but I’m terrified of leaving my husband and cat. 
I made a doctors appointment for Friday (not with my normal doctor) and I don’t know how to approach the subject. I take anti-anxiety meds but for migraines. My anxiety is insane. I don’t even know if anything can be done. I’m just scared they will say it’s ‘situational’ or because I’m on these meds that help my migraines I can’t take anything else for anxiety.

It's been a tough few months. I'm going through lot's of depressive cycles, my energy has been so low that I'm falling behind in school and I can't afford to fail but everything is too overwhelming to do.
my boyfriend just broke up with me which of course made my mood even worse and it's been hard to cope.
I've also been realising that maybe I have another problem, maybe it's sillier, but it's something I've been noticing. My thoughts about food are becoming troubling.
I've never been fat, but I've always perceived myself as that and I hide my body a whole lot. It's been like this for years, but now I've lost a bunch of weight and people around me keep telling me how skinny I am and how they think I'm anorexic and I'm so sorry to worry them but I look in the mirror and I don't see myself as small at all.
However I'm reflecting on what people have told me, and I've considered that maybe part of why I always feel tired might be because I'm not eating enough. There's surely other reasons like my tendency to be depressed, but it has been worse than ever so maybe it's also that I'm not fueling my body enough.
I want to be strong and productive and energetic and to be able to achieve my goals and overcome my struggles, but the idea of going through a weight gain, even a healthy one, gives me lots of anxiety.
I just wish I could stop hating on myself and feeling worried like hell every single time I have a meal. I'm really really tired. I can't go on like this.
