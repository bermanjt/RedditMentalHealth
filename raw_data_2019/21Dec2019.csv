* When it is someone's birthday, I cannot say the words ""**Happy Birthday**"" I find a way to let them know that I haven't forgotten or just don't know what occasion it is. Or during a holiday of some kind, I cannot vocally wish anyone a ""Happy \[Insert Holiday of Choice Here\]"".

* I cannot say ""**I Love You**"" to anyone other than a significant other. (With family I can say ""Love you too"" as a reply, but it has to be said quickly) but when a friend or someone says it platonically to me I have to come up with a way around replying. Either come up with a Joke, or laugh it off.

3,"Hey folks!

So first off, I never thought i would be writing anything about my mental health or anything but seriously, ive been through some rough years (in my opinion) and for what its worth i just want to ventilate. Im also sure that some of you reading this will think that my problems are not relevant but that matters little to me. But, who knows, it might help me in some small way. If anyone has had similar experiences I would LOVE to hear from you.

I grew up in the absolute best way possible in a very very safe and beautiful suburb to Stockholm, Sweden. I lived in a house with my mother father and brother and from what i can remember ive only heard my parents arguing once (right after they decided to get a divorce when i was 18). So its an understatement to say that I have been insanely priveleged compared to many people in this world. I can't say that I have any traumatic moments in my life but I still feel completely empty when i wake up each morning. Then again i've had my heart broken more times than I would like to have had. 

Right now in my life absolutely NOTHING is going on. I currently have no job, no education (chose to work after the swedish studies that are more or less mandatory) and ofc no girlfriend. You can say that ive been educated by working but since that work has been 10 years of ""sales"", which I really dont want to do any more, I wouldnt count it. 

And i think that its this that is really bugging me, the part where nothing is happening and I have 0 ideas about what I should do and where I fit in. Ive allways been a very social and outgoing person, just not when it comes to my feelings. Ive never had a problem with getting friends or relationship partners, yes ive been a real ""fuckboy"" in my past and that is something i really dont want to be recognized with anymore, but ive allways struggled insanely much with not knowing what to say when my girlfriend or anyone i care for asks how i feel about a hard subject. I tend to just go in to silent mode when i cant find the words. 

Ive never spoken to a psychiatrist about my well beeing and to be honest ive allways tried to make sense of shit in my head by myself or, you know, adding a question i need awnsering into a serious joke or something like that. 

I had to delete like 20 rows of text here since it got way off topic. 

  
My real problem is this:   
I have never acctually completed anything ive set my mind to. Except maybe for some things in the gaming world which has been my emotional retreat when i dont want to think about my life or my responsibilitys. Ive allways given up on stuff wether it is a relationship that ended without me getting proper closure, me asking the things that I really want awnsered or just building myself up through education. I cant say that i have been sad in my life until these last 3-4 years where its just been heartbreak after dissapointment after hearthbreak.   
For example in 2017 i thought i met the love of my life and 1,5 years later she dumped me with the reason ""I feel you have to take care of our relationship too much"" (which i really really didn't have to she was the most low maintanance girlfriend i've ever had) and then she just walked away while i fel into a big pile of crying man on the floor. I still haven't met her since that day since she dont wants to see me. I got up from that and about 6 months later i met a new girl. I dont like to think of myself as handsome or anything like that, even though people say i am, but this girl was something else and from what i could tell, she liked me. She had the beauty, the brains and the sense of humor that you just dont find every day. She had worked as a model in london for about 5 years and then went home to sweden to study to become a teacher (i mean how the hell can anyone live up to that? beautiful, smart and kind?!). So I ofcourse fell head over heels in love with this girl. We kept it pretty casual, well in my head it wasn't but i tried to maintain a facade since i just got dumped, and dated for maybe 10 weeks or so up til christmas that year. After the hollidays i got a text from her saying ""I dont want to be an ass so i should tell you that i hooked up with an old ""squeeze"" when i was home for the holidays"". This made me feel like the things we had shared was put to absolutely nothing but I couldnt really blame her since we were not a couple and had no real obligations to eachother, really i wanted to say that she fucking hurt me by doing that, but i settled on saying ""i cant blame you since we are not together"". We stopped seeing eachother for some time but some weeks later when she drunk texted me i couldn't really say no and we started it up agian. After some time i decided to tell her how i accually felt and that did not go down as I planned. I just got the reply ""I like you but not that much"". This time i was acctually devestated. This happened in like mid 2018 and I still haven't really gotten over it, if I ever will i dont know. This girl was just something else and i felt that when we hung out I was acctually really really happy for the first time in my life. But to have that feeling that i felt SO true just swept away really knocked me on my ass and I still dont know what the fuck to do about it. What acctually hurt most is that she reduced me to a fuckboy which was something I was really trying to avoid. 

Im getting tired of my own story here but i havent been able to get out of my long ongoing funk and i have no idea how to. I just feel like these past couple of years are just let downs. Usually ""life is ups and downs"" but i haven't had a glimmer of happiness in my head over these years. I realized this after the breakup situation in 2018, when i went out with my friends for beer and my oldest friend called me the next day and said ""ive never seen you this sad and/or low in your whole life"". This really hit me since im allways the happy guy who is glad to see you and wants to know whats going on but lately.. i just dont care about shit, cry almost every day with the feeling of going nowhere and i barely have enough money to feed myself. 

I dont know if this is to any help for anyone having it rough, i dont know if this will help me even, but i just felt like posting my worthless story to ppl who have no idea who i am. Im absolutely not even thinking about suicide, that is not in my vocabulary, but i just want to feel. Maybe not happiness but i want to feel anything but sad and let down by my own actions or maybe the lack of my actions.",21Dec2019,1

My younger brother (M 19) recently graduated high school and has suffered from multiple panic attacks. He saw a therapist for a while but was not diagnosed with any official anxiety disorders. He has always been emotionally distant and has always been hesitant to connect with me or my other siblings. He was supposed to go to Uni but has decided to take a break after his episodes/breakdown and stay with my parents. I (M 23) do not visit often as I live on the other side of the world and despite my efforts to keep in touch, I am unable to get him to open up. My mother has noticed a lot of changes in his behavior after his episodes, he started isolating himself even more than before. He only stays in the house and never leaves. He has lost contact with the few friends that he had before. He can’t handle any loud noises and gets irritated very easily. He refuses to apply for jobs and avoids any progress in his professional life (apply, take exams, look for colleges) and only prefers to stay at home. We are not sure how to help him get his life back on track and are very wary as we do not want the panic attacks to return or pressure him into doing anything. I can’t imagine how he must feel, and I have no idea how to behave in his presence once I get back home.

I have been thinking of getting him a book that would help him understand what he is going through and answer any questions that he might have or how he should move on with his life. However, I’m not sure whether it would be wise to talk about this at all or not. I love my brother very much and I do not know what I can do to help him or make him feel better.

I would really appreciate it if you guys/girls could tell me how you felt, how I should approach him and what I can do to help him get out of the dark hole that he is in and pick up the pieces of his life again.",21Dec2019,1

6,"I'm 18 at the moment, in 2 months time I will be 19. As of now I currently am not studying or working. I live in a disfunctional home comprised of my sister, mother, grandmother and me (a man). My mother and father got divorced when I was 13. At the time I didn't take it that hard, at least on the surface. But a year later, what I now realise, the only real man in my life, that I actually admired and loved for the man that he was (my grandfather) died. While I was on vacation. Ever since then my self identity and in general, mental health and love for life, has been slipping away. Now I find myself finally realising that I never learned how to be a man. How to love myself as a man. How to FUNCTION as a man. Don't get me wrong ... I'm a very spiritual person, I believe that being a man or woman does not change the fact that deep down we are all human beings that seek only two basic, shared, fundamental, things from life. Security and love. However I still believe that each gender has it's specific biological and most importantly SPIRITUAL differences that must be developed naturally and with understanding. What I'm trying to say is, I believe that there is a reason each of us was born either as man or woman. And that we must fulfill the roles we were given too satisfy the needs of our individual souls. All this to say... In my whole life I've never had a real male role model. And the one that I had left me when I was in the crucial part of developing my male and general self identity. I feel lost in a world that encourages me to denounce my biological self. With nobody to guide me I find myself in a home divided by hate, and by lack of will and depression I find that I have let myself drown in that aura of desperation. Without a guide in my life I find myself going down paths (drugs, alcohol, unresponsible sex) in search of answers that I can not create my self since I have not experienced life enough to be wise enough to know my path through this haze of misconceptions and illusions. In the end I realise I am at a point where I indulge in everything that separates me from my pain, my un-knowigness, my confusion and in the end, my fear of not knowing what to do with my life.. So I sit here with a bottle in my hand, wondering if I myself am enough to survive my life. I just hope that if there is anyone else that feels this way about themselves knows that this is not their fault, but rather the cards they have been personally delt, as well as the cards society has given them. I love all of you, man or woman, I hope you find your true identity as an individual one day, solidify it, become certain of your role and find happiness in life whatever it may be for you.",21Dec2019,1
7,"I've always been one. For as long as I can remember. I knew it was a problem, but when caught I'd get defensive and blaimed other people.
I have recently got caught in a few lies from my partner. She is out of this world amazing. I may be losing her because of these lies. I since have immediately haulted my life. 
First thing I did was admitting I had a problem. I called everyone. Family and friends.  Everyone knew I had a problem. Just not to the extent it was. I am now in counseling, seeking proper help to once and for all eliminate this disgusting trait. It's a mental illness(I hate calling it that), but it is. I have always thought lying isn't a terrible thing. I always thought cheating on a significant other was horrible and non forgivable, but I realize with the help of my counsellor lying is cheating. I've been cheating life with fabricated stories. This has to come to an end. Lying cannot be a part of my life anymore. 
Now my partner, she is as I said amazing. We are best friends and soulmates. She's pissed and we are separated at the moment. I am still at the house(because we have a child together), we arent sleeping in the same bed though. She is unsure if she can ever trust me again. She's said she loves me, wants to see us back together, but I have this anxious and negative feeling all the time that she won't forgive me and move on.

12,"Hey, 22 y/o female college graduate. Just wanted to share my experiences here today. I do not expect people to give answers and or even respond. Guess I just want these things in my head to get out somewhere.
Anyway, i just finished my Bachelor's in Studio Art. It was a stressful process due to unsupportive professors, an emotionally abusive classmate and medical issues. Since I was 14 I suffered from depression, general anxiety disorder and prolactinoma. I also have congenital heart disease to top it all off; that is compensated, but the horror stories I was told from my surgeries still spook me. 
I am currently working as a gallery attendant at my city's art museum. I have been visiting this place my whole life and loved it. When I took the job I figured I would be making an impact and working my way into the world of art. 
I quickly realized how corrupt this museum is. The gallery attendants are all treated like trash, in some cases through racism and sexism. The museum itself is run by many selfish administrators who don't even consider the safety of the artwork. We could be fired for doing our job in some cases- if a donor comes into the museum, we cannot even ask them to be mindful of the art. 
Since taking this job and still feeling the burns of my four years struggling to keep myself together in college, I have grown to feel hopeless. Unfortunately, some of the politics of my job are just how the museum scene operates. Afterall, the world works via money and these are rich CEOs I am talking about. You think they even understand the emotion behind an artwork that speaks of the societal impact of slavery/racism and how it can be conveyed through landscape paintings? Just an example related to our current temporary exhibition showing landscape paintings and how they speak of 19th Century Acadia.
When I am not working at the museum, I come home and play FFXIV with friends. The story is great and I play it with old friends who are states away. My family makes remarks about me playing it everyday, like complaining that I would hog the TV to play it, which I do not do. I will admit I play it a lot and I think my desire to play it is more than just for entertainment. Cat Quietus (the name is sort of a meme of myself between me and my friends) is an Au Ra black mage, ninja, astrologian and the Warrior of Light. She is not ill in anyway, and she is no one's doormat. She lives a fulfilling, adventurous life while making an impact on the world. I think about the way I made my character and how invested I am in the game. Sometimes I wish I could do a hard reset and not be me. Not deal with the life I am given or the body I have. I do not want to the useless, hopeless college graduate who is too anxious to even draw something and feel like it is worth not tesring up. 

Well if you got this far, thanks for reading. I am in no way promoting escapism as a way to deal with mental/emotional issues. This is just me describing my situation.",21Dec2019,1

When I was 17/18 I met a guy in college. I had absolutely no attraction towards him at all. Before I had no one ever show interest in me so when he did I felt nice. And I was just becoming to come out of my shell and my confidence in myself was starting to grow.
I had never had a boyfriend before and so I thought that attraction grew over time and so I went for a few coffees with him to see how it went. 

Second coffee with him he began to show me who he was. He talked about how he masturbated 5 or 6 times a day. About how good it felt. What porn he watched. While he talked about this i sat in complete silence and in utter embarrassment of what was being said. He talked in a quiet voice so that no one else in the cafe could hear but me. It was eerie, creepy but for some reason I stuck with him. He would ask how often I masturbated and what I liked to watch and I couldn't ever answer. I would laughed awkwardly and say ""you don't want to know!""
I actually have a very low low sex drive and sex and masturbation is not part of my daily routine let's just say.

Third coffee in he said ""I am in this for long run"". Meaning he wanted me to be in his life forever. At this point I felt very trapped. We were in the same class and he would always make me sit in the corner with him so that he could sit and talk about masturbation. This just become what I went through each week. It was just part of my life now.

He would come around to my home. We would sit on my bed and he would put his arms around me and touch my thigh. His lips were so close to my ear I could, hear, his smile and his breath. He moved his hand in between my legs and I felt so bad but this is what couples did, right?

After he went home he texted me to say how sexy I was and that he plans to think of me while he masturbates tonight. I just think back to how frozen I was in that moment when he had his hand between my legs and how bad I felt. My face said nothing but discomfort and eagerness to get away but I just sat there.

A month after that I texted him and said I didn't want to be with him. I cried so hard that night. I cried because I knew I would have to face him every day in class. He sent a text the next morning saying ""I was going to tell you to go fuck yourself but I woke up this morning realising how free I am, and you are just not the girl for me"". 

He bullied me relentlessly. Sent me photos of dead animals. Links to people getting their heads chopped off with big knives. I just kept silent until the year ended. I felt, rotten. I felt so disgusting. Shameful. 

Only now I know that he was a Psychopathic masturbation addict and I escaped. 

My family and friends know the basic outline of that we ""dated"" and that we just didn't work out.

I felt that my parents would be too embarrassed about one of their children commuting suicide. 
I am halfway though freshman year, and we had a presentation about teenage depression. I noticed that most of the signs fit me completely.
I want to get help because I can feel that I’m digging myself into a hole again. But my mom doesn’t believe in mental illness, and my dad thinks I’m weak if I have any problems.
How do I get help from my parents or at least friends. I think I might attempt again and it’s getting really hard to thinks and wake up in the morning. I’m getting so tired and now I can’t stop scratching my skin off. I’m scared that I will be thrown into a mental asylum, that my mom won’t think I’m telling the truth.

Hey loves! This is for anyone who suffers from any mental illness. If you are willing, I would love for you to message me and inform me on you, your life, and your battle. How it affects you daily? What you want other people to know about your mental illness? Etc. I’m working on this blog for all mental illnesses. However, I only have depression and anxiety and don’t really know much more about than other than I was diagnosed. I would love to learn more about not only these illnesses, but all the others as well. Much love! &lt;3",21Dec2019,1
33,"I don’t think many people will read this but I just wanted to reflect on how far I’ve come and what I’ve learned. 

About 5 years ago, I attempted suicide around this time of year. I was in so much pain and felt that life wasn’t worth living. Today, I’ve grown into a completely different person. I still have days where I struggle, but I know that the pain will pass. I used to self-harm and for the longest time I would cover up my scars. Now, I show them freely and without embarrassment. 

Life has thrown many obstacles my way over the years. As a young child I was molested which led to years of poor mental health. I was sexually assaulted and my dad was diagnosed with cancer when I was a teenager. I was diagnosed with OCD and depression and lost many loved ones these past few years. 

I wish these things never happened but I believe they’ve shaped me into the person I am today. A strong, independent, and determined woman.

I have an amazing life now and am so thankful I’m still here on this earth. If my suicide attempt was successful 5 years ago, I wouldn’t be here to experience the life I have today. I’m with the love of my life, have a child on the way, and a job I love (sometimes lol). 

The reason for this post was not only for me to reflect on how far I’ve come, but to also tell those of you struggling that there is hope. Life is hard and some days it feels impossible to go on. You may feel that you don’t matter or that your life has no purpose but it does! Whether you believe it or not, you were put on this earth for a reason and you deserve to find your purpose, so don’t give up. Reaching out for help is one of the hardest things you’ll ever have to do but it’s so so sooo worth it. Getting better takes time and it’s truly a life-long commitment but eventually you’ll thank yourself for taking that step. 

I know this was sorta cheesy but I wish I could’ve read more things like this when I was at my lowest point. Struggling with your mental health is terrifying and can make you feel so alone but it doesn’t have to be that way! Taking the steps to get better is extremely difficult. I went to 3 therapists before I found the right fit and had to try 2 different medications/medication combinations before I started Lexapro but it was so worth it :)",21Dec2019,1

35,"Hello,

This is my first time ever posting on reddit, so excuse me if i'm doing something wrong.

I am severely depressed, i never open up to anyone so noone knows i'm dealing with this, hence i'm posting this on reddit as a way of venting. Ever since i remember being alive i haven't been able to remember a time where i was truly happy, of course i have been happy at moments, but i can't seem to remember a period in my life where i have been feeling well consistently. 

Till this day i still haven't found an answer as to why i am not able to stay motivated or happy. I can't seem to understand why i keep ending up in the constant loop of sadness, anxiety and depression. I have really good friends, genuine good friends with kind hearts, the best i've ever had, i'm going to college, my general situation has been getting better each year and i've been maturing a lot these past years, but for some reason it feels like the feeling is haunting me. The pain in my chest, the random mood swings, the mental breakdowns that come and go, the sudden change of behavior, zoning out and coming to the realisation that nothing matters, it all just seems like it's a part of me. I have been putting a lot of thought as to why i keep falling back to this spiral, but i can't seem to find an answer. Even if i continue my hobbys, even if i hang out a lot with good friends, at the end of the day, when i get back home, i always seem to feel alone and worthless, and i hate it. I despise it.

When i think back of my trauma's it doesn't feel like that's the reason. I've already put a lot of thought into them and since a year or two i've accepted my past and that's why i've matured. I am trying to find an answer, i want to be happy. 

I do not seek pity, i just seek advice.

I couldn't move for about eight minutes. It's like-- if you've ever tried to hurt yourself, but your body shut down and wouldn't let you make the movement. I knew I could do it if I tried because physically, I'm fine, but I just couldn't.

41,"I have been thinking about my mental health and am really unsure whether it’s healthy or not. The biggest question to me is, even if I’m mentally unhealthy, how do I start? 

I am assuming that there are underlying issues inside of me which don’t seem too obvious to others but whenever I have a conversation with myself or find myself alone, I notice how I have “issues”. These issues have a very weird range; some are related to my education and profession, some are family + relationship, some are just pondering over whether this mental instability lies in the genes/runs in the family. 

I haven’t faced anything serious (yet). By that, what I mean is I have never contemplated self-harm, or done anything wrong which seems to be triggered due to mental health. I do have a very big problem of not lingering too much on things which make me sad/angry/agitated. But I do feel those emotions when I’m with my own thoughts, if they happen to appear at that moment. 

I have always wanted to talk with someone, preferably professional but at this point I’m not choosy. I feel like just talking my head out continuously with someone and maybe they can help me evaluate what’s wrong. I have so many questions that I’m also unsure if it’s possible to even sort this out.

42,"(19M). 

For as long as I can remember, I would suppress any feelings of empathy to justify my own selfishness. Recently I decided that I no longer wanted to be selfish jerk I had been for years. The first step I took for that was trying to be much more empathetic. I’m doing this I try to picture how I would feel in a given situation before making any judgement. This works very well for me in terms of being more compassionate and understanding; however, a problem that has arisen is that I have been feeling too much with regard to empathy. It’s like a huge flood of emotions just hit me like a bus. Before I would relish in the blissful emotional numbness of suppressed empathy, now these new emotions have been taking a physical toll on me. I find my self constantly anxious, feeling terrible about everything going on in the world, wanting to throw up, etc.... even worse sometimes it’s like my heart starts beating out of its chest and I can’t sleep.

My cousin told me I’m showing signs of OCD (I don’t think you can develop OCD so Im throwing this in here just in case.) 

Which made me look closer at my habits; here’s one for example,

Once I get into the bathroom, before taking a shower I have to open my bathroom door and look at my bedroom door 3 times. Can’t take a shower without it, don’t even try.

Have to make sure all doors are closed. If any door is open and I know it, it makes me very nervous and uncomfortable.

I’ve been constantly worrying about my heath for seemingly no reason I’m always worried about SOMETHING. Worried I’m going to die from something. Slight stomach ache, probably cancer. I know I sound jocular, but I’m tired of it. I’m so stressed about my well being all the time. I’m afraid to get a headache because I might think it’s my demise.

I count seemingly random things. To name a few, how many cigarettes my cousin smoked today(0), how many he’s smoked all week(6), how many eggs I’ve used all month(22), how many eggs my cousin has used all month(4), how many times I’ve seen baseketball(33) soon to be 34 when I watch it when I get home. That last one is more funny but yeah lately I’ve seen that movie every day for the past 33 days lol

I’m honestly more concerned with the worrying about my health ALL THE TIME. It’s exhausting. The thing that made me make this post was last night before I fell asleep.


I was laying down I had YouTube on and I was on the couch. I closed my eyes and my usual, “your stomach feels bloated, You might die tonight but at least you’ll be asleep.” But then it switched. I lost control over it in a way. It changed to “this is all too much, just kill yourself. It’s not worth it. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes you happy. Shoot yourself in your closet” it just kept going. I could feel it physically in my head, like a radiant darkness expanding in my head. Then it was over about 2 minutes of zero control brain weirdness. So I felt the requirement to post this to see if I should find someone to help me. Maybe I’m just over reacting as well from stress.


So please let me know if you guys have any suggestions. I don’t really want to ask my parents to have me see psychiatrist, I just don’t want to add more to the family web of problems.",21Dec2019,1

49,"This was mostly meant to be a way of collecting my thoughts and emotions, but I’ll be very happy for any advice on getting out of my massive self pity.

TL;DR: my life is pretty much perfect, except for not having a love life, which makes me feel inadequate. I also really don’t want to live alone.

I (m21) am a student on one of the more prestigious programs in my country. I have always breezed through school, and I have never had to put in much effort in order to pass exams or tests with good results. As far as jobs an finance goes, I have never had to worry, and I probably won’t ever have to. I have a loving family with no significant medical issues currently. I also have many amazing friends. My main hobbies are playing musical instruments, alpine skiing and mountain biking, but I have many other hobbies as well, both sedentary and active, individual and social. Sounds like a pretty awesome life, right?

So why do I feel like shit more than half the time?
I know it’s normal to have bad days every now and then, but the frequency and intensity of these bad feelings are taking its toll on my sleep.  For the past two years I have had problems with insomnia.

It has been like this since my ex broke up with me after being long-distance for a while. We were on-and-off for a while, but ultimately we decided it wasn’t working out, and neither of us felt happy  trying to mend a broken relationship. I was sad; we had been together for years, but felt like i had gotten over it after a couple of months. 

Since then I have tried getting back into dating. I’ve asked girls out, getting rejected every single time. That is, until this summer. A girl i worked with (I know, risky)said yes! I had a great time hanging out with her. We dated until school began again, as she goes to a different university. I wanted to try long distance, but after two weeks or so she decided she didn’t want that. Which I think is completely fair.

However, after that my mental health began spiraling. I thought I would get over her quickly, as it was a short relationship. I don’t really think I have yet. Add the sexual frustration a 21 year old male with high sex drive feels after not having sex for almost two years, just starting to get hopes up for some again only to have no chance again, and you have a recipe for disaster.

The feelings of despair from being rejected generalized this time, spiraling into something like “There is no one out there for me. I can never truly be loved”, which part of me knows is a stupid and destructive way of thinking. But, seeing as only two girls have ever shown interest in me, resulting in both of them breaking my heart, I find it all too easy to fall into this destructive mindset.

I don’t really understand why I have such bad luck with romance either. My looks are okay, and I work out and take care of my body. As for personality, I quite like mine, and so do my friends. I’ve been told I am very fun to hang out with, and I am outgoing and easy to talk to. Most people quickly warm up to me, and from what I can see enjoy my company. My friends say they feel very safe with me, and some of them come to me when the feel vulnerable to seek advice, a comforting hug or a pat on the back. My pool of friends is very diverse, but i really care a lot about each and every one of them. I actively express my affection for them, both by words, hugs or helping them out with whatever if can spare the time.

Even though I have many great traits, romance just doesn’t to go my way. I have everything else figured out, but for some reason I can’t have love. 

My biggest fear in life is ending up lonely, and it feels like that’s where I am headed. An empty house with no one waiting for me to come home, and no one for me to wait for.

Bottom line is, I don’t feel good enough.",21Dec2019,1

54,"Hello there. 

During elementary school I was diagnosed with Anxiety and OCD. I have always had this condition which I have been stigmatized for by my own parents and siblings where my mind would put me into panic mode for hours, sometimes days at a time. These kinds of events would be triggered by watching a scary movie, reading a scary story, or seeing something else scary. My mind would replay it over and over again and I get in a fight or flight mode where I'm looking over my shoulders and something as simple as my dog barking or coughing shoots adrenaline through my entire body. 

For this reason I'm terrified to go to my own basement alone. I always have a dog follow me just in case and I'm in and out as fast as I can, checking my corners and quite seriously running, because the monster I saw in that movie is hiding in the corner of that room and as long as I can get in and out without looking at it we're good. At night time I can become particularly uneasy, and I will lay in my bed watching out my window and looking at my door, not closing my eyes.

This doesn't just stop at the basement, it can be anywhere. In my room, outside when it's dark and I'm getting in my car for work, when I'm alone in the dark at night, etc.

I understand the things that I am afraid of are not real and my mind is preparing itself for a threat that doesn't exist by imagining whatever scary thing it is sitting in the corner waiting for me, but nevertheless I am still terrified. I have had long stretches of time where I have not had a single episode, but typically when I have one episode, it's never just one. I'll be on edge one night, fine throughout the entire next day, and then on edge again for another night until I suddenly just stop and go back to normal. I don't hear voices, hurt myself, or see things (although I thought I used to see shadow figures).

I brought this up to my psychiatrist when I used to see her about 10 years ago, and she shrugged it off telling me it was just anxiety. I guess i'm just wondering if this is really anxiety, or if I have some kind of undiagnosed mental disorder.",21Dec2019,1
55,"Hello redditors. I want to ask you something:

I don't know where to start. Please accept my apologies if you find this text fragmented. I just can't put my mind together. Sorry about that.

First of all, I'm 24 and male. I was living in a touristic, secular by constution but muslim majority place, in northern hemisphere. I've never had too many friends in my life. and for the last 2-3 years, I got no friends except my girlfriend (she is asian, came to my country for education). I'm kinda introverted and shy person. I find it weird to talk to people just to be/make friends. I can only talk them in a diplomatic and professional way.

3 months ago, I came to the north of the UK for PhD education. After I came here, some problems had started such as:
* Can't sleep at night. (chronic insomnia?)
* Can't sleep well and enough.
* Broken sleep cycle.

And as alcohol drinks are expensive in my home country, I found myself drinking every day after I moved here. Good thing is, I don't drink high alcoholic drinks such as whiskey or vodka. Only 3x650ml beers or one 750ml bottle of wine or champagne. But the bad thing is, I started to drink every day and a couple of days ago started to feel bugs crawling on me and started to hear sudden clicking or cracking sounds when I try to sleep. As I know these are side effects of alcohol withdrawal, I thought I need to drink less. Is it possible to develop alcoholism in 3 months only with low alcohol drinks? Also I've experienced hearing voices of people I know (such as mother, sister, cousin etc.) when I'm too tired or depressed. But these were the sentences they used throughout the day. E.g. ""haha, she said this to you?"" or ""hey, dinner is ready"" etc.

Another problem is, I haven't communicate a person truly for the last 3 months. I only talked to receptionist of where I stay at and pizza delivery guy. And these were ""can I get my package?"" or ""Thanks for delivery"". I'm not in search of any friends or whatsoever, but I guess social isolation drives me into mental health problems. Because I started to think deeply on unnecessary things. For example I was devastated for reading a sad story about ""a normal child falls on his head and began to continue his life as a handicapped person"" on a social website. I thought this for like maybe one week. After that, suddenly I started to think about women's virginity. I really don't know where this idea came from. All of a sudden a woman's virginity became important for me. It's really surprising that I have no idea why I started to think like this. I have had sex with my gf and virginity and other things were not important for me. In short words, I started to think obsessively on unnecessary things. I hope I could explain what I'm trying to say. Please excuse me as English is not my mother tongue. Please ask me for elaborate things that is not clear enough.

And now, I need to start writing a 10 page paper after I read a 700ish pages of a book. But all I do is playing video games and eating pizza and not going out unless it's needed (market, bank etc.). I can't rescue myself out of this loop.

What, do you think, is happening to me? I'm suspecting there are the indicators of a mental health problem? And please note that I'm not a muslim or raised with muslim values or whatsoever. My family is a non-muslim, open-minded, european-like family. I've always been in good schools with a good GPA. As you can see, I've rushed everything a little bit and started a PhD in my 24 (actually I started a PhD in my country when I'm 22). I wouldn't call myself ""rich"" but I have never been in economical hardness, a classical white mid-class.

Please help me. I want to understand what is happening to me.",21Dec2019,1

57,"I've always tried to avoid talking about my problems. I have a feeling if I did people with either brush it off as if I didn't know what I was talking about or think that I was being too dramatic and looking for attention. It has happened before so I've learned to hide when I'm having an episode.

There's only one friend I've confided about my mental struggles. A friend I've met online almost a decade ago. We've never met personally and live on opposite sides of the world but we've somehow kept contact even as the friends I've had growing up gradually dropped contact with me.

Our chats consists mainly of silly story ideas, out there theories, and potty humour so when we get serious it's an unspoken rule that we ease off the joking to address whatever problem we're facing, but we always end the day just as we usually do, with potty humour. It makes talking about things we normally push to the back of our heads easier. It's like having a mini psych session except its even better as by the end of it I'd feel a load off my chest.

I feel bad sometimes since she's the first person I go to right when I hit that limit and start rethinking if living is really worth it. I have a lot of problems and, after bottling it all up for months and letting it simmer, I get a full meltdown at least twice a year. I feel like absoulte shit and often can't recall exactly what I've said or done, but I know where I can talk and rant freely and so I turn to her.

I often receive worried messages from her when I disappear from our messaging app for more than a few days. Whenever I do I feel really awful and I tell her so, but she just brushes it off and says she's always there if I need someone to talk to. And everytime I receive such messages, it doesn't matter if I feel like shit or not, just knowing there's really someone out there who cares if you suddenly disappear makes carrying on living a whole lot better.

So, to those friends who don't shy away from the idea of mental illness and discuss freely about it, to those friends who stuck by no matter what, to those friends who listens and not judge, to those friends who really cared to ask, thank you. Maybe you don't know how much your kindness affected the world around you but you've played a huge part in the betterment of someone else's life.

To Chris, in case you ever stumble upon this, I've said it before and I'll say it again, thank you for being a good friend to me. Whenever you need someone to talk to I promise you too, I'll always be here.",21Dec2019,1

69,"So it's been a while since being in Reddit but something got me ticking lately so here I am.

I'm bipolar type 2 and lately I went through a hypermanic episode but didn't really realise it was happening. 

I had this online boyfriend for about 4 months on and off, but now I've come to realise it was toxic as hell. 

So basically we'd have these intense sexting sessions that would set off hypermania. Not eating and  sleeping properly, obsessing over certain things, spending way too much money online. It was all good and well while he was being sweet with me, but just randomly out of the blue he'd only reply to me with one word answers. 

Each time this happened id be insanely depressed and would have to end it because it was way too overwhelming. 

He was into submission type stuff so I always had it in the back of my mind that he was starving me of attention just so it do exactly what he wanted when he wanted.

It was incredible the control he really had over me in the end l, especially for someone id never met and lived on the other side of the world

Anyway I ended up having a drink with an old hook up, who id been friends with since highschool, we'd only hooked up for a short amount of time and realised weren't for each other that way. But he tried to kiss me that night that I really wasn't expecting.

Anyway I told online boyfriend this and he blocked me. And I'm so greatful that he did. Everytime we broke up, id be the one blocking him. Then find myself missing him and unblock and talk to him again.

Everytime I did break it off an amazing amount of weight was off my shoulders and my hypermania would be gone pretty damn quick. The nights after the break up id finally felt like id got the best sleep in weeks.

I'm starting to realise and be aware of this now.. which I think is really positive for me. As sex has always been such a big deal.. one night stands and relationships. I'm now going to realise what's toxic and what's not. As addictive as intense sex can be it isn't healthy for me. And if I happen to find that normal in someone who shares that intense sexual connection i think I'll want to spend the rest of my life with them lol

Since he blocked me a few days ago I've been back to my old self. Motivated to keep the house clean, have fun with my kids, not obsessively looking at things to buy online..  going to bed early, taking my meds on time, eating dinner at dinner time. That manic monster inside me will never not exsist.. but I'm slowly learning how to tame the prick.",21Dec2019,1

He obviously has a lot of repressed anger towards my mom, since they are divorced and he often talks shit about her to me and my little brother. But he went too far a month ago, when he basically told the world lies about my mother through a Facebook post. He took screenshots of some of my texts about being depressed and having suicidal thoughts out of context to make it look like i wanted to kill myself because of my mother. I blocked his number and have not spoken to him in about 6 weeks now. He sent me into a very dark place and I became even more depressed, I couldn’t get out of bed for almost a week straight, I couldn’t eat and my grades dropped. Over the past 6 weeks I have slowly been feeling better. I don’t know if i should be feeling guilty about cutting him off, but I’m not. Not even a little bit. But the thing is, I feel guilty about not feeling guilty for cutting him off, if that makes sense. I know he misses me, but i don’t miss him. And i feel guilty about that. But he’s done this before and somehow managed to make it my fault for feeling hurt about it. He knows exactly how to play with peoples minds and emotions in order to get what he wants, and I am too vulnerable to allow him back into my life at this point in time. But I cant help but feel guilty about the fact that I don’t feel bad for cutting him off. And i don’t know if this is normal.

I hate being seen as selfish because I was to die. What about me? Why do I have to suffer and struggle for the rest of my life just because people want me around? Can't they see I'm in pain? Can't they understand I can't do this anymore? I mean I get losing someone you care about is terrible but still. All my life it's always been about what other people want. What about me?

I'm either taking advantage of people, physically or emotionally hurting someone and just lying all the time just to get what I want at  that time. I get manipulative. I pretend to feel a certain way to appeal to anyone and anything that i need. 

The weirdest part is that everything is usually going very well. People are doing their own thing and I'm doing mine. Then weeks later i just throw a monkey wrench into the plan. 

I dont know what is wrong with me.

It's as if all my moral code goes out of the window and I no longer truly care about how others feel.

lets see how this post rolls out!",21Dec2019,1
81,"  Hi, I don’t usually do this but I’ve had a pretty bad streak going on and honestly I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. First, I should give you a little background my family has a long line of mental illnesses from ADHD to Schizophrenia. And honestly, I’m terrified.... out of my 3 siblings two has ADHD and might have a mild level of a learning disability? (I’m not too sure it’s just snipets of conversations me and my mother had) and the last one is bipolar with some other stuff. I don’t usually like to pry especially because we are all so close to age and I know they take it personal. However, I’m different? I’ve always been a outstanding student never struggled with school unlike my siblings and had a great personality. Emphasis on “Had”. I recently just experienced my first semester at college and it’s made me realize a lot about myself....

    I have a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I often ——- my thighs or burnt myself. Sometimes I would just see how many painkillers I could take to see if anything happened. (These were those 800 mg ones too my mother is a nurse) recently though since school started I have stopped. I’m happy to say I’ve been 3 months without a incident? Most likely thanks to my bf who say the scars and just let me have it... 

  Recently, my whole personality has changed. I used to be a big people person and was able to run around and make friends. I still like to make friends with people but I struggle really hard too. It’s always like there is someone telling me that people don’t like me or I’m doing to much, or lots of other horrible stuff. Basically I say one thing and in the back of my head it says another. And sometimes I can’t help it and end up doing it. Many people have laughed on occasion at my speech. Most of the time friends because I encourage it and laugh along with them. I struggle to keep up with my brain and my words. I often have to take a break so that my mouth can catch up so I usually say words wrong. I understand what I am saying but it just doesn’t correlate with my mouth. I also seem to have a really bad memory. My friends are constantly looking out for me because I lose stuff so often. I was lost in the parking lot of a mall for an hour because I couldn’t remember what the car (that we have been driving for 5 months) looked like. I’ve lost my phone and it had been in my lap, I lost my dorm key within the day I received it. The list can go on and on forever.

   I also have really bad anxiety. I think this stems from my lack of body confidence however. I’m not bad built as most people say. I have a naturally curvy body and because of that I get a lot of compliments and up front contact. Just from thee reactions I know that I’m not crazy when I say everyone is staring at me and talking about it. I can’t step foot into the cafe with my friends because I have a entire panic attack just walking in. I get so nervous and forget to breath. I don’t even eat the food if they manage to get me inside I quickly go to the table we want and sit and wait listening to everything the back of my head tells me. I usually just sit in the car but my friends feel so bad to leave me I love them so much they would even sneak out food for me. 

 
The issues just add on top of each other the anxiety causes me not to want to eat and therefore I have lost a lot of weight in the process. I like the change but others say I’m losing too much too quickly. I get sick every-time I eat something especially if I dissected it with my eyes. If it’s too greasy or looks like it’s too much to eat I won’t touch it. My stomach could be growling and I could have the most intense pain ever. But, I would not touch it because I know if I ate it I would be even sicker to the point where I’m gagging as I walk around. 


I don’t know what I have.... I’m terrified to get diagnosed and see I wasn’t so lucky after all. (Not to offend anyone) I’m just seen as the star child in my household so I can’t afford to let anyone down. The only thing that comforts me at night is my dog. Because I often see shadows or cant breath at night having him next to me knowing if he doesn’t bark or anything than I’m alright. The insomnia and sleep paralysis drives me insane. Even right now it’s 5 in the morning and I haven’t slept since the small nap I got this afternoon while my family watched a movie. 


   I’m just hoping someone on here can help... I really want to change and get better for my friends so they won’t have to worry about me. As well as for myself because I feel like I can’t hold this out to much longer. I can’t seem to cry anymore unless I get too scared which hasn’t happened in 3 months either. 

I also laugh sometimes or smile in inappropriate moments. Me and my friends swore we were going to get arrested and they were damn near crying and shitting on themselves. I looked the cop straight in his car as he drove by smiling and my friends thought I was a lunatic. They keep calling me crazy ever since and no wish they would stop.

For some background, I live in an Asian country that’s generally very competitive in many aspects and despite the feelings of anxiety, I’ve been coping very well so far by drowning myself with schoolwork, exercise and decompressing on youtube(which may have contributed to the problem). 

The problem comes now, after returning from a vacation to Northern Europe. Life there seems so much better than the one I have right now and I can’t stop wanting to leave everything and get back there right now. I’m getting major post-travel blues and I have no idea how to stop this. I already had plans to migrate in the future and I was really doing a good job keeping it in check until I had my trip. Now, I feel so sick and tired of everything in my country and just want out. I can’t bring myself to be as motivated as before and concentrate on my work.

When mom is cancelling plans last minute, it's hard to know how to help her without feeling resentful at missed chance to see people. Then she sees I'm annoyed and plays the ""I'm sorry I'm such an annoyance to you, sorry"" if I try to explain to her how I feel because she has cripplingly low self-esteem. Then I start to believe that I am the cause of her low self-esteem because we can't even have a reasonable discussion if we disagree on something without her getting upset.

I’ve never had a counsellor or psychiatrist actually tell me I have something wrong with me till them and I didn’t really expect much from them but I’m so happy I went but idrk what to do with all the information they’ve given me and all the stuff we are starting I’ve already pretty much learned by myself and I feel weird actually having people give a shot about my mental health and want to help me so it’s kinda left me stumped recovery has so far been easy and I know it will get harder but I’m kinda nervous to break the shell I’ve been in for so long now.",21Dec2019,1

92,"For the past year or so, I have been fantasising about being truly mentally disabled (i.e. insanity or having a lack of sanity). I lie to my psychiatrists about what I am experiencing to get more severe diagnoses and hopefully start to see more people that I can lie to. I love talking to people with the hope that what I say will make them think I am not sane. I love the look on people’s faces when I lie about things (like abuse).
I just can’t stop thinking about it. I have never wanted anything more in my life. At this point, it is my only reason for living.
I have only told my closest friends, but even they do not know the full extent of it. I mean, I have hated myself ever since I told my family and started seeking help. I hate my medication and skip it every chance I can.
I force myself to do perverted things and be sadistic and masochistic in the hope that being those things will increase my mental instability.
I have been diagnosed with OCD and schizophrenia. I also have suspected psychopathy (as in I have symptoms - I am not old enough for a diagnosis). I am currently taking anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. 
Zac has changed me. His whispers in my mind tell me the truth. It sends messages to me through the bubbles at the back of my throat and through insane anime characters. It also gives me messages through my compulsions and fate (e.g. I have to do a certain thing or I get punished, or I can do something if a particular event happens).
It is my God. Its’ appearance is similar to that of Kira Kousuke. Kira is what I think is a priest to Christians. They spread the wisdom in place of the deity controlling them.
In short, I am curious to see how much progress I have made. Have I done well, Zac? I won’t get punished for telling these people, right?",21Dec2019,1
93,"Does anyone else ever feel like this? I mean, not temperature cold, but cold on the inside. Sometimes it’s in my brain, and when it gets into my brain, i just feel tired and on the verge of tears. It’s like everything outside me disappears, my body does what it is supposed to do only out of havit. Its like im living inside my brain. It makes me think lowly of myself, thinking about how everyone hates me and wishes i was dead, which makes my wanting to die even stronger and my self hatred even stronger because im so pathetically weak that i cant go through with it. Panic attacks are common when im in this state of mind. Usually time is the only remedy but showering or being with my girlfriend and just cuddling in her arms and feeling loved, seem to speed up the process. Other times it’s not in my head, but in my chest. when it’s in my chest i just feel nothing. empty. numb. Even my thoughts and my brain feel empty. I find that this is when my urge to self harm is the strongest. I dont know what to think.    Someone told me they think im depressed. Im not sure though. I dont think i am depressed because with time, these feelings fade, and they come back, but they fade away again. Sometimes it’s worse than others. Does anyone else ever feel like this?

94,"Hello all. I was recently diagnosed with Attention deficit disorder by a psychiatrist but I am having some doubts about my diagnosis.

I will start by giving some background about myself:

I am a 22 year old male that is currently in University. When I was in primary school (Aged 7 to 12 in my country), i had trouble concentrating in school, often received complaints from teachers and refused to do school work. However, when I reached aged 13 and moved on to high school (again, high school equivalent in my country), my grades started to soar significantly and I quickly became one of the top students in my acadamic level. I found that I could think very quickly, process information quickly and learn faster than my peers. The only issue i've ever had was that I was unable to concentrate on subjects like mathematics and never really excelled in it whereas writing subjects or subjects that interest me was easily picked up and retained. After high school, I attended 2 years of mandatory military service and certain events and stresses I experienced during my service caused me to pick up cigarette smoking. Ever since my new-found bad habit, i realised a change in my brain; I started to think way slower, had poor short-term memory and worse active recall, poor concentration and processed information at a significantly slower rate. I realised that these ""symptoms"" only occur when I smoked cigarettes (which was multiple times daily) and my thinking would be clearer and crisper when I go a few hours without smoking, still diminished due to the nicotine withdrawal effects, but a significant improvement from when I do smoke.  


I left military service and enrolled into university with these thinking issues and finally decided to see a psychiatrist about them. Based on the symptoms i described to him and some questions he asked about my early life, he diagnosed me with ADD and prescribed Ritalin.    


I quit smoking right before i visited the psychiatrist and received my diagnosis. The effects ritalin gave me was very similar to what I felt when I smoked; I would be very focused on something but found my thinking to be slower than normal, had issues choosing the words I want to say and had impaired short term memory, basically making me feel stupid and finding it harder to understand concepts.  


 I am starting to wonder if my neurological ""symptoms"" could be caused by nicotine and not ADD and ritalin, due to it leading to more dopamine in my brain, could be causing these same symptoms as nicotine used to. As such, could it be that the excess dopamine from nicotine and ritalin is causing all my thinking problems and not any underlying psychiatric condition?   


TLDR; can excess dopamine caused by nicotine and separately, ritalin, lead to slower thinking, poor short term memory and foggy thinking?  


I know this is a long post but I really do need and appreciate any input on this, thanks in advance.",21Dec2019,1

97,"How many tries did it take you to find a therapist that worked for you? And how did you know they were the one?

Me: bla bla bla

Them: mhm...*writes in notebook*

107,"So some backstory...

I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD for many years now. The anxiety and OCD really started almost 5 years ago when my husband and I started trying to have a family.

Over three and a half years after many losses and no definitive answers, our daughter was born a little more than two years ago.

I got hit hard with depression and more anxiety and OCD behaviors three months postpartum. The first time I experienced suicidal thoughts was last summer. They are all still here almost two and a half years later.

My physical health has been awful since giving birth and I am not close to finding out what's wrong with me. When I am feeling physically bad then my mental health goes downwards fast.

After dinner yesterday I started feeling bad. I went upstairs to get changed as we were going be going to my parents house very soon. I really didn't want to go anymore but didn't want to back out.

I sat on my bed and turned on my heating pad. I was feeling upset over my current state and was worrying about potentially missing another family event for Christmas (I had to miss Thanksgiving because I was sick).

A few minutes later I started feeling suicidal again. I started tracing/digging my nails into my forearms alongside my veins in a vertical pattern. I imagined what it would feel like if I actually did cut. I did this for about 10-15 minutes.

Afterwards I just started cussing at God and being angry about my plight in life. I'm not religious so I found it odd that I was talking to God (I used to be, though). I was crying a lot while ""talking to God.""

Then I became angry and started talking about how no one really cares about anyone or anything in the world... that no one really gives a shit about others.

I remember looking down and then up again and then I felt very odd... like I was having an out of body experience.

The name ""Amy"" just popped into my head all of a sudden and then it was like I wasn't me anymore... I was Amy.

I started saying weird things like we will all die and the Earth will die too and that no one will know I ever existed. I said no one is going to save me and that it really didn't matter how I feel now because I'm going die at some point. That my body will just become ashes and be one with the Earth.

I then just started laughing hysterically and didn't stop for 15 minutes. Everything seemed to ""click"" once I realized that we will all die so what is the point in trying.

I remember saying that ""Caroline is gone"" and that it was just ""Amy."" I said it was good talking with her (even though it felt like I was her?).

I had thoughts of Amy dressing sexy and being confident and not giving a shit about anyone or anything. All things that are not normally me at all.

I don't remember everything that I said but I remember that I wouldn't normally say those things.

After 30 minutes of whatever that was, I went downstairs, still laughing. My husband was understandably concerned about my behavior as I wasn't acting like myself. I kept saying we just have to go to my parents and ""fake it"" and ""act like we're happy because that's what we do."" This also confused my husband.

My toddler daughter kept running up to me and hugging me and being her happy self. But I really wasn't into her like usual. She would do things that I would normally be nervous about (getting up and down out of ""big people"" chairs, running around erratically) but I didn't care.

I would say things like, ""I should probably tell you not to do...(whatever action) cause that's what she would tell you"" (she meaning me).

Once we got to my parents house I felt like I was starting to come back to myself. However, I was cussing in front of my parents which I never do (religious folks) and it was catching my husband off guard. Because of my behavior he thought I was high on marijuana pills but I never took any.

Anyways... I am really confused about what I experienced and am legitimately wondering if I am starting to lose it...",21Dec2019,1

109,"I feel like for most of my life I have been stuck inside my head, trying to find a way out. Until recently, I was mostly drifting through life. Life was happening to me, I was not making it happen. I never got the girl or job I wanted, I would just take whatever came my way. In recent years, I feel slightly more in control and I'm making progress, but I'm still stuck inside my head. I now know I can choose where to go, but either there is nowhere really I want to go to or I want to go everywhere. I have otherwise a very happy life: married, good career, good friends, good experiences. I have no regrets about life, and I feel I have accomplished a lot even if in an unconventional way.

The last couple of years I've been considering that I may have ADHD or ASD. I'm now waiting for an appointment to get a formal diagnostic (huge waiting list), but I'm already seeing a private ADHD therapist. I'm making progress, but this feeling of being stuck inside my head is overwhelming at times.

I'll try to explain a bit better the feeling, but it's not a simple one. At the core of it is a feeling of having a gap between intention and action. I want to do a lot of things, but I either get overwhelmed by my options or I feel my options are pointless. There is a part of me that is content with just being or existing, and I'm happy with who I am, but another side of me is constantly asking me for more and I don't really know what ""more"" is. There is some sort of internal fight between both sides, one pushing me to just be and the other one pushing me to try and get ""more"". The result is usually inaction and apathy. Another part of it is a sense of complete awareness, like being able to see the Matrix. I understand why things happen, so I rarely get angry, upset, or disappointed, but also don't get pleasently surprised or particularly excited about things. It's some sort of equanimity, although not perfect, which in a way is a perk.

I have been depressed in the past, and this doesn't feel like it at all. I still enjoy things and I'm overall happy with my life. I've also considered anxiety, but there is nothing I fear, I don't think there are right or wrong choices when I feel paralysed, and generally people gravitate towards me because I'm a source of chill. The only thing I have in common with those issues is that I have racing and intrusive thoughts.

120,"Hey, so, long story short I have a few problems with me that all roll into one big steaming pile of eggnog(happy holidays). 

To begin I suppose I’ll list my issues and expand on them afterwards. 
I have FND (functional neurological disorder). For everyone it is quite different and it is an extremely broad condition, mine affects me so that if I feel any strong emotions of any kind or over exert my body in any place or way, it sets off an episode where I mostly lose control of all my muscles and the expand and contract rapidly, tightly and extremely painfully. It’s meant to be treatable from case to case generally but mine only appears to be getting worse, treatment isn’t helping at all. It also passively goes off in various muscles/muscle groups just randomly. Along with this around half he episode or more I experience are random, with no known trigger.

My other condition, well I’m not sure what it is... My best guess in my non-professional opinion is that I have semi-severe ASPD(anti-social personality disorder) from months of research it seems the best fit of anything and explains a lot about how I act and perceive life and people.

Life was sort of difficult for me in my early years, 8-12 due to me having mild motor tics at the time, I was at the receiving end of fairly constant bullying most of my early ears and my life at home wasn’t exactly better either with my brothers and parents. All in all, for the first 15 years of my life, it was garbage at home and at school, soccer and kickboxing training, etc. around 15 FND developed quite rapidly in me and since has only been getting worse. In the past 3-4 weeks my life has been fairly constant exhaustion, pain, muscle aches and the like. Even now typing this it is setting off my arms and hands quite painfully.

What makes all of this especially difficult for me is that I feel depressed and lonely, watching my life slowly kind of just, tumble downwards. With no-one at my side, no one I value at all at least. Which raises my second issue.

All of this wouldn’t be so bad if I had someone I cared about, I’ve tried time and time again to care about someone, I always grow bored with them in a period of a month on average, maybe less. I don’t even value my family and I can’t help it. I’ve tried my whole life to connect with any of them and I just don’t care about them, even when family or friends have died it hasn’t affected me. The loneliness of it all really does though.

To top the cake off due to my presumed ASPD I have never really taken enjoyment out of anything for any long period of time. After a couple months at most whatever it is I like, I hate. It becomes such a grind and bore, it numbs my mind to death and makes me so angry and frustrated. I need to stop it. And whatever I can’t stop just makes every day loving with it even more ‘fun’. It all sucks and I’m so lost.

Now about the ASPD, there has been one person I have take an interest in about for more than a month, actually haven’t stopped caring even after we broke things off. So that was new to me for sure, with it being my first time actually caring about someone, I obviously went and messed it up, that still hurts even after being split for over month so that doesn’t help either I guess.

I don’t know what to do, what to try, what to think, how to act. Even pretending to be nice hurts me so much mentally. Existence for me at this point is mostly painful. Hell just someone to talk to might be nice, I’m genuinely unsure of anything at this point. I need guidance, guidance my psychologists, doctors, parents and friends have failed to give me, if that sort of guidance even exists. I’m 17 by the way, also had to quit my job because of my FND and keeping up at school with all the episodes has made getting anything above a B impossible, mostly Cs and Ds, some Fs even.

I don’t wanna eat, take a bath, etc. it all just feels pointless. I don’t know how to describe it but I feel like a pointless soul wandering around Earth and having existential crisis all the time. I’m afraid that people wouldn’t remember or that they would hate me. Activities like playing Piano, drawing that I used to enjoy, now they just all feel pointless. Whenever I try to do them to feel better, I just have no strive. “What do you I actually wanna be?” “What am I striving for?”  “Am I just wasting my time?” Overall, makes the activities hard, unpleasant to do,  and feels pointless. Weird thing is, I’m never like this around people!

Things are getting bad again. I find myself on the verge of tears a lot these days. I thought I was feeling better and I guess I was for a moment, but it’s back again. I don’t deserve this life. I’m not taking advantage of it the way you should. My life has no meaning and I’m so terribly lonely. My family is broken. Fuck, divorce is ugly. It happened years ago, but I still miss my mother. She checked out emotionally and my heart has been broken ever since.    I don’t have very many friends. I don’t have genuine connections with anyone. I have one person in my life who I actually do love, but he can’t tell me how he feels and it has been two years now. So naturally I’m crushed.

I keep telling myself that one this thing or event comes then I’ll feel better. Like once I get a job (after finishing up school and being unemployed for 6 months) I’ll feel better - I got a job and still don’t feel better. Or when I get a new car, I’ll feel better - I got a new car, still don’t feel better. Or when I finally move out, I’ll feel better - I got my own place, still don’t feel better. I’m kidding myself.

I feel uncomfortable in my own skin. I see people with their confidence, and I wonder what that’s like. There was a “suicide attempt” once. Downed a bunch of Xanax along with vodka. Woke up the next morning, unfortunately. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I have rent to pay and I have a co signer on my car so I wouldn’t want to fuck yo their credit. That’s it. That’s what I think about when I want to die. I’m only alive for bills. I don’t know how long I want to go on like this. I just want it to end. If I could give my life to another person, I would. I don’t deserve this life. My mind won’t let me live. I’m so tired. I doubt this will get noticed and that’s okay. Thanks for allowing me to vent.",21Dec2019,1

So as a background, I (19) have PTSD and social anxiety. Recently, I got upped from 50 mg of Zoloft to 75 mg, and it spurred a MASSIVE series of manic symptoms. I just got out of that on Monday, and now I'm so depressed I can barely get out of bed, haven't showered or done any basic hygiene in days, basically I take my Zoloft and then go back to sleep. I told my psychiatrist about all this and she's closely monitoring me because she said it's incredibly likely I might have bipolar and the Zoloft heightened symptoms that were already there in a smaller degree. But also, she said it might be PTSD manifesting in the form of a manic episode, so we aren't sure which one yet, but she's kind of super leaning towards bipolar. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I'm very scared. It doesn't feel like I have bipolar disorder despite my symptoms, as weird as that sounds. It doesn't feel real.

Taking venlafaxine extended release, low dose due to being extremely sensitive to side effects

I have read bad things about stop using antidepressants suddenly and now I'm very scared. My psychiatrist never mentioned anything about lowering the dose when you get off of it, just about starting with lower doses (and that's what I did).

What is titration, where can I find reliable sources to learn about it and how can I do it?

I was planning on stopping with the medication when I start feeling better, I don't want to rely on it forever. I just dont want to do it all at once due to side effects.

155,"Note: This is a semi-long post because I have to explain myself due to having nearly never posting on reddit aside from old pc part questions. The explanation is important to understanding what I'm trying to convey tho. -Thanks for understanding

I like to believe I am quite the average person, I workout, play games, hangout with friends, eat normal (For my area at least), and I achieve above expectations in any classes I take. My issue is that I have a lot of moments where I don't understand how to fix some of the emotions I have. Growing up I noticed little freakouts I'd have over issues that typically could be forgotten after calming down once. A main example of these childhood freakouts was my intense fear of death as I lose all cares for reality and can only think about the oncoming fate that is to be (even started shaking typing that). I was raised on the idea that pushing through difficulties is the best way to do things until you've learned that you can no longer do things on your own. (Typical scenario here from what I've heard). These moments of pure terror have gotten worse and worse over the years causing me to have an increasingly tough time at hiding fear in public. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fear of death is one thing for me but so is my general distrust of people (mostly just relationships). I've always liked the idea of being able to go to people for things whether it be me just wanting a generally good fun time or if I need help, of course things don't go like as imagined for me when things go bad. I've had a pretty good amount of experience dating and have always noticed that my main issue trusting any SO is that I've had a lot of experience with breakups due to mental health. 

Note: Before continuing previous paragraph: I won't say terms like Anxiety or depression or anything because I don't know if I have any of these conditions and I refuse to spread the idea that assuming so is correct (which it very obviously isn't).

Continuing from paragraph: Typically when dating I have really bad worries about people leaving that often causes really bad shaking and I become overloaded with these sort've thoughts. Maybe I can't properly convey how real and overpowering these moments are but considering this a mental health subreddit I imagine that most people understand. Relationships caused me a lot of pain even when things were going fine. I've had a bad history of cutting, bare in mind I want to hear nothing about this bit as I've already quit but I thought it'd helpful info. I'm not sure what else to include about relationships honestly, I really dream of a day where I can be in one and not have to end it within only a matter of days because of overwhelming thoughts.

I should probably also note I've never seen a counselor and have done a lot of things to try and help myself. I've mostly just done the typical actions of Having way too much nicotine, drinking plenty of alcohol, and smoking whatever weed I can find. I've gone a bit crazy having to give up all of these things and have recently gone back into a more worried state because I can't stop all of the fears of death, loneliness, distrust of others, and not feeling deserving of basic necessities of life such as food, love, warmth, etc. So now I mostly just sit around and have my freakouts whenever they come around, typically at home I just go in a blind rage and hit walls or scream as I can't really control how my body reacts, in public I mostly just have twitches and shakes or I stare of heavily wishing for no comfort.

So a few days ago, for the first time in almost 4 years I hurt myself. I'm in a very bad place in my head and in my heart and was in the bathtub just trying to relax. I did it without even thinking really. It used to be a thing of comfort for me but I think this time it was punishment. I didn't feel anything until after it was done. I still feel sick to my stomach looking at what I did. I got a tattoo when I turned 18 to symbolize the end of me hurting myself. Looking at it now I feel like a failure. 

Which adds to another thing. My eating disorder has flared back up. Ive never liked what I saw in the mirror to begin with. But know with what I've done to myself i really cant. I was cheated on and it really made me feel like I was ugly and gross. Ive started restricting again and counting calories and even purging. I know why I'm doing it but at the same time I don't.

160,"I’ve dealt with mental illness since I was 12. I could go on about everything that’s wrong and why, but all that’s related to this issue is that I struggle with loneliness which induces really intense violent episodes of anxiety. It’s complicated. All I know is when the feeling comes over me I know I only have a few hours before I explode.

How I cope with it has honestly been sex. My ex would always try and hug, kiss, cuddle etc but it never helped and I’d still end up having an episode. He thought it would help since I was dealing with loneliness. We eventually realized sex helps me. It’s really easy for me to get aroused when I’m like that but I never have the energy to actually have sex. So my boyfriend at the time told me to just lay on my back and let him do what he wants and I don’t have to do anything so I gave it a shot and it was amazing. I would always lay on the edge of the bed on my back and he stood up and did it missionary and he would go so slow and gently for like half an hour while slowly caressing me head to toe and it’s honestly so soothing and helpful in those times. I just lay down and close my eyes and let the soft, good feelings rush through me.

Multiple therapists have been very against this method telling me sex should never be used to cope and usually indicates bigger issues. Others have told me that sex is a very fun and healthy coping mechanism if done correctly like doing it only with someone you trust and who’s aware of how you use sex and knows about your emotional state and won’t take advantage of it. 

I’ve been in a really bad rough patch lately. Crying myself to sleep every night and squeezing the life out of my pillow wishing it was someone. I’m feeling extremely starved of touch and intimacy. I want to call my ex and ask if he’s open to the idea of a sexual relationship. He lives no more than 2 minute walk away. So when I feel lonely I can ask him to come over and do his thing. I honestly trust him and think he’d be very helpful. He knows all about it and I wouldn’t have to teach him, he already knows what I like and what I need. He also never treated it like it was his time to get laid, he was very serious about it. We are on great terms right now and have always been so I’d feel comfortable asking him

I’m just afraid I’m not thinking clearly and I don’t notice it when I say I think this is a good idea. Maybe the other therapists are right and I do have bigger problem than I think, I don’t know",21Dec2019,1
161,"So this year I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, my first episode left me threatening my best friend but it was just defensive and almost killing myself. My second episode was 2 weeks after where the exact same thing happened, my friend sectioned me. The antipsychotics have helped a lot but not completely. Does anyone else who is also schizophrenic have relationships?
I would hate to lose my friend but it happens a lot with him more than anyone else. It's so hard to put myself through this when I see him.",21Dec2019,1
162,"Hello everyone \[I don't speak in english so this may hurt your soul reading this :c\]! This subreddit may be my last hope. Iam here to ask you people for help, I want to know what is going on with me. Few years ago my thoughts, personality, started to change drastically (Iam 15 now) I don't feel like myself anymore. When I was 12 I started having weird thoughts, when I thought about certain situations, my brain would start to imagine different scenarios that could happen, for example: If I behaved differently, the situation would give me different outcome, If I did something other way, It would be better. With time I started to think about actions I already done, that Iam a total loser and Im doing almost everything wrong, But the situation gets worse. I turned 14 when things got more intense, when I watched someone get in a fight, go through trouble, or remember traumatic thing about my past, I would ""freeze"" and think about myself being in that situation, If I imagined person yelling at me, or even criticizing me, I would go on full agressive mode and think about doing bad, bad things to them. When ""freezing"" (I called it that) my vision blurs out, (just like taking off your glasses) and I see almost nothing, then I start wandering around mindless or don't move at all, ocasionally I can move on my own, but really slow, that is a sign I have a chance to go back from ""freezing"". It is hard to snap out of it, believe me, It is hard. One time I just couldn't get out until my dog started barking, normally a person can help me by simply talking to me, which ""unfreezes"" me, but when Im alone I can sit/wander like that for hours (unless I have a little control, so I can for example open fridge, when it is cold I snap out of it, also tried with hot water from sink, that works too). But lately... things got complicated. It was about few week earlier that I had weird interactions with people, friends started to talk with me about subjects that I never discussed with them, random people that I never met before somehowly recognised me, I thought that I might be losing my memory, however these people saw me differently, normally Im insecure and don't really socialize with anyone, I only have these two friends at School that I talk to, one of them started even telling me that I have "" mood swings "" and memory loss, he told me to see a psychiatrist, It's like Im not myself, It's like there's a second pearson sitting inside of me, Im starting to forget about what I written before, slowly but I do, I lost my topic a few times mid writing now.

 Please help figure this out",21Dec2019,1

164,"Recently, all of my friends have started to couple off. I'm the single friend, which I've been fine with because my friendships have been very fulfilling. But now all of their time is consumed by their significant others, meaning I don't really have anyone who I can spend time with anymore. Any time I try to bring up that I feel excluded + want to spend time with them, I get attacked -- I think I just need to wait a few months for the initial emotions to calm down, but I'm not sure if I can wait that long. They also tell me to think of the areas of my life that I've been thriving in, namely my career... but career strides can't solve loneliness, and sometimes even makes it worse. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety, and the loneliness has been so bad recently that I've come closer to attempting suicide than I have in years. I'm also still recovering from a failed romantic venture that left me pretty heartbroken (we never actually dated, but there was definitely something going on), so going on dates with strangers feels awful and makes me lonelier than before, because it's emotional connection I crave which tinder dates absolutely cannot provide. I know the work needs to start from within...but I have no idea how to even approach that. I just feel so empty and isolated all the time, and I hate it. I want to be happy again, but I don't know how. So here I am, asking if anyone has tips and tricks to fill this empty void in my soul. Thanks in advance for the advice.",21Dec2019,1
165,"I want to end it all but I care too much about my friends and family to do that to them. I always care more about others than myself. I always put others miles ahead of myself. But no one notices that. I am trying to see the light in all this darkness but it is fading rapidly. I have no purpose in this world. But I can’t take myself out of it because I know others would be hurt. I’m a selfless man, I care too much. 
I’m trying ,is that not enough? Am I not enough? Why was I put on this earth if I was only to be shit on my entire life. I am 26 and haven’t had one single good day. Was I meant to struggle this much? I’m trying, is that not enough? Am I not enough?",21Dec2019,1
