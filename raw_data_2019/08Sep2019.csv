0,Some days I will just be super on edge and get pissed off really easy at anyone no matter how close to me they are and then I'll want to cry after I feel angry. I don't know what to do I hate blowing up on my friends and family. I don't know what it is or how to help/fix it.,08Sep2019,2
1,This has been a problem since the first days of school (as in kindergarten). At home everyone tells me to shut up (in a good way) and at home everybody tells me to open up. I say like 5 words at school while at home I say paragraphs of random stuff. I don‚Äôt get it.,08Sep2019,1
2,"I know people mean well when they say that kind of thing, but I have a lot of issues around the idea of 'conditional love' so what I hear is ""I don't like you, I'm just waiting for you to turn into someone I do like"". I mean, I'm past 30 now and I've been hearing about my great potential my entire goddamn life, and all I've ever done with it is disappoint anyone who expected great things out of me. If someone talks about my potential all I think is how they're slowly going to drop out of my life as they come to realize I'm actually not on the cusp of getting my shit together like they thought I was.

Any advice on dealing with this type of thinking?",08Sep2019,4
3,"It's one of the absolute worst qualities about myself - what is more concerning is the fact that I just recently started to do it.

Long story short, myself and a bunch of my friends have started our bachelors degree at the same time - however I changed the course of my studies about 3 years in, and I am taking an extra two years to finish up. I am also now working a fantastic full-time job with commission and have an excellent support group. However, with everyone I know finished, I cannot help but to feel left behind and a bit of a disappointment to my loved ones. I know that is not the case but lately I have been struggling with this the past 3 months and it has ruined my cheerful mood. My coworkers (whom are considered to be wonderful friends), family, and friends are very concerned. I tell them I am fine but I really am not. Everyone is also in loving relationships and I am always 3rd wheeling. (I even 5th wheeled on Valentines day...)

Do anyone have any tips on what I can do to take better care of myself in this regard? I have tried everything but I cannot shake this ridiculous thought from my head. I am honestly scared on what will happen if I don't seek some advice. I just want to feel fulfilled again.",08Sep2019,1

7,"Hey everyone, just wanted to get my fear off of my chest, and thought this was a good place to do it. Here's the backstory:

I am 40 years old. I have been married for 19 years, and have two amazing boys (19, and 14). I became a parent young, but it has been a blast to grow up with them. 

I went to college, and graduated with my master's degree in computer science in 2003. My life was going great, but then I had trouble getting placed in a job because not many places were hiring at that time, as it was not long after the dot com bubble bursted, so it was kind of rough going, but I eventually got a job in 2007 and have enjoyed my career doing software design, and database management.

Well, I've also struggled with depression my entire life, and bad anxiety. I developed an addiction to pills that put me in a dark place mentally for a long time. I then had some massive marital issues begin in 2017, but we have been slowly working on them, and things are going well, but my mental health was still becoming an issue.

At the beginning of the summer, I started doing rideshare work on the side to help pay for my oldest sons college tuition, since he was starting in the fall. Well, being around so many people during this side gig, and battling my own depression and pessimism towards society actually inspired me to start being happy, and wanting to help other people be happy as well. I now am super nice to everyone I see, even if they are kurt with me. I've decided that at the age I am in my life, and being depressed for as long as I have been, I want to feel better, and I have realized that by making other people happy makes me feel happy too.

So I've been contemplating for months about a career change, and that is to try and get into mental health counseling. This would mean I would need to go back to college, and get a 2nd masters degree. I am terrified though because I would be going to school with people half my age, and doing a full career change at this point in my life terrifies me, but it also excites me at the same time because maybe I will learn some stuff about myself, and my disease and i want to help people. 

It isn't about the money at all anymore. I own my house, and have a comfortable life. This is about learning and helping even one person. 

This is a basic explanation on why I want to do this, but I didn't want this to be 800 pages long. I wanted to vent my massive amount of anxiety about this, and maybe get either some feedback about it. Is my fear unwarranted and I'm overthinking it, or am I really going in the deep end without a raft? 

Thanks for reading üòÅ",08Sep2019,4
8,"So to start, I've been sad. Probably not entirely depressed for the past month over something happening with an online friend. Prior to the incident I had a feeling it would happen and had really bad anxiety. Now I feel like I'm over the incident but the anxiety is with me. Over the past few days I now feel like I don't really care about anything for a bit then realize I want to do something, sometimes now the smallest things get me extremely upset and out of nowhere at times my heart pounds like crazy. I know there isn't too much to be stressed about but some stuff get's me really upset over nothing.

9,"honestly, I don‚Äôt know whether or not I‚Äôd classify this as a mental health question or if it‚Äôs something that others have done as well. It ranges from me checking my bag multiple times before I go out even though I know everything is in there. Sometimes I just look through it again and then other days I‚Äôll have to take everything out multiple times just to feel satisfied enough to finally leave. I also do this weird thing before going to sleep. I‚Äôll have to turn my phone on and off silent multiple times, keep checking the volume of my alarm, and even turn the alarm on and off. I don‚Äôt know why I do it since it‚Äôs quite obvious the first time that everything is the way it should be, but when I don‚Äôt it makes me feel anxious and stressed for no reason. There have been times where these things have actually kept me up or made me late when going somewhere just because I feel like something is wrong or off, even if it‚Äôs not. 

There are also certain people that just make me feel- I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm disgusted by them, since some are even close family, but whenever they slightly brush or touch me at times, i jerk away and feel grossed out for a second. Genuinely don‚Äôt know why I do this and why it‚Äôs only with random people in my life. I get over it relatively fast so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm constantly going around like that, but when I do it to close family they‚Äôre obviously offended by it and I feel bad because I can‚Äôt help it.

10,I'm not even sure if I'm lonely but if I'm not calling someone (my mom or my bf) I just get drowned by my symptoms of depression. I used to facetime my ex alot and I know it burdened him but he really helped me live through last year. My new boyfriend I've been trying not to put any expectations or ask for anything extra because I just want a normal relationship. But I don't know what to do. How do I not feel this way. Why do I feel this way. Just a constant need for someone to be there.,08Sep2019,1
11,"I grew up with alcoholic parents who abused each other until one of them died of heart disease. That was at age 10 and under those 10 years I witnessed things and did things a child should never ever have to see or do and at that age I was already ruined by depression, anxiety, paranoia, self hatred and self harm.

 Until I was 17 all of that at home just got worse and worse, I got verbally and emotionally abused daily and continued to be forced to deal with horrifying and awful situations.
At that point I've already had 4 therapists but because I couldn't be honest with them about what was going on at home, it just didn't help me and it was wasted time talking to them.
I was just sent away with anti depressants that shut me down completely so I stopped taking them.

I got help to get my own apartment at 17 and the people that helped me with that thought that I would just be able to fix everything, get help again and finally be happy and free.
Instead at 20, everything that has happened just keeps eating me alive.
I'm so paranoid and depressed, I still sleep with a knife and baseball bat even though I got out of that fucking house.

I'm terrified of people, especially men.
I'm more depressed then ever and I'm still just stuck with extreme anxiety, paranoia, eating disorders, self harm, ocd and the list goes on.
I have a very complicated relationship with my parent who to this day is in complete denial of everything they put me through and I'm still somewhat dependent on them so I have to keep dealing with them and it's so draining.
They can say one thing in a certain tone and it sends me in to a complete breakdown, it's ridiculous that I still have to feel like this and I'm just so so tired.

I just had to get this of my chest, I don't have a lot of people to talk to so.

13,"Hi guys sorry if this is the wrong place for this post but I‚Äôm wondering if someone could help

About a month ago I did lsd. It wasn‚Äôt my first time and I felt fine afterwards, I felt normal. About a week after that though I got really high on weed and hit my head. The next day I woke up feeling off and different. It was like reality was different, like I was still high from the weed. I was able to think clearly enough, but the main thing I noticed was I felt high still and I had the same vision I get when I‚Äôm high. I went to the doctor and they said I would be fine and that it was a small concussion. But about a month later I still feel this ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling every day. Maybe it has to do with doing the lsd then hitting my head while high? Idk. Sometimes when I become really engrossed in something I‚Äôm able to forget about it but it‚Äôs seemingly always there. When I get tired or focus hard for a long time it becomes the most noticeable. 

I don‚Äôt really know how to explain the feeling exactly, I‚Äôm able to think clearly and I don‚Äôt really have trouble doing activities that are stressful for my brain, but I still feel like my brain is ‚Äúoff‚Äù, kind of like I‚Äôm in a fog. I don‚Äôt feel normal. Honestly the best way to describe it is that I‚Äôm still kinda high on weed, and I guess if you‚Äôve never smoked you wouldn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about so that isn‚Äôt helpful :( I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt have to live with this for the rest of my life, which I could do but would make me sad. Also this might be helpful: I haven‚Äôt had any anxiety or depression since I hit my head but maybe very slight headaches here and there?

19,"So I'll explain everything from the top. (Starts end of July) His family all came over for a family reunion, and his drink sister threatened violence against me. I wanted to spent the day and next night at my mum's house (parents are divorced) since I just wanted to get away from the situation. It ended with him yelling at me for an hour then kicked me out. The next morning, he texted me telling me to come to his house immediately, which I didn't want to because he literally kicked me out the day before and his family was still there. I went over to my friend's house that day to spend the night and get my mind off of everything, and us two went out for dinner, before he showed up at their house telling his parents to make me go back to his house so he could ""punish"" me. We sat in the parking lot and he sent me images of him smashing up my Xbox, and threatened to burn up my hockey and football jersey collection. We went to the police, and had to wait for someone from the county since his house is technically outside of town limits. We waited four hours (it was nine o'clock by this time) and the county police officer shows up. I tell my story and he just yells in my face calling me a ""brat who likes to waste time"" and I was just throwing a ""hissyfit like a baby"". He also claimed that as a minor (I'm 16) I have no rights at all and the police nor the state (Delaware) hold any responsibility for children except physical abuse (untrue). He then took me back to his house, with me a 6' 3"" 180 lb. stereotypical lacrosse player balling his eyes out. He literally strapped me into the back seat like a criminal, then pulled up. He said that he actually realised the situation after he saw my Xbox smashed up on the ground and saw how messed up my father is after speaking to him then apoligised. I still get day nightmares (sorry I don't know the proper term) about this and it feels like I'm back in that situation again. Everything settles down slightly and he agrees for me to stay with my mum full-time, until a few days ago where he tried texting me like normal (minutes after harrassing my mum over text telling her that she needs to charge me for my cell phone service to teach me a lesson (she's not on his side remotely). He starts talking about fantasy football and acting like we were on good terms. I basically flipped out at him (quite respectfully) and told him that he needs to understand how wrong of a person he is, and I have zero interest in speaking to him until then. We start arguing, with him being his self-centred and volatile self calling me a ""disrespectful little sh*t"". I basically tell him to not contact me again until he decides to own up to his actions, and that's that. 

TLDR; I feel bad about insulting disgusting father who caused years of psychological abuse and don't know how to stop these feelings of guilt, even though I rationally know he is in the wrong.",08Sep2019,1

I put out a facade, telling myself that I should feel more important to myself. But in truth I just can't. The only thing that's keeping me together is the fact that societal norms and the like is telling me I should be thinking that way.

My wrists are itching to be cut.. I like feeling pain I'm in control of so sometimes I do hard workouts just to feel the pain. I push myself harder to have sore muscles afterwards.

Another that i dont remember as much was of a giant screaming bullet or rod traveling downward as i stood in a weird giant chamber of what i now recognize to be whats like a gun barrel pointing downward , in the middle there was a giant hole for the bullet to go through. I would either wake up or snap out of whatever daydream was happening, but when i would get out of them i would hallucinate, multiple things could happen.

The other one is where everything felt... 3D like extra 3d whenever i would feel something it would feel more dense and i could almost feel as if i were it. (Part 2?) I used to and still do have this thing in the corner of my mind. Its like a feeling of impending doom, like nothing matters. I usually ignore it pretty well and im a pretty happy looking person. When it gets to me I sometimes feel like living life is pointless altogether. Ive never told anyone about this and i kind of needed to vent, Thanks.",08Sep2019,1
38,"So a quick bit of info to catch you up to speed, I‚Äôm 23 and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when I was only 15 months old. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression, anxiety, and addiction for a good portion of my life. Before I was even 15 years old, I had had roughly 25 seizures from severely low blood sugars. 

Maybe a couple months ago, we had my aunt over and she‚Äôs also a Type 1 diabetic. She started to have a low and for whatever reason, I couldn‚Äôt bare to be around it and ended up going into another room. I was weak, panicky, and unable to stand on my own properly. I was confused and worried about what had happened to me but eventually brushed it aside.

Fast forward to today. We drive over to my aunts apartment (haven‚Äôt seen her since the last incident) and we take her to dinner. She rides with us and I can feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety. I look over and she‚Äôs preparing to check her blood sugar (nothing out of the ordinary or even remotely triggering) and I feel it. I‚Äôll try to explain this in the best way I can. 

I felt my body fill and overflow with extreme feelings of fear, shame, and loneliness. It was like I had been thrown into a pitch black room and was being cornered in. It overwhelmed me and brought me to tears. I even considered rolling out of the car on the highway just to have some sense of control of the situation.

I felt utterly helpless. 

I hope this made sense. If not, feel free to ask and I‚Äôll try to reword it for you.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.",08Sep2019,2
39,"So lately I've been crying over really stupid little things that I normally wouldn't lose my cool over, only to cease almost immediately afterwards and come down with a fever that disappears just as quickly as the crying. Anxiety levels have definitely been sky-rocketing, and I really hate how cliche and overused this phrase has gotten, but social company - even if it's necessary, like with a teacher, or with someone I know, like a friend or a parent - scares me, and I can't stand being around other people. I've been worrying at 100km/hr, jumping ahead to weird or illogical conclusions and generally stressing myself out of the realm of sanity. I've been feeling dizzy, and nauseous, and I've lost my appetite and my interest in hobbies that I used to be really passionate about. Every last damn thing bothers me, and things that I would usually be tolerant about make me snap and do irrational things out of irritation and anger. I don't feel like going out with friends, or exercising, or doing anything, really. I go from laughing to crying to absolute mental breakdown to patched-up ""fine"" in a matter of seconds, and every last thing worries me, and I feel like I've been keeping far too many secrets from everyone, especially my parents, and I feel like I'm not good enough, and -

41,"
The first memory I have of my moms boyfriend is the first time he asked me if i could ""put my mouth on it"". Its hard to say exactly how young but i can estimate around the age of 5. it all started with this damn movie, ""the hot chick"" , a corny 2000s movie that should not be played while babysitting your gf's 5 y/o. none the less i totally didn't get the joke but laughed bc i felt like it was the right thing to do and repeated what the movie had said, "" show me yours and ill show you mine."" Thats when he pulled it out. told me its okay. feel it. testing our trust seeing if id comply.

He would ask me... do you know what this is? holding up my moms big pink dildo that most def did NOT fit in me without pain. from all the porn wed watch together i nodded my head and weakly said it goes in here as i point down. i ALWAYS recall the feeling of disgust ugh it makes me feel gross. any way this went on along with oral, petting heavy kissing and penetration with crayons and markers until i was 7.

I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom. i decided this after a tv documentary i stumbled upon brought up rape and defined it . it made me realize what my moms boyfriend was doing to me was very wrong. The next time my mom left me in bed with him before leaving for work he put his boner on my back and kissed on me.I cried and froze up so bad he left me alone. I told her that he had raped me not knowing a better word for molest , my grandma called cps and i had a whole investigation.

I honestly cant remember at least a good year or 2 from that time in my life. just a feeling of confusion and feeling very vulnerable and scared like i was always in trouble.

well my mother didnt believe me. she manipulated me and told me in jail a bunch of guys would hurt her bf and if it wasnt true i could tell cps and make it all go away. thats exactly what i did. so from then on i lived with my mom and her bf all the way until my junior year of high school. growing up he was very sexual with me but not as intense as before bc hes was scared id say something again. no makeing out but like breast caresses butt touches and uncomfortbale comments.

one night when i went to a highschool party my friend got shit faced while i was slighlty buzzed and taking care of her. my moms bf was our ride home that night and my friend was spending the night. she blacked out pissedand puked in my room. i went to apologize for being drunk and fell asleep next to my moms bf and mom in their room.

I starting slowly waking bc i feel something rubbing my torso and suddenly it goes past my waistband of my shorts. i throw his arm off and jump up not wanting to wake my mom 2 feet away. i didnt know what to do with myself so i starting cleaning and cried in the shower. moms bf come out of the room looks really ashamed and just says "" sorry i thought you were your mom"" and goes back to sleep. that was when i was 16.

I became severely depressed and was collapsing. My grades plummeted and i couldnt stop crying in bathrooms. A couple of my teachers i had previous year noticed my change and notified my grade level counselor. I cracked like an egg once she sat me down and asked about what was going on. I was hesitant at first but soon couldnt stop blubbering. they called my mom

CPS case #2 mom sabotages me again. on the day i went to the cps office to talk to the social worker she trains me and encourages me to say im not comfortable enough to talk yet.  
I turned 18 and my cps case was the last thing on my mind. My mom left me to live with my friends and she moved to washingtion to save up money to chase after her bf.

and yes shes back with him. ive been estranged from her for a year now and its still heavy in my heart. Ive accepted the fact that she chose him over me. im okay with it but it doesnt hurt anyless.

44,"I have trust issues that I think came from the fact that I had a really good relationship with my mom up until around the age of 10 when she suddenly became abusive and started taking her job frustrations out on me. 

I can specifically remember one day, after a particularly bad berating, sitting in my room and crying, telling myself over and over again that she didn‚Äôt love me so that the next time she took her anger out on me, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt so much.

However, for years it continued to hurt. It only began to hurt less as the strong affection I once had toward her slowly began to fade and turn into cold apathy. When I reached a point where I no longer wanted her approval, she noticed and got upset. She tried to do anything to win back my approval, and did things like call me a terrible person and say I wasn‚Äôt the same person I used to be. I felt guilty about this and even sometimes tried to fix our relationship, but it never worked in the end.

Anyway, throughout all this time it seems like I‚Äôve lost my ability to trust anyone, or to do basic things like laugh or smile. Whenever I grow close to anyone, this massive fear of being wronged or abandoned develops, and I have to force myself to hide it in every way I can. This fear also causes immense rage on occasion and when it gets activated, I force myself into solitude and stifle it in every way I can. At my very worst, I channel all of my rage inward instead of outward and become self-destructive. I always take it out on myself instead of others because even though it isn‚Äôt my fault that it‚Äôs there, I have to do whatever is necessary to make sure I‚Äôm the only person it affects.

I don‚Äôt know how to have a healthy relationship with literally anyone. I don‚Äôt know how to recognize when people actually value me as a person. People often leave me behind for being to cold or boring, traits I likely developed from being severely socially isolated due to the events in my youth.

I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt try to cultivate relationships with people anymore. It causes too much pain and there‚Äôs too much of a risk involved since my distant exterior is the only things protecting the damaged, compliant part of me that is ready to be walked on and taken advantage of.

I have tried everything in my power to get myself to open up to people and integrate socially in a relatively normal way, but it never works and it‚Äôs been years. I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs now and out of the house, but I still don‚Äôt know how to fix this. Therapy hasn‚Äôt helped.

I know how to cope, but I don‚Äôt know how to enjoy life in ways that I probably should.",08Sep2019,1

46,"So this actually isn't about myself. I have been mostly okay for the better part of a year now and I am very thankful for that. However, someone I am friends with, lets call her Cassy, is very much not OK.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some backstory**

So I go to an alternative education center for high school because I have severe social anxiety. I was always a pretty good kid. Always respectful to people, never got into any violent fights, and even during the darkest times I never resorted to smoking, or drinking, or drugs, or stealing or any of that typical troubled youth stuff. I have my parents to thank for that. But since the alternative education center has a lot of people who have been kicked out of the nearby high school, I get to meet a lot of people who are like that. Of course it is still a very interesting mix. Everybodies depressed, some people are quiet like me, some people are extremely loud and rude and raise hell with everyone including staff, some people never say a word to anyone, and some people are avid drug users.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, belongs to that last group. Cassy is 16 and very sweet for the most part, says sorry too much, will thank you for the smallest things, and loves animals. Shes quiet, but when she's asked to write about something, its not uncommon for her to hand in a 4 page essay when all that was asked for was a paragraph. That was actually what inspired me to write a quote on the wall that reads ""the quietest people have the loudest thoughts"" (we have a wall painted with chalkboard paint in the hall for people to write on -- usually its just racial slurs and swastikas) . But thats getting off track. I met cassy last year. She joined our school about halfway through the year and never talked to anyone that much. She made some friends after a month or so and I became friends with her through them. That's rare for me because with the social anxiety, I average about 15 spoken words a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I first learned that she was smoking weed about a month or so after we became friends. On one of our breaks, she was lighting up a cigarette and said ""I only smoke because I cant bring my bong here haha"". We talked about that for a bit but I never really cared that much, because, well, its just weed. I did think that it was excessive though. She would always be high in the morning and would sometimes even light up a blunt at break. At home she takes hits at least once every one to two hours. often times more, sometimes even back to back to back. At least she did whenever I would hang out with her. She was pretty much never sober. Even during the nights I would get texts from her at 4:30 AM complaining that its cold outside and things along the lines of ""ugh, the things I'll go through to high, man. smh"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then, in the summer, I noticed she was texting kind of weird one night. You know how you can just tell when somethings not right in someones texts? yeah, well, I found out that she had taken LSD with her friend and was mid trip. That worried me, but I kept the way I felt hidden from her because I did't want her to know that. My mom always told me that weed is a common gateway drug to other stuff, and I guess she was right. The last thing I said to her before I went to bed was something along the lines of ""hey, be careful okay?"" (She said her and her friend were going for a walk) and after that I jokingly said ""you better not become a junkie lol"". In my mind, I was worried that she was going to stepping-stone her way up to the real bad sh\*t. The next morning she said that it was a one time thing. That was comforting to me, for the time being. Later on we were talking and I found out that she was planning on doing it again. Annnnd I back to being worried. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

FF to yesterday, now I hear that she's doing MDMA with friends and that one of them had actual f\*\*king heroin in his bag. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**And here we are at the present.**

So, none of that is good. And I know better than just to go up to her and be like ""stop doing drugs"" because I know that isn't going to work, and that shes not just doing it for the lulz, its the result of something else. Which is why I decided to have a conversation with her about it. That's when it all came together.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's what I found out...**

When she was in middle school, she was an outcast. Nobody really talked to her, they all kept her at a distance. She didn't have any friends and that really upset her. In grade 9, she had a boy who smoked show interest in her and because she was so desperate for attention that she agreed to smoke with him out of fear that the only person to ever show interest in her would lose it and she would be right back to the depressing isolation. Unsurprisingly, she got addicted to it. When her parents found out, they handled it in the worst way possible. They threw fits, threw her belongings out the window onto the front lawn, told her it was all her fault when she told them why she did it, got right in her face and screamed at her while she was backed into a corner, and isolated her even more than she already was. When her boyfriend left her after 4 months, she turned to weed to help cope with everything. And that's all she did, until this past summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Cassy is one of the sweetest and most caring friends I have and I really want to help her. Im worried that shes throwing her life away and digging herself into a deeper and deeper hole. I don't want to see that happen. During the talk, I got the impression that she hates herself and doesn't feel like she deserves help. I'm not a therapist, i'm just a dumb 18 year old nerd. I don't know how to be the hero she needs. What do you guys think I should do? Thank you.",08Sep2019,2

It seems that I‚Äôve had a relapse of suicidal ideologies lately as well as increased anxiety.

My main concern is that I‚Äôm thinking about life being pointless again, and how I don‚Äôt have the energy to keep on going and pushing through with things.

Logically, I don‚Äôt want to die, I want to get better, but the tightening in my chest and my thoughts say otherwise.

51,"I‚Äôve had a friend for the last 20 years who I‚Äôm close enough with that I consider him a brother. We‚Äôve both lived with varying degrees of anxiety and depression through our lives for different reasons and I know that what helps me, isn‚Äôt likely to help him because of how different we are. Over the last two years, he‚Äôs gone through some fairly traumatic stuff that he never brought up to anyone and recently it led to being hospitalized for temporary psychosis. Before that, he had been seeing a therapist, but admitted that he hadn‚Äôt told his therapist about any of the stuff he went through, and since he was released from the hospital he‚Äôs been seeing the same therapist, but doesn‚Äôt want to talk about his sessions. I can respect that, but I‚Äôm worrying that he still isn‚Äôt talking about any of his traumas. He‚Äôs distancing himself from all but me and another friend (while complaining about feeling very lonely), and only ever talks about quantum physics (his long time passion), refusing to talk about anything else. He gets upset with us if we happen to be busy when he wants to hang out even if we‚Äôre working, but then doesn‚Äôt want to make plans with us when we‚Äôre free. 

I‚Äôm worried that he‚Äôs not taking his mental health seriously because fixating and avoiding social situations is VERY out of character for him.

I‚Äôve tried to just be there and let him know that if he wants to talk about anything, I‚Äôm listening. I‚Äôve helped him with stuff around his house and gave him rides to and from appointments while he was still being treated by hospital staff.

61,"Over the past year and a half, i've gone through big changes in my life. It began when my ex-girlfriend broke up with me.

Background: my life with the ex was incredibly monotonous. It was my place or her place,just the two of us. No friends. Neither one of is had made any close friends during collage. Then it ended. Never knew from her again. At least not directly.

I moved to a new house with new neighbors, started getting back in touch with old friends amd got a part time job. (BTW I'm studying in Germany and come from south America) i also started exercising and changed my diet.

All well and good. I have more money. More friends. Lost 13kg and look 100x better. BUT i have a TERRIBLE relationship with food. I have gone back and forth with counting calories and intuitive eating. I don't overeat. But food is in MY mind ALL THE TIME. The classic ""I'm not done with my breakfast yet and I'm already thinking about lunch"" situation. 

It even interferes with my sleep. I go to bed at 10... because i wanna eat breakfast. I wake up multiple times every night... look at the clock and think: ""dang is only 3AM, still 3-4h before breakfast"". Its insane. I barely get 6h of sleep. For no other reason than... breakfast?

And holy smokes the anxiety. When i eat is a mix of pleasure and anxiety... like.. I'm finally doing it but this meal has to last me for 4h before i can eat again.... 

The funny thing is... I'm losing weight... i eat a ton but my lifestyle is very active. But since I eat 95% clean... with tons of veggies... i can't shove any more food without feeling sick. That and the fact that I'm terrified of gaining weight even while being underweight.

And that sucks because I'm bi. Also he has never been there for me emotionally. And can go on and on about how awful he is in my mind but the real reasons I think I have some sort of mental illness are the following: I've almost killed myself multiple times ever since I was like 7 for no good reason, I like pain sometimes idk, sometimes I just go blank sometimes like I can still think and stuff but I feel nothing, I have anxiety ,I'm pretty sure I have Stockholm syndrome,I believe I can speak to a certain dead rapper,I've been obsessed over this girl i probably made cry the one time we talked, i stay up until ridiculous times,and something that probably doesn't help I listen to a lot of weird music mostly just noise,but probably the worst of all, I want to be insane, idk why I just have a passionate desire to be crazy 

Anyway ik half this is probably some teenage angst shit but my life has been incredibly lonely for the past four years because probably idk how to talk to ppl normally. I'm not going to deny I'm doing this for attention, because I need some I've to the realization of, and I'm too scared to do anything about it. Thanks",08Sep2019,2

64,"I‚Äôve dealt with depression and severe stress for the past few years now but recently I‚Äôve started hearing a voice in my dead. The voice usually tells me that I‚Äôm useless, I‚Äôd be better off dead, everyone is just putting up with me, or that I‚Äôm a waste of space. There are times where it sound feminine and others where it sound masculine. 

I never really paid mind to it until recently. I was sitting in chem class on Friday after a really bad day at school. I missed class last Friday and had found out there was a paper I was supposed to turn in but didn‚Äôt get it in the first place. When the teacher gave it to me I started getting overwhelmed with how hard the problems looked (bunch of density, mass, and volume equations). As the teacher went over then I kept getting more confused and lost. This is when I started hearing the voice clearer

It started with calling me stupid, then about how my parents were going to be pissed that I was falling behind, and slowly getting worse until all I heard was the deafening sound of it saying I was a useless, troublesome, waste of space that was a burden to everyone around me. I started crying and the voice kept getting louder and it‚Äôs insults kept hitting closer to home. Of course I was trying to say it wasn‚Äôt true but it was almost like I was having to talk over a bully trying to drown out my voice with verbal abuse and a speaker. 

I‚Äôm almost scared because the voice seems like a whole different person then me",08Sep2019,3
65,"I haven‚Äôt seen my older brother in a few years and we usually keep in contact but up until recently he had completely disappeared. Nobody knew where he was but, every once in a while he would contact my dad and then disappear again. I‚Äôm not entirely sure about what caused him to cut off contact with his family but, I was extremely concerned for his well being. My brother has never exhibited signs of any type of mental illness but I won‚Äôt say that he doesn‚Äôt have some underlying issue. A few weeks ago my brother called me via Facebook messenger and he was acting pretty unusual. He was rambling about people trying to kill him and other things of that nature. At this point I am on high alert because I wasn‚Äôt expecting that type of behavior from my brother. Normally he‚Äôs upbeat and soft spoken but his demeanor portrayed anything but that. Today, he calls my dad asking him to get him and my dad goes to pick him up. I was somewhat excited to see my brother but I was also anxious because of our previous encounter. It‚Äôs even worse than I thought. It‚Äôs difficult for me to describe how he‚Äôs acting because I‚Äôm so upset about his mental health but, I‚Äôm going to try to the best of my ability. First, he was constantly pacing through out the house. He thinks his ex wife is coming to pick him up which is strange because she doesn‚Äôt live in the same state nor has he talked to her in some years. He keeps saying things that are just unusual I can‚Äôt repeat them because I‚Äôm at a loss for words. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with him because he can‚Äôt hold a simple conversation. I‚Äôm so distraught over this because I hate seeing someone I love in this state and I want do is help but, I don‚Äôt know how.

67,"i am about to turn seventeen, i am the epitome of privileged. my parents gave me legacy from princeton and harvard (undergrad) and columbia and stanford (grad). they‚Äôve paid thousands to private tutors for me to get the near perfect sat score that i got this past august. i have phenomenal grades, in the top 3% of my class, and excel in my extra curriculars. 

a lot of my peers consider me fashionable and chic. i have expensive, top of the line makeup only from nordstrom, my mom flies me to LA every six months to get my hair straight permed, and i‚Äôve never left a shopping mall without spending at least $400 on clothes alone. 

my sweet sixteen birthday party cost $1,000 and that was excluding the brand new car i got as a present. i drive it every night to an 11,000 square foot home and to a prepared dinner with two loving parents.

i have all of this, yet i always crave for more. in my head i‚Äôve constructed a perfect image of who i am and what i want to be. my pride be damned if anything tarnished this imagine. 

i have cheated on countless exams and manipulated others to maintain my class rank. 

i‚Äôve lied to my parents and stolen their credit card countless times because the night before, i had a panic attack believing i didn‚Äôt have enough of anything. 

i‚Äôve stolen money from my 12 year old sister‚Äôs piggy bank. i‚Äôve tricked my senile grandparents to giving me $800 for shopping. 

i‚Äòve spent $200 in a week on simply food alone (no, not groceries). 

my materialism and greed are insatiable. i feel no twinge of pain when i spend $280 on a pair of jeans. i don‚Äôt believe i am spoiled; i believe i am so much worse. i have no boundaries when it comes to getting what i want; i‚Äôve broken the law to get a foundation i had been eyeing for only a week. i can‚Äôt control myself with money. it‚Äôs got its hands around my throat and it alone dictates when i can breathe. i‚Äôm spiraling out of control and deep inside, i know i‚Äôm going to self-destruct as soon as i step into college. maybe it‚Äôs my obsession with perfection and my insecurity that i‚Äôm not enough that drives me to uphold a pristine persona; that the more i spend, the less cracks and less weak spots i‚Äôll have in my facade. but i realize that i will not be able to keep this up forever, and no amount of money is going to stop the day i crumble. i know that money cant buy everything. 

but at the same time i can‚Äôt stop. 

i know having too much money to spend is exactly the problem some people want i‚Äôm aware of how hideously privileged i am. but my greed and guilt are eating me from the inside out, and i fear the day it will completely consume me. 

i am currently listening to podcasts on money management and studying bible verses on greed and gratitude. i am trying to be better, but i‚Äôm so fucking afraid i won‚Äôt become better quick enough.",08Sep2019,9

I instantly (mentally) freak out and jump to the worst conclusion he‚Äôs cheating on me. In reality I know that‚Äôs not true we spend 5-6 days a week together for 12 hours a day and he would never. But my mind does that dumb shit where I can‚Äôt let it go. It‚Äôs to the point where my anxiety and depression overrides all other thoughts and feelings. And I can‚Äôt control it. A part of me wants to make myself the person I know I can be. But the other part is so scared and tired and well mostly self sabotaging. Idk what to do anymore. It‚Äôs like I have an inner part of me telling me to do horrible things to myself. And when that happens I want to cut everyone out of my life before I hurt them.

Focuses on unrealistic goals

Is pessimistic in tone and content

Reinforces the problem label

Is disempowering.

Gets it off your chest

Allows you to be believed and understood

Includes a willingness to see problems as normal 

Sees a problem as something you have, not something you are.

78,"I'm a 16 year old highschool boy. I recently barely made it to the highschool thanks to my low grades, the reason being my OCD coming in my way to live a productive life. I had it since a very young age but none noticed it, but now when i look back i know what it was. With the start of 2019, it grew exponentially and is now the biggest problem of my life that i can't run from  because it dwells within me. My thoughts and compulsions take up a huge chunk of my day, now i feel weird when I'm not feeling afraid and anxious. I don't know but i abruptly become very positive for some seconds then i become negative again. Recently I started getting a lot of nightmares, sometimes 3 different nightmares in one night, so I made the hard decision to avoid sleep as much as possible. Day by day I'm becoming more depressed and getting really tired of my life, moreover my academic downfall  isn't a less of a problem. For not feeling dull I started watching too much content on YouTube, movies and animes (for some reason i don't know i get bored in seconds from social media sites and video games), it took me out of my reality and sent me in a new world, but as soon i closed my electronic device, dullness and negativity again occupied me, of course it's a self evident fact that  it was just an escape and not a solution. But whenever i try to do something productive that i used to love earlier and could do whole day, now negative thoughts fill in my brain and i just quit doing anything productive. Moreover now I've begin to talk too much to myself, i spend majority of my time doing so in school and at night. One thing that i do in particular is to make avatars of real people in my head and interact with them in an imaginative setting/world.

But the thing that makes my situation worse is that nobody knows about my situation not even friends and family, I've kept it a secret at an expense of potential help as I don't have the courage, I don't know how to put in words but I feel ashamed whenever i try to tell anyone, i feel as if i tell my friends then I'll just become a victim and if i tell my family then it'd just give them unecessary problems and create drama. If i tell my school counselor then my parents and others would come to know about it.
Moreover, people will inevitably judge me somewhere.

When I thought it couldn't get worse, my school faculty stepped in and tried their best to kick me out of the school for bad academic performance and arguing too much with faculty, but fortunately they didn't and gave me a last chance. 

My family and teachers (who are good people) are also becoming resentful towards me due to my bad academic performance and weird behaviour (which is a result of my OCD, but they aren't aware of that and think it's just my bad behaviour). I also have a sister and she's better than me in every single way, my family, teachers, relatives and even friends love her, and constantly compare me to her. Of course I'm not blaming people around me for acting in a specific way, how can i blame them when i myself am starting to resent a part of myself and my actions, they are doing the logical and expected thing, they are acting like that because of very justifiable reasons. 

The reason i wrote it is that i just wanted to say something that I've kept inside for too long and now it was becoming corrosive. The beauty of the Internet is that you have the option of wearing the mask of anonymity, i just wanted to tell something that i can't in my personal life.
I know practically  I can't get any help from Reddit, I'm aware of the fact that I should seek professional help. It's truly said that this world owes you nothing, and I'm responsible for myself and my problems so it's my job and not others' to fix my problems, I'll soon be 18 and move out, and when it happens i hope to get professional help.

For most of my life anxiety has ruled over me, preventing me from finding friends, going out and just making regular things more difficult. 

Well in the last 2 or so years the paranoia really started to creep in and I began to constantly think others were not to be trusted and made some very extreme things up in my head about how certain things would happen and I was in danger.

Now it's got to a point where I don't know what to think.

I'm very irrational, I constantly have ideas that people are trying to hurt me or that they hate me, regardless of if they are being friendly or not, I don't feel safe.

I have learned to cope with these issues somewhat, today I'm really struggling but as a whole, I function fairly well despite the paranoia.

be taken with a grain of salt but just want to see what others may think as well.

I am going to describe things that I have done in my lifetime from the time that I

was an infant all the way up until today. Please share your thoughts or ideas.

Family history of mental illness: My Uncle committed suicide. He had what I believe

to be severe anxiety due to the fact that if something bothered him it made him physically

sick. Throwing up when worried about something.

My Maternal Great Grandmother had Dementia and Schizophrenia.

My Maternal Grandfather had Dementia and Schizophrenia.

Maternal Great Aunt was just plain ole bat shit crazy. No clue what she had

My Paternal side of the family is unknown as I have never met my Father or any of his

family.

 

As an Infant

\_Would only take 20 minute power naps as my mom called them

\_Cried and screamed all night as an infant with colic would do

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a small child all the way until now. These are in no particular order

(All actions described below go far beyond the normal reactions of normal

kids. All actions were to the utmost extreme)  

&amp;#x200B;

\_Never woke up in the morning in a good mood. Would scream and

cry just because I had to get up

\_Would not get out of bed until my mother screamed at me or threatened

me

\_Would totally destroy my bedroom or playroom and refuse to clean it up

Would not go back into the room until my mother cleaned it and then it was 

a repeat cycle. Still to this day I do not clean up after myself. EVER

\_Anytime I made a mistake on homework from school I would tear my paper up

and lose my shit and self control then blame everyone else for why I made the mistake. 

\_Beg for food and then not eat it.

\_Hoard food in my room and throw the food wrappers under my bed

\_If my mom told me to do something I would never do it until yelled at.

If she told me not to do something. I was hell bent on doing it and did 

not care of the consequences.

\_Lied and said that my sister hit me when she never touched me.

\_Threatened to kill my mother with a knife I pulled out of the kitchen drawer.

Thankfully it was a butter knife. I was 6 or 7 when this happened.

\_Totally showed no respect for anyone. I would tell my mom that I hated her.

Tell my sister that I wish she was dead and within 10 minutes of saying these

things would go to my mom and ask her to love on me or ask my sister to play with

me. As if I had never said these things

\_My Grandmother is hard of hearing and if she ask me to repeat myself I lose

my shit on her for having to say everything to her twice.

\_Learned how to read when I was 3 years old. 

\_Was tested for Advanced Placement in 1st grade due to being smarter than others

my age. Made average grades in highschool. Now I am in college and have a hard time.

\_Always lazy and no desire to do anything. Maybe once a month I get a desire to 

clean my room but never follow through and finish it.

\_Never finish anything that I start.

\_Severe mood swings from literally one minute to the next. One minute I am fine

the next minute I am crying about something.

\_Feel as though everyone is yelling at me when they are not.

\_Always complaining of stomach hurting, head hurting, back hurting. Every single day

something else is hurting. 

\_Do not even feel like getting out of bed to go to work or school. I've called out several

times from my job

\_I can sleep 12 hours and always feel so tired and unmotivated to do anything

\_Would come home from school and go to bed at 4 and would sleep until the next 

morning without waking up.

\_Personal hygiene goes from homeless to beauty queen. Just depends on my mood.

Most of the time its its the homeless look I decide on.

\_Get extremely mad and hateful towards my bosses at work over any and everything

\_Very immature for my age now. I seriously act like a 5 year old sometimes if I 

dont get my way.

\_I had to have everything that my friends had. If they got a new phone I had to have

a new phone. If they got new clothes I had to get new clothes. I did not care that

my mother did not have the money for these things. If I did not get them I called her

a bitch, told her I hated her and told her she did not love me because she would

not buy these things for me.

\_Would not and still have a hard time speaking to people that I do not know.

\_Always worried and anxious about things that were of no importance and did 

not give a shit about the major things that I should worry about.

\_Lost every library book that I ever checked out. I can have something in my hand

lay it down for literally a minute and lose it. I have no idea where I put it and then

I totally lose it when I cant find it.

\_Nightmares to where I scream out in the middle of the night but do not wake up

\_Excessive talking in my sleep

\_Able to control myself at school, church or other peoples house but when I get home I 

unleash all built up anger and rage on my family and don't think I should suffer consequences

\_Instead of doing my laundry I just go buy new clothes

\_Constant fear of making my mother mad

&amp;#x200B;

The other side of me

\_Loves to buy things for kids that need help like school supplies, Angel tree gifts for 

kids at Christmas time.

\_I have a huge heart at times when I am in a good mood.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few of the things that I can think of off the top of my head but there

is so so much more I could describe. 

Although I am aware I do these things and am truly regretful afterwards but I feel

like the victim. Even though I am sorry for my actions I always end up feeling like

everyone hates me and everyone is out to get me even though I know they dont hate me. They

hate the way I act.

My mother told me she could tell there was something seriously wrong with me by age 3.

She was a single mother barely scrapping by with raising two kids alone and did not 

have the money to get me the care that I needed. 

This resulted in my mother losing patience with me on a daily basis.

Discipline was always getting spanked sometimes with a belt because she had

no idea how to handle me.

I still flinch when she makes a sudden move.",08Sep2019,1

89,"Dear redditors,

I am a 24 years old male from Switzerland who is having a really rough time since more than a year now. Every day I wake up completly exhausted and wasted, no matter how much I sleep and when I go to bed. I`ve made thousands of medical examinations to a point where it does not make sense to dig any further into that anymore. Just to give you an overview, I make a list for what I have been tested for:

-several complete blood tests (vitamins, minerals, etc..) 
-multiple sclerosis (MS) 
-thyroid 
-apnea (2 sleep overs in two different sleep clinics)
-CT/MRI scans
-lyme disease
-celiac disease
-stool tests for bacteria and fungus
-allergies
-examination of my pyche 

What the doctors found out is:

1) Gilbert's Syndrome (should not be responsible for the above described symptoms though)
2) DAO enzyme is quite low in blood samples which could be an indication for histamine intolerance
3) Minor cat epithel allergy (i have a cat but I never get the typical symptoms like itchy kinda feelings and running nose etc)
4) Polysomnography finding 1 was: AHI 18 - - &gt; upper airway resistance syndrome (from of obstructive apnea found especially in young adults who are not overweight and snoring is no requirement). This finding has been made from a quite untrustworthy sleep clinic with specialization in surgery. Finding number 2 was: mild central sleep apnea with a lot of arousals which are not breathing related. AHI was 12 and they meant that it could come from stress or anxiety which could be true. This sleep clinic suggested to take medication against anxiety. I tried some benzodiazepines before going to bed to see if its gonna get better but with no success at all.
5) Mild depression and mild generalized anxiety (i have been more depressed in the past but never experienced non restorative sleep in combination with daytime sleepiness)

I dont feel depressed at the moment to be honest so I think that this is a physical problem. No doctor found something essential that could be logically responsible for my symptoms. I am at a point where completely giving up is not far away anymore as I am running out of guesses and tries to be able to live a normal life again. I used to be highly energetic and did really enjoy my life but now everything changed. I am sleepy every second and my motivation goes down frok day to day as I cant see the light anymore.

In my opinion my problems could be caused by something of the following: depression (even if its not that obvious), allergy to certain foods/ingredients (even if it could only be histamine in my case), apnea (maybe an AHI of 12 is enough and it could really occur spontanously) and allergy (wouldnt make too much sense though). 

I really need your help and I am happy about every input from every person here on reddit, as my doctors cant really help me.

I thank every one in advance!

90,"I'm feeling the best I've felt in years now that I've found a medication combination that works with minimal side effects. I'm eating again, I have energy and I've got motivation to sort out my physical health. I'm not asking for help here, just venting a bit. (I have borderline PD btw)

My only issue is, I'm just so anxious I can barely leave the house. If I don't have an appointment, I just won't be able to leave the house without breaking down (and even then I leave the house so late I have no choice but to drive instead of catch the bus if I want to make it on time) I keep cancelling on hanging with friends. I invite people over though (not that they're free) so I at least have company. Mum managed to drag me to the shops with her and while it was nice the first 5 mins, I got overwhelmed by all the people and within 30 mins I was begging mum for the keys so I could go to the car (she just said to hang in there as she was nearly done). Dad asks me to cook dinner, I have a panic attack whenever I try leave the house to get ingredients, to the point where I have to ring dad and ask him to get stuff or he comes home and has to try get me in the car so I can get stuff. I just get exhausted being outside. 

I feel absolutely great though when I'm not panicking. I can feel emotions, I can enjoy things, I actually have an appetite again, I don't feel overwhelmed by emotions, I even have motivation to get fit again and start doing physio on my knee again as it's become really weak after a few years.",08Sep2019,4
91,"I‚Äôm an INFP, and I‚Äôm very independent. I love people, but I need time to myself and I hate when other people do stuff for me. My goal here is to give a few examples and to see if anyone else here has a similar problem because I frankly just have no clue why I‚Äôm like this.

Example A:
I‚Äôm a student but I work part time at a movie theater. I like to be given a task to do. When my manager tells me something to do, I do it well. But if someone is watching over my shoulder, I get annoyed and anxious. If I am working at the cash register and I say something to a customer but am corrected by a coworker, I also get angry because I just like to do things my way.

Example B:
I used to be in a study hall at school, where we would all sit in a quiet room and we had to do homework. But if anything, that made me not get my homework done. For some reason, having the teacher walking around making sure I was working on homework really stressed me out and I often wouldn‚Äôt get anything done. But once I moved to a free period, I would always go sit in the library and be very motivated to do my homework. 

Example C: 
I‚Äôm in the process of applying to colleges and my parents seem to have taken over the situation. Every week we have a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù which is pretty much them watching me fill out a certain part of my application. Today my mom told me to write a part of my essay, but that really stressed me out so I asked her if I could do it later on my own time and she said that I had to do it now. Then she left to go to the store and I just went up to my room and cried. 

I don‚Äôt know what it is that just makes me crash whenever people tell me how to do things, but it needs to stop. I think my mental health is suffering and I feel useless whenever one of these situations happens. Does anyone else have this problem? What can I do about it?",08Sep2019,0

93,"I need serious advice and help please:

Hello. I have a friend who currently lives in a Michigan  while I live all the way on the west coast. He suffers from depression, anxiety, and strong suicidal thoughts. I know that he often comes very close to ending it, but I do believe deep down that he doesn't want to.

Last night he send me a text message apologizing for everything and said goodbye to me. I didn't see his message until an hour or so after he sent it but I frantically called him and tried to get ahold of his family thorough Facebook. At this time it was midnight his time and his family was asleep.

I called the local police and had them do a welfare check as he would not answer my calls. After sending the police, he did answer my call, said he talked to he police and his parents, and thanked me for calling as it kind of opened the door for further discussion in seeking help with his parents.

This morning I woke up to a message from his mom, thanking me for taking action. She said they sat down after midnight (after cops came) and discussed a plan.

The problem is: he is an adult, living at home, does not have a job, and therefore, does not have insurance. I know my brief story does not share the full details but his current mental state right now is what is keeping him from taking on a job at the moment.

I know that he is very interested in trying esketamine (Spravato) as there have been hopeful success stories with this prescription. (He has been in countless different prescriptions and has visited countless doctors and therapists but has not found anything that works well.) Unfortunately Spravato is a very costly prescription that he and his family cannot afford. In trying to help him, I'm trying to find out:

Does anyone have any ideas about Michigan state health care assistance to those who are adults, do not live alone, and do not work due to health reasons? Or even prescription assistance?

I keep seeing restrictions like he would need to include his family's income on a Medicaid application which will probably disqualify him.

I am welcome to any and all advice. I cannot stress enough that this is not a person who brings up suicide around for attention. He is really struggling and I really want to help him find him solid resources ASAP.

Thank you!",08Sep2019,4

96,"I just came across this sub reddit and a common theme here is individuals asking for help and not receiving any. I myself am an individual with mental health challenges and I wanted to reach out and offer some support. I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia but I am in recovery (yes this is such a thing) from my diagnosis and I am living a full life. I work for a couple non profits that support my peers (other people with mental health challenges). I wanted to throw a couple resources out there that have helped me and that I have seen help other people. I recognize not one thing could work for everyone as we are all very unique so here's a couple of different ideas. The first is looking into the National Alliance On Mental Illness in your area. All over the US there should be a branch near you. They offer free support groups and class and they also have something called a warm line where you can call and ask for mental health advice and resources. secondly, even if you're not feeling suicidal, the national suicide prevention hotlines have some great people on there that will listen to anyone no matter what they're going through and offer support. Lastly, I would recommend researching ""peer support"" or ""peer counseling"" in your area. These are people that have been where you have been and often offer valid one on one or group support.
For international people I got you too. I live in the US but I do know of a couple international mental health resources. The first being the clubhouse, this is an international mental health club where people can find their community and as a bonus develop job skills. The other resource I know of that exists internationally is the hearing voices network. this is for individuals that hear voices or have auditory hallucinations. 
I wish I knew more about international services.


This was long winded but I hope that helps. 

TL;DR
YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS! &lt;3",08Sep2019,8
97,"I recently started going to college, and my dad still pushes and forces me to ‚Äústudy hard‚Äù for my classes, which he has done for 8 years now, since middle school. I know he might want the best for me and my future/career, but I‚Äôve really had enough of him forcing me to do things I don't enjoy doing. And yes, his efforts and disciplined personality probably helped me to be really good at math and science, and helped me to get into a good university, but I didn't wanna take this path and I was scared (mostly by my parents, probably a Middle-eastern and Asian thing) to not go to college. 

In middle school (back in middle east), I always had A's without studying and half the time doing hw late or not doing it at all. Whenever my dad was home, he would always check me to make sure I'm studying for classes (I mostly pretended), doing hw, and getting good grades. But whenever he wasn't home I would always watch YT videos off of my phone, play video games, or watch TV, and still maintain good grades. Classes' contents were usually natural and easy to me that I would use common sense all the time while taking quizzes and tests, and to understand the content.

In 8th grade, It was the time to take the standardized test for a high school placement in the country I lived in. Even though I knew I was most probably gonna start going to high school in the U.S., I still (kind of) studied and got around %95 correct under the pressure of my dad and my peers/teachers. And of course, the result didn't even matter because I was going to U.S. and it was not that significant to my dad since other kids (tiny bit of my class) got %95-100 out of the test.

Fast forward, same old bullshit, boring, and tiring 4-year life -taking AP classes and college credit courses,- I lived through high school with force and pressure. It was the time to take the SAT and apply to colleges. I didn't give my best performance into studying/taking SAT and applying to colleges (indeed, applying last minute,) and still got into a very good university. Now I'm experiencing college, and just second week into the first year, my dad told me that I always have and had horrible time management and I am not giving my best, even though I told him that I was going to classes 30-40 minutes early and was almost done with my hw. 

I don't know what to do. I always found an escape from this pressure (caused by school/teachers and my dad) by crying and binge-eating (gained me 30 pounds), crying while thinking of the death of my grandfather (whom I loved the most cause he always would respect and let me do whatever I want, and probably would help me a lot through tough times)(Now I'm crying while typing this as well.) I also found an escape by crying while thinking about killing my self by swallowing a cup full of medicine, roping my self, or even cutting my wrists. (Didn't actually do these of course)

*Don't worry, I won't hurt myself, because I had these come-and-go thoughts for 4 years now. But I need advice on what I should do. And I don't wanna let people around me know about these, so don't suggest me to tell friends/family or go to a psychologist.

***SELF DIAGNOSE and MORE STORIES***:

-I have some type of anger and mental disorder (or periodic breakdowns) causing me to get depressed, sometimes frustrate over someone's little actions (wouldn't get frustrated normally.)

-Maybe OCD as well: I try to correct and do over and over specific things, such as while typing, spacing and deleting the same space to make sure I have pressed spacebar only once, and when I was young, I would relocate a phone on a table to fit the pattern of the table cloth, and when reading a book, re-reading the same paragraph or even the whole page over and over (this might be attention disorder.) *Ik, it may sound like I am listing whatever disorder I have in mind, but believe me, I have all of these symptoms and other symptoms too.*

-Sometimes, all of a sudden, I get a sense and feeling and start crying for 5-10 mins, or the sense comes and I cry for 4-5 sec, drop couple of tears, and stop crying.

-These ""mental disorders"" I have, might be coming from birth, or some or all of these might be (most probably) developed by the pressure I lived through. Mostly while I was in mid-school, my dad would get angry to me and use his strength towards me: sometimes slapped me in the face, screamed to my face, or pushed me on my shoulder real-hard. His this kind of actions made me feel like shit and wanted to die or get sick so that I wouldn't go to school and sleep on my bed all-day-long, or get so sick that my dad actually would feel sorry about me and love me again. To get sick, I would wear 5-6 layers of socks and many layers of winter clothing until I wouldn't fit in any other clothes, head to bed, and cover my whole body with a really thick quilt. I was, and sometimes I am so dedicated to negatively affect and cause harm to myself.

-Also, whenever I was depressed, both in middle and high school (and still today), I would listen to sad songs or emotional songs so that I would cry and get more depressed and cry more and more.

-My dad also travelled a handful of countries with his friends and rarely with my mom, and didn't even take me and my sibling to any of those countries; his reasoning was that we would get behind classes and ""miss important stuff"" in MIDDLE SCHOOL.

My dad gave me some type of discipline and many opportunities such as education in the U.S., sports &amp; activities, etc. On the other side, he forced me too much that I started hating him and the academics in general. Lastly, my past life and people affected my psychology a lot.

107,"I'll try to keep this brief and be respectful of your time.  I have been struggling a lot this year and am asking this kind community if they can chime in on what they think might be going on.  

I struggled with mental health a bit as a teenager.  Mostly a bit of general anxiety, social anxiety and low level depression.  I was on and off SSRIs and nothing too extreme was happening.  

Drank a lot in college and also used nicotine pretty heavily from 18-31.  Things started to get strange once I quit smoking.  I had a period of extreme anxiety in which I couldn't listen to music or watch anything serious on TV because they would just cause overwhelming feelings of anxiety inside of me.  This lasted for a couple months but then leveled off.  

Last year I began to smoke marijuana and did so pretty steadily for 5 months.  I felt great while I was doing it at the time.  One night in december while high, my wife told me about a coworker who just got diagnosed with cancer and I had a slight panic attack and was convinced that I had rectal cancer. I wasn't able to get in to see a doctor for a couple months so I was convinced of my diagnosis and ruminated on it constantly.  Afraid to be alone, afraid of my own thoughts, afraid of everything. Became quite scared, depressed and thoughts of suicide arose which scared me even more.  I got in to see the doctor and he reassured me that I was fine and it was just anxiety.  Prescribed me an SSRI, then something else, then a different SSRI. 

Since that night in December, I have had a very slight recovery from the anxiety, but now I have a pretty constant fear of being alone and I still can't listen to very much music/ watch tv. Also have a huge fear of the winter and what it will bring.  I feel very unmotivated and am having a hard time picturing what the rest of my life might bring (sort of living day to day). My brain also gets overwhelmed very easily and a lot of days I feel on the verge of tears. 

I've been seeing a therapist for about 6 months but I'm not sure its helping.  He seems to think that it is a physiological issue and that my anxiety is caused by my depression and the fear that i'm going to kill myself.  Has anyone experience this sort of depression along with fear of being alone, fear of music, fear of TV, fear of suicide, fear of change/anything new?

I just don't know where to turn anymore and I want to get back to my old self but don't even know what's wrong with me?  Depression? Anxiety? Schizophrenia?  Everything just feels so hard.  Any advice would be appreciated.",08Sep2019,1

I do feel a bit better for having typed it out. I wasn't sure about actually posting it but, I still can't bring myself to talk with anyone I know. Maybe some social interaction with strangers will lift my mood some?

Enjoy the bitchfest, sorry that it rabbit-trails everywhere.

\- - -

I feel like shit. Everything feels unstable. I feel like my brain's been dissolving into a thick, soupy fog, and I keep wandering around in the same circles, unable to see where I'm going. Sometimes I'll hit a clear space and think that I'm finally out of it, but then I stumble back into the mist a few steps later.

None of my normal coping mechanisms are helping, so hey, maybe a good old-fashioned word-vomit is what I could use. Posted online, for a ton of strangers to read. It's really weird how easy it can be, being so open with total strangers, innit?

I don't know what I want out of this. A pat on the back and an 'it's gonna be okay'? A 'get your shit together'? Maybe I'm just screaming on a stage for the sake of screaming. Fuck. 

Maybe social interaction with people I don't have faces for or pre-existing feelings towards will help. With you all, I don't feel that ingrained sense of guilt and shame for not doing well. That sense of failure that comes when you start doing better for yourself, then backslide back to where you were before. I haven't spoken to any of them in, what, a week now? I keep promising to not shut people out and then I go and pull this shit. 

A lot of y'all probably empathize me on that, you poor fuckers. Sucks to be us, yeah?

I have Clinical Depression, and General Anxiety Disorder. Maybe Aspergers, but that's undiagnosed and I haven't brought it up to my Psych yet. I'll probably get to that later. I've been mainly focusing on the depression and anxiety.

I was doing better for a while, and then I just... stopped. 

I went to my Psych. Got meds prescribed, took 'em for a bit, had another appointment, got another prescription filled. It was all over the course of about three months?

The meds sure helped my anxiety, but not my depression. It wasn't 'til then that I'd realized, my anxiety often kept me motivated where my depression would have otherwise kept me down. I should have talked to my Psych about it on my next visit, but I'd already missed a couple days, and I said 'fuck it' and just stopped taking them. Like a dumbass. 

PSA: DON'T STOP TAKING YOUR MEDS COLD TURKEY KIDS IT'S A DUMB IDEA AND YOU MAY HURT YOURSELF OR GET DEAD.

Fortunately I wasn't taking anything that fucked me up that bad. Now I just feel mildly shittier than I did before, and much more disappointed in myself. 

I've missed my last Psych appointment. It was... holy *shit*, it was a *month* ago. I go to a free place, the Helen-Ross McNabb Center, and I've been fucking terrified to call because I'm 95% certain that me no-call-no-showing put me on the 'sorry we can't help ya anymore' list. If it wasn't then, me going no-contact for a month probably has. I really need to call. Maybe they'll understand? Or maybe they'll understand and not be able to do anything 'cause them's the rules. It's so much easier to make the worst happen for yourself instead of trying to make things better and failing in the end. Failure and rejection fucking terrify me. Which I guess is why I live in it, even if it makes me feel like shit. It's familiar and if I know where it is, I don't have to worry about it coming.

Motivation. I don't have it. The fire inside that makes you want to do anything, really. Passion. It's just, gone. My motivation, passion, should be caring about myself and my happiness, but I just... don't. I don't feel passionate about my own well-being. I feel worse about disappointing others than I do not taking care of myself.

The desire to take care of myself and do better is there, don't get me wrong. I just want to be generally content and secure in my life. That's all. 

But, there's just no passion behind it. It's a car with no fuel, and I'm sitting in the driver's seat staring sullenly at the map instead of walking to the nearest gas station to re-fuel. With the gas-station being, y'know, help and support, in the metaphor.

Fuck, I'm supposed to be drawing right now, not bitching on reddit. ""I can totally make a living off commissions,"" my ass. I should have applied for another godforsaken customer service job after WalMart canned me, but noooooooo, I'm gonna be a Real Artist (tm)! I can TOTALLY buckle down and make money off my art! I'm definitely in a stable mental place to do that and not deluding myself! 

The sad part is, it's not for lack of skill, nor lack of people wanting to commission me. I'm just too much of a useless fuck to actually do the art part. I'm not happy with anything I make, which doesn't matter, because I NEED to finish these, I'm broke and hungry and sick of plain fucking pasta, dammit, I NEED that $180, why is this so goddamned difficult?! 

Is it because drawing has always been my happy thing, my calming thing, my 'I can put a piece of myself into the world' thing, and I stopped drawing when I stopped feeling happy or calm or like a piece of me was worth putting out into the world?

Well, that was easy. Ha. Here I am, easily answering my own questions and not doing anything with the answers. Hell. Hell in a hand-basket. I'm painfully self-aware of my issues, y'know. I'm good at sitting down and dissecting my feelings. What's the word? Introspection?  

But, yeah. After almost a decade of learning to create real characters with depth and histories and motivations, I started turning that inwards and learning to pick myself apart, much to my own annoyance. Asking myself the same questions I ask about characters to probe deeper into what makes them, them. For instance, here's something positive: I managed to sort out my shitty history with mom and dad in my own head, figure out how my upbringing affected me today, and forgive them on my own, no therapy needed! I realized the people that they were, that fucked me up, were unprepared kids with too much on their plates already, that don't exist any more. 

I'm lucky enough to have parents that were basically mental kids when they had me, but still managed to grow up into stable and happy people that I can rely on today, even if I couldn't then. And I'm happy for them. I just wish they hadn't shunted their issues onto me before getting them fixed in their own lives, leaving me to learn to deal with it in mine. So I love them, but will also give a half-hearted 'fuck you guys' 'cause I'm still damn salty about all this baggage I don't need.

I rabbit-trailed there. But, yeah, I'm really self-aware of my thoughts and how things affect me and how I respond to them and I hate it. It's like there's a tiny me bottled up in the center of my brain, able to see everything going on inside but not able to do anything about it.

Pfff, ffffeck. I still wanna type but where do I go from here. Oh, right, earlier! This is something I've yet to address with my Psych.

So, I'm relatively certain I have Asperger's--not in the fucking, goddamn quirky *'hee hee I'm autistic look at me I'm special'* tumblr self-diagnosed way. I was VERY averse to the idea that I may have Asperger's because I spent most of my early teens on tumblr, where I first learned of and heard of other people's experiences with Aspergers. My immediate response to many of the posts I read was *'oh fuck it's me'*. I was starting to get an idea that, maybe, I wasn't allistic (fancy-pants word for 'doesn't fall on the autism spectrum'.) And then, I did a 180 on that when I started thinking *'oh SHIT I'm turning into a fucking tumblrina special snowflake,'* and I never thought anyone'd take me seriously if I brought it up. I had ingrained into myself, ""I'm too normal to be any sort of autistic, right?""

(this was also the mode of thinking that made me certain I was a straight cis woman for most of my life. *ha.*)

But, no. I'm not going to say I for-certain have it until I get it diagnosed, but I'd bet money on it. Like, it's small stuff and as far as the spectrum goes, I'm on the light end, but look me in the eye and tell me none of these are symptomatic:

\&gt; I hyperfocus on one or two things at a time for months at a time to the exclusion of all else, from media to art to scientific subjects. These never go completely away, I just shift focus to new things once the novelty has fully worn off.

\&gt; I realized in middle school that the disconnect between my emotions and facial expressions make me look like an emotionless sociopath. I could be gleeful as a frog in junebug season, and my face would be like üòë. I literally TRAINED MYSELF to attach facial expressions to emotions. Sometimes, when I'm really tired, I still have to consciously make myself make faces in response to my emotions so the people around me know that I'm not planning murder in my head. 

\&gt; Slamming my head on a wall and slapping my legs hard when I have a panic attack, or get otherwise emotionally overwhelmed with negative feelings. I've had two of these that were bad enough that I don't remember about an hour of them at all.

\&gt; I've grown out of it, but up until middle school I used to do this thing with my arms when I walked, like... you know how if you're playing charades and pretend you're a rabbit, you put your elbows to your sides and hold your hands beside each other in front of your stomach, palm-down? I used to do that 'bunny walk' all the time if I wasn't doing anything with my arms. I trained myself out of it in middle school when I got made fun of a lot. I never found this as a symptom when I did research on it, but it's anecdotally common, from my experiences on social media.

\&gt; ""You've made a very simple request of me, so now I'm going to repeat it back to you the way I understood it to make sure I got it right, because I could have managed to interpret it complete differently or maybe I'm overthinking it."" And then people get all fucking agitated with me. Do you want to get mad at me over clarifying something you feel doesn't need to be clarified, or do you want to get mad at me for fucking up a simple task for lack of communication? *You don't get to be mad about both!!*

\&gt; I stim a lot on satin, and have since I was two. I always thought this was just a weird quirk of mine before I learned what 'stimming' was. If I haven't stimmed in like, a week, and I suddenly realize that I haven't and I'm stressed, stimming is like the mental equivalent of wrapping myself up in a fresh-from-the-dryer blanket with a mug of cocoa with the sounds of rain on the roof lulling me to sleep. It's the most goddamn relaxing fucking thing in the world.

\&gt; Sarcasm flies RIGHT over my head if you are not using a Sarcam Tone, or if I don't know you well enough to pick up on your specific Sarcasm Cues. Dry sarcasm in everyday conversation is generally taken seriously by me. I also suck at """"Getting Hints"""". JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR CHRISSAKES I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME.

\&gt; I'm like 95% certain my dad has it, we act VERY similar. Never brought it up with him, though. I don't think it runs on his mom's side, but it may have on his dad's. I know for certain it affects many males on my maternal grandmother's side of the family, the most recent and direct being my Uncle Trevor. I got along really well with him as a kid, he just GOT me. I miss him. I regret not spending more time with him before he passed.

\&gt; I was, to put it bluntly, socially retarded as a child. I was The Weird Kid. I didn't get social cues. I didn't understand that blunt honesty was a good way to hurt feelings. I didn't understand the emotions others felt and just told them to do what I would do. I really didn't get when people were making fun of me--I just thought we were being friends and that's how frendship went! I didn't get the message until I got ditched in a park that I didn't know how to navigate home from. It was definitely hammered in every time I had someone tell me they didn't want to be my friend anymore. This put me out a lot, and I turned into an asshole to other children by acting like I was better than them. It did help that I'm just the kind of person who is okay with their own company, but knowing that no-one my own age wanted me around still hurt. As an adult, I'm much more socially aware, but I still get EXTREMELY hurt and pissed off if I find out people are being two-faced with me. Really hits me in the mistrust.

But, ah... yeah. There's my laundry list. I really need to get a yes or no on the diagnoses, Asperger's can really exacerbate extant anxiety and depression. I need to keep this for the next time I go to the Psych, I've not brought it up to him yet but having this all typed out makes me more confident than trying to, just, yank it out of my brain on the spot and spin it into words.

...But first, I need to get another appointment. Or find a completely different Psych and never show my face there again from sheer embarrassment. Y'know.

As far as being a depressed sack of potatoes, I'm doing pretty okay. Hell, part of me feels bad posting here at all, given how some of you folks are holding up in the face of this fucking beast.

I don't hurt myself, not in the typical self-harm sense, anyhow. I eat at least once a day, usually. Just don't want to get back to seeing my ribs again, that was scary. I make sure to brush my hair every now and again so I don't get depression knots. I can make myself bathe and do laundry about once a week, though the clothes don't ever leave the hamper. Sometimes I get away with laundry once a month, if I've hermitted myself away.

I'm not doing well for myself, but I'm surviving fine. I'm not worried about suicidal thoughts any more because, through experience, I've learned that the only thing I fear worse than living in misery, is the fact that I don't KNOW what comes after death, and the thought of completely ceasing to exist terrifies me on a bone-deep level reserved for being chased by tigers and realizing you forgot to do your taxes this year.

But... I just survive. I want to LIVE. I'm not sure how. 

But damn if I don't feel a bit better after typing all this random bullshit this out. I guess this really was just what I needed, in the moment. 

Okay, gotta finish that drawing. Gotta get some food in me. I can do this. I just spent an hour typing, I can spent five more drawing. (who am i kidding im gonna be up til 2 am working on this thing, thats what i get for not drawing for a whole year and then diving into doing commissions)

Thanks for reading, guys, if anyone felt the desire to sift through my mountain of blabbering. I'm basically gonna be at my computer all day, so, if anyone wants to just, I dunno... talk, feel free to hit me up.

111,"I (27F) (ENFP) have an amazing husband (30M). He is supportive, loving, positive, hardworking, and genuine. We have common interests and goals and have built a fantastic life together. We are complete opposites -- him a linear thinking, logical engineer and me a free-spirited creative. His personality grounds me, he makes me feel safe.

As wonderful as my partner is, I feel unfulfilled. I have a wandering eye, and have emotionally cheated on him twice now (have had semi-serious crushes on two other men). I often fantasize about being single  - not only so I can sleep and date other people - but so I can self-discover. We met when I was 19 and I feel like I never had time to find myself. 

To make matters worse, I currently have a crush on my supervisor (50M), This particular person is very attractive and outgoing but I am also sensing is manipulative. He has a very casual work style, has been very touchy with me, and will occasionally invite me to spend time with him outside of work. What his motives are I do not know (he has never said anything inappropriate), but the touching, dinners and weekend meetings are certainly not helping my psyche - I just end up wanting him all the more...

If I continue to have these feelings for my manager, and thoughts about being single, I know I will sabotage my marriage and the life we have built together. I don't know why I can't appreciate the things I have!

In general, I am a very adventurous. I love to discover, explore and be challenged. I love meeting people and forming new relationships. And while I appreciate these qualities in myself I fear they will be my undoing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions for you:** 

&amp;#x200B;

* Have any of you felt unfulfilled in a seemingly great marriage? How did you resolve those feelings?
* Has anyone else had crushes while married? How did you handle that?
* Fellow free-spirits out there, how do you healthily manage your desires to explore, live and try new things?
* Has anyone gone to counseling for feelings of un-fulfillment, and did you find it beneficial?  *I would love to find a counselor or therapist who can help me decipher why I feel the way I do.*",08Sep2019,0
112,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. Throughout this entire time I've felt deeply connected to him and recently have started to wonder if we could be together for a long time. Maybe even get married someday.

He's always been a devoted Catholic and I'm ok with that. It's part of who he is and I have no right to change that. I love him for who he is.

I've been Agnostic for 4 years and a couple of months ago found the religion, Wicca. I instantly felt drawn to it and felt like it was right for me. I told him and he seemed a bit off put but accepting. He also had always known before then that I was Agnostic. Then yesterday out of nowhere he said he doesn't know if he can be with me unless I convert. I'm shocked and don't understand. I accept every part of him and love him for it but he can't do the same for me. Besides having religious differences our relationship has been amazing.

They fight all the time and that might explain why I feel so uncomfortable around them but I still feel so guilty and horrible because they are good people and they‚Äôre always saying how much they miss me. This has been happening with all of my friends too. I never want to leave the house and I cancel all of my plans. I just don‚Äôt get why anyone misses me. I am a horrible person. I‚Äôm not fun to talk to. I have nothing of value to say. I‚Äôm not very smart. I don‚Äôt get it. I feel angry at people for missing me and loving me. I feel nothing. I feel connected to no one.

114,"I never thought I‚Äôd be the person to ask this question. I have no family history of mental health issues, don‚Äôt fall into many of the demographics, and until recently I thought I was living the ‚Äúright way.‚Äù Then I found out that none of that is any guarantee. 

Got quite a few things that have popped up since starting college a year ago. Primarily, I haven‚Äôt found joy in any of my hobbies (restoring cars and anything outdoors) or the motivation to do them. Everything seems to be a drag, especially in the last month. Feel like I can‚Äôt catch a break from it all, and that is true in a way. I am taking 16hr at the local community college and putting in 25 hours a week at my machine shop apprenticeship. Ironically, my job is the only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing right now. I‚Äôm not in school by my own free will and the work is just another burden. In addition, the lost income by working less hours is making it impossible to indulge in my hobbies and even meet basic obligations. 

Also got a few other stress-related issues. I used to love driving just about anywhere, now I pre-emptively smoke a bowl before heading out into rush-hour gridlock because being in slow traffic leads to me getting really anxious about either not getting to where I‚Äôm going or being attacked (even though I have many lethal and nonlethal ways of dealing with that, in addition to being able to drive away easily [lifted truck]). Even just running short on time at school or home for something raises my HR and I sweat a lot. When it‚Äôs all over I have even less energy than I normally do. 

I‚Äôm also feeling a lot more lonely not having a girlfriend or reliable platonic friends who I see regularly, even though I have no real reason to be lonely. Now sometimes at night I spoon a large pillow and cry myself to sleep. 

I think I gave myself a lot of these issues when I enrolled in college ‚Äúagainst my will‚Äù and made those sacrifices (time and money) to make someone else happy. It will be a while before I can get out, so I need to find a way to deal and get some of my old life back.

My main problem is that even though my folks are very supportive and want me to get better, I can‚Äôt effectively communicate with them about how I truly feel because a lot of it involves them directly and they don‚Äôt believe some of the things I have said here about school. I have the opportunity to see the school LPC tomorrow and be referred to some other counselors who I can get a bit covered by insurance. Would they be able to help me find better ways to cope with these problems or maybe even eliminate a few?

Thanks y‚Äôall for any information I‚Äôll get. Hope everyone has a nice day.",08Sep2019,0
115,"Heyooo, so... I just made a long-ass post where I spilled all the garbage piling up in my brain and slapped it up for all to see. In that post, I mentioned that I have a commission I'm supposed to be working on instead of... well, bitching about my brain on reddit.

So, that's what I'm doing now! Or, *trying* to do. This is probably a weird request but, could I get an accountability partner here? Just, an acknowledgement that people know what I'm doing right now and are actively keeping an eye one me, sorta. I don't need someone to ride me like a pony, but I just can't make myself do this completely by myself, despite the fact that I am literally broke and need the money. It's been three days. All I have is the sketch. I'm useless on my own.

I've always done my best work with someone else around to update. Better yet, with someone else in the room with me, but I'm fairly sure no-one'd be willing to mail themselves Next-Day air to me. I'd feel like a total moron asking this of my client, so... maybe y'all could help me out here this time, please?

Here's the piece so far:

I actually have two more pieces, too, all ordered by the same person. Hopefully once I start working I'll be able to going through the other two before I crash? Hell, if this works out then maybe I can do 'accountability posts' for all three pieces.

116,"It's very long but basically like that title said, I'm considering putting this out there after certain events happened at work that will be explained in the post. Guess I just wanna feel out how I feel about it after I actually put it out \*somewhere\*.


   Alright guys. Here goes. I'm gonna preface this by saying there will be no debate here about if I'm handling **any** part of this in the right way. Negative comments, ""helpful"" opinions, and ""you should"" comments will be deleted and you will potentially be removed from my facebook and my life. Any and all details I want to give will be given. No less and definitely no more. If you don't like that or want to question that, not so kindly remove yourself from my life and start asking yourself why you have the impulse to know terrible specific details on something that caused another human being pain. Like get that checked, for real.

   If you find yourself offended or upset that you are finding out this way, you might wanna ask yourself why your initial reaction is to make my pain about you. Not sorry.

   Some of this will be blunt. Some of it will seem for lack of a better work dramatically written. Yall should know by now that that's just how I write and how thoughts literally run through my mind. What I know is that I haven't spoken these words out loud in this specific of a way, and they still leave a pit in my stomach. Which is my personal signal for being what I need to say the most.

   I have spent 53 days trying to be ok. 53 days since I was attacked, left covered in bruises, raped, and consequently now bear a (hopefully not lifelong) scar on my wrist that was self inflicted. My previous post saying I wasn't a harm to myself was true (and IS true). The post was days later, and hasn't been a thought or fear since about two minutes after it occurred. 

   If I'm going to go all out here (which...clearly) I'm going to have to say I struggled that night with I deserved it somehow. I'm good there now. I've struggled with how much I did or didn't do during or after. Mostly good there, I'm sure I'll have my moments but I know I'm handling it the best way for me. I've struggled with nightmares, flashbacks, shock, guilt for having happy moments, and feelings that run the entire emotional spectrum from one minute to the next some days. All while trying to juggle the rest of life because unfortunately it doesn't pause when these things happen. It's a blessing at times because the moments that I can shove it in to a box and be ""normal"" for however long are necessary for my sanity. That's not to say I'm avoiding everything. I'm actively trying to go about this the healthiest way for me possible. Reaching out when I need, crying when I need, admitting and being willing to hear if I'm doing something destructive to myself, and reaching out to professionals. I'm okay as I can be. I'm realistic that this is a lifelong process, and also focusing on how to be ok and how to prepare myself to handle days that I'm just not ok on my own. 

   Anyway, unplanned but obviously needed rambling done now to get to why I'd be putting all this out here. I don't want pity (dear god so much with not wanting pity). I'm not in search of validation, or praise, or even support. I'd be perfectly fine and probably err on the side of relief if people never even brought it up to me. (That being said I'm not going to be off put by anyone wanting to send support, and will politely cut things as short as I need them to be.)

   I'm writing this because someone within my realm of existence found out this information and used it to send me a vile, vaguely threatening, COWARDLY AS FUCK BECAUSE IT WAS ANONYMOUS AND UNANSWERABLE message on Thursday. Disgusting is an understatement and while I kind of wanted to put their message on blast to illustrate how entirely inhumane it is I also have a belief that there's no need to put such repulsive words out in to the world. It will help nothing. It is unnecessary detail. 

   I'm guessing your aim was to scare me. Or hurt me. Or push me to hurt myself because wouldn't that make you powerful right? I don't **know** what your aim was, and I'm glad I'm the kind of person that can't wrap my mind around such hate. Well, you got to me. Not gonna lie. You don't scare me though, and you didn't for one second make me believe you were right. You made me angry. And today, you made me feel helpless. I've found lately it's easier to navigate out of an emotion once I've identified exactly what it is. I put words to that feeling 1 hour ago. I decided to do this 58 minutes ago. 

  You took away my choices of what was mine to share or not share on my terms. This is me taking it back from you. This will not be for you to hold over my head. This will not be for me to be scared about, or cower behind, or be powerless in how it's handled. This timeline or format wouldn't have been my choice, that's true, you won there. But if you think I'm losing you haven't been watching long enough. I hope you find the help and peace you need because what you did says everything about you and nothing about me. I'll even go as far as saying if you want to let me know who you are I'll help you find help. I can't imagine how it is to live with a soul that is capable of what you did, and nobody deserves that.

  To end on a better note, to the people I **have** made aware on my terms, who have been my support, and to the people reading today that I'm confident will only be adding to my ""support group"", thank you. And I love you all.",08Sep2019,1

Hi! So i have anxiety. I'm the kind of person that with every decision, i make some kind of chess board in my head where i analyze a lot of ""what if"". It's not voluntarily, those ""what if's"" come naturally. For some people that might seem good because it helps you make good decisions, but when you have an Anxiety Disorder a lot of irrational thoughts come to your mind, stuff that you don't want NEVER on earth to happen.

I have a background of a very tough life with my family/school/health. I recently graduated this year and got a nice job, the thing is that this job is not exactly what i expected, is amazingly stressing and exhausting. i work 6 days a week. and it consumes me, but it's my only source of income.

Also, i'm getting married in 2 months, i'm marrying the best man in the world, and my best friend. I love him so much. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me. I feel so guilty for all the patience he has had during this year throughout listening me about my stress, and loving me no matter what.

So here's the thing: 2 weeks ago, i had an emotional collapse, a higher level of anxiety that i've never experienced before, i was crying, hyperventilating, nearly fainting. The level of stress was so high that made me doubt about all what we call reality, and when my mom entered my room to check on me i barely recognized her, same with my boyfriend. First i didnt recognize them emotionally, like i knew who they were, but i forgot the way i felt about them.

After weeks, of ""Grounding"" I recognized their voices and their own way of talking to me, and the way i feel about them, trust me i feel SO happy about remember who they are to me, but now it's the visual part. to see their faces takes me time.

Sometimes i talk to them, in which during the conversations i see them, and whilst talking i recognize them (visually, because emotionally i'm back on track) but later on, after a minute, i see their faces like it was the first time in my life

I'm getting better, i'm slowly....very slowly.....very slowly recovering.

I would REALLY appreciate if someone has a recommendation for me of how getting better. You don't know how frustrating this is to me.

During this horrible process, the best thing is that i can remember emotionally now, like remember the emotional relationship with my family, boyfriend and friends. For me this is the best, because i can finally remember my boyfriend. he means the universe to me. but still, visually i still have moments where i forget the faces im talking to. like im talking to them for the first time.

Whenever I feel I'm doing better and actually feel okay for a bit and think about the things I'd like to do (e.g. owning various pets, storytelling), I'm reminded by the grim reality of things that no matter how hard I try, I quickly reach the point of exhaustion and lose interest and empathy until the guilt becomes so overwhelming that I just give up.

Its easier to let them do their thing or my head will be foggy &amp; it will just go in circles; the fights/debates are best when I'm alone because its easier to get the fight it over with if my logical side talks though my mouth &amp; my primal side 'talks' in my head. 

It feels like I'm walking two big dogs; sometimes they drag me around,  yap at each other, or they are so quite I almost feel like they are not a thing. I wouldn't consider 'them' people in my head or anything like that (even though it seems like  it/they are sometimes) I don't have blackouts, nor is it like 'they'  have personal likes/dislikes really, its more of a fight on what is more beneficial; Its not a fight of good side vs bad side because they have been both nor are they aways together.  The logical side is disgusted with primal &amp; primal is always is ready to fight. 

I don't know how to explain how off it feels, but it/they don't control me; I don't feel like I *have* to do whats agreed on but sometimes that will make me feel like taking my skin off, twitchy, panicky, or angry depending how strong one feels about it. I'd like to just feel like a whole person, &amp; like something without it turning into a debate in my head or being conflicted about it most of the day.

 I'm sorry if I'm not explaining it well, I go along with it but I really don't understand it.",08Sep2019,1

127,"This is kinda sad, I‚Äôm sorry. 

I (17F) have been hit with a whirlwind of shit this weekend. 

It all started when my mom found her boyfriend‚Äôs stash of meth and coke. Now, my mom‚Äôs boyfriend isn‚Äôt the greatest guy, he‚Äôs had an awful past. They dated in high school, broke up, and met again 30 years later and have been together for four years. The relationship started off great, he had been clean for awhile, but then they started fighting 24/7. 

My mom had went to the basement to look for her fall decorations when she stumbled across the drugs and pictures of a woman in our home. The pictures were dated on the Saturdays that she worked. 

He denies that any of this is his, that he ‚Äúfound it in a duffle bag,‚Äù but the other paraphernalia she also found are made with things from our house. (lightbulbs we use, a specific soda my mom drinks because she‚Äôs diabetic and can‚Äôt drink aspartame, etc)

They‚Äôve been fighting for days. She‚Äôs kicking him out once his check comes in and he‚Äôll have money to find somewhere to stay. 

After all of this, my boyfriend (19M), said he won‚Äôt be able to be in town for my graduation or my 18th birthday. He‚Äôs leaving to go to Europe for a month with his friends. He can‚Äôt push it because one of his friends will already be in Europe, and if they push it back, he won‚Äôt have anywhere to go until they get there. 

I feel very alone right now. I don‚Äôt have friends I open up to with my feelings. I also feel like I can‚Äôt really talk to my boyfriend either. The last time I told him I was upset, he kinda laughed about it and poked fun with it. I understand he was trying to make light of the situation, but I just need someone to genuinely talk to.",08Sep2019,1
128," It is 11:21 pm over here (I know not that late), but recently I haven't slept much due to overthinking and anxiety over this specific thing that might happen tomorrow, which will have a quite big impact on me, mental health wise. 

I tried meditations, muscle relax sessions, different breathing thingies, but I still, in the depths of my stomach and heart, feel the fear and even disappointment. My mind is all foggy and many thoughts are going through it very quickly. I could just stay up all night, but that wouls have such a bad impact on me physically as I haven't slept properly these days anyway.

I don't know what to do. I am trying to think positively, I have for the last couple of days. But the ""What if"" question keeps on creeping in followed by many doom scenarios, which makes my anxiety and overall mental health worse.

I had a public mental breakdown over this a few days back, calmed down a bit by now. Yet my mind won't let me be at piece and accept the fact that there could be a positive outcome. 

I am too scared to sleep and wake up to bad news, while staying awake and receiving bad news all sleep deprived also doesn't sound so good to me.",08Sep2019,1
129,"I‚Äôve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for years. Suicidal thoughts are something that plague me on a regular occurrence; sometimes they‚Äôre just in the back of my mind, other times they‚Äôre all I can focus on. 

I will be seeing a new psychiatrist in two weeks. I am TERRIFIED of being forcibly committed, and I cannot emphasize this fear enough. However, I feel that I cannot get better without being completely honest with my doctor. Guys, please help. Is there a way to talk to speak honestly with your psychologist/psychiatrist about suicidal thoughts without them freaking out and committing you?",08Sep2019,15

133,"A memory has been circulating in my head that I cant stop thinking about, and I just need some closure.

When I was five, I went to visit family in India. My uncle and aunt were trying to conceive a child. 

I remember having sexual feelings at this age. Once, I remember we were all in a bed together (fully clothed) and I tried to kiss. I guess I had seen people kissing on television by that time and was aroused by it, so I wanted to try it. My memory is very foggy as to what exactly happened, but I'm fairly certain my aunt didnt reciprocate and my uncle (maybe?) reciprocated a little bit for a few seconds. I remember liking the aunt better than the uncle. 

Obviously, I had no concept of what was socially acceptable at that age, and am totally repulsed by the memory now.

Here's where my memory REALLY starts to get foggy. I remember that during my month I was there I always wanted to experience it again because it was exciting.

Here's some things I know for 100%:
1. I never took off any clothes, or saw any of them naked whatsoever.
2. I was never forced to do anything sexual, at all.
3. I remember seeing them kissing on the bed.
4. I returned back home after that month, and all the times I visited them after nothing like that ever happened again, and we didnt even acknowledge it.

For about a decade after that, I had neglected the memory or even looked at it with slight fondness but it's been replaying in my head now and I cant get it out. I cant talk to anyone I know about it because it's so disgusting that they would never talk to me again.

Was I treated innapropriately? Is the fogginess of my memory just because it happened so long ago (I hardly remember anything I did when I was 5) or because I am repressing trauma? Should I tell or confront anyone about it?",08Sep2019,2
134,"So, there's this phenomena seen in Dementia and Alzheimer's patients, (I don't know if phenomena is the right word, but just hear me out) called ""sundowning"" where their agitation and confusion becomes worse at nighttime. I'm wondering if the same phenomena can occur in other types of mental health disorders? I realize that dementia and depression (anxiety, BPD, bipolar, etc.) are wildly different, but I notice in myself that my anxiety and irrational thinking, depression, etc. gets SO much worse at night. Is this a real/possible thing? Have you noticed any similarities in yourself and in your own struggles with mental health?",08Sep2019,5

139,"I've been struggling with bipolar depression and ADHD since the age of 12. I'm now 23 and still struggling. I was hoping to find someone who also may struggle with depression, anxiety, or ADHD too. Just to talk to here and there. When you are having bad days we can vent or when we are having good days we can talk about what made the day good and what we are grateful for. We can talk about what coping mechanisms help us cope when it days get rough and just be there for each other. We don't have to stay in contact everyday I understand we all have lives and some busier than others. Some days you just don't feel like talking to anyone. I get it.

141,"Will keep it short. 
Shyness/Social Anxiety/Fear of Public Speaking or whatever you want to call it is ruining my life. I am in a reputable University and I resort to taking hard courses just to avoid easy ones which have presentation or class participation. I break down at the thought of speaking in class. For this reason, I am left with a bad CGPA. I have no internship experience or society/club experience because I am super scared of interviews and so I never really apply to anything. All this contributes to a really bad profile for when I graduate. I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôll ever apply for a job considering I can‚Äôt sit in interviews. Makes me wonder why I am even enrolled in a University in the first place. I have so many opportunities literally right in front of my eyes yet I can‚Äôt avail any. I feel I‚Äôll end up at home doing nothing for life. 

Does anyone have literally any advice OTHER than seeking help in person. If there is anything that can help me online? Any exercises, any online therapist, anythinggg? 

Would like to add that I have ‚Äòtried to overcome my fears‚Äô by giving presentations (in groups and alone) and by trying to speak in class. Those were easily some of the worst days of my life as it resulted in anxiety attacks before and after class. During the class, I managed to speak but I was just numb and don‚Äôt remember much. Would not go through it again and so I decided ‚Äòfacing‚Äô my fear wasn‚Äôt the solution in my case.",08Sep2019,2
142,"I'm with someone who hasn't ever dealt with depression personally and I almost feel like I should stop talking to them. Not because I don't love them but because I feel as if I'm hard to deal with. As if, I'd be doing them a favor. 

I want to free him from me just because I love him so much. That's the worst thing about mental illness... I fight it everyday and whatnot. But it's not just about me anymore. It's a fight for his happiness too because I never want someone to feel like they didn't do enough to keep me happy. 

I just hate getting depressed and I feel like it ruins everything. I feel like I have to distance myself.",08Sep2019,1

I understand that, but it still hurts because it feels like I'm a burden.

145,"So, for the past six or seven months at least I‚Äôve been struggling with having a REALLY small appetite and being terrified of throwing up. I feel nauseous a lot when I‚Äôm out of the house (and sometimes at home too) and I feel like eating makes it worse, to the point where I will avoid doing it unless I‚Äôm super hungry.

Restaurants are really difficult for me because even if I don‚Äôt eat much (e.g at Yo Sushi I‚Äôll have maybe one or two small plates) I still feel really nauseous there. I‚Äôve thrown up in restaurants quite a few times since I‚Äôve started feeling this way but recently I‚Äôve just been avoiding them/avoiding eating too much. 

It seems like going to the bathroom helps, even if I don‚Äôt need to go, and I don‚Äôt know why. 

Does anyone know what this could be? I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis because I know I need to see a doctor for that but is there anything that could be causing this? I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor if it‚Äôs nothing and I‚Äôm just being dumb. But I know I most likely can only get better once I know what‚Äôs wrong.

147,"A few months ago I felt like I was progressing as a person and entering a new stage of my life; now I feel like I'm going backwards, and it makes me feel sick to my stomach.

It's this weird mix of 2016-2018 that I feel trapped in. Occasionally, it'll be even more years back. I want to cry because I'm reverting back into old ideas and habits, but I just want something new- something to give me growth.

For some backstory, my mother had searched my room when I was out of the house for the day. She found an empty beer bottle and some weed. I got put on total lockdown and didn't leave my house for over a month. I didn't leave by choice because I'd get interrogated, lectured, searched, and otherwise shamed if I tried to do as much as go to the grocery store. She also took it upon herself to look through my laundry and bathroom drawers (claims she's cleaning) and lecture me about whatever nonsense she finds. It sent me into a deep rage and depression because I felt that my privacy was betrayed. That's the only thing I care about- my privacy.

The whole situation with her going through my shit makes me feel like I have nothing to myself anymore. I constantly feel exposed and guarded around my family- and my only way of coping is to revert a few years into the past to a time when I had something for myself? I listen to the same music, search the same ideas on Google, have the general anxiety come back, and I've abandoned the most recent passions I had(previous to the incident).

I just feel like every little secret or characteristic I had for myself was just ripped and skinned off of me, and I don't know where to go because my progress was disrupted. I was becoming the best version of myself, and now I don't know who I am. Time doesn't feel real anymore. I feel like I'm an NPC. I had a few mental breakdowns because I didn't feel real or safe in the timeline I am in. Nothing feels right and it makes me sick. I fantasize about shaving my head and running away to live a new life. It wouldn't be fun or glamorous, but at least I'd have some control over my life and identity.

I'm 16, likely bipolar, likely stupid, and just about ready to fuck shit up.",08Sep2019,1
