0,"I'm a 24 year old Male and I have problems. You couldn't tell from a glance; I've done daily personal development for over 5 years. I went from anorexic (45kg/173cm) to very athletic (68kg/173cm/no body fat), and I have advanced social skills for someone with high-functioning Autism. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm actually pretty 'normal' but I still have a lot of baggage around relationships. I can pickup Women quite easily, but I really struggle to develop it into a relationship. I've had a previous relationship of 4 years and it was pretty good all things considered. I struggle with negative self-talk and I'm overly critical of my behaviour and of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always seeking to improve, and to improve I need self-awareness so that I can assess the effect of my behaviour on those around me. I meditate 20m everyday, I exercise \~8 hours a week, I have a very good job and I have a good support network of Friends and Family. Yet, I still feel sad and I feel like I'm not enough and that I'm not worthy of love.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I wasn't given enough love as a child

2) I was abandoned as a child

3) I suffered/suffer from severe anxiety from a very young age

4) I've struggled with depression all my life, also from a very young age

5) Because of my asperger's I wasn't socialised properly as a child and a teen, and I've only learned to socialise as an adult. Because of this I find it hard to relate to regular people and it has negative consequences on my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would this be classified as childhood/developmental trauma?

&amp;#x200B;

Can anybody recommend a book that could help with my situation please?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",19Aug2019,2

2," I'm multicultural and do not look Caucasian, but am half Caucasian I live the North East of the USA

I have been thinking a lot lately how mental health is not just biological and psychological, but also social. I think the society in which we live plays a huge role in the thoughts that play through our head all day. Our society is heavily influenced by the media as well. The current state of the media also appears to be very extreme with how it presents info. I think its fare to say that the media is very negative. I also think it is fare to say that if precaution is not taken with how we interpret the media, our thoughts may become skewed about the society in which we live. In my mind, the media has an agenda and quotas that have to be met. Negativity helps meet that quota. This is not in anyway supporting the idea of fake news! That is a whole other ball field that is not being discussed here. Furthermore, I realize that this is not the only factor that is contributing to the current social climate, it is just one factor.

For the purpose of this post, I will discuss some thoughts that I have a lot. Often times when I'm in a public place that is predominantly Caucasian, I begin to think that the people there are racist and do not want me there.  There are actually times when I get afraid that someone will confront me about my skin color, and how I do not belong in America. (this has never happened). I'm also bilingual, and sometimes I even get embarrassed to speak my second language. This obviously hampers my social skills. Before the current social climate in America, I never felt this way.

It is becoming increasingly obvious that these thoughts are mental distortions. Sure there are racists out there who probably don't like me by how I look, but this does not mean that everyone out there is that way.  Since I did not have these thoughts before the current social climate in America, I cannot think of any other reason why this would have happened besides excessively looking at the news, and the news presenting information that is very negative in nature. Sure people do stuff that influences what the news presents, but It is hard to think how I would have been presented with negative stories if it were not for the media presenting it to me. At least not the magnitude that it is.

I have decided to block all news out of my life. I want to converse with people and get to know them for who they are, not what the media wants me think that they are. What does everyone think of this?",19Aug2019,1
3,"I‚Äôm almost finished with ‚ÄúTurtles All The Way Down‚Äù by John Green. It‚Äôs insane how much that book opened my eyes. Let me start by saying I‚Äôm a straight, male in my late 30‚Äôs so I know it seems weird that I‚Äôd pick that book to read in the first place, my soon-to-be wife recommended John Green and that‚Äôs the one I picked up.
I knew it had something to do with mental health, but it was insanely accurate as to how the mind works for someone with an anxiety problem, along with OCD. The ‚ÄúThought Spiral‚Äù is the truest description I‚Äôve heard vocalized about what it‚Äôs like to be in my head.
It made me feel like there was other people out there that has the same problems that I have which is somehow gratifying and scary at the same time.
Not gonna lie though, it was a bit triggering to read.
No one in my life knows the extent of my illness. Mostly they just think it‚Äôs weird that I do quirky shit like wash the top of my soda cans before I drink them and double, sometimes triple check the safety seal when open a water bottle, throw the peanut butter away if no one in the house can remember if they‚Äôve opened it or not when I go to get some and it‚Äôs already been opened. I tell them it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt trust people, which is true, but the whole truth is that I have an overwhelming fear that someone will poison my food or drinks . Not just my food or drinks, but anyone‚Äôs food or drinks.
I‚Äôve had this fear since I was in my middle-teenage years. I know it‚Äôs not real but can‚Äôt control it. Sometimes the fear isn‚Äôt that prevalent, other times it‚Äôs pretty bad. When I don‚Äôt think about it for a while, the habits of poison prevention are still there.
That‚Äôs all I got for now. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this.",19Aug2019,2
4,"Everything just feels like it's getting darker and darker in my mind every day. I've completely lost all hope of getting better, having a life etc, and now I'm spiraling because nothing matters anymore and there's just this one tiny voice left in the back of my head saying ""don't give up, what if you're wrong, what if there is a way"" but I'm SO TIRED of living on what-ifs. I can't live off of that anymore, I can't live off false hope, it feels like breathing without oxygen. 
I feel like I'm being dragged towards completely falling apart and letting myself just be a mess and the only things keeping me from accepting that is that tiny little voice (that's getting quieter every day), and not wanting to do that to my mom. I know how much she's affected and has to deal with my shit even when I'm making an effort and if I'm not it's even more, but I'm just so tired. I'm so tired and I'm so sad and I'm so alone.",19Aug2019,2

7, I am  slightly clingy without realizing it until now ?To start off  I used to always be  private about my mental health until recently .going back to it. I am  the helpful quirk friend that just gives on giving  and the return is   non-existent for 99.9% of the so called friends I have.  I am always the first one to start the convos 99.9%. So recently the past year  my mental health  obviously took a  massive noise dive so I started to open little by little then massively based off  some advice  off one of the friends advice. Being the friendly friend as always and trying to be supportive  of others. At the time I just revealed too much and left myself exposed. Of course failed as a friend to support  one of them  as I was in a group with her  for a project  and may of  crossed some boundaries as talked to friend's girlfriend although she was just being supportive. however now the situation is no one is up front and of course they act fake.  I did  distant myself then try to reach out. I did suggest ending the friendships with one of them by asking if its over  its okay I understand but I  am being still being pulled a long with passive aggressiveness. I am okay with ending the friendships now because I have realized my mistakes of course its  fault to both parties me included and of course its just exhausting . I can easier make friends just suck at finding good ones to keep. I am my own supportive which is I have realized based off what's happended  and not going to open to people unless its the equal is given. Of course now I have  decided  to   distant myself and just move on as its just exhausting. I wasn't  always asking to hang out  but I would sometimes of course because going out a lot if just  how I am working on myself and trying to enjoy things while they last of course I just want to make the friends stronger.,19Aug2019,1
8,"I understand that some see ""commit"" as indicating a crime. In no way do I understand that word that way. I see it along the lines of ""amor fati,"" where you accept you have to let go at a certain point and just accept fate. Now, I can understand that using ""commit"" in this sense actually has a slightly positive connotation to it. Along the lines of ""bite the bullet,"" where it's something undesirable, but you just grin and bear it. To the most extreme this phrasing reaches the Asian cultures, where historically they saw suicide as a means of atoning for wrong doing, by completely accepting the consequences of your actions, through becoming your own executioner.

Personally, as someone who has gone right to the precipice of committing suicide, (won't call it an attempt, as no harm was inflicted) I feel that ""commit"" more accurately describes the mental state required to complete the act. (I could not bring myself to defenestrate off of a high place) There's a certain amount of courage and fearlessness you need to overrule all of your body's attempts to get you to stop. I've even seen studies done on suicidality that confirms in males who successfully complete the act they have a lower fear response to stress in general. Why is there such a push against phrases like ""he committed suicide."" when it more accurately expresses the experience than the neutral, ambiguous, and sanitized ""died by suicide""? How do we find a balance between polite language and meaningful language? If ""commit"" is too tainted through associations with criminal acts what is another way of describing the act while including ""accepting what comes,"" as a piece of the sentence?",19Aug2019,1
9,"People who haven‚Äôt really dealt with mental health problems assume that it is black and white. That is not the case. It‚Äôs not even black, white and grey.

10,"I was diagnosed with only anxiety and depression. I do think i was misdiagnosed, because i was diagnosed in conversion therapy, and they gave me anti depressants wrongly. 
That was about 2 years ago.  Im off the antidepressants. Almost a year now. 

For the most part, im alright, but sometimes i remember things. I remember being trapped. 
I remember my mom screaming at me. I remember my dad being to ashamed to look at me. 

I know rationally that its all over, but its as if im watching it play out again in the real world. Ill be at a walmart, turn the corner and see the room that i sat in. Im there and so is the therapist. But its not tthere.i know its not actually there. 

I used to ride horses, and today i went to visit mine, but i mentally heard my mom screaming, horrified how she used to get when i rode horses. I heard my old trainer screaming at me for not hitting my horse. Neither of them were there. I was only with my dad, and he wasnt even near me. 
My trainer's screaming, and my moms fear overwhelmed me and I wanted to kill my horse to make it stop. I couldnt believe i thought this. I never hit my horses. I clicker train. The very thought of killing one of my horses made me physically ill and induced a panic attack. 


To be clear it wasnt audible, but it all happened mentally. 

Im selling all my horses immediately i dont want anything to happen to them they are my joy.

Sometimes just being out with my parents stressses me and i want to ram my head into walls. I wanted to so badly today but i dont want them to think i have demons again. I dont want another exorcism.

15,"I‚Äôd like some advice, if possible. Please bear with me - I‚Äôve kept it as short as I can. 

Back in May, I collapsed in a high street. Luckily, I came around pretty quickly &amp; my boyfriend decided we didn‚Äôt need to call an ambulance. Miraculously, I had no bruises or serious injuries. I had to take 3 weeks off work as I kept fainting. My eyes would be the first to go. Everything would become blurry &amp; then I‚Äôd feel my legs go. I never got any answers as there‚Äôs a 23-week waiting list for a 24-hour heart monitor &amp; a cardiology appointment. As you can imagine, this is worrying me. I never felt ready to go back to work but I pushed myself to. I just missed out on an extension on my contract because of my sickness absence from work so, as of 31st August, I will be officially unemployed. The thought terrifies me. 

Yesterday, completely out of the blue, my whole body started shaking. I just felt weird. As I was at home, I made sure to get myself a drink &amp; something to eat (just in case) but it was at least an hour before I felt somewhat normal. I still have moments where I have no energy whatsoever &amp; I‚Äôm exhausted. Some days, I skip meals as I haven‚Äôt got the energy to slave away over a cooker or even stab a ready meal with a fork &amp; shove it in a microwave. 

I‚Äôm really struggling at the moment &amp; finding it practically impossible to cope. I‚Äôm waiting for my first psychology appointment so I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what to say. I‚Äôm worried about the consequences of what I tell them. I know they have to remain confidential but I can‚Äôt help thinking that whatever I say could be used against others &amp; cause them lots of unhappiness. 

Growing up, my parents often told me I was a hypochondriac so I try to avoid going to the doctors as much as I can. I‚Äôve been a lot recently (for various tests &amp; check-ups on my mental health as I‚Äôve been feeling suicidal every other day) which has resulted in insults &amp; name-calling. If I say I‚Äôm tired, they‚Äôll make a comment such as ‚Äúyou should go to the doctors.‚Äù This is making everything worse. I am constantly walking on eggshells. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have (undiagnosed) IBS &amp; it has been flaring up on &amp; off for 3 weeks. I‚Äôm in a lot of pain but nobody seems to believe me or have any idea how much discomfort I‚Äôm experiencing. They seem to invalidate everything. 

I know there must be an underlying issue &amp; I believe it‚Äôs connected to my GAD and depression. What I‚Äôd like to know is how can I ensure the doctor takes me seriously? I have a tendency to just nod &amp; agree &amp; I don‚Äôt fight for answers but I‚Äôm really struggling. 

It‚Äôs obvious to me that there is still a problem as I experienced the same symptoms yesterday as I did before. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been told in the past to exaggerate how I‚Äôm feeling as that‚Äôs what others do (apparently). Is this something you‚Äôd do? 

I‚Äôm lying in bed, at 2:30am, wondering what to do about everything. I‚Äôm not able to go to sleep for worrying. I‚Äôm shattered. I just wish I could have half the energy I used to have &amp; not be so weak.",19Aug2019,4

17,"We went to the doctors for a checkup and she did some tests on me, later said that I lost 4 kilos in a year (which is apparently a lot?) and that I‚Äôm very close to malnutrition.

19,"I have no job. I can't drive. I live with my mother. I'm barely 18.  I tried to take a placement test for college, but i messed up signing up and embarassed myself in front of other people last weekend and had to leave early. I was supposed to try again yesterday but I couldn't. I didn't want to see that lady at the desk again. She'd recognize me as the idiot who couldn't read.

I locked myself in my room the entire day yesterday. On and off crying and trying to distract myself. The only main thoughts I had yesterday was ""i want to die"" ""i want to disappear"" ""Why didn't I die then?"" ""Why do people like me?"" ""People don't know who I really am they don't even like me."" I was and am a complete mess. 

 It hurts to know that even if I did kill myself that people I barely know would be affected. ""Why would she do that?"" ""She had so much ahead of her!"" 'So much' my ass. I don't know anything. I don't want anything. I don't even feel like I desserve anything. I just want to go away. I prayed to a God I don't even believe in to die in a plane crash when I went on vacation. I did it multiple times, too. I didn't want to be put to blame for my own selfish thoughts, which in itself is also selfish.

I can't shop for clothes when there are people my age around - I get a pit in my stomach and I have to leave or avoid them. (Honestly, shopping in general is always hard for me. I feel like no matter what someone is judging me. Even if I am alone ot with someone.) I have purposefully gotten sick to avoid presentations. I almost never talk about my inner problems to my friends because I don't want to bother them. I almost cried multiple times just for getting called on for an answer in class. When I had an internship, whenever I was talking to my coach I was ready to cry because I was scared to say the wrong answer. When I didn't have any friends in a class I never spoke once - to the detriment of my grade. I honestly don't go to social events at all, but that might just be because Im introverted. Some of these things are normal, though. 

Im not proud, but I don't think I can do anything like this and I dont know what to do. I can't get a therapist, my insurance is shit and my mother wouldn't let me anyway. She doesn't think i need it. I don't know what to do. I can't even kill myself because I don't know how. How fucking pitiful is that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So basically let me begin from the beggining, i moved to Belgium from Romania when i was about 8 years old, learning the language and basically going to elementary school, problems like asking groups of kids if i can play with them and them saying no, and i would sit on a bank for all the breaks, also i would start getting bullied because i kept asking them if i can also play and now they started kinda laughing at me and bullying me instead of just saying no, i managed to make a friend just because he was also from Romania and he moved to Belgium too, but he was popular at the school meaning he was allowed to play and that he would not get bullied and he had friends, i didin't have any ofcourse, and i got this ""enemy"" that we would argue a lot for dumbass childish reasons ofcourse but yea this ""enemy"" was friends with my romanian friend, once we were arguing and he literally sprinted at me jumped and punched me right in the face lmao like something you would see in an anime movie, thinking about it now it looked epic AF but as an 8 year old i started crying and started running at him like i was gonna kill him or something, he was really skinny and i was really fat so yeah i had no chance catching him, due to all these things happening i started dis respecting teachers, i was really mean, i was getting constantly shouted at and punished by the teachers for my behaviour, also i wanted to fight a lot of people and i was a really a very bad negative energy in the whole school i would get sent to the principals office for bad behaviour and just sit my ass there, also did not have any friends exept for that fake romanian friend really,the teachers never thinked this was happening because of the bulying so they just were like : ""Hes just a really bad kid, it must be his parents fault, he is really causing a lot of problems we dont see anything good about him"" thats how i think they were all thinking about it.

Got expelled for violence and the principal literally told my mother he will start a police report for bad parenting if she did not move me to another school, so she did. ( due to my dificulties socializing, it was getting worse on my new school )

ofcourse the new school had talk with my other school, they pretty much told them about how bad i was, how i want to fight, how i dont have respect, basically telling them i will be a fucking nightmare or something. ( that did not fucking help, the only thing it did was make everything worse for me )

so the genious idea of my new school was to be pretty much tell all the teachers, and the genious idea of all the teachers were to be extra strict and extra suspicious like i was some kind of evil walking around all the normal kids.

as i write this i am thinking how the absolute fuck did they not think twice about this, how did they not think that it did not help, did they really think this was going to do any good ? so pretty much i was not allowed to be a kid, when it was summer we would get water rite cuz it was summer we were all thirtsy, they started fighting with water and i joined ofcourse it looked so fun and all, got punished, i was the only person to get punished. so in elemetary school every class has a teacher, its nog like high school where teachers are split amongst subjects, here they are split amongst classes, so in my class i got a teacher that heard the news of me from the other school and literally this was the kind of shit i had to deal with with her :

Teacher deals piece of paper for the lesson

I did not understand why she did this so in tought it was homework

Proceeds to put the piece of paper in my school bag

Teacher literally screams my name and the whole class is looking at me like i killed someone

She asks me why i put the piece of paper in my schoolbag and i tell her confused AF with a very scared voice.

""I tought it was homework""

Told me to pack up my things and stay outside of the class until school ends. ( literally 2 fucking hours )

I simply went outside of the class, at that time i was 11ish so i had some braincells so i was thinking wtf is going on ???? on the edge of bursting out in tears, and the class was right next to the principals office so the principal comes outside to go somewhere, spots me and asks ""What did you do ?"" i reply almost crying : "" I just put a piece of paper in my schoolbag thinking it was homework"" she answers : ""it never stops does with you does it, it just keeps going, you always create problems and the teachers kick you out of the classroom"" literally bursts out crying and she just leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

this was one of the incidentst, im 15 now and i wanna fucking cry thinking about the abuse i had to go trough the worst thing was : IT WAS THE FUCKING STAFF AND THE CHILDREN THAT WERE ABUSING ME. i will tell you now about what the kids did aswell, at this time all the children had developed brains that can socialize and they had this big ass group of kids, they started bullying me because we were once playing and i pushed someone cuz i was mad cuz they found me in hide and seek or some shit we were playing, ofcourse this is some dumb shit but i did not realize cuz i was 11 and honestly dumb AF with no social skills at all, and well i was in for a long year of bullying, this was a bit more brutal than what i had experienced, i recently gave up on playing with people and just sat on my ass on the bank, this is when they came up with their whole squad of 12 kids bullying me and calling me fat ( i was obese ) i would start laughing cuz i was like ""WTF is going on"" it was not laughing like from a joke, it was laughing like a crazed insane person, then their undeveloped 11 year old brains tought i was laughing at them, so they went into 5th gear, but they did not touch me, only if i first started the fight cuz i was filled up on the edge of crying, that happend a lot and i got up and pushed on of them, the girls mainly go away but the boys just fucking jumped me, teachers come and because i was the ""evil of the school"" i got grounded for fighting.

now as a 15 year old i make sure to never ever offend anyone because they will then do shit like those kids did to me.

i am not gonna explain everything that happends because it would take hours, but pretty much it was : getting humiliated by the kids, and the teacher also searched my schoolbag for some reason in the middle of class, found some rotten apple, and told me and the class about how bad parents i have and how un organized my whole schoolbag and my mother was, cuz she had to take care of me and how i look and how i am as a person, my mother was at the time hanging out in clubs at night and literally found her photos of dicks on her laptop, and she was having sex with a lot of men. and yeah that all the shit i remembered.

my mom also thinks i am some evil kids, this really

lets move over to high school, ( it actually gets worse somehow )

so ofcourse, highschool gets told that i am ""evil"" they did not tell all the teachers this time, just principal knows, now at highschool kids have a lot more socializing skills, they start hanging out and being friends i guess but i look at them being social and going out and being friends, while i was sitting on the bank alone again on my phone.

i did not cry one single time during my mothers death, when we were at the hospital where she was dying, we were all watching her visiting her, her eyes open and close, shes not breathing, my whole family bursts out in tears, my sister fucking screams, and what i was doing ? just sitting there like i was kinda sad, HOW THE FUCK WAS I JUST SAD ??? this was not long ago btw, literally 17 days ago, my sister had to be taken to be drugged to be calmed down, my whole family was taking these pills to calm down, i did not take a single one, i did not cry 1 single time for my mothers death, i was just sad.

does this mean my emotions are stronger because of the abuse i dealt with my whole ife ?

more problems about socializing : i have snapchat and instagram, i see these kids nonstop sharing chats and calls about how they talk with eachother for fucking 3 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours on the phone, i see this couple that shares how they let their phones on the call while they fall asleep and they ""talked"" for 11 hours, all these stories sharing how they talk to their friends like :

(these are girls btw) im sure boys would never do shit like this but everytime i saw this i was like, i never do that, i dont have friends, i never had a deep relationship with anyone, i never chat on snapchat, i never chat on instagram, i never chat with anyone, i never talk to people....

24,"have a friend, who i unconditionally love, popped back into my life back in January of this year. We got to know each other 5 years or so before that and instantly connected, like i knew this person my whole life but in reality it had only been a month. After several months she had to move back home due to personal issues, and then eventually she found another guy and got married with a kid.. the guy turned out to be abusive and she reached out to me back in jan after not talking for 5 years and we instantly became friends again and expressed how fortunate we were to have each other and how much we love each other. she apologized a bunch even though i told her no big deal.

then seems like she hit a pretty bad depression phase where she isn't talking as much and only once a month or so. SHE HAS expressed how important i am to her and how i am the only human who gets her and how much she loves me. I have always loved this woman , even though she has a lot of issues and is moody, but i cant control my love for her. Lately she has been not reaching out and i told my self for my own protection i need to let her reach out and not me be the one to do it.. but fuck i miss her so much sometimes it hurts and i start to tear up. I am 31 and not someone who connects with anyone but with her, i would give an arm and leg to see her. she lives in another state with a kid so its hard for me to do anything about it.

I packed  swiss knife, a hunting knife, a multitool, a water canteen, some dried jerky, a few feet of paracord, a sowing kit, and I've been saving up some money about 110 dollars as of today that I keep in a roll inside the backpack.

I just thought of that as a last ditch plan, but I've been having this dream for the last week, every day it gets more detailed, my mom and I argue, y grab my baseball cap and my backpack, I hop on my bike, pedal as fast as I can until I get to a bridge that is about 12 kilometers from where I live and jump.

35," 

Everything in this explanation is in chronological order. Pay attention.

I'm currently going into sophomore year of college studying Aerospace Engineering. Towards the end of high school I started having these crazy panic attacks that would nearly put me in the hospital. Doctors did blood work and a bunch of tests on my heart to make sure it wasn't a physical ailment. Was referred to a therapist (not psychiatric) for treatment. Didn't do a single thing to help me. I just decided to power through and make it my new norm to freak out for no reason until my social radius got smaller and smaller.

Fast forward to start of college. A month in I was literally not able to leave my dorm. My parents were freaked out so they called emergency services to help me get medical attention. I was taken to a psychiatrist and was put on Lexapro for extreme panic disorder. I would be a liar if I said things didn't get better for a short bit, but Lexapro slowly started to fade and I came down from the SSRI boost. I ended up getting into a fist fight with one of my roomates over the air conditioning, and it got to the point where I ended up smashing the thermostat with a hairbrush and had to pay $400, not to mention the police were involved because of the fist fight. I had noticed a huge change in behavior because of these fucking meds. It started to scare me.

Fast Forward 9 months, just after summer semester move in. HUGE panic attack that actually put me in the hospital for real this time. Caused me to lose consciousness and faint, was taken to the ER. Once my psych found out about it, she gave me Klonopin to used ONLY when i absolutely needed it. I never really used it. She also upped my dose to 20mg of Lexapro from 10mg, where I had stabilized.

4 days later I was in a psych ward. I hadn't eaten in 3 days, was talking to my kitchen appliances, was convinced the birds outside my dorm were spying on me, and convinced the garbage truck was killing people and wouldn't come out of the shower. Needless to say my entire family was scared shitless. Since then I had been medically dropped from summer semester and taken home to receive treatment for an acute psychotic episode or psychosis otherwise unspecified. The new psychiatrist has me on Ablilify 10mg. More fucking meds.

Here is where things get interesting. I am fully aware I am fucking psychotic.

Somehow I knew as soon as these panic attacks started happening it would spiral into something major. I knew it. Nobody would listen to me. Doctors just brushed me off and said "" ya got anxiety kid, it happens to everyone"". NO IT FUCKING DOESNT. My life has quite literally spiraled into complete lunacy these past two years. I used to be a smart, healthy, interesting kid. Now I cant come out of the house or drive or do anything. I have not been taking my medication for fear of mind control and fear it will make me sick. I am fully aware that isn't the case, but im scared regardless. Some days are better than others in the sense that I don't feel completely depersonalized and dissociated from everything and everyone, including my parents and brothers. I think this is all just a simulation. None of it is real. Its all just visuals. I haven't gone outside besides doctors appointments, Im always paranoid of getting sick or dying, and nobody being around to help me. And they say the answer to these problems is medication. Sometimes I feel like one day the medication is just gonna fucking kill me and its gonna be over. I sleep until whenever and am still always dead tired no matter how much sleep I get.

So what do I do? Because it's gonna continue to get worse until one day something bad happens and I end up in another hospital somewhere. Its just a big cycle, a continuous loop I am stuck in. It's inescapable and my life has fallen apart. I graduated top of my class in high school and was well on my way to becoming a successful engineer. All that hard work I had put in is gone now, because of my own fucking brain. Its like I look in the mirror and don't even recognize myself anymore, I feel like i've been hexed or a demon is just following me around fucking everything up for me.

So now what? Because I'm about ready to just throw my hands up and let whatever this is take its course.

37," Hello Hello!  
This is something I have been putting off, for a good. . . long while. Though self-diagnosed, I'm fairly certain I have Anxiety and ‚Äúmild‚Äù depression. Debating whether or not to die in middle school doesn't exactly scream ‚Äúdepression free.‚Äù Especially if you decided not to was because A. It would hurt, and B. The consequences to what would happen if I did. Now, my depression has gotten significantly better, I don't think dark thoughts and such. But . . . what would happen if I picked up the shovel and dig myself back into that hole I tried so hard to fill up and covered with flowers?

Not only that, but my mom. My mother is great! She never abused me, she has mostly supported me, she's fine with my sexuality, and she's the one suggesting I go to therapy(clearly I declined, saying I don't need it.) That doesn't exclude her flaws. My mom's judgmental. To people in our family, to strangers just walking on the street. I have tried so, so hard to not judge people, even if they really deserve it. Having your mom judge everyone, well it obviously means she judges you, too. One thing she does, is when I disagree with her ‚Äútoo much‚Äù within a week or something. She calls me Connie, Connie Contrary. She thinks it's just some funny, inside joke. . . but it's not. She's done it for so long and I know she won't stop. It takes her a good while to go ‚ÄúOh. I fucked up.‚Äù But she has her own problems, too. Depression and other such things. It's the reason why I don't vent about my problems to her. She thinks it's all her fault and it isn't! I don't want her to think all my problems are from her. It isn't fair. But she's overprotective, so guess who has no friends to talk to!

And my dad . . . Mom made sure he stayed out of my life. No matter what, there wasn't gonna be a happy ending there. It was the best option. 	My mom is out of town to support a family friend, and I am here. Alone. And I feel my body freaking out. I feel myself disorienting itself. I feel my mind rushing back to all of my worries about my self. Like this ‚Äì What if I'm a sociopath? I'm freaking out about it, so I'm not! . . .Unless??? ‚Äì  So that happens every couple of weeks. Yippy. I always felt that every major choice wasn't mine to have a say in. Move to Pennsylvania? K. Move back to Florida? Sure.

  So going to therapy, is a choice I'm suppose to decide myself. Which is why I think it's something I can't wrap my head around. I can't even write in a personal journal about all my problems, what makes me think I can just. . .t a l k to someone about it?

Throughout this. . .essay, I've tried not to cry. I've walked away from the computer quite a bit to calm my nerves. I don't know what to do. I have a job that I love, the house we rent is more that grand! I have what is almost everything for someone who's poor(which I am.) I'm just not. . .Happy. And I feel like I should be. It's just, the 'what ifs' keep wrapping itself around me and I don't know what will happen. I just. . .need some advice on what to do. I feel like I do, but I also don't. 

I tried so much to have the most positive mindset. I mean, look how I started this, ‚ÄúHello Hello!‚Äù Sounds chirpy to me. But I don't think staying positive is solving anything. It's just putting pretty flowers by weeds and saying it's perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 	

Got (mild, no longer feel like I should die) depression and anxiety, I have things that should make me happy but I'm not, I have literally no friends to ask for advice and such cause of overprotective mom. I don't know what to do. I've always felt like big choices weren't mine to make. But this is big, and my mom isn't going to make it for me. It's only me, and it's too much for me to grasp.   
    
    
 Should I go to therapy?",19Aug2019,1
38,"This whole thing is gonna sound very melodramatic. I‚Äôm a 17 year old, about to start the butt end of my high school career, and I don‚Äôt even know how to defend myself. I need serious help. I‚Äôm going to split this into 4ish parts. 

The relationship:
Recently my girlfriend of a year broke up with me. We‚Äôll call her...Sarah. She left me because she has issues of her own that got between us so I have absolutely no harsh feelings towards her. I understood. Now here‚Äôs the issue. I put more trust in her than anyone I ever have, I trusted her with things I wouldn‚Äôt let my own father know, and my dad is my everything. I was relying on her for a lot more of my self love than I thought I was. I was using our relationship as an uncanny resolve to be happy. Which I know is unhealthy but I didn‚Äôt even know I was doing it. I was using our relationship (which really wasn‚Äôt a healthy one to begin with) as sort of a wall between me and the self loathing issues I have. This situation is so much more complicated but I don‚Äôt even know how to write half of it without writing a book so we‚Äôll leave me and her at that. 

The best friend:
So, we still hang out. Everyday. She‚Äôs still my best friend and we do everything together. But recently the person I called my brother tried getting with her. She didn‚Äôt reciprocate at all, she kindly ignored his statements (him trying to hook up with her without actually saying it). Even after telling him it would end our friendship he continued. Not long after that, he stopped talking to me, and continues to try for her. Call me closed minded but best friends going after your ex is (and bare with me here) against every guy code. (Oh and btw he also stole money from me after doing all that, yeah I don‚Äôt know either.)

The reason:
Now that you have the basis of the sh@t fest the last two months have been, here‚Äôs the reason it all sucks so bad. Now, of course I have a lot of issues behind all this, I have depression, anxiety, a whole slew of mental issues. My main issue is how damn willing I am to throw myself in crossfire just to get into a relationship. It gets me hurt every time. But this break up was different. It‚Äôs like the whole situation is slowly poisoning me and changing me. I‚Äôve had thoughts of getting in fights, getting with someone just to cheat on them, telling people I love, to piss off. Anyone who knows me would read that last sentence and say I didn‚Äôt write that about myself. Usually when people say ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a hole in my chest‚Äù I think to myself oh, that‚Äôs just how they describe the feeling of the emotion they‚Äôre feeling. My god was I wrong to even try to understand what they meant until it happened to me. I woke up at 11AM with a hole, so wide it felt like I might fall into myself. I started my day off by crying into a blanket trying not to let Sarah hear me. I don‚Äôt cry. Usually I‚Äôm dumb enough to internalize the feeling and let it soak for a second and cool down. Usually I wake up and go on Instagram and laugh at some meme pages and watch stupid videos of doggos doing flips. I tried that and nothing even made me smile. Not even a spark of joy. Which is the polar opposite of me. I may be sad and terribly shakey from my anxiety but I‚Äôve found out how to make myself feel happy and be a little ball of boiling joy (lol). But nothing was working. I tried watching my favorite video game on YouTube to get interested in something. Nothing. Nothing was working. Then the fear that I had lost myself set in and made me start to feel powerless. I cried again. (The second time in one day, the first time crying in over 3 years). Since then, it hasn‚Äôt gone away. My dad said it could just be a bad day and he would help me get through it. It‚Äôs been a week now. And nothing. I haven‚Äôt felt anything. 

I don‚Äôt know how to muster up. I want to be able to tell people kindly that I don‚Äôt want them in my life anymore. I want to be able to tell someone they‚Äôre in the wrong without fearing them getting mad at me or not liking me anymore. I just want to stop being so sentimental of everyone else. I‚Äôm not Jesus, I don‚Äôt need to spend my life sacrificing myself for the well being of others. There‚Äôs ways to defend yourself without being a bad person. I just don‚Äôt know how to find it. It‚Äôs so bad I almost apologize for apologizing sometimes. I just deleted a whole paragraph on this post of me apologizing for it being so long. I don‚Äôt need to apologize and I don‚Äôt need to be submissive to other people‚Äôs bad decisions. This post was a last ditch effort for finding anyone who knows how to help. I know so so much about mental health and I plan on becoming a musical therapist as a career after college, so why the hell cant I listen to my own advice?

44,"Hello, please call me Scin, he/him and they/them pronouns y'all.

I'm 15, trans male (ftm, dunno if that's important but felt like it may be) and I've never once seen a therapist for any of my issues but I feel like this may be one. I would also like to apologize for spelling errors, grammar, and things of the like; I'm tired.

Is it normal to feel like theres multiple people stuck in my body?

Hopefully that doesn't sound too odd, but what I mean by this is that it feels like I have multiple people in my head, almost like I have multiple brains. Each ""brain"" feels like a different person, turns on randomly, and behaves in their own separate way.

I tend to call my main personality ""Normal Brain"" since, well, it's my normal personality. 

However theres other brains like ""Angel Brain"", a person/brain that genuinely believes their an angel, cast out from Heaven, desperate to return, and forced into a mortal body that they know is going to kill them when it finally stops. Angel Brain, which I'll call Angel for sort, when in control will just seem desperate for praise, or desire the feeling of holiness and will often scream to the skys in poetic tongue with tears in their eyes screaming about how they're still holy and the feeling of being in Heaven, or the feeling on their fall, etc. The funniest thing about this brain is that I'm not even Christian, sure I believe in the idea of gods, but I don't really believe in ""God"" or Heaven. I was also about to hit POST when I feel like I should also mention this brain uses plural pronouns for themself, or refers to themself like several people, saying ""we"", ""our"", ""us"", and stuff like that in reference to themself.

There's also Carrion Brain, Carrion for short. A wild, bleeding hound left scared and alone and hostile to everyone, left laying on the side of the road with two broken hind legs in the hot sun. Honestly I don't know how to describe this one except that anytime it's active I feel trapped, angry, and almost feral in a way (not the haha I've got rabies joke feral that's been going about the internet but almost like a feral cat)

And this brain, I don't know what to name them and I hate when their active since they make me fear for both my life and anyone around me. This brain, I guess I'll just refer to as Knife for this, is just a homicidal maniac with a developing god complex (I would like to state that I, ""Normal Brain"" don't have a god complex, I barely even see myself as a good person, let alone a god of all things, oh also small warning cause the rest of the paragraph gonna sound a lil gruesome and I know some folks aren't cozy with gore and stuff) believing that they're the most powerful thing to ever exist, and thus they're the only person worthy of killing them and refuses to die unless it's by their own hands on their own terms. They'll also gladly kill others for the smallest of reasons. Hatred, general disliking, they did something annoying, just for the fun of it, etc. and they'll gladly tear themself apart for anyone that they care about. Not only this but they want to tear themself apart in general, often writing in depth paragraphs about veins wanting to be torn out and skin crawling, covered in the insects they feel on their rotten flesh. They're violent towards themself, others, and just everything in general and anytime they're active I get scared I'll lose control and kill someone I love or ruin a perfectly good relationship by them screaming their throat out at the person. They haven't done anything major yet but theres small things that make me scared of them.

Theres also a lot of other brains but I just thought I should list off three of the most common ones, I don't really know exactly what to add to this (its 2 am cut me some slack) so if you want to ask a question about this and maybe help me figure out if this is therapy worthy, go ahead and I'll answer to the best of my ability!",19Aug2019,1

46,"Hey guys,

For years now I've been suffering from very disordered thinking. I honest to god feel like someone might be in control of my brain and is messing with me. I know I don't actually think that's true, and that mental illnesses are chemical imbalances of the brain. But my symptoms are just completely strange and have always had me confused as to what it is I'm suffering with.

I do see a psychiatrist, he diagnosed me with OCD and cylothymia (a lesser serious version of bipolar), I was given lithium to calm my mind down. But it hasn't really gotten rid of the disordered thinking. I also haven't told my psychiatrist all my symptoms for fear that I'll sound completely fucking insane. He just knows about my emotions being high and low sometimes and my compulsive thinking (which is just one part of my disordered thinking).

In terms of the rest, and I'm completely aware how weird this sounds:

Pretty much I feel like my mind gets worse when I jack off, no i'm not trolling. But I feel like when I do, my compulsive thinking gets worse, and my ability to be social gets worse. As in I can go from being able to hold conversations forever to having trouble forming clear thoughts in conversations. I also feel like I ""lose touch"" with other parts of my mind, like my ability to enjoy music, and sometimes I have some delusional thinking. It's weird as it's not some depressive episode but it's almost as if the parts of my mind that are suppose to control these things aren't as effective....idk how else to word it. 

This whole process also works as a cycle, the more I do it my mind gets worse and then eventually ""resets"", after that I can be very social again, have less intrusive/compulsive thoughts, less depersonalization like moments. God as I'm typing this I really do sound like I've lost it -\_-...however lately my mind hasn't ""reset"" and I'm still having trouble socializing and am dealing with issues with sleep. 

I've tried to ""break free"" before as i like to call it, when I ignore all my symptoms and think what I want to think and do what I want to do. Beforehand I'd have a lot of pure OCD like thinking but if I start ignoring everything it tends to causes my symptoms listed above to get worse.

This is why I mentioned that it feels as if someone is control of my brain, like someone is aware of what I do and knows to make me worse after masturbation, or after I try different cognitive behavioral techniques.

All of this is going on all in my head, outside of my head I'm a functional human being. I work a good job and have a good social life (although sometimes my friends may think I'm occasionally more withdrawn). I try to approach this situation logically, but I'm scared. I don't know what's going on in my head. I haven't told my psychiatrist about this side of my mental illness because it's embarrassing and would be extremely uncomfortable...

Has anyone else dealt with weird mental illness symptoms like this????? Is this some form of schizophrenia or psychosis???",19Aug2019,2
47,"Little backstory, I have been dealing with mild depression (i say mild because i've never been diagnosed,but.. i've self harmed when shit got too rough and i have been through rough times. thankfully i'm out of that dark spot) So i decide to go email my doctor (i have kaiser) and they call me back and i call the rn to discuss things. I tell her my history and she asks if i've ever hallucinated which i have last week due to lack of sleep. right after she asks my history she immediately says we're going to get you to see a doctor at a local kaiser and possibly prescribe you meds. i was thrown back like woah i didn't know you have to see a doctor in order to get therapy? i've never been to a therapist or even know anyone who's done it besides my bf and he didn't see his doctor or physiatrist for what he went to (wasn't mental health but drugs which has lead to mental health) I'm not sure if I should even go see my doctor anymore because the copay is $50 and i'm a college student (2nd year) money is TIGHT. literally I do have insurance but it doesn't cover visits, the nurse did say i should be covered for therapists but idk. she mainly wants me to see my doctor to see if i even need meds i personally DONT think i do because it has been 4 months since i've last self harmed myself. life has treated me pretty good of course there were time that were hard but not to where i would contemplate suicide or even self harming myself. which makes me happy to think about, i just don't want to become addicted to the pills they prescribe i've had a pill problem with benadryl (would take nearly 4 a day to either help me sleep or more than 4 if i wanted to feel the ""high"" fucking hated it.) and i DONT want to go back. never. i'm 4 months clean from cutting and pills i just thought i should go see a therapist to finally talk about it just because, I feel like it'd be good for me to finally talk to someone who specializes in it besides my close friend or my bf. My parents don't know about this though... i don't know how to bring it up. i do plan on telling them one day i'm just afraid of making them feel guilty and stuff, i live with them too and it's just a lot to do. anyways yeah, i was wondering what process did you guys go through when you decided to see a therapist? thank you so much",19Aug2019,1
48,"Is it common for people that suffer with Mental Health problems to be less sensitive to (physical) pain?

Thinking back there are some times that I think if I didnt have these Mental Health issues, I wouldn't be able to tolerate physical pain like I do

I had 2 episodes where I just couldn't function beyond a various basic level due to crippling pain

I went to Urgent Care the 2nd time (its basically one step above a Dr office, but 1 step below a hospital, for non life-threatening emergencies) and got checked out, but they seemed baffled even having an Xray machine

I think with my current job and knowing it has an established pattern, that next time I would get over my stubbornness and actually go to a hospital 

I even have a function where I can choose to enjoy my pain so my body releases endorphins and I dont feel miserable due to being in bad physical pain

I think another part is the whole ""tough guy"" gender role for a male where we aren't supposed to show weakness or complain about anything, so we act like we are indestructible and are never actually hurting

I think I have been corrupted by that system as well. Because sometimes I just feel amazing and get super irritated when someone is complaining that I get mad over it and kinda turn into a bit of a bully and a jerk

Its especially maddening when someone is just being insanely unreasonable to me, or I feel like people are just being fake or hateful",19Aug2019,2
49,"After a fall out with a friend. They cut all ties with me randomly, 2 weeks later it started to get better, they tried talking but then started pressuring me mentally, telling me to get a job ""you cant keep doing this"" this lead to me wanting to end myself which they called the police on me. 

After talking to the police and Samaritans I did alot of thinking and although this person has been a huge pillar of support for me. They constantly lied to me, caused me stress, pressured and manipulated me into doing things I expressed that i didn't want to do. I decided I didn't need this person as a friend anymore, so I instead cut ties. I honestly felt better to be done with it.

Now I just feel angry whenever I see this person for how this person treated me. I feel like I want to verbally lash out when I see this person but I stop myself cause I'm not that type of person. This person works just round the corner from where I live so it's inevitable that we will cross paths on top of in the friendship group / group chat

Hey,¬†

So I'm 19 and I was looking for a job to have while at uni and I had a very difficult time I applied for 160+ jobs and I got 1 interview and I got that job, not being wanted was making me depressed and I had that job for 3 weeks and then I suddenly got very sick, I got blood clots in my lungs and heart and my heart failed. I should have died I was in ICU for 2 weeks and recovering for 2 months and after I was better I had one shift at work and they fired me. So now I have no job and I feel very sad and depressed like someone hit me with a truck. I know I'm going to struggle a lot to get one and all my family say stuff like you do nothing, your lazy, get a job. I do 3 kinds of volunteering and full-time uni with perfect grades so I don't think I'm lazy.¬†

I am a full-time neuroscience student in 2nd year and I have a perfect GPA of 7 and I'm terrified of losing it I would honestly probably sacrifice my friends and my health to keep it at a 7 I worked so hard to keep that I even managed to keep full marks while I was in ICU (it was week before exams when I got out). I honestly don't know what I would do if my GPA drops its unthinkable but I have a VERY hard course load this semester and the classes are really difficult and its a very large possibility that I'm going to end up with a 6.7 - 6.9 not a 7 and I would probably have a literal mental breakdown if that happens. Uni and grades are my life doing well academically is the only thing I have going for me in life and is the only thing I'm good at and proud of.¬†

I should mention I have GAD and am medicated and see a therapist.¬†

51," Sleep and mental health are closely connected. Sleep deprivation affects your psychological state and mental health. And those with mental health problems are more likely to have insomnia or other sleep disorders.  Americans are notoriously sleep deprived, but those with psychiatric conditions are even more likely to be yawning or groggy during the day. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Traditionally, clinicians treating patients with psychiatric disorders have viewed insomnia and other sleep disorders as symptoms. But studies in both adults and children suggest that sleep problems may raise risk for, and even directly contribute to, the development of some psychiatric disorders. This research has clinical application, because treating a sleep disorder may also help alleviate symptoms of a co-occurring mental health problem.  The brain basis of a mutual relationship between sleep and mental health is not yet completely understood. But neuroimaging and neurochemistry studies suggest that a good night's sleep helps foster both mental and emotional resilience, while chronic sleep deprivation sets the stage for negative thinking and emotional vulnerability.

Transferring to one of the UCs this Fall 2019. Im just average at everything. Still no real life professional work experience. Just settle for part time jobs like labor and less thinking while going to school. For a long time I don't think I can earn more.

 Besides that I have horrible anxiety in communication and talking to people because I just speak what I really think and doesn't know how to make jokes so everything is awkward and lots of the time they lose interest in hearing my honest thoughts. I even thought networking is like taking advantage of people when you only need them. I guess because I think making friends in genuine way is when we can share our honest thoughts and just help others without expecting anything in return, that kind of trust takes time to build. So people think I'm weird and cold. So I fail in building connections.

55,"I'm going to start this off by stating that I've been cheated before. Twice. This is how my 3 years relationship with my previous girlfriend ended. It ruined me emotionally, made me super insecure, paranoid and paved the way to huge trust issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating my girlfriend nearly 1 year ago, and until 2 months ago it was almost perfect. She is beautiful, caring, supportive and has a great personality. I'm quite an introvert and I don't like going out, and for the first time in my life, someone understood this and didn't judge me or force me to go out. For the first time after the break-up I was feeling really happy, and it went on for about 9 months. I want to say that absolutely love this girl, and I'm sure she feels the same about me. She wouldn't do anything to hurt me, and I have complete trust in her. 2 months ago, she went to a different country trough a work and travel program, and that's when it all started. She met new people, guys mostly (she's not a girly type of girl, she mostly spends time with guys, even in our home country she used to, so I don't have a problem with this). At the time of writing this, I am extremely stressed over the fact that I might pass my semester, we have nowhere to live when we move back in the city we study and I have 12 hour work-shifts every single week and no time to study for my exams. I also overthink a lot and I tend to feel depressed when I feel alone, and since she left, I felt alone daily, since I have very few friends that've been busy as well. For the last month, I felt she was being more and more distant and that she no longer gives me the same attention she used to when she was home. This may have to do with the fact that there's a 9 hour time difference between our countries. To make things worse, last month, she met this guy, call him A (18 years old, 3 years younger than her), who is a colleague at one of her workplaces. I only found out about him about last week, I don't know why she didn't tell me about him earlier. She told me she is super nice towards her and he is a handsome guy (I don't mind her saying this, we constantly talk about good looking people) and that she likes him as a friend, since he's too young and she has a boyfriend. She started hanging out with him, smoking weed and going shopping together, since he's got a car. I had a feeling that he liked her, since he is constantly asking her out and talking to her a lot. Turns out I was right, she knows he likes her, but she doesn't see this as a problem and why it should bother me. I told her I'm ok with this as long as they don't hand out alone when they smoke, cause I don't know what kind of a person he is. My problem is that, before meeting this guy, she didn't use Snapchat for about 8 months, and started using it again after meeting this guy. She also convinced him to get an Instagram to talk there. They talk a lot. Fast forward to today, we had a fight in the morning (evening at her) because I told her that I feel she is being distant from me and that she is acting different. That's just how I feel. It's true I fucked up by not considering how she feels about this as well, since she's in a different country, surrounded by strangers. It wasn't a huge fight, but after it concluded, they went together shopping and after that she told me that they went smoking. Alone. After she got home she told me they smoked together and it was because how I made her feel. She then fell asleep without telling me good night.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am so devastated for some reason. Even tough I know she won't do anything to hurt me, I can't help but overthink everything. It's killing me. I've been super jealous for the last month, my trust issues were sky rocketing and after today I think I'm losing it. I've hurt her and I feel terrible for it. I'm constantly thinking that if I keep doing this, she'll find shelter in him, and she'll left me. I feel so insecure and so bad about all this. I can't even write coherently, there were so many things left out, that I didn't tell you. I just need someone to talk to. I feel lonely and exposed. I'm afraid, I don't know what to do.",19Aug2019,1

 In the army, I've always had nightmares.  Every night was filled with terror and sleeplessness and loud screaming that just wouldn't go away.

I couldn't sleep because I was scared all the time, I couldnt stay awake cause of the suicidal thoughts and attacks constantly barraging me.

Now I'm home, and most nights seem to be dreams of happier times. I keep dreaming of the girl I loved who now despises me, I keep seeing her smile, hearing her laugh, feeling her touch, and feeling her weight on the bed. Only to wake up and see it's still empty.

Why does my brain do this? All I want to do is to sleep, but it keeps bringing me back to dreams and memories that only stress me out and make me feel depressed.

62,"So I (25F) met a guy (22M) 3 years ago. We hit it off right away, we were so alike. We quickly becamse best friends and we were also FWB for a while, but this stopped and we were both ok with it. We still had so much fun together.

But he's depressed. I used to be depressed for the biggest part of my life, but thankfully I got out of it and regained confidence. But my friend, Jake, hasn't. He has happy and sad episodes. When he hits a sad episode, he can be depressed for months at a time. But when he's happy again, everything is great in his eyes. Kinda like manic episodes. He takes Xanax and smoked weed almost every day to cope, smokes cigs a lot,...

I was always there for him. We were cuddle buddies even. His family and friends loved me. During last Christmas, he was again very depressed. So as a present I decided to ask all of his friends and close relatives to use one positive word to describe him and so I collected over 20 words and made a miniature book out of it tagging who used what word for him. It made him quite emotional and happy. He got me a gift that was a very memorable and funny token from the first time we met, I was surprised he remembered that from 3 years ago.

He lives in another country btw, but I'd visit him every few months and he always asked me to stay at his place for weeks at a time but we co-habited very well. We were seriously 2 peas in a pod. Then he started acting a big strange. More affectionate, would come up behind me when I did the dishes and put his arms around me, kiss me on the cheek, be protective whenever guys flirted, ... So I thought he might liked me but he's quite a fuckboy so I forgot about that idea and kept dating guys and telling him about it. Then he became more cold and distant after the last time I visited him. And one day he just blew up and said I was too fucking stupid to be friends with and he can't deal with stupid and dumb people. He has 150IQ or something so he is pretty smart but he's never complained about this before and I also got 2 bachelor degrees so I know I'm not stupid.

And then he blocked me on Messenger where we had that talk. I reached out via insta, he just said ""oh, forgot to block you here"" and did so. So I tried snapchat and there he didn't block me ubt suddenly got very nasty. I told him respectfully that his words were very hurtful. He said he must be a psychopath because he didn't give a fuck about how I felt. Kept saying things so bad that I literally couldn't bear it anymore, it brought me to tears so I blocked and deleted him.

Now it's 6 months later and only now I've told some of my other close friends about this because even though we never dated, it felt like a heartbreak and I never experienced anything like that. Losing a best friend hurts like a bitch. Anyways, my friends said it seemed like he tried very hard to push me away on purpose. Seeing his depression and everything, it did make sense. because it made 0 sense he said all of that shit to me while he treated me with the most care and love for 3 years. Now I'm wondering if I should somehow try reaching out again to him. I got an alt FB account or I could make another instagram account or whatever or ask a mutual friend to relay a message but I'd rather not use a middle man.

I'm only scared of his reaction. I'm just now getting over all of this so it would devastate me if he'd say the same shit again. I don't even know if he ever really cared for me anymore or if it was his pain talking. He's always been there for me and I don't want to give up on him yet. But what would be the best approach?

63," (in case youre not a fluent sarcastic speaker like me that title is a fucking drastic understatement and Sorry in advance for any miss-spellings. And please don‚Äôt be to harsh on me if I‚Äôm being stupid here. And also for laying out a 500 word sob fucking story) skip to para 3 if you‚Äôre getting board.

so my father and I were rebuilding a brick and mortar wall out the front of our house. As far as I remember it was a nice hot day and my father was teaching me how to lay bricks and mix concrete correctly. I understood the concepts fine. 2 scoops sand, 1 scoop concrete, and add water until you get the correct consistency, but I digress. I struggled lining the bricks up with the line because I was young (like 5 or 6 young) and found it difficult. Anyway, the moral so far is it‚Äôs a good day.

At the end of said day my father was stood behind me to my left cleaning the tools and he already had me pointing and spraying a hose toward the general direction of the wall. Then he said/did sompthing idk what, but it made me look over my shoulder and as I did, I think the hose slowly started creeping up. I noticed what he was cleaning, and he told me to ‚Äúwatch where youre pointing that hose pipe‚Äù so I looked back and I held it still. Only now it was probably only slightly higher, and I was probably spraying the wall a little. Then suddenly from out of nowhere, for no obvious reason and without warning. (he normally shouts) he swiftly pulled down my trousers and pants and smacked me on the ass whith what he was cleaning. Keep in mind this all took place in the space of around 2 seconds from when I looked over my shoulder. Saw He was cleaning a motor trowel. And my god I swear when I think about it to much, I can still feel the fucking numbness in my ass that persisted for days. that or I‚Äôm sitting down for too long.

Now every day usually when I‚Äôm in bed chilling on yt at night the thought will brush by and then ill start thinking about a bit, then a bit more, until I fall asleep sometimes shed a tear or two. And it had affected my trust whith my parents. As long as I can help it, I will chose to walk behind them so they cant just smack me. Even jokingly. And I‚Äôve been doing that for the last 6 months or so. Whenever I lose concentration on both (especially my dad i.e. where they are) if they‚Äôre not in front of me I feel my heart sink and feel sick to the stomach for a few seconds to make Shure he isn‚Äôt behind me then its fine and I go on whith my day. And when he is behind me I feel sick scared that he will hit me jokingly in public and ill lose my shit. Idk what ill do but I see myself having no control over myself and that kind of scares me. Like what if I get arrested or worse if a stranger or a mate hits my ass i feel like I might kill them. Now I don‚Äôt want to do that.

But recently I took a trip whith 2 of my mates to the capital city (unspecified\_generic\_city.png) and I found myself subconsciously telling them to walk in front of me and ill follow. They found it odd and eventually one of them asked me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you walk beside us youre always behind us and youre never like it in school ‚Äú(16yo just finished a month or so ago) and that‚Äôs when I realised I was not only doing it whith my parents but I‚Äôm now starting to do it whith friends as well. I don‚Äôt do out much but when I do, I don‚Äôt want to be lagging behind because I probably won‚Äôt get invited out again.

69,"I've been dealing with progressively worsening paranoia over the past one to two years. It's gotten to the point to where I don't think I'm capable of having any kind of relationship outside of the two previously established ones within my family (and even those can get rocky). Because of this I've been spending the past six or so months trying to come to terms with the fact that I'm just not capable of dealing with people.

I'm totally socially inept because I've spent most of my life as a loner and I'm so damn neurotic that when I look at it from an outsider's perspective I see nothing but reasons to give me a wide berth. Anytime someone is friendly it scares me and makes me distrustful and wondering what they're trying to get out of me or why they're pitying me (I don't think I act in a particularly pitiful manner in person, I'm just quiet).

I realize it doesn't necessarily make rational sense to feel this way, but I can't turn any of it off as much as I tried.

\----

I am a very unhappy 30 year old woman. I don't have a great outlook for my future. I work in a high paying medical field and have good health insurance, but I am so stressed and busy at my job that I have to take an Uber to work every day to not waste more than 15 minutes away from my computer instead of my usual 45 minute route on the train. My job is high paying, but I can't afford to do this commute longterm ---- even though I've been doing this for about 8 months now after I broke my nose and face in an accident and lost a lot of confidence and efficiency. My father is disinterested in talking to me as a rule and my mother has pushed me away as disappointing physically and needy emotionally. When bad things happen to me, like car accidents or getting my face broken or being taken advantage of sexually or floods ruining my things, my parents called me pitiful. I want to be better at my job so I don't have to work 18 hour days and I can focus on maintaining my wellness and maybe finding a boyfriend, buying a house, and having a family. I've had two boyfriends in my past. One started doing cocaine and left me because I told him to stop. He pushed me sometimes and yelled at me for bothering him for physical intimacy. The other boyfriend pushed me down when I gave him the wrong kind of look for biting his nails, and I had learned my lesson and told him we were done. I tried to date for a while after that, but I am suffering and not my best self. I have been told I'm a 5-7 out of 10, and that I would need to have a very happy and attractive personality to attract a significant other.

I have some sick days saved up and want to take some time off work to do something that will help me be a better person, but I can't figure out what that is.

I have a therapist that I see once every two weeks, but I don't find it helpful at that interval. I tried antidepressants, but they made me less effective at my job, which adds to my stress level. My therapist is currently recommending reframing via CBT to help me, but I can't find relief from this. 

I do wish I was dead, but I don't want to hurt myself. Is there a place where you can go where someone comforts you somehow for like a week straight? I have a lot of pain inside of me emotionally and in my physical body. I took a class on meditation, but I can't manage to comfort myself through it. I am silent on the outside and try my best to appear professional and efficient, but I am screaming and crying silently inside of myself all of the time.",19Aug2019,1
71,"So, the title is pretty self explanatory, but here's some back story. This will be long. 
I (25f) have three younger brothers, each spaced ~2 years apart. My brother (23m) born after me has been having suicidal thoughts and severe depression for years and our family has tried to help him but he thinks we are all against him. We had a rough upbringing to say the least, parents had a toxic relationship, our dad is a narcissist, mom is suspected to be bipolar, probably brought on by being with my dad for so many years. Her mood would change at the drop of a hat. My dad was abusive, mentally, physically, and emotionally. He still wont admit to that but it is what it is. 
My brother got a LOT of hell from my dad. He was very hard on him. None of us kids learned healthy coping skills for life as kids. I myself am just now getting to a point where I feel like i am finally coming out of the crazy fucked up mind cycle that I was taught as a child, so I know how fucking hard it is to save your own self after being raised like that. 
My grandpa passed away in 2014, and he was like the father my brother never had. Taught him everything he knows pretty much, but losing him fucked my brother up and he hasn't been able to cope. Losing my grandpa is what triggered my brothers debilitating depression. He got married to his high school sweetheart at 19 I believe, but they were toxic and she couldn't figure out how to help my brother and they ended up divorced after like 3 months, tops. This put him in serious debt. He had bought them a home and he was left with the debt for that. After his divorce, he sunk even deeper and started drinking more. He would get drunk and his ""true feelings"" would come out. He would cry like hes just lost everything all over again, every time he drank. He would say that he always feels that way, but hes too much of a pussy to admit it while sober (his words.) He would try to get his gun, he would say he just wants someone to help him but he wont listen while drunk, and wont talk while sober. My husband and I moved into where he was living to try to help him, which is my grandma's place. We couldn't help him because he wouldn't let us.  He thought if he could find a woman to love him, she could save him. 
So he met his current fiance. They were living together within a month (she moved into our grandma's place with us, with her two kids) and she soon saw how severe my brother was. She tried to help him, but he blamed her for everything now. Hes in a bad mood? Her fault. Hes depressed? Her fault. He doesnt get sex? Her fault. He isnt happy? Everything is her fault and he treats her like shit but she stays because she sees the potential and doesnt want to leave him like this. 
So my brother decided maybe having a child would save him. Him and gf try to conceive, they have miscarriages but on the 3rd try she gets successfully pregnant and now he has a 4 months old baby girl! Shes perfect. 
But it didnt save him.
He often dumps all the kids off with my mom or anyone really so him and his fiance can go do whatever. Fiance HATES this but goes with it bc it's what he wants. 
Hes still drinking. 
Hes still suicidal. 
He wants help but wont admit he even has a problem. Of course, drinking is part of the problem but the main problem is his ability to cope with life. 
This came to a head saturday night. He invited my family over. We have two kids, 4yo girl, 5 month old boy. 
My daughter decided she wanted to stay the night and play with her cousins. We decide that's fine, nobody is drinking. So we leave her there. 
Around 1 am, my mom comes beating on our door waking us up saying shit is going down at my brother house. He got drunk, heard the wrong song, and started acting crazy. Tried to get his gun to shoot himself, tried to leave in his truck. His fiance told the older kids to take the little ones inside and lock the door, then she went and tackled him in the yard to prevent him from leaving. This is NOT the first incident like this, there have been a LOT the past few years but it was the first my daughter was involved in. The cops were called, he was taken to the hospital and mental health services were called but they just chalked it up to alcohol and sent him home the next day after he sobered up. 
I wasnt mad, I know he is sick. Obviously its unacceptable that our daughter was involved but that's on us for leaving her there. 
How do I help him, if he wont admit he has a problem? 
Every day, I'm waiting for the call. One day he will be successful in hurting himself and I CANNOT accept that theres nothing his family can do. There HAS to be something. Please someone give us advice. He needs help. He has a family now. He has a good heart but he cant beat this. He cant see it as us trying to help him, he just thinks everyone is against him and laughs it off.  

I know he has potential. He is NOT a lost cause. I know he wants to be better, he tries so fucking hard to have the stuff he thinks can make him successful. House, kids, a woman. He has it all, although he cant really afford the stuff he does have. It's like he wants everything now, and not have to work for it.  

I know this was a long post, so. 

TLDR- brother is suicidal, depressed, probably manic. He is suffering. Our family is suffering. We HAVE to find out how to get to him before it's too late. We need help.",19Aug2019,1

73,"So this all started suddenly about a week and a half ago... I dont think there was a specific reason why, but I started having these homosexual thoughts, they kept popping in my head, I had this doubt that maybe I was homosexual, but Im sure im not. So this thoughts kept popping for about 5-6 days, like everytime i saw an attractive man, this doubt would fill my head with these thoughts... But keep in mind, I am straight and I even accepted that maybe I was curious, but then it got worse... I started having these thoughts about suicide, NO NOT SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, but about the topic suicide like, ‚ÄúNo I would never do something like that‚Äù and these thoughts kept popping in my head, and contrary to the homosexual ones there were no apparent triggers, these thoughts happened for 2 days which were like hell to me, I think I had 2 panic attacks (first time ever in my life) and 2 days later these thoughts vanished, however during all this time i was searching for answers in the internet and saw that what i was feeling was similar to OCD. Now after having those thoughts about suicide, they have gone away and have been replaced with a fear that I suffer from ocd. For the last 3 days i have been struggling with thoughts that I suffer from OCD, like I can think about other things by distracting myself by doing some things I enjoy, but when i am left alone with nothing else than my mind (like right after i wake up for example) I start thinking that maybe I have OCD.

Another thing I would like to share is that I have no apparent physical compulsions.

I would like to know if my situation to you seems like I really suffer from OCD. 

Like a lot of the symptons I ve been struggling with are comparable to OCD, but my obsession doesnt stick too much time, and this is the first time i am ever struggling mentally and maybe the shock is the reason why i am thinking so much about it. It is also the first time I am been under so much anxiety in my life.

I would like to get your opinions and to know if medical help is needed in your opinion, due to the fact i have been only struggling with this for a week and a half.",19Aug2019,1
74,"Apologies as this will be a lengthy post, as a lot has happened in the last few days. There will be a TL;DR at the end. 

To start some background. We live in the US (GA), I am her SO, not a family member. However her family does not speak English, so I‚Äôve been a translator of sorts. The SO in question is an adult which makes this a degree more difficult. Another hurdle is the fact that she is a Trans (MtF) Woman.

My SO of three years did not have a great schedule and was suffering from a lack of sleep for an extended period of time. She suffers from a history of anxiety and depression, which she was already seeking care for and was being watched by a medical professional. Along with this, as well as the lack of sleep, she had issues at work regarding a manager that seemed to kick off her problems.

She was displaying symptoms of a manic episode, her parents eventually brought her to care and I personally talked to the therapist regarding things as I was an emergency contact. This is where she got the prospective diagnosis of a manic episode and the therapist recommended lots of rest and continued visits to the therapist to continue treatment. I will note that this is the first and only time she‚Äôs shown these symptoms according to her family.

The other night (8-17-19) according to her mother, she had a ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô. From her sister the next day I learned that she had an anger episode and from her words ‚ÄúWas made worse by her parents yelling at her.‚Äù Police were called and held her down and sedated her, and she was promptly taken to the hospital. Personally I‚Äôve spoken to her parents to explain how this is NOT the way to handle a person during a manic episode. I know that famously the Latino community turns a blind eye to mental health and I‚Äôve only recently been able to explain how this isn‚Äôt the work of the devil. 

I learned the next day that she got transferred to a behavioral health hospital over an hour away. She does not have her phone, no way to contact us. I looked up the hospital and the reviews are a stellar 2.2 out of 400+ reviewers. What scares me the most are the reviews of Trans people being mistreated, forced to room with males, having their genitals inspected and harassed... generally making me beyond sick to my stomach. 

I‚Äôve called and we don‚Äôt have a patient number, they‚Äôve said they would give her my phone number and let her call if she needs to. Honestly I don‚Äôt even trust them to do that much. I‚Äôve been calling about once a day to make sure she‚Äôs at least there. Her parents haven‚Äôt had any luck either. My main worries with this are that she could have signed off on treatment, she could be drugged, she may not have access to a phone... I know HIPPA laws are in effect but in my experience you could at least visit a patient in hospitals should you be family.

I‚Äôve read about a 72 hour hold... though I‚Äôm not too sure how the laws are in the US for mental hospitals. The best case is to get her out of there and get her to therapy, as I‚Äôve already spoken to her therapist about the situation. I just don‚Äôt know how or when.

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is what are some resources we can contact, how can we get her out of there ASAP. Just generally asking for advice as a scared loved one. 

As always thank you, and apologies for any typos. If needed I can answer questions in the comments. As well as crosspost this somewhere else if needed.

TL;DR: SO going through manic episode, got in fight with parents, they called authorities who sedated and took her to hospital, got admitted to behavioral hospital, currently seeking advice on what to do.",19Aug2019,2

Now this is where things changed from being just a normal day to a dream,  because normally here I would either be just trying to go to sleep and get on to the next day, or just thinking about what I can do to prevent the arguing tomorrow. But in the dream, I went to my room, grabbed a shotgun, and blew my head off. End of dream. I wake up with tears of joy.

Names have also been changed for the security of everyone, this is VERY long and I thank you very much if you even stay to hear my story just to know you're not alone in anything (I encourage you to explain and reach for help to someone, Anyone you trust, with a good heart or even a therapist who you know cant spread anything and wants to help, or if you have a limited amount of trusted friends/ just cant handle person to person conversations with deep topics(me included, dont feel alone!) do something like this! And super big thanks in advanced if you're willing to give advice pertaining to my story or if you suffer with similar things, your ways to relieve the feeling/urges or anything!

Me- 18 Y/o Male. In a happy relationship of almost 2 years. Diagnosed with general anxiety(not exactly sure the name) and moderate depression (I wasnt completely truthful in fear of being sent to a ward) so honestly probably worse even back then too And has been getting worse, so very possibly and what feels like severe depression, which makes me only want to leave home for work and other occasions I feel I have to.

1.) Anxiety
The only things that really induce/trigger bad anxiety (beyond usual social anxiety which I'll get to) are driving (i have a permit, but I've only driven down my street once, and in an empty lot) Even that was overwhelming though, i dont even want to think about a highway üò£ and I started to panic; or freak out as I like to say) and another is getting too many tasks to do at once (I can do multiple things to what I think is a &gt;maybe?&lt; Reasonable extent. Dont misinterpret that!) BUT for example at work (side note 1.Decently popular restaurant right next to a very popular park, And its summer | 2. Only have worked there 4 months so not exactly great at it yet) If I'm the only cook there (not supposed to be just one at any time other than the morning when we aren't busy at all) if we get too busy, I'll start panicking, rushing around the whole kitchen, grill to fryers back and forth until I'm damn near the point of breaking down, rather than ask a supervisor/manager for help because of my social anxiety mainly, and maybe unconsciously scared for them to maybe relieve me of my job. Being since I cant handle it often or I also feel it may prevent me from receiving a promotion. Calling in makes me feel terribly guilty, even though it shouldn't because some call out many times a week. Also have worked washing dishes at a smaller eatery (Haha that word is fun) but MANY labor laws were broken in addition to selfish-asshole boss/co workers which made me feel inadequate in work situations now that I really think. Left that job in a 2 month long period of mainly happiness, in which I sold drugs to make money which yes is bad BUT I stopped! and then my family caught on, and I was told to get a legal job or I had to live with my mom, which I haven't lived with for 2-3 years, and didnt live in a preferably location or place, which is an apartmemt. Mom lives a decent drive away and I try not to worry her too much but if I truly need help I will. Though many things on here may be because I push myself too hard and expect the most out of myself at all times Because I strive to be more successful than my biological father (backstory Abused his girlfriend in front of me when I was 13-14 while trying to tell me she deserved it) that night, I also stepped up to and almost faught this coked up father figure of mine because he threatened my mother when she came to get me) I've been told that that might have something to do with my mental illnesses/problems and habits deeply, maybe even mainly. But I'm not completely convinced because I've thought deeply about a lot of things, that being included.

1a.) Social anxiety
(Short one in relation to others)
I grew up as a shy kid keeping to myself usually playing my Nintendo DS (Pokemon ftw) and only had a few kids that I really was comfortable with (about 2-3 actual guy friends tops which I still talk to 2 of, no deep conversations pop up unless they were to tell me something deep, because I'm concerned with their well being) because I build a shell around myself, even to my girlfriend (who side note; has literally saved my life ‚ù§) and I keep my problems to myself either due to fear of judgement or thinking I can handle them, when often I cant.
I can only carry on conversations for say, just a half hour usually max IF the person I'm talking to is a good/old friend, a just plain good conversation maker, or is saying something interesting. If someone, or the conversation dont match any of those, I really dont mean to be rude but ide rather keep to myself and if you try to talk to me you'll get short/unexplanitory answers.

2.) Anger issues
Back about exactly a year ago give or take, on any given day I would still be depressed, BUT I would always be a kind person (acknowledge statements in conversations {whether it be deep, or normal} with nice or helpful answers. And that would just come naturally since I dont like when people give me attitude (big trigger) so I didnt (and try not to now) do that to others. But as of recently, even the slightest things can cause anger either by slowly coming out ALL DAY to everyone I come across, or in one or 2 big bursts of yelling (I prefer these because if blow up on somebody, I realize right away and feeling bad about it floods out the anger, often relieving it.
More triggers include but not in any order are;
people asking me more than one question in a row
People treating me like a lesser person due to my age, past, problems, or sometimes even position at work (Even If they're my superior, if they dont give me respect then they won't get it back, try to be very, very careful with this but have given boss attitude once or twice.

3.) Suicide-Related past briefing
First suicidal thoughts began ide say 16 years old
If I remember correct I had actual real problems, being that I was almost failing all of my classes mainly because I refused to do homework, maybe because I was never correctly disciplined, and built the image early on that I dont like talking, so when they ask if I had homework ide just say no, even if I said yes mom wouldn't check its completion, plus very bad attendance issues so bad child services had to be involved. Second big issue being; I thought I got a girl pregnant, which caused multiple breakdowns, some in school because I was 16 in highschool!
But not bad news but also not pleasant, she lied about being pregnant for 2 months for a reason I still dont know. That caused me to have trust issues from then on, getting further worsened after being cheated on by my next girlfriend. Mainly just generally worried that any information I tell one person, will be spread to everyone, and early on insecurities in my current relationship(passed now) but trust issues are to short to have their own section, sorry! Near suicide story in the next section!

4.) Drug use (kept last so you'd have unbiased thoughts on everything before)

Background and early, ""non harmful use (very probable causes of current drug issues);
My whole entire mother's side of the family smokes cigarettes, a small handful dont, and almost equally with my dad's side, which I didnt see as often, now rarely ever do
Mom used to be very addicted to prescription pills
Dad was and still actually might be a crack/cokehead and alcoholic
He left while I was a small baby though, so after, my mother's new boyfriend stayed with her and supported us until the day he died, because he too did drugs and overdosed on what I was told to be a mix of narcotics and benzos (wasn't told then, I was only 10!)
I personally, started smoking cigarettes at the very young age of 12, maybe just to defy rules, not sure Haha. They were always in access due to the amount of people that smoked, and it was all in the house so my room would just smell like everything else.

Before I touched a drop of alcohol, at 13, on memorial day I smoked weed for the first time (with one of my close friends I still talk to, and get bud from now occasionally lol)
And within a year (at 14) I was emotionally addicted to marijuana and have been ever since not going a single day in 4 years without smoking. which for the longest time I denied being, but it's very very easy to become addicted! even if it doesn't cause physical withdrawal symptoms like prescriptions or narcotics, it can still turn into a habit that may follow you, so even if you cant die from it, it can become a big problem later on, just be careful!
After is alcohol at 13, maybe a month after smoking for the first time, not a big fan at the time, but then when I was 16 I drunk a lot at once, about once or twice a week
The illegal drug jump:Adderall;
Prescribed primarily for adhd, an old friend had them, and boredom caused me to try one, after only have done them a handful of times, not exactly my thing.

The one that made me want more of IT and others:Cocaine; Also, my relationship and details on my marijuana use

Upon meeting my current girlfriend, I started hanging out with her friends and one of them that I considered a friend had it and asked if I wanted some coke (wasnt peer pressured, he made it clear it was only if I wanted to try it and not to if I was nervous at all)
But this is after I had developed depression, so an escape from baseline feelings while high on weed alone (tolerance never getting a break over years, and being used to being stoned on the daily through any and all activities dulled any kind of ""magic"" from weed which at my peak, I was smoking an ounce to myself every week(currently still smoke a little under or equal to half ounce a week, depending on price but its progress none the less!) Reason being, I cant properly cope with boredom, so normally, if I'm doing anything at all, even with other people, or just alone, I smoke (by myself is the case 99% of the time since I experience physical exhaustion, or lack of motivation from depression; making me only leave the house for work, and to get my next bag of something) and my girlfriend has been through with, and helped me since the beginning of my first cocaine use to--&gt; right now, proofreading all of this and helping with errors! Thank you my Penguin üíò (she used to smoke but stopped due to paranoia-like symptoms, doesn't enjoy drinking, or doing any drugs, just cigarettes a little more than me. This is very nice to me for many reasons, mainly being that if she doesn't try them, she cant get hurt by or addicted to them, which I ask her not to do often, just because i know that I'm a bad influence, even to other drug users at times and dont want to get her hooked on the wrong path because she's only been addicted to hydrocodone for a month(I also took those;mixed them with hydros and maybe? Xanax) but other than her cigarettes she didn't &gt;need&lt; anything else emotionally {to prevent harm to herself specifically meaning}she didnt do that often at all, and even better, shes about as clean from that as I am!}(she has her ups and downs, and its no competition in any form and I dont like to discredit/diminish the importance of someones mental health) But It isn't a secret that she's more emotionally prepared and able to cope than me, and while this makes me feel like a lesser being a guy and all, I know that I wasnt taught/raised correctly (which may have led to any one of the things described here) and she had one constant father figure (not pill/narcotic addicted parents which I did) so luckily convincing her to stop wasnt too hard considering she understands the worries of having a drug addicted loved one. I helped her withdrawal symptoms (back rubs to fall asleep or she would be up all night etc) and she repays the favor when needed. Back to my boredom coping issue, during any activity (limited enjoyed activities are Apex legends, and music has a nice place in my heart. I constantly have something lit, either a cigarette, or the bowl. and other wise even if I was alright with being bored, I still really enjoy trying new strains, especially lemony tasting buds{absolute favorites solely due to taste/smell) sounded great, first time doing coke I was absolutely disgusted with ""the drip"" (while if I did some yay today I would be disappointed without getting it) but the feeling of strong euphoria very shortly after had me hooked! getting coke with half the money that would normally go for weed all week 
And that might seem like a equal trade, but ide do all of it at once, only having one bowl of weed per day to get me by(not alot, nor enough for me personally) which I prioritized more than one nights worth of coke, so I stopped doing it.

DXM ""fake lean""
With the same group of people as cocaine, the one that offered that, also stole some kind of cough syrup which had dxm(dissociative I think, look up for facts) in it which also for some odd reason, enhanced the high of other drugs, including alcohol which can be very dangerous.

The cause of my memory problems:XANAX; 
During the time I was doing dxm, I also started doing xanax, which again you shouldn't do them individually, and especially should not together like I did, with weed and alcohol all at once like I was mixing, there was a very decent chance of one of us just passing out and getting seriously hurt (&gt;spontaneously passing out&lt; in comparison to dozing off due to being tired, but usually always ""xanning out"" this specifically being because (at least for me during my addiction to xanax) its near impossible to sleep without just a half due to withdrawal symptoms. A downer, prescribed for anxiety in small doses (.5-1) in the Benzodiazepine branch of drugs, which is scarily included in the drugs you can die from withdrawls in some cases! only additionally including alcohol &gt;if I'm correct&lt; (look it up for confirmation)

Take a break, as long as you have non impaired memory! Like you'll hear about how I do; In xanax continued, but first

PSA
I'm not promoting or advertising use of any drug of any kind, ESPECIALLY NOT XANAX 
I'm telling this so maybe people will think twice about doing drugs by my story, they can kill you even if you think you're invincible if you're not careful. In addition to warn, I'm asking for help or advice to stop in the long run, because If I dont get help i know I'll inevitably overdo it again because addition runs in the family, and I have a short attention span now. Meaning hobbys or activities that used to be fun for days and days on end are lucky to hold my attention for an hour, before needing some drug (2 grams of weed smoked in bowls all day, everyday and a pack of 20 cigarettes every day and a half on average AS OF RIGHT NOW) and if you're here looking to judge, judge away because to me, living 18 years old doing drugs may be looked down upon, but it's my personal coping mechanism to not have suicidal thoughts that may cause me to harm myself directly (not through being intoxicated {cutting}) or potentially end my life if it's an extremely bad wave of suicidal thoughts. which I dont recomend either of, drugs or self harm.

Self harm was forgotten, but I have still visible scars (healed now though) on my upper thigh from a blackout episode of drug induced sadness when I was all alone (only time it happened since people being present blocks out an opportunity to) so that's helpful if you find yourself uncontrollably harming yourself, stay around people as much as possible, even if your like me (an introvert that doesn't talk often, and/or get uncomfortable in social situations often) if I did it (cut) in front of someone which I wouldn't, I know they wouldn't want to see it (unless they maybe had different issues than you and did want to? No judgement anywhere, as long as you dont hurt anyone about it) but since there was nobody around me at the time, mainly because I was pushing people away during that period. Ide say im almost a year clean from cutting since that last bad episode, yes Im proud to have not done it anymore, but to be fair, I have sadly replaced that bad coping mechanism with another. 
Talk to someone for you, your family, or anyone, someone will miss you when you're gone. No matter what situation, if you're reading this you have wifi so even if it has to do with friends family meaning you cant go to them, or maybe Cant afford mental health charges for a therapist, etc.! Even just from a nice community on reddit of people you dont know, (like the one i'll try to find for this post will go on!) Or a trusted community, maybe the same one here if you see I got help or advice personal to me! You might just get the same :)


Xanax, continued
I absolutely fell in love with xanax after a time or 2, that was mixed with some dxm and alcohol those times, I knew the feeling of all the others. But I knew xanax's effects separately and i started doing them alone, stopping use of dxm all together, and not mixing xanax with alcohol (deadly. Out right do not do this, even if your experienced with both. even one beer on some if not all pills (xanax at least) can actually kill you, If not that, then do serious damage to you.
I developed a xanax habit quickly, and before long, I was up to 3 a day, and started taking them with hydroxyzene (prescribed for anxiety as well) and those were just to stay calm (anxiety levels were pretty high constantly, due to relationship troubles {I was In a thrupple}) but I added the xanax to those too because I wanted a very synergistic high to escape with
(Unmentioned in suicidal section, due to the drug use involved for bias thought reasons) While addicted to doing both of those (xanax and hydroxyzene) usually separately but wasnt rare for me to mix them
Setting: Out of my home state for my current girlfriend's, old friend's, birthday weekend
About a month before my 18th birthday 
My hydroxyzene tolerance was so high, I took 9 of them on the way there, and while I was there
Then I decided to take 2 white xanax bars (2mg each), while still on the hydroxyzene(callin em ""hydros"") because I was just plain reckless and expected alcohol but when there was none to mix with the hydros I became unhappy with just those so I chose the 2 xanax instead.
One hour passes, and someone brings a lone, single beer seemingly out of thin air. I made the near fatal decision of drinking that on the already dangerous &gt;11&lt; total pills, resulting in me literally passing out in a chair multiple times, WITH PIZZA üçï someone got a picture of me with pizza hanging out of my mouth not even trying to joke but actually concerned, to which at the time I found funny but it really mustve been difficult to see.
After my pizza privileges got taken away (haha) I just passed out in the chair and wouldn't wake back up, scaring the 10ish people not close to me out of the room because they thought i was dead.
I only woke up after being slapped with as much force as an old friend could give (it worked, but it was a very light girl)
That woke me half up but I was still in a daze so I get mad about the slap and them yelling. That's when I decided to storm out of the whole house (reminder, in a state I've never been before) and run around looking for a bridge I saw nearby earlier that day. The only reason I'm alive today is because there was someone chasing after me, my current girlfriend (were on a break at that specific time)
Tripped and broke her toe. You might be wondering how that stopped me, and I'm not completely sure either. But when she screamed in pain; I snapped out of the suicidal episode and went back to help her.

One week before my 18th birthday, I told my mom about my addiction because I was desperate for the kick for help I really needed; &gt;seeing her cry&lt;
I had a large amount of drugs that I did the day before my birthday, as a last bash because I checked myself into the hospital for addiction on my actual birthday, which I expected to be in for at least 2 weeks for actual help, but the day after checking in, they released me because they basically said that I was fine.
So use of xanax didnt stop until about 2 months later when I came to the realization that xanax was going to seriously hurt me/kill me if I didnt stop soon. After easing myself off to avoid withdrawal, I only had 2 more of them since then, get tempted every now and then, but I know they're very bad and addictive so I stray away from doing them. But even after over 6 months of not doing them, my memory is still impacted and unreliable.

The immune system destroyer: Acid;
After getting over my xanax addiction, I tried acid, a couple times before really tripping when I took 2 tabs which at the time felt beautiful, I was really giggly at literally anything and everything, but I still wasnt having visuals. That's when I tried 3 tabs and it blew my mind the difference one makes, visuals everywhere and happiness the whole time, except while having thought loops, which aren't harmless as far as I know, but I really dont like because they cause me anxiety, and distract me from enjoying my trip. The last 2 times I've done acid I was on coke, and molly respectively. 2nd to last, my reliable iguana got some new tabs which were a bit stronger than the last, And I forgot that I had taken cocaine just an hour before. The come up had me just dry-heaving because my stomach was empty for like 20 minutes (I felt death was very much possible it was so bad) due to the heart rate and blood pressure on cocaine, the acid hit VERY hard VERY fast and I wasnt ready. Last time, was an intentional candy flip(acid+molly) but I only took 2 tabs since I was new to it. One of the best trips I've had, but I did feel a bit overwhelmed at some points, all around good experience. A few months ago, after tripping a good 5-10 times before I heard of hppd and after a further look into it, I set out to give myself the condition. If you suffer from hppd and dont enjoy having it (some people do!) I'm sorry that I sought out and still wouldn't mind having what you wish you could reverse. But I tripped 1-2 times a week on 3 tabs each trip for about a month straight, and after trying for that long; I calmed down on it, and now I take 3 tabs ,only once in a while. Main reason I stopped doing it often, and an explanation to the title of this section is because while on LSD your immune system is very weak, meaning you can easily get sick during it. I experienced this every time I did 3, but not 2 tabs BUT it wasnt even a workable passable sickness. Every single trip, I would get pinkeye and it affected work alot(attendance there is still an issue and that's a big reason I'm looking for help) so I cant do that too often anymore.

I got bamboozled!:Meth (Once, accidentally);
Quick one, I bought 1/2g of molly from a shady iguana in a trap house, and after doing just one line, I experienced what I was told was meth(may be something else) but it burned my throat so it felt as if I was breathing like fire (compared it to being a dragon üòÇ) I wasnt exactly scared, more upset since I got ripped off than anything, but it was entirely my fault for not knowing the iguana, and for not testing it beforehand (I recomend doing this, Especially as of late. Reason being, dealers have been cutting/lacing their products more and more for their sales recently. I definitely was not rolling.

In between accidental meth and molly/MDMA, there was about a month or 2 period where I would get over a gram and a half of coke per week, often doing it all before the week was over. This of course resulted in withdrawal for the second half of the week which wasn't ideal for while at work. Also made me mad AT ALL TIMES that I wasn't on it

Current problem: molly/MDMA
After the fake ""molly"" just described, I was reluctant to try to buy more, but about 2 months ago, my reliable iguana got some that they said was from Europe (apparently a LOT more pure than american street M) and they say they test everything they have. (Dont just expect random iguanas to be completely honest, they sell to make money!) But I trust this one, so I did about 250mg for my first time and similar to xanax, I fell in love instantly. Recently, I've been taking 350-750mg every roll, once or twice a week, even right now, I just finished 750mg during an all nighter in which I spent completely by writing this since I open up while on it. I'm aware that's a lot especially for someone 140-160lbs, but I can handle my stuff if dont do it all at once(never been inclined, or wanted to anyways due to the taste)

Lasting effects and their suspected causes;

Memory- Definently from xanax. Slowly healing itself

Speaking- combination of cycling cocaine, acid, alcohol and molly for days on end (explanation; in school or anywhere really, I didnt like talking, but I was good at formulating sentences and speaking them) but one, or all of the substances have given me problems like studdering, needing to repeat a sentence once or twice completely, slurring my words and difficulty recalling words or even saying one sentence without pausing through it.

If you have read completely, all the way until now I'm assuming this must have taken at least 45 minutes to read, maybe more cause I ramble a lot while rolling/dont always make sense. For being interested in me/ in helping/ or just to know you're not alone I really appreciate your time :) Be safe and have a great day!",19Aug2019,2
84,"Recently fell off the wagon with drinking and smoking. 
It just hurts a lot. Like so much effort was wasted. Was sober nigh on a month and haven't smoked in a year. Can't beat my brain out of craving now. 
Alcoholism was killing me fast and cigarettes slowly but going out with friends recently pushed me over. And after 3 drinks I can't resist a cigarette. Now I'm back to drinking a half jack every night and smoking 5-6 cigarettes. Every morning I wake up pissed off with myself and it hangs over me all day. Its like a permanent splinter under my thumbnail.

85,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the way many people on social media use diagnostic terms in the way they tweet/meme/talk. I have Bipolar Disorder, medically diagnosed, and I‚Äôve noticed more and more people tweet and meme about serious symptoms of mental illness in a way that‚Äôs often meant to be humorous or an extreme way to describe a situation. Recently there was a tweet going around me which had a slow mo video of a man waving with this as the caption:

‚Äúwhen im out with my friends and nobodys paying attention to me so i decide to start dissociating just for fun and then enter a drug induced psychosis‚Äù

And I know it‚Äôs supposed to be fun but the way people toss around terms like dissociation and psychosis is incredibly disturbing to me. Dissociating isn‚Äôt fun, and it‚Äôs not a choice. Psychosis isn‚Äôt zoning out as it‚Äôs connotated here, it‚Äôs a terrifying medically diagnosable condition. 

Other examples include this meme format:
‚ÄúTherapy
- bad for x
- and y
- and z

Something random
- better because haha
- and fun! 
- and clearly not a substitute for therapy!‚Äù

OR bonus;
‚ÄúAlmost broke up with my therapist for her never seeing Ratatouille or something fun and random‚Äù 

&amp; some good ones I‚Äôve seen are varieties of 

‚ÄúTherapist: you have PTSD

Me: crude joke/get to get a dog i can take on planes/absurd reaction‚Äù

or 
‚ÄúTherapist: why do you think you have ptsd?

*Link of tweet of something I dislike*‚Äù


I‚Äôve even seen major corporations tweeting memes about ‚Äúhaha depressed until I get *food from brand*.‚Äù Happens now on boards outside shops. A thing I saw is coffee shops having signs like:

‚ÄúDepresso: the feeling when you run out of coffee. Get an espresso!‚Äù 

Again, feeling depressed is a valid emotion, and not the same as the medical diagnosis of depression. But the way these terms are thrown around I think has damaged the conversation of mental heath and mental illness, and skewed perception of those who suffer mental health issues. 

For instance, I‚Äôve encountered many people who think bipolar disorder is this beautiful tragic thing where yes, I suffer but so did Van Gogh and Sylvia Plath and Ernest Hemingway and they were brilliant and could do so much more than a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person because of this glitch of mania/hypomania. Being bipolar is not ‚Äúbeing so bipolar‚Äù as the phrase goes that describes someone who acts hot and then cold in behavior. It abstracts a serious, diagnosable disorder because for it to not be abstract is uncomfortable. Being bipolar has hurt my family, mania has hurt people I‚Äôve been in love with, psychosis has brought me near death. 

Mania, hypomania, a dissociative episode, and psychosis are all serious illnesses that have a strict diagnostic criteria. 

(An entirely different issue is social media conflating self care and taking care of mental health as doing things like face masks and bath bombs, but that‚Äôs for another day.) 


I understand many people struggling with mental health issues find comfort and comraderie in jokes and memes that validate that they are not alone, and I am grateful for that.  I do too sometimes and I see people find others who suffer the same way in comment sections, and that helps us not feel alone, which is good. Additionally, I know there are people who haven‚Äôt had access to healthcare or suffer stigma and can‚Äôt get a proper diagnosis, and this doesn‚Äôt apply to you: your suffering and coping mechanisms are VALID and so are you. 

But when masses of people make jokes about illnesses and symptoms they do not have a diagnosable experience of, or exaggerate terms to get a reaction, the words stop having meaning because people start thinking something like PTSD is what jokes made online make it out to be, and make the trauma survivors feel negligable.

I know that somethings wrong with me but I don't know what it is or what to do about it. I've always been low on motivation ever since middle school so nothings new here, but for the last 2 years it's been getting worse. I can't get out of bed in the morning, i start work at 9:30 and i can only manage to get myself out of bed by 9:10 on a good day. I always have great plans, i plan on going back to school (to finish my bachelor's in programming), i want to make games, i want to build things, but i can never push myself.

It's hurting my relationship immensely, my fiance feels as though she can't count on me. She's extremely understanding but everytime we start to talk about it i freeze up. I can't talk and i either start crying or get mad and scare her off the subject. I hate myself for it because I feel like I'm dragging her down with me, she's becomming less and less motivated and happy in her everyday life. Part of me really want to leave her because I feel like I'm holding her back, but the other part knows that the only reason I'm still here is because of her. She's the one pushing me to do great things, because of her I might have a job I actually like, it's because of her that I'm actually wanting to go back to school and it's thanks to her that I could get away from the trashy life i was living at my mother's house.

I want to go see a psychologist but I can't afford it. My job doesnt offer inssurance and my family doctor is a 3h drive from where I live and as stated above unless someone forces me to do something I'm not gonna do it.

Hello, I haven‚Äôt been on this subreddit before, but I hope this is one is appropriate for the content that I‚Äôm about to write.

96,"I used to always think that I was a stupid person who always somehow was able to pass courses by putting not so much effort into anything.

When i was taking exam, going to an interview, i always knew that everyone is smarter than me and I will be exposed as a fraud at one point. I am not street smart at all. I dont get things fast, i almost always make stupid mistakes and dont get stuff that other people get. But i do think that I might , might be book smart.

Immediately after I finished my Masters degree in Finance, i left to backpack through Asia for 6 months. I came back to Europe and decided that I dont want to work in Finance anymore. I did not know why. I just did not want to. So I got a job in a restaurant and in a club. in 2 weeks I will start studying Applied Mathematics at Bachelors level and I am really scared for my mental health.

Been a while since I've posted here...
Not that it matters ...

Everything today seems so chaotic and unreasonably complex... to the point where it unnatural. I've been suffering from a variety of mental illnesses of which I'm still treating or working on - the sort which make it difficult for me to discern between what's real and what's in my head.
I dont trust people anymore, I'm always immediately jumping on the defensive assuming some mal- intent. 
I still have a tremendous disliking towards people who are just happy, living there lives without a worry or a paranoid thought... perhaps it's out of sheer envy, I want that but for some reason i dont get to have it.

It's to the point where i cant even fully accept a good situation (should i be so lucky as to fall into one) as I'm just not willing to believe things are going well and let my guard down.
This prevents me frequently from forming meaningful connections with people. 
And it sure as hell is gonna ensure I'm alone eternally if it persists. 

But I'm the back of my head, I have that fear that once I get better I'll realize the world really is that fucked up and everyone is just bullshitting there way through it.

Part of me wants to get a van and find a place to stay as far way from people as possible. But is there anywhere where that is even achievable within reason anymore?

Part of me knows I'm a human too, I'm probably more of a piece of shit then I realize, and that i might be better off just ending myself so that at the least I'll no longer be adding to the chaos.

The worldis so full of despair, hatred, lies, murderers, cheaters, and general chaos. 
I really want it to be in my own head, but I'm afraid it might not be.

I'm completley turned off by stuff like long term commitment like marriage or something. It scares me, not because I would have to commit, but I'd have to let my guard down long enough to be demolished.

I'm afraid I'm going to be alone for a very long time.

I dont know how to rid myself of this paranoia, psychosis, you name it...

I dont understand why I'm here. It all seems so pointless, I feel so purposeless 

I dont know how to turn it off.

Please help me folks. 
Admittedly we all have our own problems but if anyone has advice or a direction to head. Similar experiences. Anything.
Please give me a hand here
I need out of this before I'm too far to turn back...",19Aug2019,11

OK so some information first, I have depression, anxiety, psychosis, and potentially ptsd. On South that conveyed I'll go on to explain that due to the fact that I can usually just put on an ""I'm fine"" face I tend to be the one who has to go out to run any errands that can't get covered by home delivery, despite the fact that I'm far from fine.

OK enough with the backstory fluff:
  Today I went to try and pick up my mess for my mental issues and other problems, which is usually not too bad, but today when I got there an elderly lady starts moaning loudly complaining that I've had enough of the pharmacists time so they should hurry up and serve them. 
  Despite my attempts to keep myself from falling apart completely I still wound up having a bit of an episode and am now petrified to go back to get the rest of my medications tomorrow since my doctors are inept. 
  Hell it's made me just want to stay in the relative safety of my home until someone gets tired of it and pops me off to a psych ward. Need advice on coping techniques or anything so I can keep trying to not just be stuck staring at the same foot walls.

100,"**Tl;dr: Therapy didn't work because I was misdiagnosed, and my diagnosis meant I wasn't taken seriously when I tried to object or present relevant symptoms.  Therapy was trying to fix the wrong problem and I was labelled resistant rather than the approach being reconsidered.**

Looking back at a 10 year adventure.  It turns out I have ADHD and some sort of trauma related issue (this one's hard because the current DSM is very limited in what counts).  What I was treated for, mostly, was some variant of unfounded anxiety issues.

What ended up happening was my anxiety diagnosis ended up blocking my own reports of my problems.  When I started to understand abuse and talk about it, it was seen as my anxiety causing me to worry about a good relationship.  When I reported that no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't achieve focus, it was my anxiety causing the problem.  When I raised concerns about the treatment, I was gently encouraged to push through my anxiety about therapy.

None of this helped because the treatment framework was all wrong.  I was reporting real and significant problems, but problems that could be addressed.  However, the treatment (CBT) was proceeding based on the idea that my distorted perception was primarily responsible for my distress.  This also meant that various other symptoms, such as ADHD-related forgetting or losing homework, or trauma-related mental states in therapy, were interpreted as anxiety-based resistance rather than separate symptoms that I needed help with.

All this is to say - sometimes the experts are wrong.  If someone says therapy isn't working for them, it's not always just as simple as ""try another therapist"".  I don't have all the answers.  I did a lot of research on my own, but I understand that not everyone's able to do that.  But I would like to put it out there that one big reason therapy might not work is because therapists are missing a problem.

I did experience a lot of blame for therapy not working, people telling me I must be approaching therapy wrong or that I must not have been honest with my therapists.  I was honest as much as I knew; in retrospect some things were missed because I didn't have the right knowledge to bring them up or didn't know the right words to get them across.  I would ask people to refrain from blaming people who aren't benefiting from therapy and to refrain from dismissive approaches like just suggesting people keep trying or telling them that therapy is hard sometimes.  Even just the validation that therapy can genuinely cause harm and that there are flaws in the system can really help.

Again, I don't have a lot of answers.  I would suggest if people can, try to keep track of everything about their symptoms and consider doing research on their own.  I know self-diagnosis has its risks, but it's also something that people can take to professionals (that's what I did with ADHD).  I might also encourage people to push for thorough diagnostic testing, rather than just going off of a therapist's impressions, or at least to push to clarify how the therapist perceives your issues.  I think overall, having more people be aware of the limitations of the system will improve things with time.",19Aug2019,2
101,"Hi all.
So here's the down low. I'm 26 years old, I keep getting major bouts of anxiety about things I shouldn't. I get worried when people done talk or wave back to me who I went to school with, I get really worried about what people think and how people see me.

My biggest problem comes from alcohol. I'm not dependant but the anxiety is so much worse after I've been drinking. 
So my major thing is giving that up, but my family drinks alot and I'm living at home with them, as do my friends, and when I do drink I just can't stop myself from drinking more.

I have a good degree which I'm enjoying, I work and have placements. But when I'm on down time I just start to worry about what people think and what I've done/not done. It affects my sleep and pushes my heart rate through the roof.

I find the gym helps but when I work shifts I don't get much of a chance. I feel like I want to get away from my hometown and try somewhere new to live but I have to finish the degree first.

Apart from giving up alcohol can anybody give me some advice on a change of lifestyle or mindset that can help me out.

I just genuinely feel exhausted and I feel like there's been some great advice given on here. I work as a health professional and want to be at the best for my patients.

Most days are ok but some days are almost unbearable. Today is one of those days. I have a much awaited interview at a job in a brand new town (in a brand new state) and while I‚Äôm not anxious about the interview, I‚Äôm anxious about my looks. (Or maybe both, who knows?)

One of the things that has been the hardest on my anxiety is my smile. My teeth to be exact. Long story short, not being able to go to the dentist for years has not done good things and it‚Äôs made me extremely insecure. I‚Äôm sitting in my car right now waiting to go in, obsessively smiling in the rear view mirror inspecting my teeth and every time I do it makes me anxious. But NOT looking makes me anxious as well. It‚Äôs almost silly because it‚Äôs not like anyone is examining my teeth (unless you‚Äôre neurotic like me) and it‚Äôs only the bottom teeth that really have the issues. So a smile would hide most of it anyway. But my anxiety would have me believe that everyone on earth is focused directly on my smile at all times and that my interviewer is going to somehow judge heir decision based off of my jacked up teeth. 

And anxious rant over. Apologies for clogging the feed with my nonsense. But I wanted to get this off my chest so I can remain calm during my interview. Thank you üôè",19Aug2019,1
107,"I have a sister who is 5 years elder to me.

When she was in the 12th grade, my father got a stroke and this had a little bit of an effect on her studies, but not that much.

After this she dropped an year which was probably hard for her, and spent time in a hostel (dorm) while preparing to join college the next year.

During this period she got worms.

Later she had gall stones and had gotten a surgery done to remove her gall bladder.

Now 1 year after she finished school, she had a choice between MBBS in a slightly unsafe area and BDS in a very safe area, she wanted to choose MBBS but eventually chose BDS which is what everyone wanted, but she wasn't really *forced*.

Halfway through her second year, she stopped going to college and began getting super religious (we're Muslims).

After a few months, she dropped out, came home with me and my parents and is basically throwing away her life apart from being a huge bitch.

She sits in her room all day, she is mean to my mother, doesn't eat with anyone, sleeps as she wills and now she's began writing Islamic things and sticking them everywhere.

She's refusing to do anything unless everyone leaves with her, thus playing with my career.

It's gotten to the point where she's stuck paper on the bathroom mirrors because of something she read somewhere.

114,"I've (M21) been with my girlfriend for 8 months (F19). She had a very rough upbringing, with extremely conservative, religious parents. She never conformed to the religious expectations placed upon her and therefore received a lot of very serious physical and mental abuse, leading to bouts of depression, for which she has been medicated in the past. I knew this going into the relationship and I still wouldn't change her for the world. She is an international student at my university and we are 9 weeks into our 13 week summer break, meaning I haven't seen her in person in a long time. We have both been missing each other very much and planning stuff for when we are once again together. 

She has been having a particularly rough time these past few days and mentioned last night that she was feeling uneasy and anxious for no reason. This morning, she essentially split up with me completely out of the blue, citing reasons like 'I don't think I want to date anyone right now'. I was obviously shocked and distraught and I asked about her motives but I knew that if that is what she wanted then I should let her go, so I essentially wrapped it up by saying that one day I hope we can be friends. She then replied maybe two hours later saying that she wants to be with me. I recommended that she take some time to clear her thoughts but she was pretty adamant. So I essentially said that I am willing to try and fix this but that it will take some time for us to get back to normal. At this point, I said I would give her space for the next few days (we usually text 24/7) and made sure that she knows I am always here for her and that she can message me at any time to discuss anything. 

Obviously, given the circumstances with her conservative parents, I can't visit her. I am looking for guidance on how I can help this situation from afar. I don't want to force myself on her at the moment, but I also don't want it to seem like I don't care about her when obviously I care very very much about her.

1. I probably have a personality disorder but nothing has really been set in stone. When I was just 18, I got diagnosed with bi polar disorder, however my family have told me that it was the wrong diagnosis and I was just suffering from grief from my fathers suicide. I know I have displayed BPD/HPD tendencies however my current therapists isn't into labels.

2. I have been with my husband for 5 years. He is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He is a mental health profession.

3. A few years ago I used to have addictions and a reckless lifestyle. I also moved around a lot because of jobs and education.

So here's the thing, all I want to do is run away and leave my life behind.

It's hard to explain, but I feel like wild animal trapped in a cage with a overwhelming urge to hunt. I just want to leave and start again somewhere new but I cant because I'm in a relationship, have a mortgage and I am financial reliant on my husband. I hate where I'm living which is a small and poor suburban town just outside a larger city. I feel lost because I don't really have many friends and I'm very much an outsider as it's a different country.

With my husband, I love him but I don't feel like I am in love with him anymore. Hes my best friend but I don't feel like I have any romantic feelings for him anymore. But he is very emotionally clingy with me, constantly wanting me to cuddle him and constantly touches me which I hate. He says this is because of him being an only child and he craves tactile feelings. I find it hard to have a physical relationship and our sex life is pretty non existent. 

I'm going to talk my husband about it but I don't know what else to do to get rid of this feeling. In all previous relationships I have ended because of  similar feelings but now it's not that simple because we are married and I'm not sure if it's what I really want.

I feel awful because I'm fighting with this feeling, and nothing is helping. I've been so unhappy with how my life has turned out and been self medicating with things like food (so badly that I cant look in the mirror) but I can't think of anything else to do without hurting anyone.

121,"To give some background, my husband is my best friend. We started dating in High School and got married a little over a year ago. In February, he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression and it has been a major struggling point in our relationship.

When we were in high school, our youth pastor was fired from our church for unknown reasons. He obviously left and started his own church a few years later. Our entire youth group was a very tightly knit group and we were all angry that our pastor was gone. In turn, most of the youth group left to go where he went. We joined his church, it was just like being in our youth group. We felt like we were apart of something important, however it was intimidating. Our pastor had this weird ""aura"" about him that made you feel like you had to do what he said for fear of disappointing him. But you wanted to fit in and belong. You wanted to be on his good side, in his inner circle. He made me and my husband feel like he disapproved of our relationship. But we loved each other and we weren't going to let anyone tell us we couldn't be together. 

2 years ago, J's anxiety started to really bother him. He did a good job of keeping it to himself which is really unfortunate. He knew he had anxiety for sure, and it was at the point he couldn't control it. He had old friends that didn't go to our church or occasionally would, but they weren't involved. One of those guys had his own set of issues and would want to stay up all hours of the night with my husband and would offer him Adderall and alcohol to stay up with him (We were about 18-19 at the time). It got to the point where J stared to feel like he needed the Adderall to function and started to ask for it. At some point during this, this friend had a ""come to Jesus"" moment and decided to twist what he did to make my husband seem like he pressured his friend into giving him his medicine and buying alcohol (he did this with more than just my husband, he did it with another close friend of ours as well whose parents ended up kicking him out for it.) He went and told the pastor of our church, who my husband was really close with at the time. 

Our pastor went to J's house, told his parents, reprimanded him, and stopped talking to him altogether after this incident. J would call and text him asking for forgiveness, to get together, to talk about it. Nothing. Everyone in that church stopped talking to us. No one reached out, no one asked how we were or where we went when we stopped going. When they saw us in public, those people told us that they wanted to get together and talk about what happened. Our pastor had told others there about what J did and in effect they exiled us from their group. 

J lost every single friend he had except for two people and myself. I lost the majority of my friends as well. It was a very hard time for J. I think he has PTSD from the whole situation. It was a major turning point in his life. He won't talk about what happened, he refuses to go to public places for fear of seeing these people, he has panic attacks and angry outbursts whenever anything is brought up relating to them. In fact, two of the people refused to be in a mutual friends wedding because they didn't want anything to do with J or I. They told our mutual friend that they didn't want to associate with someone who disobeyed God's word and proceeded to quote many bible verses as to how J is a horrible person.

Everyone says that the first year of marriage is really hard. I went into it knowing this, nevertheless nothing could have possibly prepared me for it. It was really rough. J had a psychotic episode where he was convinced worms were coming out of his skin. Our car broke and I had to get a second job to make ends meet. I've been working 60-70 hours a week since November of last year trying to keep the ship from sinking. He doesn't want to work, so I alone have worked the past 3 months other than him mowing for his parents and grandmother.

In February, he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression. I started going to mental health support groups and will be starting a class next month with NAMI on how to help your spouse with their mental disorders. He is unwilling at this point to take medication or see a therapist for this. Does anyone have advice?",19Aug2019,2
122,"I grew up in a physically and mentally abusive home situation where doing homework and asking for help, especially about math, was asking for trouble.

When my struggling started to reflect in my math grades, I remember being forced to sit at the dining room table after school every day and write out algebra problems 100 times each while my step-dad would scream at me for being too slow or making errors or even hit me.

I ended up chosing a major in college that didn't require high level math classes because whenever I would try to do a new math class the anxiety would be crippling and I'd end up dropping the course or failing it. Of the last six math courses I've taken, I only completed and passed one.

Now that I have a career, there's occasionally times where I need to do math and it causes me so much anxiety that I either have someone else do it or I get really anxious because I'm completely unsure of how to solve the problem at hand. And you know what? I'm sick of that!!

Math is a malleable skill. If I practice it, I can get better. I don't want to feel anxious about doing it anymore and I don't want the prospect of having to do math to deter me from pursuing the things that I want to accomplish in life.

The mental illness is part of the eyes (analogously), at least for me, so noticing my illness is very hard, because I can't really look at my own eyes, I can only imagine the eyes.  

Trying to perceive and notice my mental illness, is very difficult, because my mental illness is the state of my being it's self. I need look no further than my looking itself. The eyes are what the mental illness is, and I'm trying to use the eyes to notice it.",19Aug2019,1

To be honest with you guys I'm really searching for a solution, I'm 26 years old my field of work is biomedical engineering, I'm an engineer. My life is good. 

But, I'm not.

And to be honest I've had this since I was a kid but I used to see who I'm talking to and just stop it immediately. But now I can't I just wake up very tired and feeling really overheated like I'm burning and dizziness. 

I just want it to stop it really kills my day I become a bad and moody person. Otherwise I'm really humble and nice with people.

127,"My friend is dealing with depression and anxiety, and recently she has been getting worse. She started to smoke less than a week ago, and without smoking she is really irritable and impulsive. She tried to kill herself with pills but survived, and she self harms a lot. She also has really strong suicidal thoughts. I live far away from her and have no idea how I can help her, usually when she is being reckless I tell her mom since she is in the house with her, and her mom tells her doctor/therapist. My friend told me that if I told her mom again she would end up in programs, and that she would rather kill herself right now than have to do the programs. I told her if she didn't wanna be in the programs she would just have to try and get better and stop doing these things, but she told me she doesn't want to stop and can't stop.

I'm really worried about her, and I feel like the programs could help her, but I feel like if she is just at the programs really unwilling to get better, they won't help either. And I am afraid she will just lie at the programs like she does to her therapist and get out of them so she can go back to her old ways. How can I help her best??

128,"Hello everyone. My 4 year old daughter started acting weird today after she woke up from her noon sleep. We have gone to doctor and they run blood tests; everything seems fine and she has no fever. They wanted to run a tomography test too, but since she had no trauma from her head or anything remotely linked to that kind of damage, we have decided to have that test tomorrow if the situation will still continue.

It seems like she is still in a half dream state, you know when sometimes you wake up, you have trouble adjusting to the reality for a couple of seconds or even minutes; she is in this state for since 6 hours. She almost acts like she is on a mild psychedelic trip, but in a good one if that makes sense. Her attention span is much lower than usual and sees kittens here and there. Her appetite is ok and has no physical symptoms whatsoever.

131,"It's really fucking me up mentally, even more than I generally was. 

I keep realizing that if I commit to A, then B is off the table, and if I commit to B then A is off the table. 

\---

My three main options, are music, science (physics 1st, chemistry 2nd, biology 3rd), or philosophy/psychology. 

I feel that:

If I follow music, I will be able to be creative, story telling, expressive, understood, will be good at it, and enjoy it, but I will feel a huge sense of uselessness, loneliness, emptiness and pain from not understanding the world, and underachievement, and will have to be very hard working (possibly too much) in order to sustain it financially.

If I follow science, I will be able to understand the physical world well, feel smart, powerful and well achieved, will feel a huge sense of innate human achievement, usefulness, satisfaction and helpfulness, but will feel uncreative, might not be great at it, and unable to properly express my self. 

If I follow philosophy, I will be able to understand the hypothetical and metaphysical world, feel smart, well achieved, will be able to understand myself and others, but, will feel a huge sense of nihilism, will financially struggle, will get bored (too much thinking can really tire you out or make you depressed), will be unable to express myself fully, and will be stressed because I do not understand the physical world.

\---

I almost feel an ideal situation would be doing all three, but that's unlikely to be possible:

I really have a passion for music, but am generally pained at the fact that this route taken, I would not understand the world (I like science and philosophy because I can meet my minds strong thirst for knowledge of the world).

I really have a want for understanding the world, but am very pained at the fact I wouldn't be able to express myself in the way that I really want to. 

\---

It really feels trapping. Either option has just as many nightmares. But I'm partially afraid that maybe one has more than the other and I just don't realize it or understand it yet.

I'm currently following music, and that's what I've spent the last almost 2 years doing, but I am starting to get stressed because of the feeling of ''THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND DUDE, YOU CAN'T START YOUR EDUCATION TOO LATE''.

I've recently been very very stressed about not having enough knowledge, I was watching a science video, and I literally broke down crying for 10 minutes heavily, because I was just realizing how much I want to understand this stuff, but currently how much I absolutely do not.

133,"Men have launched unknowingly ourselves into the wilderness. 

I think that there is less and less of  a purpose / need for the discernment of what another human being can actually achieve/ do in industrialized modern day times. 

I mean purely in survival, utilitarian terms. Which is putting men especially in a place they‚Äôve never been. Our modernity is putting into question hierarchal thinking that has been axiomatic to men. I think now more than ever before men can just ‚Äî&gt;‚Äòbe‚Äô.  

And this new masculine mode of ‚Äòforced  being‚Äô is pretty uncomfortable . I‚Äôm not sure if men have had much of an example in the past generations before them to be comfortable just being - comfortable. 

For example: even in the 1970‚Äôs economic stability rested on American workers ability to go out and manufacture,  build, and spend copious amounts of physical, and intellectual energy.   Strength , power, and hard work was still the rules of the masculine game. 

In the 1950‚Äôs  even more so because the ability to eat was more closely related to ‚Äúgoing out in the mean dangerous world, taking something and bringing it back home to eat it‚Äù.  Occea, min wage, standardized safety and working standards were not the norm.  A woman truck driver could not have easily happen simply because of bias and inflexibility to social progress. 

In the 1920‚Äôs and prior we weren‚Äôt even able to die with out the safety and provision of our family members household who‚Äôs  survival also relied heavily on overworked, enslaved men who were even more valued for their upper body strength and insane desire to risk life and limb for their .80 cents a day. No Social security waiting for them either. They just died - one foot in the grave and one at work. 

While women had their own horrors to contend with men were historically enslaved and literal canon fodder for Kings and presidents blood filled conquests. Many many untold millions of men were forced to die in  wars that were often not even of benefit to them  as to if their side even won.  Men‚Äôs value was in his spine, muscles and ability to DO. 

Now , ( arguably) families don‚Äôt have a need for the dangerous, slave like arduous functions that men were forced  to  ( and women were forced out of)  Even our modern military‚Äôs focus more on machine and technology than the human. Smart bombs, drones, cruise missiles. 

Speaking as an American:


There is FICA, Social security, public education, TANIF, utility reconciliation services (electric/ gas services not allowed to shut your stuff off in winter)  homeless shelters, WIC, Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, disability income, fire department, police, usda, fdic, fda, national guard, volunteer federal military, fema, Red Cross..... ü§îthere‚Äôs probably ten more I haven‚Äôt mentioned that has also decreased the amount of suffering, pain and brutality experienced on a day to day basis by men just to survive.

I know there is still way more work to do in regards to dignity and quality of life , length of life into elderly ages 75, 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs. 

However; my main point is : MEN DONT NEED to DO anything for anyone else ever again to ensure that others survive. (At least not in a micro, nuclear family perspective ) 

Two problems occur with this quiet but epic revolution:

Now that men have time to be intimate with themselves the levity and introspective environment is driving us insane.  Our pursuit and instinct to DO  is  no where near as important as being able to .... well that‚Äôs question for the main stream modern day man really. What‚Äôs more important than doing? 

And identity and role confusion. Purpose of ones life and the choices that a man can make is so numerous that it‚Äôs actually depressing us. The grass is perpetually always greener on the other side of a land scape that seems to be moving in odd directions at staggering speeds. 

Now men can ‚ÄòBE‚Äô more than ever before.  We can laugh, dance, sing, muse, focus on sensuality, relate to others with more intimacy, explore spirituality, be creative for the sake of just being creative.  It‚Äôs like acid to our pre industrialized lizard brains. 

I wonder and I can only wonder if women‚Äôs blessing to the curse of being forced into domestic and ‚Äòsheltered‚Äô functionality prior to birth control was that they were allowed to just ‚ÄòBE‚Äô . ( with the exception of woman whos identity where not under the umbrella of patriarchal implied femininity)

About once or twice a day she will follow an exercise video (about 20minutes long) of low to medium intensity workouts.

142,"Title basically explains everything. Since January I had been assigned to a wonderful mental health therapist. I would see her once a week as needed and my last appointment I had with her was in early July.

In that last appointment she told me she would eventually be going on maternity leave around October or November. She said that that she and the health clinic I attend would make sure the transition to a new therapist would be smooth and that they would talk to me prior to the change. 

Fast forward to today. I called to book an appointment with her, but it turns out she had already started her leave. This is much earlier than I had anticipated and these appointments are really important for me. The lady on the phone told me I would have to go to the walk-in section of the clinic to be re-assessed by their head psychologist and then assigned a new therapist. 

What I'm worried about is all of the progress and work my former therapist and I were able to achieve together. I know my file and all of my notes and experiences will be passed down to my new therapist.. but it just feels like I'm starting all over again.

143,"I know its of no use to vent on here because nobody is a certified professional and there's only so much you can say... I get it I just want to get this off my chest. 

I've recently started having nightmares again... About what happened from before or even things I have tried hiding deep down. Most nights I'd wake up terrified other nights... I couldn't even close my eyes. I have tried so hard to get the help I need but it wasn't getting any easier when I lost those opportunities before I could even blink. 

I even used resources that were free and didn't require insurance. The thing is I don't believe in the system that failed me to help me through what I need help with now, I tried talking to my school therapist but it got to two points...

Point A) She said there was only so much she could do and that I require more serious assisstance so she called CAT on me and all we did in sessions was just talking ... No learning how to cope No offers of aid ... Just talking. I hated it mostly because it just reminded me all day of the things I tried getting rid by hiding from it... It made me feel worse. 

Point B) It did more harm then good ... After seeing her my nightmares became more frequent I began to see things and I felt more afraid of what was around me which caused my grades to slip. 

I am in a continuation school so a lot of people just assume I am trying to pull some bullshit and fake it to get out of soing school work ... or simply blame my anxiety attacks on simply trying to skip class early. Most of the adults I have met with growing up with always told me to get over it... To just suck it up and pull through... It hurt hearing those words. 

I was getting worse I am almost an adult, If no one gave to shits about me as a kid what help would I get as an adult. 

However more recently I have been having these moments... It makes me feel strange because it I remember the nightmares, where in some of them I saw myself die... I felt the grief I caused my family and it is something that split me in two ... It shattered my heart knowing I hurt my family. 

But recently all these moments have given me was just me dying all over again and what scares me is the sense of liberty I gain from it... To just let go and not have to feel it anymore, I don't need to be afraid of loud noises anymore, I don't need to worry when someone is walking behind me, where I don't feel my heartbeat speed up because I hear a siren. 

I've tried my best not to show it... It upset my family when I feel down. 

I just want to apologies to all the people I told that I would try my best but I am just to worn down from running against time... Trying to make something impossible possible. I am tired of looking for something that doesn't exist.

144,"Hi everyone. Apologies in advance for the length of this post.

Depression runs in my family on my dad‚Äôs side. I knew that when I stopped wanting to get out of bed, cried myself to sleep, started getting panic attacks, and felt angry/confused most of the day, it was time to get help. I was put on 40mg of Prozac per day and started talking to someone monthly. It worked well and my life was stable for the next few years as I was finishing college and starting grad school. 

To give you a full picture of my situation, I want to provide a few details. I work in the entertainment industry and my schedule is very inconsistent now that I am out of school. My insurance situation is also.. questionable. I am on government provided healthcare from my home-state of California, but I live and work most of the year in Massachusetts. I have not changed my residency to Massachusetts because I plan to go back to California in the next year or two. I can‚Äôt fill prescriptions or see a doctor here in MA unless I am getting emergency care. I fill my prescriptions in California and get them mailed to me by my mom. I started on 40mg like I said before, but before I was dropped from my parents‚Äô insurance and put on the one I have now, my doctor upped me to 60mg. I am waiting to get enough weeks of work under my belt to qualify for insurance from the union I belong to, but due to the inconsistency of work in my field, I‚Äôm not sure when that will happen.

All that being said, I planned a trip home to see my doctor because they abruptly denied a refill for my Prozac prescription. When I called to talk to someone, they informed me that my doctor left their practice and would be cutting off my medication until I saw another doctor. I used this visit as an opportunity to ask my new doctor about re-addressing my medication because my initial depression symptoms were back. In addition, I have absolutely no attention span anymore. 

The doctor told me that she couldn‚Äôt provide me any psychiatric help because of my work situation and location in MA. She wants to monitor me if I‚Äôm on new medication, but I was asking for a referral to see a psychiatric, which she would not provide. She also told me that ‚Äúbetter insurance will get better care‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing on the same prescription another year should be fine‚Äù. I was told I would have refills for a year and that was that. I left sobbing because I know I am sick and need help. 

My phone rang when I got to the car and a nurse asked me to come back inside. When I got inside, the doctor came back into the exam room to tell me that if I was going to hurt myself, she would need to ‚Äúlock‚Äù me up. I said I wasn‚Äôt and she sent in a counselor to give me a phone number to call asking for a referral to tele-counseling services that I could have in MA. I left humiliated but optimistic that something good would come out of this.

I got a letter the other day saying my depression isn‚Äôt severe enough to qualify for the tele-counseling.

Does anyone have advice for me in terms of coping with my situation and waiting it out until I have better options? Do I have free options here in Massachusetts (Boston)? I can‚Äôt afford to pay for private help at this time.

Hi guys,

I‚Äôm a 25 years old guy and I‚Äôd like yo share with you a situation that you might also feel related with. For the last 5-6 months, I‚Äôve been experiencing a state of very low, almost none motivation to do anything. Something that I used to be more curious or excited about, it‚Äôs not anymore. It is not a depression state in which I don‚Äôt want to live anymore but rather a feeling in which I ‚Äòfeel‚Äô that I have lived everything and nothing surprises me anymore, everything becomes typical and usual and I see things through the glasses of mediocrity. I get impressed by very few things and this is something that may affect my attitude towards others. Its like the extreme side of the maturity process or entering into a universe of indifference. Also, problems dont seem to be as much as they used to be. I.e. ‚Äúif I get fired I dont a give a shit‚Äù. Same with relationships and friends.

Is this a religiously grounded idea like the concept of unalienable / natural rights? 

I guess the idea that humans are entitled to anything doesn't seem consistent with the natural world as I understand it.

I used to be so scared of her dying and I just don‚Äôt feel anything it could be because she seems to dislike me and will criticise me every chance she gets but I don‚Äôt know. I just can‚Äôt be bothered with this life I get so many intrusive thoughts where I just want to punch people or things I have such a short temper like my door is rattling from the wind right now and I just need some relief I‚Äôm going to snap. How do people live life and are happy with it like how it just doesn‚Äôt make sense why am I the unhappy one I just want to fucking die end this pathetic life I live in so embarrassing to be around and I just can‚Äôt anymore I know people actually care about me and that I‚Äôll be missed but I just don‚Äôt care I don‚Äôt care how selfish that may sound but which is more selfish making someone suffer just for your own feelings or to let them go out the way they want to. Why do you think I ride a bike I fucking want to die doing what I love what brings me joy even if it is minuscule I forget about everything and can be at peace. See how quickly I go from I don‚Äôt feel anything to just I want to die,19Aug2019,3
153,Where do we go from here? How did we get here? Why doesn‚Äôt it feel like I should be worried? Why do I feel like that? What am I running from? Why can‚Äôt I enjoy? Why am I overthinking?,19Aug2019,1
154,"I grew up with an amazing family and I have had nothing but good experiences in my life. My dad did end up passing away from cancer when I was a kid, but my mom was strong enough to pull us out of any issues that came up. I was also a smart and quiet kid in high school.

I started college about a few years ago and I suddenly began feeling like life is just worthless. I got by in my classes fairly well, but I was living life passively. I did not care about my classes and didn't really want to work hard either, so I took super easy classes. I still have no idea why I started feeling this way. 

Anyway, to keep a long story brief, the feeling got worse as time went on. I started losing focus on everything. In high school I used to enjoy challenges, but at this point I don't enjoy doing anything. I used to love working out and now I can't even bring myself to go to the gym for some reason. 

I have done everything I possibly can to make myself better again. I've tried meditating, working out, making friends, and even picked up boxing hoping it would help. I don't feel sad or anything but I just feel like everything in the world is worthless. School is worthless. Life is worthless. At this point I don't know what to do. Nothing I do makes me feel better anymore. Anyone have this issue before? What did you guys do to help yourselves?",19Aug2019,4
