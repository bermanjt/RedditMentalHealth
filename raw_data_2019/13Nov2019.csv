0,"2 years ago I decided that I finally wanted to get mental health help. I've been on medications since 2013 but have never sought to speak to anyone about my issues. I saw a counselor in January 2018. And the 4th session she put (or police I dunno how it works) a 5150 on me and called the police. It was because I told her that I fantasize about killing certain people sometimes. And in the past when some things were happening I almost [trigger warning] let's say went postal. When the cops got there they stormed into the counselor's office where I was and one had his gun and said, what's this about you wanting to kill someone!? I'm like gee I was just opening up. 
The beginning of this October I started going through a manic episode.  I had just came off a 2 month depressive episode in September. I was running my mouth a lot because of my racing thoughts to the counselor. And he grew concerned and wanted me to check In to the psych unit at veteran affairs. I said I would but I didnt. Becaise my last experience in January 2018 was terrible. I was put in a hallway for 12 hours with patients, doctors, nurses running back amd forth for *observation * it wasn't until I was like wtf! And I started flipping out that they out me in a room. There were no groups or anything. It was just a nurse checking in me twice a day for a couple mins while they tool vitals. AMD a doctors asking me questions for 5 mins since a day. Amd the weekend was nothing at all. I even ended up getting into a fight because this other patient came I to my room and attacked me.
The next time I see my current counselor I'm still bouncing off the walls amd telling him things. He did t put a hold in me but called a team that escorted me to the psych ward. Er first them got admitted.whem I got out I had a session and he said it was because what I was saying about slicing sim3ines butt cheeks off, painting them amd wearing like a joker mask.",13Nov2019,1
1,"I live with general anxiety disorder &amp; major depressive disorder &amp; I feel like these are the two big culprits when it comes to me making stupid mistakes and trusting the wrong people &amp; sabotaging good things for myself.

It’s like my brain does some chemical nonsense that MAKES me do stupid things. Today, for example, I burned my dinner. Don’t know why, don’t know how. It seemed like it was in the oven for 20 minutes and it was half an hour. I don’t know why my brain made me think it wasn’t that long. Stupid thing to think about but it’s a prime example. I’m constantly making stupid little mistakes and I can’t understand, in retrospect, why I do them. And it makes me feel useless, like someone normal wouldn’t do dumb throwaway things like that.

TL;DR: How do you stop your dumb brain from messing up the simplest of tasks that you really have no business messing up because you’re not an infant &amp; guilt tripping you for hours and hours, even days after?",13Nov2019,1
2,"I was diagnosed MDD last year, I was in such a bad place that I failed almost every class for two straight semesters. So I left school and everything I thought I knew behind , and spent the majority of 2019 doing simple things to rehabilitate my mind. It’s now November and my school dean is telling me that I can return next semester in January if I’m in a good mental space. I said I was, and I’m Definitely better than I was last year, just not 100%. The thing is, I have to take 4 classes and if I get anything below a C I will get academically dismissed for good. I feel like I need to go back to school and study but I’m scared shitless that I’m going to fail again. I still have problem with concentration. Should I go back?",13Nov2019,1
3,"Since depression has faded away it has just left me with other problems. Social anxiety, anhedonia, irritability and horrible anger. I am completely withdrawn at school and barely speak. Partly because of anxiety, partly because I just have no interest in talking to anyone. I’m still struggling to find anything I actually enjoy to do. I can’t feel happiness. The only thing I seem to care about are drugs. The smallest things can completely piss me off and ruin my day. When I get angry I feel an overwhelming desire to break something or hurt myself to feel relief. Not cutting just like punching or kicking something until my hand or foot hurts. Only then do I feel less angry. Just a little while ago I spilled water on some papers and I got so angry I had to tear a folder up and crush it to feel just a little bit better. I’m still pissed. My thoughts are still constantly negative. Anytime I see someone I manage to immediately think of something I don’t like about them. It makes me feel like a horrible person.

Fuck depression. It took my life from me and I’ll never get it back. Does anyone else feel this way. Can anyone else not get adjusted back to normal life after being depressed for so long. Fuck it’s hard.",13Nov2019,1
4,"It’s like a cloud that I can’t see through to the path ahead. As I further into my twenties, the cloud has been getting progressively thicker. I am told by friends and family that I am resilient, and strong because I keep fighting an uphill battle in life, but I started to wonder if all the obstacles I am fighting in life are only self produced. That I am self destructive enough that one day that cloud will become smoke, and I will soon suffocate from inhalation. 

Some background: medically, I am diagnosed with BPD and anxiety disorder. A fun cocktail I know. But who knows. 
I am now 20 years old, going on 21 and began official treatment first for depression when I was 14 due to a suicide attempt and hospitalization. My treatment would come to a abrupt stop after a year due to my fathers reluctance to accept that mental illness is actually real. He would exclaim, “it’s all in your head!” Which is hilarious because isn’t that the point? That I have something wrong in my head? 

I wasn’t always aware that there was something wrong with me. I was taken from my mother due to an abusive situation when I was 6 going on 7, relocated with my alcoholic father ordered by the state; in my childhood I witnessed alcoholism, violence, poverty, drugs, and homelessness. The verbal abuse (sometimes physical) and emotional neglect from my father and lack of stability molded me into a person I now understand to be a defensive, emotional, anxious, irresponsible, obsessive, disorganized, inclusive of many more qualities I am now understanding to be consuming my identity. I don’t know who I am, except for all of the things my father would tell me that I was: nasty, an asshole, disrespectful. And now all of my relationships such as coworkers, professors, friends, and romantic seem to fall apart in which I can only point to the one culprit, the one common denominator: me. 

With aging into adulthood, developed this self awareness that is transcending to a prediction of my inevitable demise. I’m starting to really consider giving up, because... well... what is the point? 

I now second guess every decision, word, or thought I produce: is it rational, is this true reality, or is my perception of myself and the world just misconstrued by my mental illness? Is it all my fault, like my father told me, or was I born in this world to have bad things constantly happen to me and given the disability of not being able to cope and overcome? 

How do I separate my illness from who I am? Maybe life creates the uphill, my father placed me on that hill, and my mental illness added all of the obstacles....",13Nov2019,1
5,"I'll explain my situation in the post, rather than the title since its fairly detailed.

I am effectively scared of the cold. Its winter here in the UK, and?d a cold one too. Everyday I go out, and the weather chills me quite literally to the bone. Im at the point of feeling lots of anxiety when I need to go near any kind of cold water, or outside into the chilly air.

I tried to start taking cold showers in order to negate this + the benefits you so often hear about as a way to manage the anxiety, however it has if anything made it worse.

Coming home after being cold also makes me extremely depressed, to the point of literally wanting to off myself.


A doctor won't help me, imo. Too much of a stupid question.

I've been very stressed with exams recently, too, if that has anything to do with it.

Sorry for this post being lack luster, im typing on my phone and my hands are very cold.",13Nov2019,1
6,"hey guys, how are y'all feeling? 

well, I don't know if someone will answer this, but I had to try it anyway. today I realized that I can't speak out loud among strangers or people that I don't have a really close relationship with. every time someone else asks me something I usually just nod, whisper or even mimic my answer. a lot of people already pointed out to me that I speak with a really low voice and I get really nervous answering other people (sometimes I even mess up with the words). any clues about what is my problem?",13Nov2019,1
7,"idk if this is the right sub at all but it’s like the only place i feel i can go right now and i’m freaking out and idk what to do.  also please for the love of god do not say some shit like “wow way to brag” after reading all of this because honestly it’s really fucking difficult for me to even put this out there, and if people just think i’m doing this for attention i’ll end up just deleting to post and not getting any help. 

okay so full story: 

i’m a male in my very early 20s. i do have mild social anxiety and i’m prescribed meds for it (Paxil, 25mg) but i haven’t taken them in a while so they don’t really have any impact on this story. Anyways, two nights ago was a big night of firsts for me (namely: first kiss and first time having sex). i was with a woman i find incredibly attractive, both physically and her personality. however, when things got going and we started to kiss, i noticed that i didn’t feel anything emotionally. nothing. no magical sparks that people talk about, not even a slight little tingle of joy. i pushed passed it because i thought that maybe i was just overhyping it since i waited so long before actually kissing someone. fast forward to us doing it, and i suddenly cannot get a fucking erection. this has literally never been a problem for me when i’m alone, so i played it off as i was nervous but honestly i didn’t feel anything. no nerves, no anxiety, but also no connection with her. i rarely watch porn when i masturbate, because i’ve heard that it can lead to things like this happening, so that’s not the issue. i ended up getting one eventually, and went about the deed. however, i still never felt anything emotionally. 

now, here is where things fucking terrify me. so, i had a date planned with another girl for last night. it had been in the works for a while, so i thought it would be unfair of me to cancel it because of the events of the night prior and everyone seemed fine so on the date i went. apparently it went well because we also ended up hooking up. however, this time i swear i felt even less emotionally. I had the same erection issue, but due to time constraints i didn’t have time to wait for “eventually”. all of the other problems continued to persist as well. no sparks during any part even tho i am incredibly attracted to all of her, no anxiety, just a whole lot of nothing. i had hoped that maybe just maybe all of those issues i had the first time were just a one time thing, but nope this confirms that it’s an actual issue i have. 

this isn’t just a issue i’ve noticed in my love life either. on friday my mom informed me that one of my great uncles passed away. i was really close to him as a kid, i stayed over at his house with him and my cousins at least weekly for years. and after reading her text, all i thought was “aww that sucks” and then i just moved on. no tears or real sadness, just what i can only assume was pure apathy. i had the same reaction when my grandfathers both passed away about 4 years ago, and when my great grandfather passed away about 7 years ago. all of whom i was fairly close with, i even lived with both of my grandpas for about 2/3 years each. 

all of this leads me to one conclusion about myself and it fucking SCARES me. i have been essentially laying in bed all day have intermittent fits of overwhelming fear where i just cry my eyes out because i don’t know if i’ll ever actually be able to actually love someone. for a minute i thought i might be a sociopath or something, but like i do experience genuine empathy (i can’t think of a really good example, but like i cry all the time at sad moments in movies and tv). i’m also never mean or anything, most of my friends say i’m the nicest person they know. idk, i just don’t know what’s wrong with me and mental health resources around my area are limited to say the least, so any help would be appreciated.",13Nov2019,1
8,"Hello, reader/inputer!

First off, this is my first reddit post. I have isolated myself entirely recently and well, I need the help of my fellow humans. 

My story: I am the youngest and only son of a family of 4, My parents raised me by letting me do what I want. I would play video games until i am bored, hold back on homework and finished it last minute. My parents would recommend me to do things but it was never truly enforced. I loved it, until i started struggling; thats when I craved guidance and discipline. This started to happen when my parents decided to move to a different city when i was 11, but my dad moved out to the new city to secure his job first, he spent about a year doing that. Before that I moved to a new catholic school that i had just found my place. Seriously, everyone in my class loved me. Anyways I moved to this public school in a new city and i was really struggling to make friends, cliques were a thing now, bullies, etc. I eventually found a place. Life was okay, I started getting into pot, still playing video games but atleast i had a friend group. My Dad lost his job after and it started creating tension. My Mother and him are having a serious talk and I eavesdrop and even catch a glimpse at something that was burned into my brain. Mom: ""I want a divorce"" my dad fakes a smile and he says he understands. They still love each other. My Mom decides to move out because she had never dated another man other than my Dad. She didnt know if she actually loved him was her reasoning. My sister and I understood. So at this point I'm like 13 drowning myself with whatever pleasure I can. Parents don't notice. Parents get back together when I'm 15, we go on a vacation as a family where I was complete sociopath. Sabotaging any moment i could, i dont know why. I say something that angers my dad, he runs towards me with his hands out like he is going to choke me. grabs my neck, pins me to a wall and says: ""RESPECT ME!!! RESPECT ME!!!"". Luckily my Uncle runs over and splits us apart. I will also never forget this. Anyways we come back. life as usual. my pot smoking worsens to nearly everyday multiple times a day. My dad moves BACK to city we originally left from to work. no father for another 2 years other than a phone call once and blue moon. I'm 18 he comes back, im inclined to spend time with him but he wants to do things only he enjoys. no middle ground. I end up spending the next 4 years barely doing anything with my family. I live with them but nothing. Im 22 today and I'm struggling with discipline and depression and loneliness. I dont feel any love. I've been missing work and playing video games and ordering uber eats, burning through all the hard earned money I made over the years. few more weeks left and I have nothing. I cant afford to miss my 1 meal a day im already too skinny. I've always been the cheerful happy guy that really cares about people and wants to make them happy. Now im sad all the time, and I have no friends left. I could have done some really great things for this world. I also was in an abusive relationship at 17 for 3 years. I feel like i am experiencing what Robin Williams felt and that I am doomed.",13Nov2019,1
9,"I started my first year of college in September. I have been struggling emotionally and am finding it extremely difficult to focus on my work. I like my roommate, but I haven't really made any friends other than her, and even with her I don't feel very close because we are both always really busy. We're also very different people, which makes it hard to connect. My mental health has gotten so bad that I cry all the time and can barely manage to get out of bed. I feel empty and apathetic and the only thing that makes me feel emotion is thinking about my parents back at home. I feel a sense of guilt and shame because I'm supposed to be an ""adult"" now, and moreover i am about an hour away from home so it's not as bad as other people have it. I still just hate LIVING anywhere else other than my home and miss the evenings I spent with my parents in high school everyday and our general routine. I am a complete wreck and recently came down with an awful cold and fever which has worsened my homesickness. My mental health is the worst it has ever been. I am looking for a therapist.

My question is, should I consider moving back home to be a commuter student? A very small percentage of students at my school commute. I also am required to have housing my first year. My plan would be to move out but have housing here. My parents have already said this is okay but I really need to consider the options. For one, I would feel awful for just leaving her like that in our first year. I am struggling to find a solution to this problem and I am a general mess who can't make decisions because my mental health is so bad right now. I miss being happy.",13Nov2019,1
10,"I thought I’d post about this as I wanted to kind of vent and also see what everyone else who struggles with maybe all or some of the symptoms of the above.

Before I go into depth I currently take Concerta, Sertraline and self medicate with CBD and have no therapy but looking into it. Concerta is a controlled drug, basically legal speed.

I recently was asked by my girlfriend to attend a christening with her side of the family (whom I literally know none of) and as a result didn’t take any of my medication including my Concerta which puts the brakes on my mind and stops me before I end up saying or doing something most of the time. I knew after the church event that they’d be drinking and that I’d be the only person not drinking at the event. I didn’t want to let my girlfriend down either!

I’m fine during the church service, smiled at a few people and had a chat with my girlfriend and then went to her families after party. Drank three beers and then one of her uncles side chicks said something, can’t remember what specifically about my appearance. It triggered me off and my anxiety had the fight or flight reaction. I went for flight and ran out of the venue being chased by my girlfriend.

There’s a small petrol station next door, ran in and got a coffee and called my parents to get me quickly. Think they arrived within a few minutes and then anger struck when I realised what she had actually said. I called my girlfriend and went sick, basically saying it’s a war between me and her family (chatting balls because alcohol had the better of me) and began insulting her over the phone. Hung up and tried mentally to calm down.

Got home, get messages off her and then have a sudden urge to self harm. Instead of self harming I choose anger, throwing my phone across the room and subsequently breaking it.

Moments later, I’ve got the home phone and called 999 stating I’ve got my parents hostage and that I’ve got a bomb and they’ll blow if they come near and want a negotiation. Truthfully at this point I didn’t expect the police to react as they have attended before when I’ve self harmed in the past. 

Hang up, call back a few times and they ask to speak to my parents (who don’t even know or actually being held hostage) to which my parents play along, again - no idea why and I hang up. Next thing you know I’ve calmed down on the phone to the 999 operator and she’s understanding what’s happened and why I’ve been triggered off by everything. 

She suddenly cuts me off and says, I’ve got to go, good luck. Hangs up and then seconds later the negotiator asks me to bring a “hostage out” (there were literally no hostages) so I asked my mum to come with me and went outside.

Took me a few moments to realise that there’s a group of armed TAU (tactical aid units) standing against a neighbours wall and staring into my soul. It was at this point I knew this was beyond repair. There was physically no way they’d let this go and just be like, no worries. This was the real shit and they meant business.

My anxiety kicked in and I tried to run back in, seconds later bang I’m on the floor and being choked and handcuffed on my front garden, neighbours out and being ushered away out of the street. I was instantly searched, arrested and taken to the police station as quickly as possible. 

Massive reality hit that I had really not been able to stop myself and how serious the situation was. The nurse assessed me and deemed me okay. Didn’t get sectioned and explained everything. Thrown back into my cell and had no communication, no change of clothes (covered in mud from being tackled) and nobody knew where I was.

I constantly pressed the buzzer in the cell but when I asked for a phone call and lawyer I was told they had no authorisation until they had figured out what they wanted to do. Decided the best thing to do was to sleep. 

Next morning, same cell and nothing changed. I pressed the buzzer and asked for an update and was told as it stands I’m going to court the next morning and to keep quiet and wait for them to speak to me. 

I will never be able to describe the feeling I had at that moment, the feeling of oh shit this is actually happening and this is it. This is my whole life over. I cried and said to myself there’s nothing I can do, no point being upset and asked for a coffee. Coffee came with a book and read. Door slams open after I fall asleep again and the custody sergeant calls me out, sit up and I’m told they’re going to interview me soon and that they’re not taking me to court currently.

I had the interview, parents said the truth and explained I never held them hostage and that it was me asking for help (which it was, I called to try and protect myself)

My lawyer and responsible adult arrives and slowly but surely I begin to admit to the charges and explain my story. They understood and as it stands they’re releasing me under investigation. 

I have never been in such a situation in my life, a situation where I now actually appriciate my freedom and where I have the comforts of my girlfriend and home. The decisions I made that night were not the right way to deal with the situation at hand but at the time, I felt I needed help and the only way in my head at the time was to make things up so they’d actually listen and help. Being in the system for anxiety and depression means nothing, the NHS do nothing but ask you to wait for months in order for help. 

Thanks to the officers and the team at the custody I’ve now got help and I am working towards recovering and resolving my mental health. I’m sharing this story in order to open the eyes that although it seems people don’t understand or care, in reality the police could’ve charged me and they should have done (they still can) for what I’ve done. I have that shame to carry around but I’ve learnt a valuable lesson.

Ultimately there isn’t enough resource for the amount of help that’s needed right now in the UK and it needs to change. 

I hope by sharing my story I can open the eyes to how all my symptoms can result in such a dire situation that I couldn’t control. 

If anyone else has similar experiences, feel free to share and I’d love to get some positivity towards improvement and self care as well as tips on how you are helping deal with your anxiety, depression or ADHD.",13Nov2019,1
11,"Stumbled across an old video of my past

And in response I became very emotional and distraught. I can’t help but sit here, in misery, watching a time where I felt genuinely happy and dreaming to go back. It just keeps getting harder, waking up and trying to move on with my life. Everyone around me seems to have no problem, yet here I am stuck, obsessed, crying and wanting nothing more to go to a time where I didn’t feel broken. I’ve considered suicide, then maybe I could relive my past for eternity without the pain and sadness. 

So here I am, thinking maybe another post will help me release pent up emotions. It probably won’t, but who knows. 

It’s definitely better than spending all day in my bed, watching videos of my old hometown, being on Reddit just to look for posts that mention my hometown, driving around (rarely) my hometown, looking at google maps at my old apartment and so on.

12,"Hi, was wondering if anyone had any ideas abt this or could relate, but sometimes I'll go from liking someone (in a platonic sense) and they'll do something, and I'll suddenly be super disgusted with them (idk if disgusted is the right word, but I'll just want to distance myself from them and will want to unfriend them?), and then I'll be back to normal later. Idk what causes this and I know that it isn't normal, so I was thinking it might be connected with when I will suddenly get this intense feeling of love for others.

15,"So I don’t really know what my mental health history is in terms of concrete diagnoses, but GAD runs like fucking crazy in my mom’s side of the family, and lately i’ve been starting to think a lot of its (and potentially some other complications from other mental illnesses) signs are showing in me.  For the past three weeks or so, i’ve been having a lot of trouble falling asleep due to me falling into really emotionally upsetting/worrying thought loops that come out of nowhere. those thought loops quickly turn into a mix between a depressive episode and an anxiety attack, and once i’m in that place, i’m absolutely powerless and my mind starts working independently from my conscience. i’ve cried myself to sleep every night with the exception of one, for the past three weeks. a lot of it is me feeling like i’m just going through the motions of life, anxiety about my family’s future, and emotional stress about my on and off girlfriend of 2+ years. for the past few months, the two of us have both kind of just been doing our own things (she’s out of the country and i’m in the middle of an internship) and haven’t talked that much (dating or not, we’ve always been best friends) which has made this semester pretty hard for me. today, I got to talk to her for the longest we’ve spoken in a really long time, and it was really good on both sides. I really enjoyed getting to hear about what’s going on in her life and joking around with her like we always do. I got to talk to her about what’s going on in my life, good and bad, and I really fucking missed talking to her. out of nowhere after we got off facetime, I just felt so happy, the happiest i’ve felt in a loooooooong time. something as small as her reaching out to see how I was doing really quickly turned into me being happier than i’ve been in months, and i’m so glad I got to talk to her. A, if you ever come across this, you’re beyond wonderful, and i’m so excited to see you when you get back. 

All in all, today was one of the best days i’ve had in a really long time. I felt happy today, which has been a little more rare to come by lately, and i’m so far beyond grateful to have this feeling right now. If anybody out there is having a rough time and going through it right now, hang in there. patience is a bitch to control, but when you do, it’s more than worth it",13Nov2019,1

17,"Hi everyone, using a throwaway account here.
I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.
I’m 13 right now, and I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was around 7 years old (my mom has many physical disabilities that subsequently effected me at a young age). Recently, i’ve also been diagnosed with Derealization/Depersonalization Disorder (DP/DR). It pretty much makes my life feel like a dream and affects many depressed people as sort of a getaway from reality. I’ve been dealing with it for 3 years now, but i’m afraid to tell anyone. I hate people who brag about having mental illness and constantly bring it up in conversations, but that has resulted in me not mentioning it to anyone at all. And recently, I haven’t been able to muster up any courage to do.... anything. I’ve stayed home from school for the past 2 days pretending to be sick and i’ve been laying in bed crying all day. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I haven’t eaten anything but I just keep telling everyone who is worried about me that i’m “not feeling good” or that i’ll throw everything up that I eat. I can’t do anything right now. I have a ton of homework I need to do too but I can’t find the determination to do any of it. This is by far the worst i’ve ever been and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never self harmed and I never intent on doing it, i’ve had suicidal thoughts before but I have never acted on those thoughts, and I have a loving, accepting family that would 100% support me through this... but I can’t fucking tell them.
I wish I could fix myself, but for some reason I can’t tell anyone. I constantly tell my mom I don’t need a therapist or medication but I really do need them. And everyday I wake up feeling like nothing is real and for fucks’ sake i’m sick of it. I just wish I could be normal for once. I have so many things to be happy for but i’m just a sad fuck. I’m attractive, i’m fit, I have tons of friends, I have a girlfriend, and I excel at academics but i’m just so mentally fucked and I don’t know why.

20,"Dear Reddit,  
I'm making this post because I'm looking to receive advice on how to help a girl process something terrible.  
I'm personally responsible for giving her a traumatising experience.  
You could argue that I want to help her for selfish purposes - yet I want to make clear I am not looking for help myself.  
I will be talking to a psychologist myself to process this experience since I feel like it's a long reach to ask strangers to sympathise with such an awful deed.  
A little backstory about me to understand my issues and possible causes for this experience:  
I'm in my early 20's and have recently been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.  
I also have narcissistic traits, depression, anxiety, and a diagnose for substance abuse 'disorder'.  
Despite my narcissistic traits, I do not see myself as an unethical or abusive person.  
I do experience sympathy and have healthy, albeit somewhat controversial moral standards.  
I met her a few weeks ago. We are associates from the same study which I will not disclose for privacy purposes.  
We initially had casual sex the first time we met up. All was great, we started talking, and we hit it off on an emotional level as well. We both shared the same ideas about life.   
I would describe her character as not precisely stable yet a grounded rationale person. I noticed she was impulsive as well as I am, and looking for an edge. She had been struggling with PTSD from a past boyfriend that raped her.  Given this information, I proceeded cautiously since I tend to be dominant during sex and enjoy BDSM-roleplay.  On several occasions, I have asked her to tell me if she would not be into it regarding her past.  So far all is good; we had met up and had sex on three occasions to full consent.  
This third time that we're having sex, we are using the drug GHB ( ***gamma*****-Hydroxybutyric acid** ) which is a GABA-agonist. Comparable with the effects of alcohol,  but with an extreme delirious effect at high doses.   
Since the substance is extremely concentrated it is not out of the ordinary to take more than intended.  
It increases testosterone and on an overdose disinhibits quite a lot - yet I would never suspect it could go as far as this. 

So there's a discrepancy between my recollection and hers since I was much less present in the whole experience due to overdosing on GHB. What happened to me is that I woke up 2 hours after she left, mad confused not being aware I've probably been black-out for a good 2 hours. Extremely worried whether she had overdosed somewhere else in the apartment-building I went looking for her, only to later read my texts and find out the horror of her accusing me of raping her. I was in absolute shock, and honestly disbelief because I would never consciously take advantage of someone. Yet I obviously don't want to discredit her perspective, because she had a past rape experience and I have a mere recollection of events. 

So the next morning she comes over to talk, crying, and it broke my heart to little pieces that I felt so powerless -

When you'd usually give a hug, I obviously could not be close to her at that moment. 

She breaks down what happened: We first had perfectly fine sex and then went to watch a movie.

Until that point our perception and memory align. From there on apparently, something in my face changed and I screamed during sex which made her feel uncomfortable, so she told me to stop it.  
My response was according to her that I would comfort her, but then 5 seconds later tell her to be submissive and continue performing oral. She says she was not into it and that I just told her to 'shut-up'  which I can identify with cause I like aggressive roleplay. In my perception everything was roleplay - but I cannot speak for the moments of absolute black-out memory. 

I obviously have no intention of raping this girl because she was into me regardless!   
It's a very confusing situation since for me it feels like I either had trouble picking up the signals due to being deliriously intoxicated, or have I actually decided to have sex with her against her consent at that point, and completely forgotten about it? I highly doubt the latter, because I do not (want to believe?) that I would be able to do such a thing.

It makes it difficult that I cannot relate to the word 'rape' cause for me it wasn't, but I want to place myself in this girl and help her with the actions I'm responsible for. What in the world Reddit, can I do in this position to give her the least emotional luggage?  


PS. I'm not doing GHB again",13Nov2019,1
21,"To begin, My mom has been a wonderful funny and caring mother. She basically lets me and my brother get away with murder. She has been working for a grocery store for over 25 years of her life, and she hates it, she says she put herself in her current situation but even then, it doesn't justify the toxic people around her. My dad has been with her only because I was a one night stand mistake, and now he emotionally abuses her to the point where she thinks he owes him for paying the house bills. She never gets treated with love or affection whatsoever from my brother (he always seems to argue with her because he doesnt need to do anything because hes just going to kill himself too.) or my father, and she also lives with her twin sister; my aunt who always seems to bring in crazy people and argues with her nonstop about the stupidest things I've heard. Last time, I've heard her argue about me using the driveway and my mom said it was okay for me to use the driveway but my aunt is complaining saying, where shes going to put her two cars, which by the way she shouldn't be having two cars with a pizza delivery job income and no other responsibilities. She used to make income off of her roommates but she never got along with her roommates and just argued with them too. So she kicked them all out. One time she had a roommate that used to be homeless but his mother paid for his rent. He was a complete drunk until he corrected himself and moved out. She wants to bring him back because shes running low on income for bills. I'm getting off topic but the point is, I recently had gotten a boyfriend so I've been spending more time with him lately, I hadn't realized this would affect her so badly until she told me all of this. She said she wouldn't continue living anymore when her parents die because she would have no other purpose in life. I want to help her as much as I can because she's too important for me to lose and i want to help her out of her situation before I leave to a student exchange for 6 months across the world. I dont care if I have to miss going if it means I can stay here to help her mentally, I just want my mom to be happy, even though she always tries to make others happy. I live in Denver Colorado and I'd really like your help, please. (Btw I'm 19 F)

TL;DR: My mother is surrounded by toxic people and in a situation that she doesnt think she can get out of and wants to end her life.",13Nov2019,1
22,"Hi there, 

My cousin recently committed suicide in September and we were not close by any means but after that I started questioning my mental health and I believe it made me overthink and now I think of suicide more often. 

I work at a dealership as a salesman and it’s a high pressure environment, not only that I work maybe 50-70 hours a week. I was never depressed before I was motivated and ready for any challenges that came my way, energetic and outgoing. This week has been so hard for me I don’t know where my minds at, I got into a fight with a manager and got sent home. After that I got bad anxiety checked into the hospital and they sent me to a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but I don’t believe I’m depressed. He gave me zoloft (sertraline) 25mg and then I questioned if I should take it cause I was coming back to my normal self eating normally and sleeping fine. I decided maybe I should listen to him and just take it, I took it fell asleep around 9:30pm and woke up at 3am having the craziest anxiety/panic attack ended up going back to the hospital and they told me I just needed to lower my dose. I wasn’t sleeping good on it woke up super tense and decided that I shouldn’t take this because I believe I can gain control of my mental by myself. 

I’ve been off it for 2 days now and although I think I’m fine I’m eating normally and acting like myself, I keep thinking about suicide. My thoughts are super irrelevant I think about life not having a value, the way I describe it is that we are alive to die, there’s billions of people in the world and days are just getting longer, that things have no value to me anymore. But I’m pushing every day to get better. I don’t want to give up on myself and become a victim of suicide but I keep seeing signs of mental health is a big problem and more and more people are dying everyday, it’s just getting so fucking hard. I find enjoyment in a lot of things my concentration is all here, I don’t believe I’m depressed and I don’t think I should be taking the meds cause if I’m not crazy they’ll be driving me crazy, the side effects are too much to handle.

Am I the only person who thinks like this?",13Nov2019,1
23,"When things are good they’re great.  But when they’re not, I very easily get negative about everything, even though objectively I know I have no rational reason to feel that way.

25,"I will try to keep this as short a possible while trying to keep as much context as possible. I am trying to figure out if I need to see a psychologist, a psychiatrist or if I'm making something out of nothing. 

I work at a good job. I make good money. One year ago I lost my company, I was in a custody battle at the time as well. I didn’t win and I didn’t lose over all on the custody battle but I get my kids 50% of the time, pay the Bill’s and still pay child support. I feel like my wife is about to give up on me and I don’t blame her. I feel like a failure losing my business and I feel like a failure for trying t ok improve my kids lives and only ending up costing myself way more money and leaving everything else the same. During the last year or so of the business I gained a lot of weight and stopped sleeping very much  which destroyed my confidence even more so after losing the business and the custody battle. I’m beyond disgusted with myself physically, mentally, spiritually, philosophically, and where I am financially. To the point I cant bring myself to attempt sex with my wife because my brain panics during sex and makes it bad for her and stressful for me. (Not to mention the disgust with myself.) I feel broken almost daily, I turn looks and sentences into sagas that leave me alone and even more broken than I am. I don’t think I deserve success any longer, I don’t think I deserve my wife , my family or any friends. I thought it was just anxiety but I take meds for those and it helps at times to take the edge off but it kills almost all other emotions to the point all I have to look forward to emotionally is anger or vengefully dragging myself back down. To the point I wouldn’t blame her for leaving, I wouldn’t blame her for cheating  mentally I believe that it’s what I deserve most of the time. I don’t want to hurt myself, I’ve been down the cutting road but I have had the thought that everyone would be better off if something happened to me but I wouldn’t act on it. I know I should talk to my wife about this but I also feel like everything I do or feel isn’t worth her time or concern, not due to her actions but just feel that worrying about me isn’t anything she should have to worry about.

26,"I'm having a hard time after having 2 hip surgeries this year. It's been a few months since the last one, so if you saw me walking on the street I look normal but I'm technically still recovering and very sore. The procedures have left physical and emotional scars.

The reason I'm writing is because I'm struggling with being able to relate to people, especially my friends. I think I might be isolating myself and pushing people away. People either assume I'm OK or don't ask how I'm doing with everything. And if they do ask the conversation is quickly shut down by them saying how strong I am and that I'll be fine. To be fair I do put on a persona of being a strong person but this has crushed me, every aspect, and I'm not so strong. I'm a different person now. I also need to note that I'm 35, single and self-employed. The people in my life are all coupled or have families. Therefore, it's hard to relate...our lives are not at all similar.

I feel sorry for myself - is that healthy? If so how can I change that? Why do I feel that and is that normal?

I feel guilty for starting to isolate myself or make new/different connections and leave old friends behind. I feel I'm making a conscious decision to cut people out and it doesn't feel good. I've started not asking my friends how they are doing because to be honest, I can't hear about other people's lives right now.

If anyone has advice I would appreciate it, so much! Thank you.",13Nov2019,1

Tired of stressing about the future.

31,I’ve only seen my psychologist four times and they’re still trying to diagnose me. I understand that it takes time to diagnose someone but I’ve just been feeling a bit anxious on what I might have. One day it’s general anxiety and the next day they mention ocd. I use to take drugs in high school like pain killers and Molly’s but the thing that affected me was something called 25-I. I know it’s my fault for experimenting with drugs I shouldn’t have and now I’m dealing with the aftermath. Everyday feels like i am in some kind of dream and that I’m disconnected from my environment.Its been like this for years now and the dozens of medications I’ve been taking have not helped at all. My head rushes with negative thoughts and I’m just trying not to lose hope that maybe one day I can feel better. I’ve stopped doing any type of drugs and I don’t drink. My only vice is caffeine and I don’t even drink that much anymore. My psychologist is still trying to diagnose me and once they do they’re going to put me on the right meds. It’s frustrating not knowing what you have and how to treat it.,13Nov2019,1

I know they aren't real, but I can't stop creating a whole other world in my head. It goes on for hours and I zone out no matter where I am and when I snap out of it life doesn't feel real at all. It feels like reality isn't reality and everything is so dreary compared to what I imagine. I'm also starting to absorb myself in web comics and they suck me in for a good portion of the day. Nothing can distract me from immersing myself in a whole different world as often as I can and I feel as if it's getting in the way of daily things.

35,"It's been well over a year since we went our separate ways and I haven't stopped thinking about my ex since then. We only went out for three weeks because we met about three weeks before her graduation. When she graduated, I was deeply inconsolable. But! I hid it from her and kept up appearances as she soon moved on and began texting me about a new gf she'd met a couple weeks after graduation. It was easily the worst pain I'd felt in my young life. Even then, we texted almost every day until March-ish, through two failed relationships of mine. March-ish was about the same time my ex had found yet another gf. Around then, I also got into another doomed relationship - with a guy, this time.

Do you know how much femme-induced pain a lesbian has to be in to try it on with a guy? Lots. And lots and lots and lots and lots. Though it was really my fault for going into those relationships when I wasn't ready to move on. 

Now I'm stuck in the boring, lezzie-bereft South and I still can't help wondering what things might have been like if I'd gotten into a law school near her or into a school in any major metropolitan full of actual people, instead of chattel. However, I did run into a dairy cow that was sending out some solid butch vibes...I haven't seen her on Bumble, so I can't be totally sure what team she plays for. 

Anyway. Something my ex said about her newest, March gf still sticks with me: ""Is it weird that she's strikingly similar to you?"" As a person who's always had the subtle feeling that my life is a like a superfluous bump on the universe's backside, I was thoroughly rattled. My feelings had been confirmed: a self-actualized, superior version of me already exists, making my existence kinda pointless.

The problem: As insecure people of my generation tend to do, I've spent too much time doing the least healthy thing possible: cyberstalking the shit out of both of them. Turns out, New GF seems exactly like me, interest-wise and personality-wise. Even music-taste-wise! All she's missing is my height, my blackness, my light mustache, my grad school debt and my impeccable, erudite wit. However, New GF actually has friends. Like, ""sign my yearbook"" ""omg we've been part of the same squad since high school"" friends. Something I could never offer a future partner. 

The constant social media stalking and random Googling is biting into my time and messing with my dreams - my actual, unconsciously-produced, night time, beddy-bye snooze theater, y'all! This 1L semester has been non-stop fantasizing and crying and intrusive thinking to the point where I can't even begin to remember what the hell I'm supposed to be learning half the time.

I’ve been through therapy but I’ve always felt bad about how much it cost my mother since therapy is expensive.

I wish I didn’t exist and cost my loved ones money and worry them.

42,"For many years, since at least college, I've had this pattern. Reckless self-destructive behavior, followed by short periods of stability, and then back down the rabbit hole. I used to think I was bipolar but something about that diagnosis just doesn't feel right. Regardless of what it is, it's exhausting. 

When I was younger, I used to kind of enjoy it in a sick way. The drama of my mental health rollercoaster was kind of entertaining, even as it was painful. Now, I'm just really sick of it. 

I stay in this minor ebb and flow most of the time. The self-destructive periods don't get too out of hand and my external life stays intact, even if internally there's chaos. But every once in awhile, maybe every 1-3 years, it all really explodes and I am left picking up the pieces of something traumatic. This usually ends in a falling out with a close friend or a huge mental breakdown of some sort. Also, weirdly, I'm noticing that this often happens in November/December (but not always). No idea why. 

I've been in therapy for awhile. I feel like I am really trying, but I cant break out of this pattern. 

I can feel it coming on again. I've started using drugs or doing other self-destructive things. I'm angry at everyone. I'm anxious at everything. I'm panicking in my friendships and pushing people away. 

Here's the thing about it, though. I can very clearly see this pattern now. I don't want it. I don't want to be making the choices I'm making. I am putting every measure I possibly can in place to stop it - therapy and self care to the extreme. Yet, I still see myself spiraling. It's absolutely exhausting.

The very next day I dont talk to them. They take this as me hating them but truth is I just don't talk much. They just stop talking to me in total soon.  I feel as if I let them down. My teachers see I have no freinds, and me being kind to them and giving them  small gifts and being a decent human being, they try to ""help"" me.

In short, my biggest issue is that I can’t tune out sound. In a busy room my mind strings sounds from all around the room together. When I’m trying to listen to someone, I’ll pick up sounds from all over the room. They blur together and my mind has trouble picking things apart and I’m left with overwhelming gibberish.

I work in the middle of a busy warehouse store.

Lately the gibberish is making me involuntary visualize things.

Like if I asked you to visualize a banana, I bet you could. In your minds eye you could ‘see’ the yellow, you could see the shape, the details the texture maybe even the lighting on it and the sound it makes when you peal it.

All it would take is someone saying ‘imagine a banana’.

For me, that sort of visualization happens normally.

A child randomly raptor screeching in the store is like a bright white light. A low grumble from a man is like a red, jagged scribble. A backwards shopping cart wheel making that loud nails on a chalkboard sound is a metal spear flying through the air. The general chatter are all sorts of things depending on what people say or how much my brain picks out of the conversation. Sometimes I see spiders or faceless dolls if I’m feeling anxious. Sometimes it’s sun beams. The AC and coolers are like TV static.

It’s maddening. This used to happen in school, and I think it started back up because my job is so repetitive and there’s not enough for my mind to do while I’m working, so it busts out the crayons and colors some pictures and sticks them all over my mind fridge.

Ya, I know I sound batshit. I feel batshit. What is wrong with me? Is this a disorder?

It started up again pretty recently, so I haven’t had the chance to tell my therapist. I’ve tried googling this to no avail.

55,I can't comfortably maintain any relationships with anyone anymore and I spend a good 90% of my time by myself now. Is this bad? Should I see someone about this? I feel like I'm going to be okay but at the same time I'm really worried for what it could do to my mental health.,13Nov2019,1
56,"     When I was in 7th grade, I was stabbed in the back by my then best friend. Causing my whole school (small) to hate me. Same exact day my great grandmother died (we were very close). This caused anxiety, depression, BPD, anorexia, and suicidal thoughts and attempts. I can’t even tell you the amount of times I held a knife to my wrist or held pills in my hands. I went down 3 jean sizes in one month, and couldn’t leave the house for anything other than school.

I lost all my friends and didn’t fit in and quickly lost the new kid hype and became very lonely and self conscious for the first time in my life, and it’s stuck with me ever since. I’ve worked hard ever since to build up my self confidence and I’ve done well enough in sport/school/relationships/whatever to objectively look at myself from the outside and not feel shitty. So why do I still feel lonely in a room full of my closest friends? I’m 20 now and I’m just worried these feelings will never go away. Whenever I’m with friends I feel like I never know what to say and that I’m making a fool of myself or just feel completely alone even when I’m surrounded by my closest friends. From experience I’ve learned to ignore it because I get that it’s conceptually not true. But I can’t stop the feeling from just pressing in on me at all times. It goes away when I drink at social events, but I don’t want to use alcohol as a solution. I just want to feel confident on my own. Any tips?",13Nov2019,1

59,"Hello! I hope your doing ok, whoever is reading this. I just wanted to say that everything is going to be ok, I promise.

For over a decade I've dealt with depression and suicide. I always thought that the universe was against me and just wanted me to struggle. I never thought I would get better, with myself or progress in my life.

But I wanted to say that it's going to get better, despite the constant days of struggle that seems so repetitive and never ending, I promise you that it WILL end.

Weeks ago, I was sobbing in my pillow, not eating, not showering, not having any motivation to do anything, isolating myself. But, I told myself that I could do better, I could become better and not let the shadows of my past linger over me, not to allow the anxiety and stress over power me, and to not allow the negativity corrupt me any longer.

A few days ago, I worked out for the first time in months and I did it again today. I started to gain my motivation back little by little, by doing the baby steps; eating a little bit more, not sleeping in past the early afternoon, taking the time out to check up on my friends and call my mother (small things that used to be a big struggle for me) and I have been feeling a lot better than I have before and I feel like I can kick my negative energy and depressions ass right out of me.

I am not trying to flaunt, but only to show that I am living proof that you will get better, that you will overcome what is holding you back, it takes time, but it also takes a lot of will power that I know that you still have in you to beat this. I hope you can rid of the things that hurt you, and destroy it so you can live the life you want without having anything holding you back. I'm still not fully out of it since its been a part of me for half of my life, but I just wanted to say that I am proud of the baby steps I am committing to myself, and I hope you can also make a promise to yourself that you can beat this thing and be the person who you were meant to become.

64,"I recently decided it was time to fully commit to weekly therapy to heal from a very traumatic childhood, the suicide of my fiancée and the recent death of the grandmother that raised me. I’ve seen about two other therapist but always felt like they just wanted to hear themselves talk. 

I just had a third session with a therapist and I feel like she should’t be saying some of the things she has been saying. 

•Repeatedly asking if I am bipolar (she shouldn’t be diagnosing me).
•Saying I’m on the wrong dosage of my antidepressant and should be on a different one (she is not a medical doctor). 
•When I told her I met a great guy, she said that is for her to decide. 
•She has brought up God and projected her spiritual beliefs onto me. 

I was ready to just walk out tonight after she literally scoffed at a few things I value very highly. She would put her head back and say, “Oh nooooo! I’m not a fan of______. But that’s alright.” I try to use natural alternatives whenever possible in every aspect of my life. She compared the use of homeopathy to the use of heroin or arsenic. I’m a vegetarian and environment scientist and she said being a vegetarian is stupid and the negative effects on the environment caused by mass scale meat production is okay because we (the US) are feeding the world. They way she reacts to what I tell her makes me not want to tell her anything. How can I trust her to support me when she doesn’t support the things that make me who I am? 

She is obviously not the right fit for me but if this is normal for a therapist to behave this way, I don’t want to find a new one. I feel like she showed way too much bias and she made me feel small, damaged and stupid.",13Nov2019,1

I was diagnosed with ptsd a year ago but I have been living with it for years. I haven't asked for help because I'm afraid to finally face it. Tomorrow that changes. I've lost alot of important things to me. I lost the person I love most. I've lost family and friends because of my fear to be close to anyone.

I’ve made a lot of progress, but I feel like I’ve only hit the top of the iceberg. I’m trying to go through college and get my life started. I’m 21, I should be hitting the ground running, right?

I got into a really bad mental state last night a decided “hey! You know what, I’m going to kill myself tonight. Because I’m going to end my life might as well give in and cut, get drunk, and say goodbye to my friends.” I cut so much. There was more blood then I’ve ever seen come out of my cuts before. When I got drunk I decided to post something on r/suicidewatch to see if anyone could talk me out of it. I was convinced no one could because I was so dead set on hanging myself. 

As I got drunker the less I wanted to die and the more I just wanted to be held and told everything will be ok. So when someone said that my dog wouldn’t understand where I went, miss me, and never stop looking for me it hit hard. I cried for the first time in months because of that person. Yeah, it was probably just the liquor, but still. 

Since someone was able to talk me down I kinda just drank until I blacked out. Looking back on the videos I took I basically cried about how useless I was, how much of a burden I am to everyone around me, and how I must be faking the schizophrenia because I only see things on occasion. Basically I was blabbing about my insecurities. After I while I passed out and woke up to my alarm being loud and hand having to get up at 5am with a hangover. 

When I got to school someone noticed dried blood on my hand (forgot to wash them). I was able to play it off but a friend who knew I was almost a month clean noticed. They helped me clean up, held me, and kept telling me that I was going to be ok. It felt nice but I still feel guilty about not doing it or being a burden to them.

The pain... it can't be explained... why can't i ever feel ok and secure in an environment im gonna be in ALL the time, like my job??? should i jus not talk anymore? because im going to keep things to myself from now on if this is how most hams treat me with my mental health issues...",13Nov2019,1

72,"Just a short background, I grew up poor. I always wore secondhand clothing, having to eat cheap processed food because that’s all my family could afford, and sometimes we didn’t have anything to eat at all. Due to a few factors, I also grew up obese. I remember weighing myself at 5 years old and weighing around 85 pounds, virtually double what the “normal” weight is for that age. By the time I was 18, I weighed 300 pounds and was morbidly obese, with a BMI of 47.

I never thought well of myself. I never thought I was beautiful, or that anyone else thought it either. I didn’t receive much or really any affection during childhood or teen years, and suffered from severe depression &amp; anxiety (I still do), and that only reaffirmed my thoughts. If your parents don’t show you they love you, why would anyone else?

Here’s where the fun starts. I got a job, and it made me active. I started losing a lot of weight. I kept it up and a year and a half later, I’ve lost 100 pounds, barely hanging onto a BMI of 30, the bottom of the “obese” category. I know that I’m strong, and I know that I’ve gained muscle, as my legs are more toned and I can physically do more, but when I look at myself in the mirror, I see myself as I’ve always been: fat. 

I look in the mirror and see my big thighs, protruding belly, chubby cheeks, loose skin everywhere. And it feels like nothing has changed. I have physical evidence; I’ve had to buy smaller clothes several times because my old ones didn’t fit. I’m painfully aware of anything that jiggles in the slightest when I walk. I can see how much weight I’ve lost around my waist because I’ve been able to use the same belt for the majority of that time.  Around half of my coworkers have commented on my weight loss, so it’s obvious the physical changes are enough for people I’m around 5/7 days of the week to notice. I weigh myself almost every day, and get into a generally panicky mood if I see it goes up at all, or if I didn’t lose enough overnight. I constantly ask my SO for reassurance to see if I look better, what they’ve noticed has changed. 

I think part of that wants me to succeed at what I’m trying to do (lose weight) but the other part genuinely doesn’t see the results. Ultimately, I still feel like I weigh over 300 pounds. 

I’m not sure if I’m experiencing body dysmorphia, low self-esteem, if my other mental disorders have a play in it, or if I’m not experiencing any at all.",13Nov2019,1

He gave me s speach how I was vasting supplies on porpous and how I didnt care about anything and how I wasnt respecting him etc... it was beyoung tough to endure it.

I made another appointment to try to get help again. But it's always such a fucking pain dealing with the healthcare system.

I don't understand how someone could experience this and keep going. I talk to people who suffer from anxiety/depression. But I don't think they truly grasp how monumentally miserable this is. Maybe that's self-important of me.

It makes me think I'm going to lose everything because people don't understand. I feel like they look at me and just think I can't get a grip. But it's taking every ounce of me, every day, to stay on top of my shit. I'm worried they won't see how hard I'm trying and they'll leave me.

So this is a little story of a young boy, who decided to make an ambitious journey. 

The day we was accepted into his dream school, he was ecstatic, jumping for joy. He saw an opportunity, an opportunity to be who he created for himself. He longer needed to of adhere to the traditionalist ideals of his father, and the oppressive expectations of his mother.

When he arrived on campus, it was the best day of his life, he was away, free of the tyranny that was his upbringing. However, there was something... missing.

Not knowing what it was he took matters into his own hands. He had a job, so he bought himself new clothes. That wasn’t it. He tried to join clubs. He couldn’t get in them. He wanted change so he dyed his hair. Nothing. The one good thing going for him is he’s going to see his favorite band of 5 years. 

His family back home found out he had dyed his hair, he was presented with mixed reactions. Feeling uneasy he wasn’t sure if he was supported by home anymore.

He took his exams, and now has failed one them. This means it’s more than likely he will not graduate on time. Knowing he can’t afford college beyond 4 years, he considers dropping out. 

He has a job in line for when he moves back, and he can even get another with a family member who is also different and actually likes him.

All things considered, he could lead a life, maybe not the one he dreamed of, but one none the less. 

He can return home to his friends whom he considers his real family, and he loves. 

He can continue to tread water, either comfortably back where he started, or uncomfortably and free.

80,"I'm a INTP who frequently has depressive moments, in such moments I fully convince my self that I'm in autistic spectrum. I take a few tests online and, even with super high confirmation bias, I only score minimum score to be suspected of a mild autism-Asperger. Also I don't recognize in half of descriptions and depictions of autistic people, neither I feel similar to the ones I met, but still I have a lot of similar issues.

I also took tests for other disturbs like dissociation and others I can't even remember, always had mild suspected to strongly negative results, and I was super biased.

I'm clinically depressed but I'm not satisfied by this diagnosis I came up with my therapist, because I'm sure my depression is mostly caused by my pathology and not my early life, even tho I surely had a terrible early life. I got to the point where I remember everything of my early life and connect the dots of cause effect mechanism and see how it impacts on my adult life, but still there are a lot of issues ununswered.

Problem is I have high self esteem, I don't have mood swings, I'm not suicidal or autolesionist, I never cried since years and can't feel anxiety, I don't even how does it feel to be anxious, I'm some kind of anxiety virgin. Now I'm happy I don't have any of this issues, but all of this stuff is what makes people care about you. I could come here type that I want to kill myself and there it'd be everybody telling me I should appreciate myself and that I deserve to live. This is how it works IRL too. I think that for suicidal people it is a big help for a brighter future. 

But for a guy who is perceived to be just one happy reserved guy, serious and equilibrate, while I feel I'm rotting inside...

I can tell people I have big problems because of depression and they won't believe me or act like I never said it. When I asked help anybody started with his ""you gotta have higher self esteem, you gotta distract, I feel you: I suffer anxiety too"". Oh come on! 
So when I start a relationship and depression places itself between me and the person I care, that person will split with me thinking that I'm faking depression just to justify my emotional absence. They don't believe me because I don't place my hand on burning cigarettes or have emotional outbursts and stuff. Many people think I'm a manipulating bs.

Just give me a name for my pathology. I want a fcking bracelet that tells everyone I'm autistic or whatever so they start acting with me like a not-normal person and accepting me. When I start to be perceived to be disturbed, there it starts my normal life. I have a fantasy of being autistic too. I sometimes fake what is described to be autistic behavior (posture, gestures, voice and stuff) and it feels so good, cathartic! 

Ps: I hope you understand I'm just opening to you and I don't want to disrespect anyone affected by mental issues, neither the awsome people who help them here. I'm telling you how I feel, this is how is supposed to work when you talk about your problems, you have to talk freely.",13Nov2019,1

Dear Sir/Madam:

We are a team of academic researchers interested in early detection of signs of depression. The main purpose of our project is to instigate the development of automatic methods that try to learn how to link word usage to psychological problems (e.g. depression, eating disorders, self harm, etc).

We really believe that this kind of ""text mining"" research might be valuable as a complement to more traditional screening strategies. As a matter of fact, there are multiple studies that show that depression is often undetected or detected at a late stage. We think that these low ratios of early detection could be improved. At least, we think it is worth to try.

To meet this aim, we need some data from individuals who were diagnosed with depression. If you were recently diagnosed with depression, we would greatly appreciate if you could fill the questionnaire attached. It is a standard inventory of questions related to depression and used by psychologists at the earliest stages of detection of symptoms of depression. Note that the questionnaire contains a field in which the respondent has to provide his/her Reddit username. This would help us to link word use (as extracted from your Reddit's public submissions) with the level of depression (as estimated from your answers to the questionnaire).

Of course, we will treat the information you provide with the utmost confidentiality and privacy. All information we will extract from Reddit will be anonymised and we will be the only one capable of connecting your username with your postings and your questionnaire. Such information will be kept in an encrypted file and will not be disclosed to anybody.

The information you will provide through the questionnaires will enable us to properly weight each and every symptoms to enable their best identification in what people writes.

We really thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope that our activities help to gain insights into the development of depression and how it affects those who suffer from it.

90,"Hello. This is hard to convey the best way, but I am a college student who lives 45 minutes away from the school. I started to lose interest in going to school, skipping classes, and not showing up altogether. I don’t know why it’s like the lazy and overwhelmed feeling just takes over and tells my mind and body to just skip it. 

I tired to see a counselor to talk with at school to figure this out. 

A couple of things is that I know I am suffering with something but I don’t know what. I would get this strong sensation of feeling stress, sad, and anxiety all at once but it won’t take long for all of it to go away and I feel nothing, it’s like the emotions balance out and I just feel nothing. The rest of the day I can be productive and do what I need to do but I just feel nothing and maybe slightly annoyed. 

I’m also in Army ROTC to help me to get a career in the military. I know based on what I wrote above might seem like I shouldn’t go into the military but when it comes with work and school these emotions of feeling nothing just turn to focus and out of a social mask and I Do well at work. And the military will give me a good chance to get my life together and help me with a lot of things and it’s good for my major as well. 

I don’t want to see someone professional because I don’t want to blacklist myself from going to military. I know mental health is important but the military will help me career wise and just getting my life together. But I been dealing with this for a long time, it’s just now taking a large toll and I’m starting to lose interest in school because I want to complete my major (my major is in high demand and very profitable) and so I can be an officer and hopefully be a pilot in the military (also helps with my major) 

I tired to go to my schools counselor but at certain points i wasn’t able to make it due to situations that came up that day. 

This might be vague and that’s because I don’t know exactly what I am feeling. When I am feeling the overwhelm pressure I can express it but after that I don’t know and I just feel empty and numb. I can function especially for work and school but other then that I just feel empty. I don’t know where else I can really turn to but would like some advice if possible.",13Nov2019,1
91,"Hey people ! I posted in a different sub before but I'm hoping to have more anwsers here (also it can benefit to more people)

I'm thinking about moving to a foreigner country next fall for a year. Maybe Scotland. I live in EU, no idea how the brexit gonna affect us, but for now it's just an idea.
I'm on 3 different meds and already made micro ajustements 3/4 times this year, so I need a psychiatrist handy. I would have the financial means to pay for consults and everything whatever my job situation would be bc my parents back me up

92,"As the title says I have very self destructive behaviors I tend to try and find a reason for everything. It usually just ends up driving me insane and the reason I come up with is always like worst possible scenario. I never speak my mind because I am afraid of judgement , being weird, or opening up and being drowned in Sympathy. As a result I’m very standoffish and have very few friends. I’ve never really learned how to get over the trauma I had as a child.
I have gone to numerous therapists over the years and feel as though I’ve gotten nothing out of it. Honestly I’ve gotten quite depressed and just need something positive , maybe suggestions on how to stop the negativity I bring into my life, or even just your way of calming down (I used to go to a place near where I lived and sat by a stream to think and now I live in the middle of no where.)",13Nov2019,1

I haven't self harmed in months, suicidal thoughts still come and go but the frequency decreased. things just became somewhat of a joke and I'm living life as it comes. currently in the midst of university entry examinations and I think I've got gum infection. 

and suddenly, I feel infuriated at myself. at my younger self. that bitch. self harmed, and now I've got scars. bitch didn't take care of her teeth and I had to wear braces and might even have gum infection now. bitch kept pulling out her own hair and now I have very thin and few hair. scratched and peeled my wounds and now I have so many ugly patches of scars. didn't take care of her eyesight and now I have 700 degrees myopia. I am so angry. so infuriated. at my own self. 

I feel so disconnected with myself right now. I don't want to go back to depression and all. but I'm just so so mad. why did she want to ruin herself so badly? I'm only 18. how am I going to live on? especially after my examinations, I want to go out, live life and have fun. but now I have to take time off to heal from the self inflicted ""injuries"".

95,"Lately I feel like I'm constantly angry or frustrated. One of the things I do when I get really angry is hit inanimate objects. Unhealthy I know. I've bruised and bloodied my knuckles way more times than is healthy and I've had to replace a lot of broken things, but I feel like if I dont take the anger out on something I could take it out on someone. I just punched the hell out of my locker at work after my boss did something that annoyed me (gave me two tasks that would take time and got mad that in the time it took to do one, the other wasn't magically completed). Now my hand hurts and my locker is dented and I still feel angry. I'm hiding in the break room trying to calm down by writing this post. 

I've just felt this way a lot lately. Getting snippy with my family when I don't mean to be, getting way more annoyed at little inconveniences, and any times where normally I'd be a little annoyed I get the overwhelming urge to hit something. And never anything soft...for some reason hitting something solid that could break the object or hurt me is the only way I get any kind of catharsis or feel like I'm getting the anger out of my system.

When I was a kid I remember my dad being the same way. Any time he was angry he'd kick the wall or throw something and break it. I remember when he was angry at me he'd pick up my toys and smash them on the wall then later feel bad and buy me a new one.

100,"Ever since I'm off my anti depressants (almost 4 months) I keep getting these weird flashback moments from when I was severely depressed between 2012 and 2015. I would have a lot of days where I tried to kill myself out of impulse in a place where I had no weapons or no option to do so. And then when I had the option there were always people to hold me to the floor. For example, when I was in my deepest depression I lived in this homeless shelter for youth (I was 19) and forced to go to this camping trip. It was either figuring out a place to stay or joining. Dont get mad, they meant well. Just stupidly organized. I had another one of those self-attacks there when we were done biking. There was a combination of smells in the air that day like burnt wood and wet mud, combined with the hot sun on a cold day. I was feeling exhausted and tired. So the other day I was biking to my friend on a cold but sunny day. Out of nowhere I smelled burnt wood, for some reason I still can't explain I smelled wet mud too. And even though I liked the combination, my heart broke down. I felt so sad. I stopped biking because I had to sit down. And I know it sounds like some PTSS, but I've never been diagnosed before with that. I have OCD, BPD, ADHD and dysthimia. But I never had these flashbacky-ish things happening until I got off my medication. I don't speak to a therapist anymore since a week or two officially because they were all too messy. But it's always a combination of a smell, the weather and sometimes food. But I see food as part of the smells. There's a lot of these examples but this is just the only one I wanted to share because I don't want to bore everyone with áaaalll the things. They're too much to explain.",13Nov2019,1

I think I have a depression, but again, I'm not sure (to be clear, I'm not asking for you guys to diagnose me)
Sometimes, I just think that I'm exaggerating and I'm just feeling sad, but, like... I'm not sure that people with a good mental health are feeling the way I do.

Seriously, do everyone think about death ? Like, is it a normal thing ?
I'm sincerely surprise when I see some people with huge struggles, I just think ""... If it's so hard, why not just killing yourself ? It's so much easier !""

But, with nowadays culture of ""Omg death yas I wanna die lmao I'm depressed"" I'm not really sure if everyone actually feels that way, or others say it just as a joke and I should be worried.
If it's the second case, I don't understand how people can live without being depressed.

A little over a month ago got into a conversation with a cousin I don't know super well who lives in another country. Acknowledged that I wasn't doing OK and she asked why and said she'll listen and like an idiot and took the bait. 

Of course she had more talking than listening to do and insisted a book on the power of the subconscious mind (written in 1963 by a total quack) would cure me of my depression and a whole lot of other garbage and platitudes. I don't know why I even engaged but it took forever to just get her to fucking drop it. 

Well, it looks like she got my new address from a family member and decided to send the book my way and just messaged to let me know. The address is not correct, though it might still arrive here. It's going straight in the trash. But she's so fucking smug and feeling clever. I told her next time to send it to her dad because maybe it'll cure his alcoholism. And yes it was a dick thing to say but WTF. 

This woman fucking MOCKED me a month ago by talking about how active listening is for children and I guess we'd have a better conversation of she just said ""Mhm"" and ""aha"" and nothing else. YES we probably would have. 

I blocked her. I'm so angry.

Lots of people ostensibly want to help, but honestly they just want to prove that they're right, that they know better, that they have a solution, and if it doesn't work or apply it's because I'm too negative or uncooperative or whatever. I've spent so much of my life beating myself up for being depressed and things I have no control over. I don't need someone swooping in and thinking it's funny they got one over me because they'll force a stupid book into my hands. 

I was on the verge of being hospitalized a month ago. I don't need a fucking garbage book and someone just waiting eagerly to say ""I told you so"" or ""well you just don't want to be helped."" I battle this thing every day. No one can tell me I'm not trying.

110,"I’m a 20 year old female recently having a struggle with life. I feel so alone, because my mental health has completely taken a turn for the worse about 3 months ago. I recently started therapy just last week because I have become aware that something is not ok. 

I live an alright life- not with my parents- i live with my girlfriend and her family a state away from my home town. 

These past few months I have felt so detached from the world around me, and I feel like I am just existing inside of my own head. 

I have no attention span. someone could be talking to me, telling me a story and I will be paying attention to them as if I am listening but i really am not, which is the frustrating part I cannot help. someone will tell me a story; or at work I will be given directions and I will respond as if I heard them, but once the conversation is over I realize I do not retain any information that people say to me. I am very forgetful lately which is also so unlike me. Everything upsets me, has a toll on me, and i take everything in and just dwell on it until it eats me alive. 

I cannot express happiness. Sometimes I will feel it, but I cannot show that to other people- it feels impossible. I have no motivation, no will looking forward. Everything around me is becoming so unorganized and it’s my own fault but I can’t seem to snap out of it. It’s scary because I just feel exhausted, like every day is the same and i’m just pushing to the next day for no good outcome. 

I have the worst car anxiety. I have never been in an accident and I have always been a great driver. But lately, in the car I’ll be driving then all of a sudden I will get hot flashes and start to shake, my heart feels like it is beating out of my chest and I feel as though I am going to end up in an accident somehow. It’s terrifying because I don’t know why my body has this reaction all of a sudden. There is nothing to be triggered. 

I have woken up with extreme stomach pain, heavy chest, sweats, fast heart rate, all followed by instant vomiting AS SOON as i wake up. I can’t even lay in bed because my body forces everything out of itself. It has affected my work because my body is just in excruciating pain every morning before work. I have been losing weight fast- which is unlikely for me- i never lose weight even if i’m trying at the gym. 

I have no appetite. I even was going to see doctors for the longest time, but all my tests came back normal for diseases or any food allergies. That is when I finally convinced myself to go see a therapist because maybe it isn’t a stomach issue. 

I am scared because I am not like myself anymore. I am so negative, all I do is complain and I cannot seem to find an ounce of happiness in anything that used to make me happy. I have tried everything. I am physically and mentally exhausted inside of my own body but there is no escape. It has started to effect my relationship because my girlfriend says she feels as though she is not making me happy, which is not true I love her more than anything and want to be with her, my mind is just really messing me up. Nobody seems to understand around me, no matter how much I try and explain myself to them. I feel like I am just a bother to the people around me with the issues I have going on, so I stopped talking about it, but that just causes my thoughts to build up with nobody to express them to. 

I have only had my assessment for therapy so far, so that is why I am coming here to see if anyone has experienced anything like what I am?

116,"Don't know if I am doing this right or even if I should be but here goes anyhow... (sorry if it gets long)



I have a litany of mental issues but last night was a doozey. It felt like I was rapid cycling through hyper emotions (anxiety, rage, self loathing, grief, etc). I even beat my head against the floor because I was convinced my husband had ""reached his limit of my bullshit"" and was going to leave me. Despite my almost daily urges to hurt myself I almost never succumb because I don't want to upset him or chance my daughter seeing.




Anywho, some time later, I was sitting in the bathtub. It was a retreat but also the most lowkey uncomfortable place I could think of. I had this overwhelming urge that I needed to be punished so I was going to sit in ice water or rain scalding hot over me. Ultimately I only ran cold water over my feet until it hurt because I don't have a way to dry the clothes I was wearing in the tub.




At some point I started to explain to my husband how I didn't feel like I was a proper human. Like there was some part of me that was missing or so diseased that made me more of a homunculi than a person. How I've always felt like I was Wrong. People's subconscious and even animals could sense it and avoid me.




After 11+ years together I thought I had covered everything with him but he seemed perplexed. He tried to point out he could gather our friends to prove I was wrong. I argued that they are kind people that would say whatever they thought would make me feel better. Which is more of a testament to their goodness than the truth.




I told him I was poison that my mother rejected even before I was born. I was the source and target of her ire. Maybe she wouldn't be so severely fruit loops now if it wasn't for me. I orginally thought she was incapable of anything but cruelty--until I was old enough to see how she treated other people/kids. She was fine, even kind, supportive, and encouraging of my cousins, neighbors, etc. She was always ready to give someone the shirt of her back or help lift them up towards their dreams. Meanwhile, I once punched/pushed her in the chest as a teen because she had tried to hug me. It was so foreign that I had panicked and instinctively tried to defend myself. 




My mom wasn't the only one who targeted me. Other adults abused me as a child (and only me out of the kids I grew up with), I was a pariah at school, and even animals seemed to avoid me if possible. Like they could smell whatever is wrong with me at my core.



It was me that was the common demoniator.



My life simply doesn't mean as much as anyone else's. I didn't sleep last night because I was upset and didn't want to disturb hubby with my crying or shaking in bed so I've been laying here on the couch obsessing. 




It goes beyond this sense of negativity. I legitimately find myself confused, frustrated, and exhausted by socializing. Like, I'm not participating as much as I'm just playing the part of what I think a person would be saying/doing. I feign sympathy or excitement for others when there is just emptiness or apathy inside me.




I feel like my friends are just snowballed by my performance. If they knew how alien I feel most of the time they'd reject me as well. The only person I have dropped all walls to is my husband--which my brain tells me is a grievous mistake because he will eventually run out of tolerance and paitence for me. I feel guilty for having the few peeps in my life that I do because I am certain that my Wrongness is going to disease them by proximity.




Logically, I know this could be dissociation or depersonalization or something, but I don't believe that. I am reluctant to say ""soul"" but the best way I can describe how I feel is that my soul is corrupted and sick. Or I am missing a vital chunk of whatever makes a person a person. I'm like some Frankenstein. Convincing outer appearance but inhuman monster inside.




Now that I am at the end, I don't know what the point of all of this is. Maybe a check to see if I am alone? Researching depersonalization didn't seem to fully fit and my dissociative episodes are usally more...absent and detached.




Luckily I have an appointment with my therapist today but I have little hope about it really mattering. Any time I have tried to brooch the subject with other therapists they point out my feelings as being baseless and illogical. I effing know that it's illogical! But I have never been able to shake my subhuman status and the urge to punish myself if I upset or even inconvenience someone else on the sheer basis that they have worth.",13Nov2019,1

118,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to read my post. Here's the rundown. High level stress situations such as arguments, fights, (verbal/physical), or anything else that sets off high stress for me causes me to hear static. It usually starts off low barely even noticeable but as the stressor continues and or gets worse, the static gets louder and louder. I already told my doctor about this but I don't thinks she's taking it seriously 

Thanks in advance i look forward to seeing y'alls responses.",13Nov2019,1

122,"I was waiting for a phone call about a job and started believing they wont call me. it was a mediocre job. normal and legal. I was disappointed but not much and started having random thoughts under impulse like ""its better they did not call back, because I would not want to work there because it triggers my ocd worries. I do not care they did not call me. everything is fine and I do not care. hahahaha"" 

These thoughts were normal thoughts to myself. 

The next day, they called me for a second interview. and I got excited but ocd started warning me

ocd: do not get excited you may have made a promise to God under impulse not to go there again.

me: I remember nothing

ocd: you do not. but your subconscious does that's why you are having these thoughts right now. do you want to risk it?

I was planning not to go and turn down the second interview but I got sad and feeling that ocd won a big round. after talking with a friend and reddit, I was determined that everything was ocd and went to that interview.

Now, I feel again worried. what if there was a promise that I cant remember because it was under impulse? what if a punishment was asked?

what if it was a promise on purpose but I cant remember under impulse?

what if I was so carefree and careless in order to stop myself feeling disappointed for possibly, not being called back, that I started having thoughts about promises about this job? just for fun?

why, a part of my subconscious, somehow without my will, agrees with what ocd says? it is like saying "" wait. what ocd says is maybe true, cause something rings a bell"".

Could ocd has taken advantage of the random thoughts I said to myself like "" I would not want work there and it would cause me anxiety"" and turned them to a hypothetical promise? just because my ocd worries are about promises?

it has been a year and a half since I started having ocd worries with promises. and I have told God to protect me cause I suffer from the ocd. and if by any chance, I forget and make a promise, with or without my will, under ocd stress or while being carefree, to never make it valid.

But does God protect me from these ocd thoughts? did I do the right thing going to that interview again? does God protect me even from the promises that are not ocd related? why ocd finds similarities of my case with the story of the father who made a rush vow his daughter to God?

and why I do not remember the hypothetical scenario of the ocd? and why a part of my subconscious feels like it may have happened? I remember less important details about my thoughts but I do not remember a promise. I analyzed every thought that I can remember. and I I cant remember any promise. yet, my subconscious sometimes is like "" maybe ocd is right but you cant remember cause something distracted you while making the promise or maybe you were sure that you wont go to that work interview so you forget it quickly. maybe you got distracted with an other ocd worry""

I have been analyzing my thoughts again and again. I did not sleep well. I slept almost at early morning. I was restless.

When I calm down, I say to myself

me: I have ocd. ocd worries are about promises. I have asked God for protection. He protects me and absolves me from any promise. I am supposed to be free and no matter how much worried I am, to remind myself of God's protection. if, I think that maybe there was a promise, I should remind myself of the protection and that I am metally ill. it has been a year and a half and I do not allow my ocd to continue giving me worries for doing normal things. I do not allow my self to be affected by my ocd, after all these months of anxiety. 

I used to worry about ocd thoughts that were without my will and I ended up worrying about hypothetical ocd thoughts and scenarios. I worry so much just for an ocd hypothesis. and yet, my subconscious is like ""maybe, ocd is right, cause something rings a bell and I cant remember it""

why I cant confirm it? my brain is trained to automatically, get so worried if the word promise comes to my head. and even if it comes to my head, it is without my will. and I remember it even if it is for a second. how can I can not remember an hypothetical real promise?",13Nov2019,1

125,"Sorry for weird english and don't worry, I go to therapy. Not a throwaway account, I might delete later.

I (20F) recently struggle with depression. I can't eat, sleep schedule is messed up, I feel alone even though I know I have friends I can count on, I lose interest in everything I have ever liked and nothing can distract me as I'm drowning in my thoughts.

Necessary background: I always had period like this in my life but I could never overcome them. My parents never loved each other. When I was little every day was full of discussions, screams and tears. My father was basically absent. My mother is very sweet but tremendously insecure and that made me feel lost. Home never felt like a safe place for me, it's filled with those memories (both discussions and my depression periods).
The discussions finished when I was 11 because they separated but I feel like they have left a huge hole in me I will never fill. I still don't know how does it feels to be part of a family (having dinner at a friend's house always makes me emotional for example. Peaceful dinner all together, I don't remember things like this). 
If I had to choose just one thing I want in my life is to feel home with a person that I love and that loves me. 


Two years ago I moved to a far city in order to study at university (it was October). I fell in love with a boy and we became a pretty stable couple (November). During the last few months I slowly felt more and more insecure about my feelings, I genuinely thought I was in that relationship because I needed someone. I felt like I was a shit and he deserved a lot better. We decided to broke up almost two months ago. Every day since that event became more and more terrible. I met him again. I told him that I missed him and he asked me if I was sure I missed him and not his role. I couldn't tell and I swear now that I know the answer this regret is burning me alive. He told me he didn't want to try again to be with me and I really understand why, I was just too fragile to stand by myself. 

I've had very terrible days when I couldn't do nothing but walk and cry for hours until I felt like I couldn't take anymore steps. I thought about me and my feelings way too much and.. 
If It really was a blind need then why am I alone right now? I could have accepted everyone as my partner in order to fill the role. If it really was a blind need then how did I make until this point alone? Is the desire of a warm home with your loved one really a bad thing? 

I told him my situation with depression and cures and I said him that I'm sorry for everything I caused him. I told him that I would like to see him again, but that I'm not ready right now as I'm still bleeding. I want to see him when I can stand by myself, I want to see him not because I need something but because I want to see him and nothing else. I feel like he doesn't want to try anymore a relationship. I fear that he won't wait for me.

I rejected everything that wasn't him. I miss him. I want him to be in that role and not everyone else. And I couldn't tell him before. 
I feel like I lost the only person I have ever felt like home.

In these days I can't help but imagine situations where we are together, where I overcome my past and grow strong and can stand by myself. 
This kind of scenarios help me cope for a second, until I realize they are not likely to happens and I feel worse than before.
How can I cope with this kind of thoughts and situations? Any kind of advice or point of view is welcome",13Nov2019,1
126,"I understand that suicide isn't a way out, it's selfish to those around you, and nothing can ever get better if you're gone.  Life isn't negative, and there is no underlying or defining reason for me to always be looking for a break, just some rest, a way out... But it is always a constant, underlying theme in my thoughts.

I've been medicated for about a year at this stage, it helps to even things out but it can also feel like a bit of a cage because you can never experience emotions fully. Can't just cry when it feels like such an ideal pressure relief.  Conversation with the psychiatrist are challenging because the consensus is always the same. More drugs, different drugs, get a brain scan. Switching doctors is a struggle because the whole cycle of something new, a new regiment, only to find the same 'let down' is just too much to stomach. 

Multiple psychologist and techniques haven't really stuck or fit for me, with the latest being cognitive behavioral therapy, which just didn't seem to click with me. Starting again with someone else has the same issues as the psychiatrist. Going out and aski g for more help when you're just .. exhausted of being let down/abandoned/forgotten or simply not getting what you want. 

Yet - perpetually - I can't find value in things I do, I don't find pleasure and enjoyment in so much of my life, it just seems like a constant cycle of moving from one 'mandatory' task or activity to another. Always wearing a mask, a disguise just to get through. Just wanting to sleep to escape it all.

Prioritizing myself, or this vs that I want - just leads to feeling guilty or wrong; no one is actively discouraging it, but I always seem to be dropping the ball for someone else. Like I have to support me plus everyone else, or everyone else...

And so, I want to stop. I want to stop trying to feel ok. I want to stop playing a part, stop trying to provide people with the connection or support/attention I wish would be shown to me (..treat others as you wish to be treated).  I want to stop feeling like a burden for feeling this way all the time. 

I can't just quit though .. I'm not commited as to why I can't, beyond how it would impact everyone else... But would an acceptable alternative just be to abandon this life I've created, simplify everything and start over? The isolation/loneliness would be crippling - but would it be a better alternative..  I just want a break, a chance to get my head above water... A chance to care about me without the world having their hands out for their share..I just want an emotional state beyond ""protecting myself"" and pretending to be ok..  is 'nothing' a new state? Is it better?",13Nov2019,1

130,"Warning this is a long text and Im already trying to seek help but its gonna take a while

Backstory: i was a happy kid, sadly my father passed away when I was entering primary school, since then I believe Im becoming different. Im 16 now and in high school and im afraid my life will become terrible and sad and nobody will be able to help me, and that I will have constant problems with my mind that will restrict me from living happily and normally

I had a history of problems which I dont find much of a problem compared to this (some depressions and terrible hypochondria)
This is a recent and much worser thing. It started a week ago when a teacher who is an undecent weirdo decided to show us a documentary about a f*cked up man who murdered his family then did horrible things to their corpses and did sexual things with them. Ever since Im lost and I terribly regret coming to school that day because I was granted one free day from school but I spent that on the day before and im seriously regretting it. I could have been normal if it didnt happen. Im getting sad as i even think of it and i think im such an idiot for doing the wrong decision

So I started getting bad thoughts from it and I was slowly convincing myself that im a terrible person like him too even though i was a great kid never hurt anyone. I was afraid I could be a sadist or a psychopath who could harm somebody and I was thinking I was getting urges to do terrible stuff like that. I have 2 cats that I love I never seriously thought of hurting them but now Im afraid I might so I try to stay away from them as much as possible. Im also scared i might just punch somebody or hit a girl or something and im afraid I have urges, I cant tell but I didnt have that until now

Then I started thinking that for my whole life I was an asshole in disguise, a narcissist psycchopath and person who just used people and family in order to get what i want and I thought I dont have any emotions for anyone and just care for myself. Im still struggling. Until now I thougt im a good person who wouldnt hurt anybody and I thought i love my family but now Im feeling very weird

Next thing is that in my mind I keep picturing just totally morally wrong things such as murdering someone or torturing or raping and so on. I didnt have this before

And more thoughts. For example I meet a person and i immediately think of them as idiots and I just laugh at them, in my mind im rude to everybody. In real life I try to stay cool but these thoughts start to convince that im just an evil asshole that hates everybody and laughs at everyone. I dont have these thoughts all the time but its unbearable because I cant tell whether its truly me or just evil thoughts. For example I talked with my grandpa with my problems and he was crying and then this idea popped in my head: ""im getting bored, i dont care what you have to say and screw off"" and Im afraid im seriously just pretending in front of people but i laugh at them and think badly of them in my mine. Its so sad and terrible and I wanna have nice thoughts towarda everyone. Im even ashamed to admit this. I cant tell whether I had this before too or not, thats whats really scary

And the worst thing that is recent is that I think there are two personalities in me, a bad and a good one. I dont even know which one i am there are still fights between the two, I feel like the good compassionate one is getting weak or it didnt even exist before and the evil personality was always there subcounciously and it wants to get rid of the better one. That i was always a terrible human being who wasnt aware but that documentary revealed its existance and my true self and that It was planning the whole time to do terrible things but revealing it too early screwed me up because I was still convinced im a good person. I feel like im harming myself but I dont even know who I am, I feel like i enjoy torturing myself, that I dont do bad things just to not go to jail or something. I feel like i wanna laugh at somebodys death for example and the good personality wants to be compassionate but the bad one tells it that the good one is just pretending and non existant and it just wants to laugh at somebodys death or their relatives DO YOU REALISE HOW WRONG THIS IS??? The bad one just wants to be morally wrong and terrible to everyone and Its DESTROYING ME. I dont even know who is writing this. I feel like im the bad side that wants to secretly seek help but in reality its just a pessimistic one that wants to have my life destroyed and destroy the life of others. I feel really disconnected from this world, that im the only real thinking being and this feeling reinforces the bad side thinking ""No one is as real as you are so why not do bad things for fun??"". AND i fear that not even psychologist can help me because Im afraid im a special case and im done for good. BUT I WANNA BE A GOOD COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEING AND ENJOY LIFE AS OTHERS, I DONT WANNA BE RUDE AND PESSIMISTIC ALL THE TIME

I feel like im just pretending to all you who read this and that the truly bad side might take over me but somewhere deep down this one thing orders me to write here and seek help in real life in case it gets much worse. I dont know who I am, I am crying now and I cant figure out why or what is really happening, I feel like im pretending again. I feel like even writing this furtherly damaged me because I had to face all of it and im afraid i really convinced im evil...

Im very afraid some supreme being is controlling my life and is purposely screwing me over and this hellish pathetic and sad existence will just go on. Why me? Why do I have to be so unhappy and tortured? Please leave thoughts below because everything seems so dark and I cant seriously tell who the hell is even typing this.

My shortness of breath got even worse this week, and I finally did some research only to find out that I have been doing the opposite of what I should have. Apparently, hyperventilating (breathing too much or too hard) is a (major cause)[https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/symptoms/breathing-difficulties] of anxiety-related shortness of breath, and even thinking about breathing and trying to control it can cause problems as breathing should be a mostly subconscious thing.

Okay so I just got home i’m a little shook up but I’ll be fine this really isn’t about me. It’s about that poor woman I saw on the overpass today. 

I’m just driving by freeway overpass and I saw what looked to be a small slight woman with both legs over the barrier and both palms ready to push off. 

There was a man on the bicycle next to her talking to her rather calmly I don’t know if he was just some passerby or if he knew her. Whatever he said to her seem to of worked because she got off that barrier. Only like four or five people that I saw called 911 like myself. 

Seem like everybody else was just in a hurry (Silicon Valley)honking their horn‘s angrily that people are pulling into the emergency lane to help this poor woman. 

I can only imagine what brought her there, I hope that she will get better from here. I made sure she was with a group of people talking and waiting for first responders to arrive.

I doubt she’ll ever know how many people cared about her today. However alone she felt in the past, she was not alone today. It’s an awesome thing to remember that every day people can pull together and help each other out in their hour of need.

141,"Hey guys! I have been working around the clock on my self-esteem for nearly a year. Wanted to share the results with you guys. Sorry in advance, this may be a bit of a long post. 


Anywho, I'll just jump right in. I don't know about you all, but I was always after direct solutions for my mental health issues. 


I had problems with cutting, so I sought out direct alternatives. Ice cubes, rubber bands, paint markers. None of it worked. 


When I felt ugly, I would put on nice clothes and makeup. That didn't work either, most of the time I felt WORSE after I had gotten dolled up. 


When I wondered why my long-term boyfriend wouldn't propose, I'd make sure the house was spotless, and that the meals were from scratch. Didn't get a proposal. 


You get the idea, right? 


Anyways. Nearly four years ago, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I had extreme paranoia, and delusions. 


At that time, to be able to function properly, I had to learn to fight some of the thoughts that popped up. That looked something like this:


""Someone is in the house."" 

""No they aren't, you know you locked the windows and doors, the dogs haven't made a peep.""

""Yeah, but someone is here, I can feel it. 

""They absolutely are not. Quit trying to convince yourself that they are. We'll have a look around, and put this to rest.

""No, you can't look, take a knife."" 


And so on and so forth. My adrenaline would peak, it felt like every nerve in my body was a live wire. These situations made me want to run, or shutdown. But I forced myself to stay and fight. 


And you know what? I had pretty decent success. Sure, the paranoia still wins some days. But I no longer find myself in the position of carrying weapons around my house, or putting my couches in front of doors. A nervous wreck, sure. But fighting with every ounce of my being to overcome my paranoid thoughts, and by god, fucking WINNING. 


So what does this have to do with my self esteem? 


One day, I was really laying into myself. ""You're such a piece of shit, nobody likes you, you're a burden."" You know the drill. And all of a sudden, my thoughts shifted. And I reply to myself with one weak and measly, ""No you aren't."" 


What? I never stand up for myself. Not even in my own mind. I had made such a habit of fighting my delusional thoughts, that here I was, making a stand, on a front I never Imagined I would, and saying ""You're tricking yourself."" 


And just like that, I made a mental note to argue with my low self esteem. Every time I told myself I was ugly, or a piece of shit, or this or that, I would counter with reasons as to why I wasn't, and why I shouldn't talk to myself that way.  


A thousand times over, slowly but surely feeding myself kindness. Day in, day out. Even when I didn't necessarily believe it. 


It wasn't easy, by any means, but it got easier as time went on. I wasn't just amending a few words here and there, replacing bad adjectives with good ones. These were full on arguments in my head. But I showed up every day, willing and ready to tell myself why I wasn't the person I thought I was. Something I had never done before. I had always just accepted my inner narrative as the truth. 


And now? Now I believe it. To a degree, at least. I feel better about myself than I have my entire life. And it has been the biggest game changer for me.


The cutting? It stopped. 

The ugly feeling? Getting better. 

The boyfriend? We're getting married. 


All those problems that I thought had individual solutions, were solved with one single notion. Loving myself. And I know how cheesy that sounds. But I am simply floored at what kind of difference it has made in my life. I really NEVER imagined.


I had been abused for most of my childhood. Because of this, my negative self view was likely a product of my environment. Now, I am a product of a new environment, one I created for myself. 


I guess that's it. I just wanted to share this step in my journey. I feel like I've won the effing lottery. So if you read this far, thank you, and I hope you are all treating yourself well out there! 


Tl;DR: Gaining self-esteem fixed some problems I never imagined it would. ",13Nov2019,1

143,"This guy I'm seeing has been showing signs of depression for a long time, especially recently. Typical signs he's showing: either sleeping for extremely long periods or going several days without sleep, going several days without eating or eating massive amounts, irritability and mood swings, loss of interest in daily activities, feeling hopeless, like nothing good will happen for him and feels like he should give up, he is overly critical to himself and blames himself for everything, and also have some alcohol and drug problems. There have also been periods where he spent all day every day in bed. He will stay in bed if he has nothing planned that day.

These are just the ones off the top of my head.

I am not a doctor or psychiatrist or anything like that, but these seems like pretty clear signals to me.

I've been trying to point it out, but he won't listed to me.

144,"Before I was something like 12(I'm now 25), I was always the most friendly, talkative kid around my friend circle. I was very emotional. Always trying to give out positive energies. I loved everything about the world. 

But then, things suddenly started changing for me. No one died, nothing traumatic happened. The change just came by itself. 

I started feeling tired and drained all the time. Laughing and smiling felt like chores, and I didn't want to talk even when it was necessary. I pulled away from my friends and family, and shut myself into my room on my way to a world of deppression and loneliness. I started having diffuculty comprehending everything. If someone asked something to me, even when I tried to listen to them, I wouldn't understand anything. I could hear the words, but  I couldn't attach any meaning to any of them. I always had this blank state of mind. I did not think unless I actively forced myself to, and it felt as if all my emotions were completely suppressed, almost silenced. 

As time went by, I started having difficulties with school.(Late mid, early high school)That tends to happen when you don't talk to anyone for years, especially at that age. I was almost always completely silent, had no sleep or eating routine, and looked so drained that my teachers would always ask me if I was a drug addict or not. Of course, after you start to lose your comprehension of the world, and talk very little, you make it easy for the other kids to bully you. And I got bullied a lot. When the first year of high school came by, I didn't want to go to school anymore. I ditched school all the time, and strongly refused any assistance from any of my teachers. The school tolerated me because some of my grades were the best in school, and to them, my silent attitude meant that I was reversed and respectful. 

It did not turn out to be a phase, as everyone thought it would be. I just sort of mastered it. In time, my loneliness turned into solitude, and deppression into peace, and I found ways to function moderately well in society. I'm 25 now, but the blank page is still there, and likely always will be. The issue with comprehension is also still there, unless I show some effort to prevent it when necessary.",13Nov2019,1
145,"Apologies in advance for the longish post. 

I’ve dealt with depression/anxiety for the majority of my life, and as you all know, it’s so hard and sometimes just getting up is hard. 

Currently in the best relationship of my life with the most amazing guy ever. He’s the real deal, he’s def “the one”.  He knows I deal with these mental health issues and never ran away, but instead has decided to love me through it. 

However, for the last few weeks I’ve been super depressed and anxious about everything and just been really insecure.  We opened up our r/ship (sexually not emotionally) and while neither one of us has played, it’s impacted my mental a lot since I know he’s obviously talking to other women. I just feel super insecure. I know he’s crazy about me and would never leave me, but I have a hard time reconciling my emotions. 

I want to close the relationship, but also want him to experience it at least once before closing it up, as I think it’s unfair to pull back now. 

Lately I just feel awful every day and don’t know how to pull myself out of the depths of my depression and anxiety. And I’m so afraid of how this will impact our relationship if I’m not a better version of myself.

Don’t push people out. Don’t barricade yourself away. It’s cliche to say but you’re not alone. You’re not alone until you make it that way. 
One of my closest friends in college has decided that any help that was being offered to her for her own sake was unwelcome and unwanted. And as a result she’s refused to talk to me, avoids me at home, doesn’t leave her room (even to eat and she locks it so no one can come in) and broken all forms of communication except for (hopefully) my phone number. As of right now I haven’t seen her in 4 days.
Going through any mental health crisis no matter big or small, you shouldn’t feel that you’re alone or refuse help that anyone gives you. But you have to realize friends are your support, not youre solution. Friends are there for you because they genuinely care. Everything we do is for a reason. And if we think that you need help from someone who is more knowledgeable, someone who can help you in ways we can’t, please respect this because it’s us saying we want to help and it’s hard to tell someone that we don’t know how to help you other than referring you to someone new. We’re here for you, to support you and help you grow stronger and listen where we can. But when we advise you, tell you, beg you, to get help in ways we can’t offer to you, please listen like we do for you and take your health as seriously as we do.

147,"Ya so basically
A friend made me realize that my personality was the reason people didn't want to be around me, and since this summer I've been trying to change that. My high school social life has been a disaster, but I want to change myself until college.
I first managed to get rid of victimising myself &amp; drowning myself in self pity. I realised that people don't give a fuck about my suffering. They all have their own problems, so there's no need for me to shove my sorrows down their throats. Also, the world doesn't revolve around me. That was pretty easy.
Secondly, I started thinking twice (or more) before I speak. I am an impulsive person, so I used to say or do pretty cringy things before that. I shut up more now, think about whether what I'm going to say next is contributing in any way to the conversation, if it helps people perceive me better and so on. I still have outbreaks, but they are getting fewer and fewer.
I'm also trying to give off a positive vibe. Smile more, compliment friends, be kind.
All the things mentioned before went fine. I'm glad I did those things. But here comes the tough part... you know, I'm a weirdo. And I want to become a normal person. I want to be like the other girls, feminine, reserved, calm, confident, mature, blah blah. Maybe even superficial. Because this is what guys are attracted to haha. And I want to be loved.
But the fact that I have to get rid of that weird kid inside of me, kill him, or hide him behind some mask, it's tearing me apart. I feel so miserable. So bad. I've spent most of my life believing that I am worthy of love just the way I am, that I should be myself and other bullshit, and now I realise that was wrong. Because no dude wants to be around a weird, occasionally hyperactive, childish girl. Oopsie.
Most girls in my class have boyfriends. And friends to party with. I don't. And they are all so unlike me. Just nice and feminine. I want to be like that too, but also work on my other hobbies &amp; passions and develop myself (playing the guitar, art, going to metal gigs, reading, photography etc etc)
But I feel truly miserable because the 'true me' was unworthy of love. I just want to change, to become like the rest of the world, a bloody normal girl that leaves either no impression or a good impression (unlike now haha), but I don't have the power to do it. I don't have the power to do anything. I just feel sad and lay in bed most of the time.

158,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

I’m here to vent about my complicated relationship with my psychiatrist. For context I am 25, and I believe he is 35 years old. He is technically a physician’s assistant, but he prescribes me medication and is the only medical staff that I interact with at the clinic.

I had initially gone into the clinic 1.5 years ago to address my anxiety disorder and ADHD. I had chosen this particular PA because of his outstanding reviews online and close proximity; however, when the nurse introduced us, I was surprised by how handsome and young he was and immediately started to have a panic attack. I tried to keep it lowkey, but as he was doing the standard questioning, I could feel my face getting flushed and I could hear my voice shaking. It was very embarrassing. Also, he had to shake my gross sweaty hand as I was leaving. 

Fast forward a couple sessions, and we’ve found the perfect combination of medications to help me feel balanced. I can honestly say I feel better than I ever have, and because of one of my prescription’s schedule 2 classification, I have to go in for an appointment every month. For the past year or so, my medication has been so reliable that our appointments have gotten very casual. Unlike our previous appointments, we now talk about our personal lives and topics that we find interesting. It is at this point that I started to sense that he is interested in me.

Now that I’ve covered the background, I’ll get to the weird stuff. A year ago, I ran into this PA at a fancy cocktail bar in my neighborhood. He got up and left very soon after he saw me, but at our next appointment he brought up the encounter. At one point, he asked me what kind of alcohol I like to drink, and it came up that I don’t like tequila. Well, apparently, he is a tequila fanatic, and told me that if he ever runs into me at a bar again, he will buy me a shot of his favorite expensive tequila so he can change my mind. Not terrible, but vaguely inappropriate. Recognizing this, I started scheduling my monthly appointments at the same clinic, but with different PAs. This only lasted about 3 months, as I didn’t have good experiences during these appointments. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 sessions ago, I mentioned that I was experiencing heightened anxiety, and that my antidepressants weren’t working as effectively anymore. When he questioned why I was so stressed out, I disclosed that work had been tough, I’d gotten into a car accident, and that I had an ex-boyfriend who was trying to reconnect. This ex-boyfriend and I broke up due to long-distance issues. I was absolutely in love with him, but when I had to relocate for work, we decided to end things. I told my PA that my ex reached out and said he wanted to visit me and potentially work things out— that he would maybe relocate in order to make the relationship work. And the PA’s response was “what’s the point? You guys broke up for a reason. I’d advise against it”.

So my ex ended up visiting and it was nice, but we decided it’d be best to stay platonic. My PA also adjusted my medication very promptly and I regained control of my anxiety.

Today was my most recent appointment, and the weirdest by far. I don’t feel good or bad, just weird. This session also lasted a very long time—almost 50 minutes. Usually our sessions are 30ish minutes, but I think that they’re actually only supposed to be 15 as they’re check-ins? I could be wrong. This has never been clarified. I just get up and leave when I feel like it. Anyway, he asked about my ex again despite me telling him that we decided to remain friends during a previous session, and then we spent about 40 minutes talking about politics. I joked that I use a dating app as a tool to campaign for a candidate that I like, and he was like “hm I wonder why I never saw you on there. I’m also on that app”. He then showed me a picture of his friend who is also a PA, and asked if I was interested. I asked if it’d be weird setting up his friend with one of his patients, and he was like “I wouldn’t introduce you as my patient. I’d say I know someone very pretty and very smart.” And at that point I politely declined and left. 

So now I’m at work feeling confused. I’m attracted to him, but I also know it’s wrong.",13Nov2019,1
159,"Hi. Not really sure how to start this, and I'm probably going to delete this later. I'm 18 and from New York state. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2013-ish, and was hospitalized for a week and a half in 2014. I was on Zoloft and Seroquil for quite awhile, but I was weaned off of them once I started to manage my symptoms with therapy and healthy coping skills. I went to weekly therapy for probably a year and a half after I was hospitalized, and as far as most people in my life are concerned, got ""better."" I was doing really well up until June of this year- I'm not really sure what happened, but it's been downhill since then. I'm trying not to give too many details for the sake of brevity, but I just genuinely need some advice and second opinions right now.

On top of my mental health issues, I also have chronic migraines, PCOS, and a condition called MALS, which manifests in GI issues and pain in my right side. Both of these are being treated right now. I also have something going on with my Thyroid (undiagnosed at the moment) that probably isn't helping.

Right now, my depression has gotten bad enough that I can barely get out of bed, most days. Even though Theatre is usually what keeps my energy up and keeps me happy, I can barely enjoy it right now. I'm in three shows at once, and it's a good distraction sometimes (mostly when my energetic friends rope me into doing something) but if I'm not being distracted, even if I'm surrounded by what I love, I just feel alone. Every little thing that goes wrong will send me into a sobbing fit or panic attack because my self-esteem is so fucking fragile right now. I can barely function at work, if I even make it to work in the first place. I've genuinely been contemplating killing myself again for the first time in about a year- I'd never do it, but the thoughts are there. If I did it, I would hurt others even more than I already have, and I can't do that any more. Kind of in the ""wishing-I-was-never-born"" place right now, which is ironic, because one of the plays I'm in is 'It's a Wonderful Life.' I hear that message every single day at rehearsal, but all it fucking does is make it worse, because all my brain goes to is ""Your life hasn't touched that many others. You're not like him."" I'm trying to make time to go to therapy, if I can afford it, but even then, my therapist barely has appointment slots for me anymore and I can't hunt for a new one again. I'm trying to find a psychiatrist to get on medications again, but I don't know if that would even help, or if it would just make the fatigue and weight gain worse (I already have that from various conditions and that's all it felt like the meds did last time I was on them). I have time to take care of myself, but by time my day is over, I usually just go home and lie in bed, in my clothes, and cry until I go to sleep. 

**Point is. My coping skills are minimal at best, I'm so busy that I barely have time to get in to see a therapist or psychiatrist, I fall apart at the slightest thing that goes wrong, I'm so unstable I can barely take care of myself. I don't know what to do. I can't really drop out of any shows I'm in to make time, the hints of peace and distraction I can find in those (not nearly as much as usual) are the only reason I haven't just given up. Part of me thinks hospitalization might be the best idea, but I don't know if I'm ""bad enough"" for that to be an option, and if I was, I would have to check myself in, I would probably get fired from my job for missing a week straight, possibly more, and quite possibly get kicked out of the shows that I'm in because of it. I don't know if I'd be able to hold myself together if I was in therapy only once a week, it doesn't feel like enough. I feel like hospitalization, a week of just trying to get my mental health back on track, would be the best answer, but I'm so afraid of losing all of the opportunities I've worked for because of it. But then again, I can barely enjoy what I have right now.**

I'm sorry if this is a lot. I have virtually no one I can talk to about this, every person who's willing to listen, there's a reason I don't feel like I can talk to them. Some of them just stopped responding altogether, or I heard them calling me a burden behind my back, and I don't want to bother them more. I'm an actor. I'm great at hiding what I'm feeling, I'm used to bottling my emotions up, but I can't do this anymore. I feel so fucking alone in this, and lost, and I feel like I've worked so hard to get myself all of these opportunities, but now I'm stuck with my own thoughts and no time to try and take care of it. I don't know what to do. If anyone got to read this thing, I'm sorry it's all over the place, and so long, and barely said anything useful, can you just let me know?

So I am 15 years of age. I am an extremely deep thinker and have been since I was 8. Back when I was 11 I started meditation (I was a woke ass kid lmao). I started meditation to help myself lucid dream. So I became very aware of everything. Peoples patterns was something I paid attention to, aswell as learning how things worked instead of just accepting that it exists. I can almost predict people and how the react to a situation. Along with this hyper awareness came a feeling that forced me to remember that I am conscious, and like hyper aware of my consciousness almost like I am viewing it from a 3rd person view. It happens at least 3 times a day and up to 10 on bad days.

I shared this in the advice subreddit and one of the two replies I got was ""disgusting"". I'm hoping here I'll find more compassion...

I'm a female, 29 years old. When I was four, two huge events happened in my life: my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer, and my younger sister was born. Within maybe 6 months I developed an intense sibling rivalry, the reasoning behind which I cannot remember, but needless to say I started to become violent with my baby sister, trying to hit and push her. One day I admitted that I wasn't sure if I would be able to control myself from taking her and throwing her off the upstairs balcony (I have no memory of this but my aunt told me about it). As a result my parents put me in a psychiatric hospital for a while when I was five (I don't remember the time frame but I'm guessing it was maybe a week), and I was absolutely terrified. I thought they were abandoning me and trying their life out without me to see if it was better. I believe I stopped the violent behavior towards my sister after that, probably out of fear of being hospitalized again, but the trauma from that hospitalization stayed with me, and I think I decided I needed to bottle things up inside me and that apparently I was a bad child, a bad person.

My mom's cancer got worse, metastasized, spread throughout her body and into her brain. Thirteen months after her diagnosis, she died, just a few weeks after I turned six. I remember many hospital visits, seeing my mom barely understanding who anyone was or where she was, watching her physical and mental state degrade. One day at home her hair started falling out in clumps from the chemo and she asked me to help her remove her head hair. I said yes, and did it with her, but the whole time I also felt somewhere deep inside that this was scary and upsetting, but it was my mom, and she was asking me to do something (She had a traumatic brain injury before I was born and it affected her reasoning, I believe that is the only reason she would have done such a thing), so I did it. My aunt also told me about a time where my mom, aunt, dad, myself, and doctors were in a hospital and my mom was talking to me about her cancer and the chemo and how it would affect her and I went and hid under a chair and covered my ears and told everyone in the room I wouldn't come out until we stopped talking about it.

Losing my mom was devastating, obviously. I remember the moment my dad told me she died, especially vividly remember the numbness, emptiness, and bit of dissociation that spread over me, a little six-year-old girl, once I heard the news, as well as at her funeral. I did know deep down that she had a high chance of dying because of the cancer, but it was still soul-shattering when it happened. I felt extremely alone, permanently different from all of my peers and pretty much anyone I'd ever met, and just... scared. Scared and alone. My dad was going through his grief and he's never been cold or unloving but I think he just didn't know how to process it all either, and I feel like I sort of pushed most of the grief processing aside.

Here's the part that will be upsetting to people, but I want to be honest as possible and give details, so proceed with caution if you are sensitive.

At about seven years old I started pulling the wings off of small skipper butterflies I would catch in my backyard. I then started pulling their heads off. I would watch and be fascinated by it. I think I was fascinated by death, trying to understand it. It made me feel gross and very bad, but also gave me some sort of release and part of me was just curious about what would happen. Then I sadly moved on to the litter of kittens that one of our cats just had. I would pick the maybe week-old kittens up and hold them a few feet in the air and then drop them onto the carpet. I did it repeatedly until one of them slowly died over days because of internal injuries. I felt HORRIBLE when it died. I admitted to my dad, sobbing, that I did it and it was my fault the kitten died. I know I got put into some sort of therapy for this, but obviously it did not help, because I continued doing this for another couple of years. There was apparently a rabbit that I killed that I don't remember hurting at all (my aunt told me about it many years later), there was also another older kitten I suffocated by cutting a slit in small rubber ball then putting the ball over the kitten's head, leaving it there for minutes watching the kitten squirm and trying to get it off, then pulling the ball off and seeing the kitten out of breath and panting. I know that kitten died but I can't remember what the exact cause was. Finally, this is different but also I feel related so I will include it: my dad made friends with a couple of parents down the street and their kids and myself would have play dates. One of their kids was a three-year-old girl, and one day when I was about 9 years old, the urge came over me to just tell her that her mother had died. No-one else heard me say this to her. She got scared and upset and denied it and I just told her ""yes, it's true, she died"". I remember some sort of feeling of satisfaction knowing she was hurting the way I was hurting. I feel like shit for that, too, obviously.

At the same time I was doing this, I was also genuinely (and still am) a huge animal-lover. I always have loved animals. I loved our multiple cats and dog we had at the time, I had ""my own"" cat when I was nine, I was crazy about cuddling with her every day after school and treated her like she was my baby. I was a good kid in school, followed rules, never wanted to get in trouble, never really ever got in trouble (not until 8th grade and that was because of poor grades and absences because of depression). I've always thought of myself as highly sensitive, caring, and compassionate. By the time I was a teenager the self-disgust I had was through the roof and much of it focused on what I did to those animals and I guess also what I said to that girl. I also was assaulted by the 40-something brother of our live-in housekeeper/babysitter (we had to get one after my mom died so my dad could continue to work) one day when I was about eight. He cornered me against a wall and forced me to kiss him on the lips. He didn't physically hurt me, but I told him no, I didn't want to, and he kept insisting and held his arms on either side of me, making me feel like I was trapped. Eventually I let him because I felt it was the only way to get out. He never did anything else after that that I can remember.

So, I'm 29 now, have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety (diagnosed at 13), and borderline personality disorder (diagnosed this year). I have made some improvements in living with these conditions but sometimes the self-hatred really kicks in and those things I did as a child are always one of the main things my brain pulverizes me over. Please understand I would NEVER, EVER hurt any animal or person. I love helping animals and helping people. I adore my pets and turn into complete baby-talking nonsense whenever I interact with an animal like a cat, dog, bird, heck even snakes and lizards! I went to school for wildlife conservation and management and am looking for work with animals.

I can't shake the thought that I'm somehow evil or bad because of what I did, even if I wouldn't do it anymore. I can't shake the thought that everyone in the world will think I'm a monster if they knew what I did. I can't seem to get it to sink in that I was a little girl that was traumatized, lost, terrified, and felt alone from a very early age and didn't know how to cope or find help or manage my emotions. So, if you've read this and if anyone has any idea how to get myself to forgive myself and understand myself, I'd love to hear it. Or maybe I actually am a monster and shouldn't be forgiven at all? I don't know anymore.

Long story short- I have had an eating disorder since age of 11 from emotional eating/obesity to starving/anorexia to yo-yo dieting and now compulsive eating.
I don't like this because I have to always buy new clothes for my fluctuating weight, social embarrassment=social isolation and its an emotional rollercoaster for my self-esteem. 
I rlly want to focus on other aspect of my life but I can't because for me my body and mind are connected so If I don't look good then I don't feel/think good. :((
The problem is I suffer from this weird urge where it randomly pops up and I know I am NOT hungry like I do the apple test and I know I don't need food. BUT, this urge it is like a SNEEZE or a COUGH or like needing to POOP.
The more I hold it back the worse it gets like I get this pressure in my brain and this weird urgency in my chest. 
I have TRIED everything read ""brain over binge"", ""rational recovery"", changing diets, cutting out carbs, cutting out sugar, exercise, distraction, mindfullnes, I even tried every other day fasting= IT does not work.
I feel like the problem is not with food as much as it is with this freaky URGE. like I can literally overeat on chickpeas and eggs :/
I can't white knuckle it because its like a sneeze or needing to poop it always wins :(((

I've tried a bunch of different things from him, I'm on an antidepressant that helps a bit but we haven't found anything that works for my anxiety. My anxiety is considerable and I have Asperger's so these things really impact my day-to-day functioning.

Last time I saw him, he explained about Risperidone, saying that it's an anti-psychotic but at low doses it can  be used for anxiety and there's some evidence it's useful for high-functioning autism. I'm pretty desperate and trust his opinion, he's highly qualified (and expensive...) 

Well, I took one dose (0.5mg, the lowest possible dose is 0.25mg, the highest (for psychosis) is *8mg*) and immediately began to disassociate and feel very, VERY strange. I've only ever had about 3 panic attacks, the first time it happened I had taken edibles, at a stupidly high dose. This very similar, which made me panic more. Luckily I was with my mother, we spoke for a bit, the attack only lasted for about half an hour, but I was shaking and couldn't stand up.

Then I got very restless and couldn't stop talking, I got angry that I'd been given this thing, and I felt embarrassed. Things still felt unreal. I went to bed, I had trouble breathing, my nose was blocked, I kept jolting awake because I would stop breathing. My limbs and jaw got spasms. When I eventually fell asleep I dreamt vividly throughout the entire night. At one point I woke up to go to the bathroom, when I stood up I felt as if I had drunk about 8 pints of beer, it was this incredibly intense dizziness. 

The next day I was exhausted, I woke up at 8am and went back to bed at 11am and slept another 5 hours. 

I had a little more energy the day after... But the panic hadn't completely gone. I went to the supermarket across the road from my house, and became super paranoid, I still felt high. The panic creeped in, it didn't turn into a panic attack but it was very unnerving and I felt dizzy.

The next day I had to go back to uni/college. I went to an evening seminar with a friend, same thing, he said my face turned white as a sheet and he thought I was about to run out the door. Luckily it passed, but the disassociation was so unpleasant.  

I took this thing on Friday, it's now Wednesday and I still feel the underlying panic. I just really don't feel well. I'm scared, I'm having dangerous thoughts again (I am very far from acting on them, don't worry), which had actually subsided for about 6 months thanks to the other medication I'm on. I keep getting adrenaline rushes and palpitations. My heart just always feels like it's floating in my chest, I can't really explain it, things don't feel real.

I emailed my psychiatrist and he just said he was sorry to hear it, that this was very unusual and we'll discuss at the next appointment. I feel so let down. He gave me this knowing that:

1) I'm very sensitive to medication
2) I'm very debilitated by fatigue (this medication has a big sedative effect)
3) I have previously suffered from an eating disorder and this medication causes massive weight-gain

Last December I left my job. I was there almost a decade, passed over for promotion in favour of newer hires, then “promoted” but never given a pay rise...

So I decided to make a go of being self-employed. It’s been rough — my earnings have halved but my work has doubled, things haven’t really taken off how I hoped.

I haven’t really made a proper go of starting a business. I attended workshops and seminars, but never really followed up on all the good advice. I’ve just muddled through, freelancing here and there.

I’m constantly anxious about money and deny myself little things I used to buy — things which used to make me happy, like beers or lunch.

All this often puts me in very black moods, when I just stare into the middle distance, loathing myself. Sometimes I lash out and smash things. All I can see is failure, hopelessness and wasted potential. 

I don’t know if it’s anxiety, depression (I was diagnosed with GAD)... the word that comes to mind is despair. When I find myself in these moods there is no talking me out of it. I know I could decide to shrug it off, find something to laugh about. But in that moment, I just don’t want to.

It’s odd — I’m so sad, angry and ashamed, but I choose to go on stewing in that rather than bucking up or seeking to reframe or gain perspective. In that moment, it somehow doesn’t seem appropriate to try and be happy. I’ve screwed up, this is what I deserve to feel like. I haven’t earned happiness.

I suppose there’s also a twisted sort of comfort in feeling something that is becoming more and more familiar to me. I don’t want to be this way, but I don’t feel worthy of anything better. It seems self-destructive and it’s hard on my wife too, so I want to get better for her.

For some context: I live in Poland and i'm 16yo boy so sorry for any typos.


When i was kid i was really active and extroverted. I was in this soccer club that i liked and my classmates were great. I was kind of a leader of a group in class. The class wasnt devided in any sense, just we made this group to hang out after school. In this group i had my best friend. Lets call him Bob. He was half-arabic, little chuby and tall guy. We spent countless hours playing xbox 360, lol, soccer etc. There came time of vacations. It was Polish 6th grade (we were 12 at this time) and we went to swimming/lifeguarding camp. Since he was half-arabic he started going through puberty ealier and at the camp it exploded. We ended our friendship. After this our group fell apart and i felt lonely for the first time. I was always with people i knew and liked, but then i was alone. It sound like i was an entitled kid but i was far from that. I was kind to everyone and i made friends fast and easy. After the breakup i couldnt get up. I mean i gained 20 pounds of weight. Fortunatly in the 1st class of middle school (we were 13) i started playing with one of my friends from our little group. We became good friends but what ive noticed was that everyone i was best friends with was identical or very similar to me. Bob was extroverted and 'groupable' guy like me and after we went our ways and when i hit my rock bottom i met let call him Adam. Adam was introverted kid with a huge gaming addiction. There was a thing that kind of devided us. I was ashamed of everything i did and i hated myself but he didnt. I couldnt understand it and i still kinda cant. We were identical but he didnt hate himself. Because of that diffrience our friendship ended a year later. It was a great time but now im  alone 16yo with huge self esteem problems that hates himself. 

To update on my 'friends':
Bob started hanging out with older kids and started drinking very early.

Adam found a girlfriend and he has many friends and hes great even though he is an introvert.

Now here I am doing it and I'm still not happy, I know I'll never be happy all the time, no one is, but nothing hits those dopamine receptors or whatever anymore, not accomplishments, not love, not sex, or drugs or food or exercise. I am beginning to think I didnt learn how to enjoy things when i was supposed to and now i dont know how to look at a positive situation and honestly tell myself: this is good.",13Nov2019,1

202,"Something was confirmed for me last night. Something I always doubted myself happened to me when I was younger. Something I’ve repressed for 24 years. It happened when I was 4, I’m 28 now. 

Last night I was laughing. Today I feel empty. I feel betrayed. I feel scared. I’ve been really trying to cater to my inner child today.  My friend came over for a bit. We went and got food because my body needed the nourishment. But right after she left, I felt empty again.",13Nov2019,1
203,"

I’ve been on Zoloft (and Lamictal) for 11 years, with one break where I was on cymbalta for 4 months to see if my libido might magically reappear. I tried to get off the cymbalta back then (suuuuper slowly) because I thought I was stable enough to not be on an anti-depressant but the withdrawal symptoms were SO BAD (basically mimicked a depressive episode) that I went right back on the Zoloft.
Cut to now, three years later, I felt again like I might be able to do ok without the Zoloft (I also wondered if it was blunting my capacity for joy). I decided to wean off extremely slowly. I went from 125mg and was able to get to 62.5 ok but when I tried taking 50mg a day by mind COULD NOT handle it. ridiculous irritability, brain fog, difficulty concentrating. It was so crazy that at 62.5 it was fine but then BAM! my body was not ok with just 50.
I went back up to 75mg which is what I’ve been taking the past two weeks but I think that as the medicine is starting to fully leave my body, I’m starting to really struggle. I’ve been really irritable for the past 5 days and am now feeling kind of depressed.... I am 90% positive that what I’m experiencing is part of the SSRI withdrawal process. It’s just SO HARD and feels so miserable. I know I could just go back up on my dose but part of me wonders what would happen if I just stuck it out? Would these awful feelings resolve?
Anyone else have lottttts of trouble getting off of an SSRI even while weaning super slowly?",13Nov2019,1

205,"I (24) have social anxiety and chronic depression and it's been a rollercoaster for the last two years. I've had this mental issues for as much as I can remember, but now I know I can deal with them in a much healthier way. A couple of months ago, I finally got a scholarship to attend therapy and that encouraged my father to also send my sister (15) to therapy.

The thing is, it seems that she has some kind of anxiety that makes it really difficult for her to express her feelings. A mixed of ""I don't care"" and ""I don't know what to feel"". We've always had this special bond which we didn't  need to express through words, I pulled her leg for a while by being way too caramelous and then we usually talked about Korean bands that she loves.

Now I don't know what to do. I was always so conscious about my mental health that I didn't realise before that she had such problem. Have any of you gone through this with a close relative or has a similar  mental issue as my sister that can give me advice or cheer me up? I feel really under the weather right now. 

Today is her birthday but I'll see her next Saturday. I think I'll make her a gift of some kind.",13Nov2019,1
206,"I have a dependent personality disorder and with it comes this horrible need to jump from one relationship to the next within hours of a breakup. I’ve talked about it in therapy but I’m still not able to resist this need yet. My whole life whenever I got anxious I would starve myself so I’ve always been around 120ish but now that I’ve recently gotten on a whole new cocktail of medication for my OCD and panic disorder I’ve been able to eat. But because if this I’ve gained weight and now 189. That’s not only causing me to be very insecure but now needy about my insecurities. Talked to an amazing guy on PoF for a few days and this guy just told me that me commenting on my weight was a problem for him because he likes “confident girls” My response was “Alright, well. I’m sorry MY insecurities about MYSELF are a problem for YOU.” 
But I get where he’s coming from. I’m sure it’s really annoying. Unfortunately now, I’m completely pushing him away. Like those side salty comments. 
“Are you still excited for our date on Saturday!” -Him
“Other then having 2 days to become a “confident girl” ? Yeah! woo!” -Me
Anyone know how to combat this bullshit? I’m even annoyed with myself.",13Nov2019,1
207,"Currently, I sleep at 9.30pm and wake up at 6am. I’d wake up at 4am and do some trading till 4.30am - 5am and go back to sleep. Will this have any impact on my mental health?",13Nov2019,1
208,I can't get any help from anyone unless I'm trying to actively kill myself. It can't be just enough that even though I don't wanna kill myself I've lost the will to live and enjoy life. In that case I have to wait until its convenient for them to see me. Really does a good job at letting me know that I or my problems don't matter. It's great how no one cares until it's too late.,13Nov2019,1
209,"My family bitches at me non-stop every single day. They always gotta find something to bitch and moan about. My mom is essentially a parasite who leeches off my disability money whilst having no job herself and yet has the audacity to bitch at me when I ask her for things. Want to a gym membership? No. Want to get a job? No. Want to get a car? No. Want to go to college? No. They’re holding me back from getting anywhere in life. My mother is the reason I failed high school. Since I had to switch schools because I got bullied out of the nearest one I had to wake up extra early just to make it to the bus to take me to a school from out of town and I fell asleep in class everyday because my mom was taking my adderall and vyvanse like the crackwhore she is. She also took my hydrocodone I got prescribed for my wisdom teeth extraction and essentially treats me like a child at 21. I hate my family enough to where I want to slowly torture them to death by flaying them alive. How the fuck am I supposed to get out of this inescapable situation? Should I just kill them all? From the looks of it, yes. Nobody else in my family evidently gives enough of a shit to extend the helping hand to me to let me move in with them neither do I have any friends. The only option for me is either life in prison or on the streets. I have no outlook in life nor do I have any future.",13Nov2019,1
210,11-14-2019 is my 22nd birthday. For weeks I have been planning to kill myself that day. It will be a great chance to visit parents and grab pills and alcohol. Today is my last day of being 21 and maybe my last full day alive. It's a scary thought and I feel so guilty.,13Nov2019,1
211,"So flash back to my last relationship which was my first relationship ever which was july 2018 -january 2019. Anyway i’m just gonna give y’all a little background so in the begging of our relationship i was so happy, iwas GLOWING. And then towards like the end of november i began having. feelings of hopelessness, depression, loneliness, i started to pop pills and i was just a whole ass wreck, i would cry litterlay every night and call my boyfriend (now ex) and just spill all my feelings out to him and he tried to help me feel better but that never really helped. Ok anyway begging of january comes around and he breaks up with me. I have never been through a breakup before so it was so hard for me i became even more depressed and i cried even more than i did and this went on for like 2 months. And after those 2 months went by i think it was march i was so happy and finally back to my old self. Anyway flash forward to SUMMER 2019, oh god last summer was really fun at the begging until july 4 came around, this night i had a absolute break i think it was from holding all my emotions in and not talking to anyone about them. Anyways i went bat shit crazy and i was saying all types of nonsense and then my mom sent me to a mental hospital and i was in there for about a week. Anyway ever since then i have not been the same, i seclude my self now and i don’t really talk to that many people, i’m more socially awkward now too, the list could go on but i don’t feel like typing it all out. Anyways moral of the fricken story i just want to be happy again, not be tired 24/7, and feel again, and i really just want
to be back to my old energetic social butterfly self again. I used to feel like light now i just feel like darknesss, can anyone please give me tips on life?",13Nov2019,1
212,"I’ve been pretty down for the last year or so but relationship issues and, what appears to be, an inevitable break up with my girlfriend has sent me over the edge. For a while I’ve been trying to work up the courage to leave the relationship but now that it is over (her decision) I feel empty, lost, alone and have had tempting thoughts of inflicting harm to myself again. I know the relationship was unhealthy but my world revolved around her and now she’s gone I feel incomplete and everything reminds me of what I had. I beat myself up for things that probably aren’t my fault and have developed anxiety and depression through the course of the relationship. We were together for 2 years. I get sudden bursts of motivation, usually lasting a few seconds, to pick myself up and follow my dreams then I sink into this void and tell myself I’ll never be the same and that there is no point. Due to the relationship I have pushed all of my friends away to the point where I don’t know who my friends are anymore. I have nobody to talk to and the longer I wait to tell somebody about my pain, the heavier the weight gets and the harder it feels to pull myself back together. I’ve been disregarding my own mental heath due to my (ex) girlfriends own mental heath issues. I’ve always took it on the chin and said I’m fine so not to trouble anybody else but I fear that if I carry on any longer I’ll explode. I have noticed my increase in anger and quite often over meaningless ordeals. I guess what I’m after is somebody to talk to about this. Maybe someone has gone through a similar thing. Apologies for the long post",13Nov2019,1
213,"I have to tell my friends often i'm okay, i'm fine but they don't believe me. I understand its a common thing to say when you aren't but I don't know what else to do. Proving isn't the best idea, they'll always find something i'm doing wrong- and I have a few bad habits but that doesn't automatically mean I have a mental condition. My best friend thinks I have anxiety and depression, possibly a mild eating disorder, and my boyfriend won't say what he thinks but he doesn't believe i'm okay no matter what I say. I don't know what to do and it's really stressing me out because I don't want them to be worried about me since they're both dealing with some stuff but instead pay attention to what's up with me.",13Nov2019,1
214,"it’s have been years that I attended to kill myself, last time was like 10 years ago and I promised myself to not do it again.
Last month i also dedicated to go to therapy because i wanted to get better and the Therapist diagnostic was CPTSD and dissociative disorder. 
She started to help me with some relaxation techniques when i have panic attacks and started EMDR too.
These days are a roller coaster. My parents aren’t supportive plus they are forcing me to do others things that I don’t want.
We had a huge argument and i lose it and tried to kill myself with knife but failed because my mom stopped me got just a little bit injured.
My dad said i am a drama queen and a weak person.
I really wanted just die today so I didn’t had to listen anything from anyone.
I am thinking to retry tomorrow with more planning.",13Nov2019,1
