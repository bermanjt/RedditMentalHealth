0,"I started taking abilify (or aripiprazole) about a month ago. While the initial side effects were daunting, I have been doing much better. For the first time in years I haven't considered killing myself every day. So, yay!

My question is for anyone else who is or has taken this before. It feels like I don't enjoy things as much anymore. Sure, I have fun, I smile, I'm not in a bad mood, but I don't get that happiness high anymore. Model building is meh, video games don't give me a sense of pride and accomplishment, everything is just... *okay*. Nothing is great anymore. 

Is this a normal part of this medication? Should I be concerned? I don't have a follow up appointment for 3 months, otherwise I would just ask my provider.",05Nov2019,1
1,"Hi there, I just recently found out I have mild bipolar II. There's a part of me that's known for years but I'm grappling with it still. I feel like it's not real, that I'm not really that sick, people have told me ""I've known people who are bipolar - you're not like them"" And I'm really good at hiding how bad my lows are because I've always had to, and I just disappear from my loved ones when I'm on a high because there's so much I want to do. My manic episodes only last a day or two so it's not as dramatic for my family and friends to watch I guess. I just need to vent this off. I'm having a hard time accepting it and others are making me feel like it's all in my head.",05Nov2019,1

If a piece of fruit is bruised or has a mark I won't touch that either. I refuse to eat chicken or turkey cooked by anyone else than my dad, and even that is rare.

I know that no one here is a doctor, I'm not asking for a diagnosis via reddit, I just wanna know what you all think, if its worth went to a doctor, have a diagnosis and treat it, or should I live with this.

6,"I(20f) was diagnosed with depression when I was 15 years old. It has come and gone but a year ago when I was studying in South Korea it came back.

I decided to go back home to Sweden to rest since it was probably stress that triggered it. I also got medical help and started taking my medicine again. But since I had decided to start studying in a different city in half a year, I felt it was unnecessary to get therapy. But things were still good. 

Fast forward to now and shit has hit the fan. 2 and a half months of me taking my own responsibility and it feels like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. But not like I've experienced before I'm not sad or apathetic, I don't want to kill myself I just want to be able to sleep and concentrate. To function like a normal human.

instead... 

my mind went into instant planning mode, which upset her. Instead of asking things like ""Are you ok?"" I asked things like ""When are we planning the funeral?"" ""Does his children know?"" ""Who identified the body?""

8,"I'm not exactly sure how I should start this post, so I'll just tell it from beginning to end. For the past few months, I have been feeling pretty down. I believe that this has come from breaking up with an ex who I was dating for over a year. We were really close, but this happened pretty suddenly. I do admit that I could have coped with it better, as I turned to self medication with cannabis in order to get my thoughts off the event.

Recently though, the sadness has gone away and has been replaced with an emptiness instead. It feels as though something is missing in my life, and I don't know how to cope with this and make it go away. I stopped smoking as much cannabis about 2 weeks ago, and this made me feel more present with life, but I still have this feeling that nothing matters, and it feels like I just don't care that my actions have consequences (such as not completing schoolwork, staying up as late as 6 am and then sleeping instead of going to school, letting my grades drop).

I know that becoming normal again will be a process, but I want to put in the work to do so. What is the first step that I should take? Should I see a therapist?",05Nov2019,1

Hi, sorry if this post seems too long, rushed or nonsensical or whatever, I'm not gonna write a TL;DR because I feel that if I summarise it in a sentence it won't seem important (to be honest I can't even tell if it is important or not anymore) anyway here goes.

Hi, I am a 22 year old male, I live in the United Kingdom and I've been on a downward spiral for years now.

The reason I'm writing this post is that I have these very rare intermittent moments of clarity where I actually feel positive for once and feel an urge to make a change (these are extremely rare) and I need to jot it down before I sink back into the void where nothing matters and I just sit here like a fucking useless piece of shit.

I'm not really good at putting my problems in writing especially when I'm thinking about it directly, I think my brain puts up a wall to stop me from seeking help at all costs because I think I ""need to be better than that"" or to ""be a man"" or as a result of my apparent need to ruin every single aspect of my life. Anyway the point is that I literally can't bring myself to do anything positive at all, you may think that sounds ridiculous but every single time I put in a phone number or write a referral form the next chance I get I thwart it all and retreat back into my cave of bullshit. Right now I have the clarity to know that the real me is how I feel when I have this clarity and the fake me is the one who's too fucking lazy to do anything.

I started cutting at age 13 and I haven't stopped at all since, when I turned 18 it got a lot worse due to an extremely messy break up you've heard it all before blah blah blah, I've never felt a need to stop, I don't have a high opinion of myself when it comes to my body or who I am.

I actively pushed all of my friends away in 2015 irreversably, I said things I didn't mean to isolate myself and it worked flawlessly, but I regret it when my head's clear. I've always been a loner, I've never really had friends but that small group of four friends I had back then were the only sense of normality I've ever had in my life.

I was homeschooled, being homeschooled is a lot more rare in the UK than it is in the US (at least from where I'm standing). Lemme tell you something about being homeschooled in the UK (from my point of view), the people that I knew from that community are...let's just say they're very ""alternative"" people, by which I mean they were quite laid back people, the kind of people that use alternative medicines and name their kids some stupid bullshit, I'm being quite judgemental and I probably sound like a huge asshole but the point is I was brought up around a very abnormal setting compared to normal people that go to school, college and then university and go on to have jobs etc, I'm not normal and the need to be normal, I feel it came from this upbringing and the divide between us and ""school kids"".

My parents weren't completely innocent of this either, my dad had a very very small business he operated from my disgusting run down childhood house, he sold medicine to people who didn't want to (or couldn't) go to the doctor for \[UK has free healthcare\] my dad has some kind of medical background but I know next to nothing about it. As a child I went to my dad for medical advice because I trusted him more than I trusted doctors. As of late though I've slowly come to the conclusion that my dad doesn't know what I thought he knew and now I don't know who to trust (I wasn't vaccinated as a kid and I don't know the full reason, every time I ask my brain checks out, in one ear and out the other I need to get vaccinated soon, I know, I'm not anti vax I just can't bring myself to call the doctor and I have a lot of deep seeded distrust for vaccinations because of my parents)

At age 15, miraculously, I got into a college (high school) regardless of the fact that I had absolutely ZERO grades since you don't get grades in the lackluster homeschool groups I went to (they were basically glorified playgrounds). College was good, but of course I had to start at a low level of education, I didn't even bother to make friends because everyone seemed completely alien to me. I completed two full years and dropped out year 3 because of a bad series of medical issues and subsequent mobility issues and seemingly the aggrivation of my anxiety (and 30% attendence because of it).

At age 19 my sister moved out to persue university (me and my sister are extremely close so this was a blow for me)

And here comes one of the only times I've successfully gotten any kind of therapy at age 19, after being on a waiting list for several months and phone calls or whatever I don't remember how it happened, but I got into some one on one sessions that served as an assessment to see what help I needed.

I got put into a weekly group therapy thing where people would take it in turns each week to talk about themselves. Of course I had really bad anxiety every single time I went, without fail, I get there and wait in the waiting room, finding it really really hard to breathe, shaking and just wanting to be alone. This happened every single week, sometimes I would come late, get the go ahead to go up to the room where everyone's waiting, only to stay outside the door shaking and ghasping for air, one time it got so bad I got into the room, but I just couldn't shake the anxiety so I had to leave the room and cut the fuck outta my arm. A few minutes later one of the people from the group (this woman was so goddamn nice, she was amazing and probably the reason I didn't give up on going to that group) came out to see if I was ok, she saw my arm of course, I remember sitting there, I don't remember what was said, but she was very understanding. anyway, I didn't go back into the room and waited down the hall in a chair shaking all the time playing quietly with my little comfort ukulele. They came out to do the second part of the session which was a lot less anxiety inducing so I did that.

I finished that group therapy to the end, great experience but I don't know if it actually helped me or not.

Then me and my parents (still living with them) basically got evicted from our house and forced to move into my grandfather's house (who I was ""taking care of"" at the time), you may think that this was a good outcome, but it really wasn't. My grandfather is a known rapist, he's a clinical psychopath, he abused my grandmother, uncle and father emotionally and physically, he raped my grandmother on multiple occasions, and he feels absolutely zero positive feelings for anyone, let alone his family. The ONLY reason we're here (still living here after 3 years by the way) is because he's rich due to his stocks in British American Tobacco, 6 digits in stock value. Living here is torture for my dad and me, because I was forced to look after this cunt and so was/is my dad (I don't do it anymore, I refuse to even see him, that's why I never leave my room in the daytime) but basically no one wants to say it but it's tearing the family apart, my dad can't even see his own granddaughter (my niece) because he's too afraid to leave his dad's side, afraid of the backlash.

Anyway, fast forward to a few months later (age 20) I get into another group therapy thing which was pretty much the same as the other one but this one you had to talk about current issues and come up with a plan (on paper) to fix things which you would then follow up on the following week. Long story short, I wrote down the plan on the paper thing they gave me but I did nothing on the plan at all, and I couldn't bring myself to go back to the therapy for fear of judgement (even though they wouldn't have judged me, I just felt too ashamed to return) they called me back to offer me a thing where I could've had a thing where I go and stay with other people for a few days a week as a way to attempt to integrate myself into reality, another form of therapy, they really tried to push this thing because they believed it would've helped me, it seemed tempting, but I didn't take them up on the offer. Few months later, still supposed to be going to the group therapy, I recieved a letter talking about another apointment, the letter also mentioned in passing that they thought I had Avoidant Personality Disorder which does make sense, anyway I was called back to a one on one thing, I assumed this was to get another type of therapy, but I went there, into the room and the guy who asessed me back the previous year was telling me they had to cut ties with me because I wasn't going to the therapy, I was taking up a space someone more important could use (they didn't say that but I know that's what it was)

So I was left without help from anyone, no support network, no friends, and a hostile home situation, that's where I've been for three straight years, and all I do is sit in my trash heap of a bedroom just waiting for the next game or TV show to come out, slowly eating away at my will to live, now I've never thought I wanted to die, but I can feel myself slipping closer and closer to wanting to, does that make sense?

Back in August I thought I was on an upswing because I met a girl on tinder and she lives in the same city as I do, we met up and got together, and her father was GUESS WHO, completely against the odds her father was the very same person that assessed me in therapy years ago! What are the odds of that? Legitimately crazy odds there. Anyway that girl dumped me two weeks after we got together all because I self harm (she told me outright that was the reason) so there's that. And then I got involved (not sexually) with her best friend, hanging out with her was amazing but she went on some impulsive trip to europe two weeks after I started hanging out with her and she hasn't been back since.

I feel so empty, I don't enjoy things like I used to, I can't cry anymore, I've got anger issues, I can't trust people easy, I can't leave the house or my room, I can't go to the hairdressers, I can't call the doctor, I can't do fucking anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a recluse, a shut in, I hate almost every single part of my body, I'm gaining weight, I have a gym membership but every time I try to go I physically can't bring myself to do anything if there's even ONE other person there, I hate being seen by strangers, I have panic attacks when I leave the house, I'm quite jumpy, always on edge. Sometimes I get a lump in my throat like I'm about to cry but it comes out as a smile, but it's not a happy smile. One moment I'm happy and any small annoyance or downer I'm immediately either angry or just feeling nothing again.

I'm basically an insomniac, I don't sleep during the night, hell I barely even use my bed ever, I've only used my bed about 3 times in the past month, I sleep when I pass out in my desk chair, I stare at screens legit about 20/7 and that's not an exaggeration, I'm surprised I'm not dead yet.

I used to be able to let it all out in the form of tears, but I haven't been able to cry about anything for years now.

I need help urgently, I need it to be something I can just send a message to and an appointment's ready, if I have an appointment I think I can go to it, but I just need the appointment, I've never been diagnosed but I feel like I need a diagnosis or diagnoses, I need to know what's wrong with me to even begin to improve but I'm SICK AND TIRED OF MYSELF AND I NEED TO TRICK MYSELF INTO GETTING HELP, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN TOMORROW COMES I'LL JUST RETURN TO THE FUCKING VOID LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

13,"(Mental Health Professionals ONLY)

This is very long but the info is necessary. 

I’ve been doing this thing that I just recently found out was referred to as “stimming”.  I don’t know what it is, but my last psychiatrist was looking into a possible ASD diagnosis before I grew above the age for them to continue working with me (was 16 when I started going there and it was pediatric). My last therapist was very new to the practice and I believe (along with my family) wrongfully diagnosed me. Things didn’t ever add up with her assumptions of my mental health but when I said otherwise, she would insist on putting a narrative in my head. 

I’m 100% not asking for a diagnosis. Just possibilities so I can rest easy until I can afford the cost and insurance for a new psychiatrist since I recently got kicked out (For being gay) and just recently got a fast food job. 

I don’t like self diagnosing and I will never claim to have a mental condition that I have not been professionally diagnosed with but I can’t sleep at night and this would make me feel better if I knew. 

What my last psychiatrist narrowed it down too was ASD or another behavioral disorder. 

The ways I stim is I clap my hands randomly in a specific pattern. And sometimes grab my hair during panic attacks and won’t let go. It’s soothing. I also often repeat sentences and phrases or words in my head. Most of the time it’s my own thoughts or words but other times it’s stuff someone else has said and I play it on a loop. I don’t have all of the symptoms of someone with ASD but I have most of them. I’m very neurotypical-presenting but my old psychiatrist said that didn’t disprove her theory since Autism is a spectrum and everyone is different in their experiences. This isn’t all my reasonings for why I’m concerned but just the most prominent and recent ones. 

AGAIN, I DO NOT NEED OR WANT AN ONLINE, ILLEGITIMATE DIAGNOSIS. I just want answers of what it COULD be so I can work on methods to cope easier. Please don’t send hate my way for “not seeking professional help” because trust me I want to. I plan to go through the proper channels as soon as finances permit. 

Thanks if you read. Thanks if you have any insight. Appreciate anyone willing to help.",05Nov2019,1

TLDR: I'm 17 years old struggling with ADHD ruining my hobbies and school. My parents are horrible and I feel like they don't really care about me. I feel so alone even though I have friends cause I'm stuck with my own negative thoughts. Is there any advice to get back to my normal self?



Hi, I'm 17 years old and am diagnosed with ADHD  and Anxiety/Social Anxiety with a small dose of undiagnosed, but treated depression (idk I was given antidepressants).


Where do I start? I'm so tired of life. It's exhausting trying to go through it with all my issues.


First issue is my ADHD has been interfering with my school and hobbies. 


I don't know if it's a sick combo move with depression but I don't find anything fun anymore. Video games used to be fun, then I eventually needed to watch something else while playing em, and now I can't play em at all except for a few occasions. 


I also love music production which is suffering from this. I want to do it as a job but I can't bring myself to practice or learn. I want to do it, it's just I get bored after 5 minutes and quit when I used to be able to play around on it for HOURS.


My school is suffering from this too. Most classes are fine except my English which I am struggling with lots. I can't bring myself to do the homework or pay attention. I just zone out. My mark is taking a hit because of this and is going to take an even bigger hit because I have not been paying attention at all in class while we read Shakespeare. It's so painfully boring. This is causing huge anxiety for me right now.


My second issue is my home life. I fucking hate my parents so much, and not cause teenage rebellion type shit. Whenever I bring up how much I'm struggling with my certain issues, they always compare me to others. Saying stuff like ""Your cousin has ADHD and a job, why don't you?"". She always tells me I'm not using strategies to control my anxiety and ADHD, which is a big lie. She also says I just gotta suck it up.


 They always start fights and are just assholes to me. I don't feel comfortable going into detail but it feels like they bully me.


After these fights they manipulate me into loving them again. Saying they care about me and they love me. Sometimes they even claim I remember stuff wrong. Everytime we see a therapist it always ends up as me being demonized for these fights if I bring em up, so I just never do anymore.


I feel like I'm alone. I have some friends but I don't know how to vent this to them. I don't want to be that kid that's just always depressing and shit. I try calling for help on my various social media's because I just want one person to ask if I'm ok. I want to know someone cares about me I guess. I just feel like I bother people though.


So I have no idea what to do. I feel like I'm going nowhere in life. I have no one to talk to about my feelings, no outlet because I always get bored of em.


Any advice on getting past this all?  I want to feel like myself again.  Be able to play games and make music, not worry about anything.",05Nov2019,1

16,"I'm male, almost 18 and have never felt like this before, not this consistently anyway. 
These past few months I've been very paranoid, I'm suspicious of everyone, I get very extreme thoughts whilst at home, thoughts that people want to hurt me and I'm often too scared to take my clothes off to change them or to get a bath. 
I recently moved and every thing I own is still in boxes and my clothes are still in their case, in case I need to do a runner for some reason. 

It's always a fear of something happening, whether it's the idea that someone is going to break in, or police are coming to arrest me, despite me having done nothing wrong. 
It's the same with people I meet through passing or through family, I really don't trust anyone and feel like everyone has a motive.
I don't have any friends, literally none, I cut off my last ones because I thought they wanted to hurt me, and weren't really my friends.
I don't mind the emptiness, it's a normal thing for me, it's just the paranoia that bothers me, it's distressful and makes me feel sick.

17,"ive been being treated for mental health for over ten years now, mostly just getting medication (i dont know if its relevant but my longest used medication has just been seroquel that i use at one of the lowest doses for insomnia - though i know its also a mood stabilizer), ive had anti depressants in the past and ive been diagnosed with bpd in the far past, major depression currently and long standing, but i think years back psychosis/schizophrenia was offhandedly mentioned after some self attempts. but if im being honest, i dont remember the last time i even saw a therapist to talk about things because im so, so bad at therapy. i cant bring myself to talk, and if i do its short answers and i always need prompting. ive been told id probably benefit from like a child therapist but thats neither here nor there. 

anyway, even though i havent ""revealed"" much to my therapists aside from the major depression stuff, i have this delusion that i'm not sure how to classify? like, im very obssessed with the idea of going back to the past (before trauma), and have created this bubble where i just 'exist' in that time. music, fashion, media from that time etc. thinking about my age gives me anxiety and i often feel like im younger than i realistically am, and i think i am younger. but i think i can get back to 'those times' someday. but i also KNOW that that's illogical, yet i still cant make myself not think that i can? i have no idea if that makes sense... i just think about how i have to go back to that time. and when i catch glimpses of ppl from my childhood and stuff that are just living their lives as adults and getting by, it doesn't make sense to me, because how could they leave it behind? 

i dont know, i thought this post would be easier to make sense when i started typing it but now im not sure. anyway i avoid thinking about my age and focusing on the passing of time (which has become an obsession to try and not think about time, which, obviously just leads me to thinking about time), and those nostalgia ""this show/thing came out 10-20 years ago!"" always makes me dissociate. i just think i have to go back. so is a delusion still a delusion even if you know its a delusion?",05Nov2019,1

21,"I have self-diagnosed myself with Seasonal Affect Disorder (SAD). A little background, I (24F) live in Upstate NY where the winters can be very brutal. The last 5-6 winters I always spiral into a deep depression and feel hopeless until about March/April when the winter starts to reprieve. This year, I am experiencing more anxiety than ever about the upcoming depression I will face during the dark months of January and February. When the weather is unbearably cold, it is excrement difficult to leave my apartment. 

I have already made an apt to see a therapist but am unable to get in until the end of the month. My question is what do people with SAD do during the winter months to help surprises their symptoms?

22,"So my brother tried to harm himself, luckily someone was there to intervene. He was admitted to a hospital and has been moved to outpatient care program and will likely be released in the next few days.

My parents dont know because he doesnt trust them and they aren't very understanding. So I have been notified of the situation and I dont know what I should do next? Do I tell my parents? Once he is discharged he has no immediate family in the area only his now Ex-girlfriends family and her. Which there breakup was the tipping point for his depression, so probably not wise to be spending time with them. Imo.

I live pretty far away and in a remote area, I am not opposed to him coming to live with me but professional level care would be extremely difficult.

What are my options? Anyone have any thoughts, I've run out of resources and this is beyond my skill set.

23,"This really kills my productivity.

Instead of practicing something, I just avoid doing them and I waste time on social media.

I want to work on my art skills, but nowadays I often getting frustrated instead of enjoying it. I rarely manage to produce any output in art, and when I do I usually manage to hate it after 10-15 minutes. Often I only finish pieces just so I don't have to see my art that I feel was drawn pretty poorly.

This isn't limited to art. I recently stopped most effort for looking for any kind of job since I didn't had any luck with it for years, and often the only job I could get is some minimum-wage factory job 100-200km away from my home. Not much look with remote jobs, since most of them centered around web development and I've trained to be a software developer. Retraining myself would take some time, and since I'm getting older (29 in a few months) the expectations towards me are very high. I couldn't get any internship, which would've been mandatory for my college degree, but not only I've probably lost the chance of getting a college degree in software engineering, but also ended up a gigantic hole in my resume. Probably someone else would lie some other kinds of jobs, but I'm very bad at lying and I cannot lie that I've worked at certain companies, especially not about the details of said jobs. I don't really know why I was always rejected, but at least in one case they probably noticed my autism. I don't know about the rest, but in that case they lied about my skills to avoid having to deal with ""possible issues"", not to mention they were suspicious about why I couldn't get an internship deal for years.

I don't have any friends offline anymore. Anybody who could do it, long left this county, or even this country. Only old people are here, or the younger people who probably believed my mother collected huge amounts of welfare money between 2002-2010 (a usual stereotype about disabled people in Hungary is that they got so much welfare money from the previous party that they could buy luxury cars).",05Nov2019,1
24,"Hi everyone! I constantly ruminate day and night over this one situation that happened two years ago. 

It all started when this girl on my floor in university introduced me to her guy friend. Her guy friend happened to like me and when she found out she said that she’s likes him. A few days later she went to his place and hooked up with him. One day I went to his place and she politely told me off. I apologized and I told her it was not my intention to hurt her. After we both agreed to stay away from him, however one day this guy wouldn’t leave me alone and asked to talk so I said yes and then this girl completely lost it and kicked me out of her room and started yelling at me. Eventually she said it was okay for me and him to go out so we did and then she stopped talking to me and started making intimidating faces at me and acted as if I didn’t exist. I contacted her a couple months after and she said she just needed a break. Although after that she still continued to avoid me. 

Now I constantly think about her and everything that she’s done because it really hurt me. However sometimes I think i’m a bad person and a bad friend. I messaged her a couple times after and asked how she was doing and she never responded. It also really hurts how she has moved on with her life yet i’m here suffering.

25,"My friend since elementary school and I are both comp sci majors, and the courses required are very heavy in workload and are quite difficult. This semester I’ve started to break from my depression and start giving school my everything; I’ve been eating healthy, exercising, fixing my sleep, actually making an attempt to study, and my grades still aren’t the best but certainly improving.



Recently, our physics and calculus courses have begun to get more progressively difficult, and it seems like my friend who once i saw as a harder worker than me, is now just giving up. In class he just ignores any question I ask him about anything pertaining to school, whenever we go to the computer lab in between classes he’s stopped trying to actually work and instead just screws around or cheats to complete the homework with google or a calculator, and he’s switched to a simpler 2+2 plan to go to another campus instead of going to the main campus like we were originally doing.



I’ve been really struggling to maintain my motivation as hes my only friend nowadays and I have crippling social anxiety that keeps me from talking to people, and I have nobody else in my life that I can relate to about my future, my academics, or really anything anymore. I still live at home, and I interact with my parents, but they aren’t the brightest and usually when talking about college it goes right over their heads.",05Nov2019,1

27,"Hello. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. I do not usually use online sources for help but, at the moment, I do not know what to do or think at all. I feel so alone, scared and confused. I come from a very religious and conservative family. I managed to keep the secret about my homosexuality from them throughout middle school, although I told my aunt once while having a breakdown and contemplating suicide. I tried to ignore these feelings throughout high school but now, for some reason, it is becoming more and more difficult. I find myself being attracted to the same gender, having inappropriate thoughts, and indulging in homosexual videos. I am 19 and I live with parents, who I love very much. I would never want to go against what they believe, or to disappoint them. I really hope that I do not offend anyone but our Christian beliefs also say that homosexuality is not okay so I am afraid about that.😥 And I do not intend to let my parents (or anyone for that matter) know about me. I love my parents so much, they are wonderful parents and I just wonder what they would say and think if they knew the truth about me.:( I feel so guilty and ashamed, and trapped in my own thoughts and mind. I feel very sad and like I am going crazy. I have nothing against people on the basis of sexuality of course, but I just wish that I personally was not this way and that there was something that I could do. I do not even know what I am asking or doing here, really. I suppose I just needed someone to talk to and get all of this out. So thank you, very much. 😢❤️😔",05Nov2019,6

29,"Just to clear this up and prevent from getting the obvious answers, nothing is on my mind and I'm not stressed at all. When I watch films nowadays, I enjoy them but they never really leave a lasting effect after the watch like they used to. For example, a couple days back I went to see a movie in theaters (it's a foreign movie) and it was a remake of a actor's (who is my favourite) previous movie. The film had alot of twists and turns and believe me, I really enjoyed the film but idk, at the end I struggled to remember everything in a matter of seconds (like I used to) and my mind just felt really empty. This happens for every film and because of this effect, I never really know how much I enjoyed a movie as I never really get that lasting effect anymore and my mind is always empty, whether I'm trying to remember what just happened in a movie I just watched or try to remember a bunch of movies of a specific genre (ex. horror), it takes my brain way longer to process these thoughts.

So I am constantly checking their profiles to see if people are posting on it and what they say. Especially since one of them was my best friend and ex boyfriend.

33,"I hope this is the right place to ask this. I have some thoughts I would like to express and I wondered if there  is a term for what I am feeling, if I can find others like me, or if there is any way to lessen this feeling. I've had the thoughts as long as I can remember but never really put it into words until recently.

The best way I can think to describe it is this: instead of feeling that I am a part of the world around me, I feel like I am looking through a window at the world. I am constantly and unrelentingly aware that I am controlling my body and everything I do; like it's a vehicle I am sitting in, rather than part of myself. I can't stop feeling like the real me is inside my head, watching and dictating the actions of the body, and isn't really part of the reality I experience through my senses... and I suppose this is true, because my consciousness is my frame of reference, but surely most people aren't always aware of it or thinking about it the way I do? Sorry if this is getting a bit philosophical.

Anyway, this makes me consumed by my own thoughts, to the point where I can feel detached from the world, sometimes even in an active social situation. I'm not really introverted, but I am extremely introspective probably to a fault. I can't stop examining my own mind, and not always from curiosity but just because it's *where I live*, and maybe subconsciously it's where I want to stay? I'm supposed to wear glasses, but I don't, and I have sometimes joked that it's because I prefer the world blurry as it allows me to more easily stay in my head where I'm comfortable. As silly as that sounds, I don't really think I'm joking.

The reason this is starting to be a concern for me is because I'm switching career paths and studying to be a counsellor. It's something I really want to do, but I absolutely have to be more in touch with the world around me, because I need to be able to examine other people in order to help them, instead of just myself.",05Nov2019,1

I'm 25 now and I'll still get a bit anxious from time to time, and I'll occasionally have depressive moods as well. And now and then, I'll have some trouble falling asleep too.

Last week, something changed for the worse though. I'm having a much harder time falling asleep, to a point where I can't fall asleep without sleep aids (Melatonin, HCI). I feel depressed more than ever, I'm anxious as hell, and I feel a bit out of it sometimes (I think it's called depersonalization/derealization?).

37,"Okay so I know that I should take him to a theripist and I will, but I just wanted to ask someone who knows more about this stuff than I do. 

He's very smart, knows a lot about computers, has common sense and is even clever. The thing is he has this really bad anger in him, he snaps sometimes for a small reasons he's also very sensitive and emotional. He's been under a lot of stress lately because of his abusive mother who had a really bad argument with him and really hurt him, also she has his money, over 100k, in her box and wont give him nothing, so she basically stole it and there's nothing we can do. I never seen him this unstabe. 

He snapped lastnight again (every night since a week he's been having a nervous breakdown, either crying or arguing.) I got a little upset because he woke me up late at night. So because he was making too much noise I went on the couch, long story short we got on eachothers nerves. But we didnt argue, i haven't slept right since 1 week because of his nervous breakdowns, I just wanted some space for a min and told him I would be back in bed in a few mins because he kept asking me too. He didn't like that that answer and started banging his head into the wall, so hard that he left a big hole in the wall. Then he rolled on the floor, crying hysterically like someone was torturing him. He was scratching his face and was trying to pull his eyes out.
Somhow I was holding back his hands so he wouldnt hurt himself. 

After he calmed down I asked him why did he do all that? He said he had no control over his actions.

I don't know if he may be mentally ill, or maybe he's just seeking pity? I know it sounds harsh, but he does seem like he feels bad for himself, he cried afterwards and said ""nobody loves meeee!"" But he knows I and our daughter love him very much, we tell him we love him too. 

He has been through a lot of verbal abusive from his mother and a lot of other terrible things to go though and I acknowledge that and try my best to make him feel better, I tell him to forget his terrible past and move on to the future with me and our daughter. I dont blame him for being furious about his money, but I know thats not the main reason why he's acting this way, because he wasnt like this before their argument. He says he been through too much and has PTSD and he thinks he may be ill because he has a uncle who is mentally ill, he also thought he had autism and every other disease out there.

This isn't the first time I've been to therapy, but the last two times were two and three sessions respectively before I stopped. I didn't feel a connection with my therapists, and I didn't have a adequate support system--or, actually, I wasn't open about my issues before so no-one knew I needed help. This time, I have a support system and I'm in a state that has generally better mental healthcare, so I'm more optimistic about this than I've been before.

So, I've got a laundry list of problems. Clinical depression, anxiety, a very high likelihood that I'm on the lighter end of the autistic spectrum, and I'm experiencing something that... well, I'm not sure if it's gender dysphoria or body dysmorphia. Also, I'm asexual, and married to someone who isn't asexual and this has, as I'm sure many of you can infer, caused issues.

I was touched a lot by a woman who was a lot older than me. She knew my age but I didn't know hers until after everything. It started with a lot of sexual dancing, which I was a bit uncomfortable with but my friends weren't saying anything so I just assumed it was normal and I was just shy. She touched me on the hip a lot and tried to get me to drink alcohol- but I was supposed to be sober that night so I said no. She was flirting hardcore, and I have never been flirted with before so I just kind of laughed and let it happen, even though I didn't feel ready for this. My friends left the two of us alone- I think they thought they wanted to give us space, and I wasn't saying no so I can't blame them.

She touched my knee and rubbed it a lot. At one point we were holding hands- but what fucks me up is that I can't remember if she grabbed my hands or I grabbed hers. I remember I was so stressed out in this situation that holding her hand reassured me. And after that I can't blame her for thinking I thought this was okay- like I was literally holding her hand. She asked me to dance a lot but I said I'd rather just sit. She danced near me a lot, and at one point pulled my hands up to touch her chest. And then at one point she sort of sat on my legs and grinded me for a moment while she was wearing a dress. At this point I remember calling out in surprise and recoiling slightly, which she smiled at. I'm not sure what happened exactly after that but eventually I think she sat down again and continued to touch my knee.

Eventually my friends came back and grabbed my hand and got me out of there. I cried the entire night and the entire next day. Today I didn't leave my room because I felt too scared to leave it. I'm so angry and embarrassed for not saying no. I've always had trouble with standing up for myself but like...shit I was just worried about hurting her feelings which is so stupid.

I’m going to try my best to keep this short but want to be thorough.

My wife’s brother was dealing with problems with buying drugs online. It started with one, led to another, which led to excuses for selling for money etc etc. He moved from the west coast to the east coast to live with us after one of his best friends was shot during a drug raid by a gang. He was doing well at first, regulating his prescribed medications and other drug use (somewhat acceptable considering the circumstances but don’t what to specify specifics). He slowly began becoming is second personality which we can call Clemente. Clemente thinks the real person here, we will call him Xavier is an idiot. Xavier was doing good until he relapsed 3 days ago during a party and Clemente came back out. He’s mean, aggressive, thinks everyone’s out to get him etc. not fun stuff to be around. I decided to bring him in to a state sponsored clinic but they literally did nothing after 3 hours! They took him back with us, then he kicked us out for telling them the truth of the situation. Then he came back out 3 hours later with no solution and he was given a prescription for a drug he already has and doesn’t work! He came back home with us and got aggressive once again probably coming off the extreme amount of “cleptograpanizes” he took which he got in a not so legal way so who knows what’s actually in them. He’s passed out now but don’t know what to do.

He’s aggressive to my fiancé and i. His mother and grandmother won’t take him back. He victimized himself so it’s extremely difficult to get anywhere with him especially when he’s on the “stuff”. Wait it out until he comes down is more of a problem. And no one will let me call the cops. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME. PM ME IF YOU ARE AN expert in this and want more details",05Nov2019,1

I don’t know where to start to make this coherent, I apologize for potentially jigsawing this question.

Why do I (18m) feel... weird? I don’t know how to put it other than that. I feel wrong, or weird, like a void needs to be filled or emptied. 

I look for problems and false solutions and go after them like a missile and then it turns out to not be correlated at all. Or at least, I’ll obsess about them for a while and then forget.

I was miserable in my last two years of high school, and I didn’t know why. I blamed it on my lack of a girlfriend and tried really hard to get a date. Pathetically so. Senior year I thought it was my lack of direction in life and so I dedicated myself to finding a job or goal to pursue in after graduation.

Well, I realized after graduation I really don’t give a damn about what I do as long as I have basic living. So i thought I’d focus on college and have fun. Well, I’m miserable here. I’ve gone to clubs and didn’t enjoy them, talked to people and began the spark of friendships but I never truly liked them. The people wore a real chore.

I commute and began to think that’s my problem. I need to dorm. But really, I can’t stand the idea of dorming and don’t really want to lose my relationships with my parents. Living with my friend sounds like it would be fun for a week and then hell. No offense to him, but I like privacy. 

I feel like I’m wasting time here. 

I have best friends and a friend group, but I’m extremely close to my parents and very grateful to have them. But I can’t figure out why I just can’t fell satisfied with what I have? None of them can help me, I’ve told them all of this and I they can’t figure it out either.

My dad thinks it’s boredom and I should work on my free time so I have no free time. He thinks I should curb anytime where I’m free so I literally cannot feel this feeling.

My mom has no answers, and says she’s felt the same way her whole life. Her escapism from this feeling are housework, Hallmark movies, and my dad and I. She is literally my shoulder to cry on occasionally. 

My friends think I just need to move out and have “freedom” and that’ll fill it. But I’m more free now than I’ll ever be. 

All I want to do is escape through books, daydreams, movies, music, video games, and Reddit when I feel this way, as if that can make me feel better. It does, sometimes.

That is a terrible thing to say, but with almost sixteen years under my belt of feeling like garbage, you would too.

On the outside, my family looks normal, standard, functioning.

On the inside are my parents, screaming that I don’t look, act or behave a certain way. For the record, I have not done anything with substances, or gotten bad grades in school.

I ask my parents to discuss, I’m told I’m selfish.

I ask my parents why, I’m told I need help.

However, I’ve been to therapy forever and it will never be helpful for me, it is just not. I’ve accepted that...

Unfortunately, I’ve found records of them trying to get me to live at a therapeutic center, however I have so much going for me.

On the other hand, they don’t even believe me at all.

So many times in court rape kits have been thrown out because they can’t always prove if there was consent or not. Sometimes the judge sees it as “not right forensics”. Also I was ashamed I was raped so I never wanted to talk about it/I was very embarrassed it happened. The defense lawyer at the trial kept asking me questions solely based on rape myths.

So I'm 24.  I grew up a fairly isolated life.  In my teenage years, I probably hung out with people maybe 5 times in those 10 years.  Now I'm almost halfway through my 20s. 

Here's my problem.  

I've never asked out a girl.  I might have been with friends that could resemble a group date but it really wasn't.  Anyways, yeah I feel lonely, but now I really have no desire whatsoever to ask anyone out.  I've convinced myself that I'm going to live a life alone.  I've almost accepted it now. Just a side note, I am heterosexual.  

My parents are starting to get worried about this.  They keep bugging me to ask someone out.  It's getting to the point where its nearly every day.  I'm not bashing them.  Just decided to mention it.  

Part of my why I don't ask anyone out is likely because of fear.  The other part just doesn't care and has accepted living single the rest of my life.  The fear probably stems from my teenage years.  It's just residual now.  

I think this part is important to mention as well.  So in my teenage years, I would avoid eye contact with any girl.  I especially never spoke a word to the ones I liked.  Now this same practice is going on in my 20s but it's more of a subconscious/automatic thing I do, and less of something I try to do.  

Please don't misunderstand, I don't avoid talking to girls, I just don't ever flirt or ask them out.  When I do talk to girls, I act friendly and happy.  I'm not the guy that runs away if a girl makes conversation.  Yes I do look at them when I'm talking to them. I possess some level of social skills.  

I almost think I am unable to love or show that type of emotion.  Idk.  Maybe I'm just stupid.  

Yep, I know I'm weird.  Laugh all you want.  I've gotten it my whole life.  I haven't met a soul like me so I'm pretty sure I'm the only guy with this issue.  I'm being serious here.  

So I know the normal solution is to man up and ask someone out.  I could have told myself that.  

What the hell is wrong with me?  Am I the type to be happy alone?  Is all this social pressure getting to me?  It's likely nobody else has this problem...But I guess I'm asking for opinions and advice.   Please don't roast me.  Nearly everyone seems to do it.

74,"So I guess it started about 5 years ago when I started dating my first serious boyfriend. He was suicidal among other serious issues and I was always saving him or bringing him back from the edge. He was abused and neglected as a child and that carried into everything. It felt like it was my job to keep him alive, that it was my purpose, and not knowing where he was or what he was doing freaked me out. Long long long story short we ended things but the feeling of having to save my SO carried into my second serious relationship. It took a long time to convince me that he wasn’t anything like my 1st bf and that I didn’t need to keep tabs on him even tho I still kinda kept a tight leash. And then he got cancer... He decided that he didn’t want to die from cancer and that he wanted to end things his own way. So it started again, I didn’t sleep many nights just so I could watch him, I was on the phone with him 24/7, and having to go to work or school was the biggest stress because I wasn’t with him. Shortly after he passed away from leukemia. My bff (guy) and I started dating the year after and we were really happy. At first I was super hesitant because I didn’t want to enter yet another “toxic” relationship since I knew he was recovering from an eating disorder (I guess mentally unstable is my type). But my 3rd bf was later involved in a horrible shooting where he almost died. This triggered his disorder (also triggered my anxiety) and his health declined rapidly. He had to go back to rehab and I know he wanted to break up but he didn’t. He ended up not saying goodbye or anything. I know he didn’t want me to deal with his issues but I don’t think he understood how much that would hurt me. I don’t just freak out over SOs tho. It could be anyone. I have a pair of friends that are a couple and if I see them doing cool stuff on Instagram (as couples do) I get really jealous that I wasn’t invited to go with them and I feel anxious that they are doing things without me. Even this new friend I made at work. She had a different lunchtime than I did and I wanted to cry because I wanted to go to lunch with her. I didn’t quite notice this whole pattern until I thought about it just now. I just started crying cuz my bff (girl) just called me to say goodnight and then actually hung up the phone.

It’s only gotten worse as my depressed best and closest friend has repeatedly told me how they don’t deserve me and how I should just forget/leave them. I get so scared and worried when I don’t hear from them. 3 hours ago they sent me a text that was worrisome and haven’t texted or called me back and I’m so scared I can’t sleep, I just can’t stop crying. They promised me they weren’t suicidal or going to leave me but I’m so terrified. They’ll probably think I’m crazy if they’re actually fine and leave me anyway.

When I’m not crying due to being lonely for no good reason or anxious for stupid crap, I can barely talk to people of any authority. I get too nervous to go to my counsellor or ask my parents to take me to a therapist, which is morbidly ironic considering I really should.

81,"(30F) I meditate, I work out, I battle my negative thoughts daily.. But what's the point? What's the point if all I'm going to do is fall right back into the way I was before. What's the point in trying when this can happen again so easily? One simple moment and the weeks of ""self help"" are out the window. I'm right back where I was. My husband hates me again, I hate me again. Why can't I just get it right for once?    

I finally woke up happy today. It's been a few days since I've felt that way. I did everything I  needed to do to start my day right. My husband (32M)and I have been on rocky ground for a while. I blew up on him while pmsing and now we're in recovery mode. He usually needs a few days of space to recover from my meltdowns. He's less affectionate, if at all, he dives into his own self help work, he's distant. These recovery days started as recovery hours, but now it's days, and I'm afraid that soon it will be recovery weeks. And I'm the one to blame. I know I am. I know I'm fucked up and insecure. I'm anxious, I'm afraid of losing everything while literally pushing everything away. Usually all of it compiles and I explode during my pms week. We then spend the next few weeks trying to reconnect, and right when things feel right, I'm back to my emotionally unstable week of hell. I don't blame pms. I know I have my mental  issues and that week happens to elevate them.. I just hate this cycle. It's been this cycle for 6 years with him. I've been really ""working on it"" for 2 years and it feels like nothing has changed. I still blow up, I still hit myself (harder than before), I still think that the whole world will end when he's upset with me.... Back to today.. Everything is great, until I'm alone with him, my thoughts start to race and panic. ""does he still want to be with me?"" ""is he annoyed with me"" ""how can I act so that he will like me again"".. I reached over and held his hand, he reciprocates, ""sigh... he still likes me"". The day is good, great even. Until I pick him up from work. ""He looks upset, is he upset?"" ""whats he thinking about?"" ""does he still like me?"" ""are we ok?"" ""are we ever going to be ok?"" ""stop relying on how you think he feels"" ""but is he upset with me?"" And on and on.. We get home and I do my own things because being around him is making me more anxious than ever. The distance between us is tearing at my soul. All I want is to be close to him, but he needs space. While all of this is happening, I'm extremely overwhelmed with work. I run my own business from home and things are getting piled up because I keep having mental breakdowns and finding something else to do other than work. I finally confide in him about my work and how stressed I am and he hugs me and tries to make me feel better. He's great with words, but I couldn't shake the feelings of self doubt and overwhelming sadness. I literally wanted to cry all evening. So I pretended like what he said had helped and it really would have had I not felt so extremely down, then went into my office to work. I went to the kitchen a few times to check the fridge to see if new food had magically appeared. He was putting away Halloween decor, but seemed off. I knew that me confiding in him about my emotional state and brought his mood down. We haven't been close so we both feel lonely even though we're right next to eachother.    

We had another argument. I tried to apologize for being so anxious when I know better than to feel that way. He said I've been pushing him away, I said he's been pushing me away. He left the room extremely upset that I said that. I went after him, bad idea cuz of the whole space thing, we argued some more. I went too far and closed the door to the office behind me in a huff. He went to bed. I cried then went  into the bedroom to talk to him, he yelled at me to leave him alone and leave the room. I then went into my hysterical mode. I cried and severely hit myself on the head and face until I felt ashamed enough to stop. I cried and cried. I wailed, yes, wailed. I am now convinced that I will be alone forever no matter who is around me, I will be alone. I can't escape my head. I can't get past all of these rules and fears and conditions that I've created for myself. I can't stop thinking that whoever is with me will surely leave me. I can't stop pushing people away. I can't stop pushing him away. The only person I want next to me, on top of me, inside me. And I think I've lost him.",05Nov2019,2

I feel so alone recently, and lost, and hopeless, and confused and I'm trying so so so hard.

My Nala, says that I need to keep fighting because if I can get control of my symptoms and keep the weight off her shoulders she'll come back. 

For background we recently broke up a nearly 4 year relationship in which our most recent intention was to have children and get married. 

I have dissociative episodes constantly and she's been so supportive and tolerant and patient through the entirety of the time we've spent together. 

So much so that I can't remember a time without her, between my symptoms and medications really that's as far back as my memory goes really. Other than the traumatic ones. 

I love her dearly but having to face my problems on my own is so devastatingly hard that I broke down on the freeway not to long ago going about 120mph and I can't remember safely getting to her house. She of course talked me down and soothed me but I felt so helpless. 

She's saved me many times in fact, she says that I have to come to terms with the fact that she might not come back though, and I struggle with that concept. She says she loves me so very much and that I've impacted her life, but she might not want to pursue a relationship with me. It's still something that bring tears to my eyes when I think about it. 

I know that it's because its healthy to not be so reliant on someone, and that for us to have a healthy relationship I have to strive not just for her, but myself as well. She says the best way to get her to come back is to show her how strong I can be on my own, and Nala says that she knows I can do it, she wants to be proud of me and I wanna be able to do it because I wanna be strong like other people are too. 

I miss her though and I'm sad because the voices in my head always say that even if I do improve she might not come back, and I know that it's true, and I'm trying so hard not to be delusional because that's unhealthy but I so much want to give up and be delusional because if Nala won't stay, if Nala doesn't want to love me I have no chance. Nala is so nice to me and I didn't always deserve it. I know that I didn't because I forget who I am and I'm mean to her when I don't mean to be and Im so sorry for that, but I love her. Idk I'm just afraid that she won't come back and I'll be alone forever. She says that I have to learn to love myself because even if shes not with me, if I love myself other people will too and that someday I can use what I learned to love someone even better and that I'll be so perfect because I'm a good person and I'm strong, but I just wanna make Nala happy. 

I know I have to let go of her and help myself for her to come back but it's so hard, and the thought of losing her keeps me from making more progress, because I'm afraid she's going to see how well I'm doing and decide that she's done everything she can and move on with her life like the angel she is.

92,"I took a leave of absence from my first year of college because of depression. I was assaulted my first week and tried to push through each day, it definitely was a factor in my leave. I could not get up to go to classes, I did not want to fail so early on. I've been ""hopeless"" since 8th grade, and the more time goes by, it only seems to be getting worse, with small jumps in hope/happiness in between. I'm using sex and relationships as a coping mechanism, I know it's bad, but it seems like the only thing holding me together, along with the love from my parents.

I have the most loving family and all I feel is guilt for worrying them. I've been in therapy since 8th grade, went through many SSRIs and now I'm on peroxatine, Wellbutrin, and Klonopin. I really found my match concerning my therapist and psychiatrist. 

I recently got out of a physically abusive relationship in which I felt trapped in. I should feel happy or relieved that it's over, but I continue to hate myself and sulk when I know that's a stupid thing to do. I feel truly alone, even though I'm not!

When I ask him why he wants to know everything, he says its better to know than be kept in the dark, and I agree with that, however I do feel extremely anxious and very very uncomfortable talking about my abuse.

*Scrolling through the Instagram feed on her phone, 22-year-old Ingebjørg Blindheim explains why she has been given the nickname ""the lifeguard"".*

*""I see a lot of people who want to die,"" explains the young Norwegian.*

*""I'm not just going to watch someone saying they're going to kill themselves and ignore it and hope for the best.""*

 *Intervening to help suicidal Instagram users is not a role Ingebjørg would have chosen for herself. She doesn't work for the social media site, and she isn't paid for what she does. Nor is she formally qualified to offer help, having received no training in mental healthcare. Instead she feels compelled to act, realising she's often the last chance of help for those posting their despair online.*

*""I feel like when I'm not on the phone watching, people might do something to themselves and no-one will see,"" she says.*

*This means monitoring Instagram constantly, identifying those who are close to the edge and alerting the police and ambulance services. She admits to having sleepless nights. She knows that being so distracted by her phone can anger her family and friends, but she worries that without her vigilance, someone might die.*",05Nov2019,5

I have lost motivation in the things I used to like. I used to do crafty things, I was taking drawing classes, I used to make YouTube videos, used to exercise, used to take photos because I’m a photographer but all my motivation is gone. I hate my job, and I hate that I studied something that was my passion to end up working as a dumb receptionist listening to people complain about the stupidest shit ever. I feel like a have tons of weights on my shoulders, I’m always tired.

Talking to my psychologist doesn’t work anymore... she does gives me advice and things to do to get better but nothing works, I’m just disappointed at myself, why? I don’t even know.

My family doesn’t help either, my mom is always mad and fighting, my sister is always on her phone so I can’t talk to her because she ignores me, my dad its just annoying always telling me to join the airforce when I told him that I can’t, Im not qualified because of health issues (asthma) but he doesn’t care he just keeps on telling to join and pretend that I’m healthy.

Over the past few weeks I've not been feeling myself so much. I've tried to keep the smiling face but as I've found out I failed at that. It was only when someone close asked why I ""wasn't smiling so mich today"" that I realised that perhaps I'm not as okay as I thought I was. 

Around the same time I've noticed people stopped talking to me as much as they used to and in class at uni people don't sit next to me unless theres no where else to sit. Friends have drifted away and most of the people around dont take me seriously. To people who dont know that might hear what they say or do would probably think I am being bullied.

This is where things take a dark turn. Over the past 2 weeks I've had bad thoughts. I have, on more than one occasion, while sat in class, had a moment in a out of body perspective that I walked out and shot myself in the face. I've also imagined first person falling from a building that isnt far from where I live. 

I know that this isn't normal or right to be having thoughts like this but I dont know what I should do. I keep telling myself that this isnt depression and that they are just wierd day dreams. It has happened before when I used to ride a motorcycle a few years ago that I would imagine crashing it into oncoming traffic.

I know this isn't okay. I feel like I need help with this to get my mind clear. I would talk to friends if I had any that would understand or not take the Mickey.

Writing this is just reliased I've created a loophole. 

And I think I have schizophrenia because I watched https://youtu.be/cKVctQNRL6w and in the video the dude explains that he thinks there's cameras watching him through his drain. When I was a kid, I watched the Truman show and for a very long time was convinced I was on it. So when ever I was alone I would behave correctly so I wouldn't get laughed at. 

Also when I was younger I created this strange strange ritual of whenever I go into my garage to take out the rubbish I have to sing a new song that I haven't sung to what I thought was a monster waiting for me underneath and in the cars. I believed that if I didn't sing a new song that would please it each time, it would become displeased and eventually lunge out at me. 

These weird thoughts went away for a while and I recently haven't had them as frequently but the other night after I smoked some doogie it triggered some of those weird garage thoughts. I thought to myself that's ridiculous and there's no monsters but instinctively and forcablly I started singing. 

Anyway I doubt if someone will read this but if you do, where can I go for support? I can't really talk to my parents because they're too awkward to talk too and I don't think I can see a doc.

I feel unworthy of living, I feel hopeless and helpless in so many areas of my life. 

I need someone to tell me how to live😞

I know a lot of it has to do with me not working, or seeing people who care about me.

But what can I do if I can’t?

114,"Am I engaging in something dangerous? So hi, little backstory, I suffer from OCD and a week ago I finally went to get meds. I've been on 5mg for about a week. Now, that's not what I'm here for. Actually, I've got another "" hidden"" problem. About 3 weeks before going to my psychiatrist while I was really struggling, I went to my GP for advice. I would have taken anything at this point. She prescribed me 0,5mg of Clonazepam to take at night, advised me to start with a half (0,25mg) and up it if needed and to not take it when I can avoid it. I decided to up the dose after 2-3 days because it was just not doing the job. So I've been taking 0,5mg of Clonazepam roughly every night for now about a month. The first two weeks, when not taking it on Sundays, I was totally fine. I was sometimes switching: taking 0,25mg in the morning and then again 0,25mg at nighttime. or sometimes I would just take 0,25 mg. Then I started taking my SSRI and the psychiatrist told me to keep takin clonazepam for a little before putting me off of it. I proceeded to immediately drop my dose to 0,25mg every night and then not taking it at all before bed and only going back to it if I ever woke up at night feeling stressed. It was fine. Then I had 4 days off of school so I decided to decrease even more: I broke the 0,25mg in half again. Then, I felt like crap. On Saturday, I was so stressed that I eventually had to take 0,25mg again during the day and it didn't do sh\*t. Then I didn't take anything all through Saturday and felt even worse. Took 0,25 mg for Monday and good again. Then today, I didn't take it and feel like f\*cking c\*ap, literally. 

I suspected withdrawal. I already went through that stuff when I happen to take 1mg of lorazepam at some point and it felt exactly the same. I went to my psychiatrist in emergency. Luckily, he was available and was very nice and sweet and didn't even make me pay. I explained and he confirmed it could be withdrawal. He adjusted my meds to 10mg (just because we happened to talk about it) and then we talked about the clonazepam. He hesitated, but prescribed Xanax (0,5mg). He said it might seem weird to try and ""cure"" withdrawal with another Benzo but that it would be a temporary fix until my meds kick in. He warned that it is also addictive and that we should monitor it, but that it would give me rest. 

I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I really feel like sh\*t and need a fix and know that some anti-anxiety action would be needed for my OCD for a while. But, on the other hand, I don't know how to feel about starting another benzo. Maybe I should try and go through it (???). But then idk if it gets better or worse the second day and I am scared.",05Nov2019,1
115,"For some backstory, I never really thought much about my mental health, whether I had any problems or not. I know that for the past few years life was just sort of dull. I was never really bothered to do anything, going outside seemed like a chore, and the only thing that got me going was having something to look forward to, or having something to be into currently, like video games.

Sometimes when walking past certain places I would get a hint of this feeling that I used to feel in certain memories, it felt very nostalgic, I would for example remember playing with my friends when I was 14 or 15 outside in the park, and there was a strong happy specific emotion associated with it. I always assumed it was the nostalgic emotion of a good memory.

For the past week I had a pretty bad flu, after I recovered from the flu I felt different. Everything just seemed more ""colourful"" emotionally. That feeling that I described when thinking of memories, it is now here all the time. When I go outside I feel happy because I look at the scenery and it just feels so different. Things are much more interesting, I can feel sort of how I felt when I was younger, it is impossible to describe the feeling in words, it's just... I feel like I have been living in a dull world and suddenly its like I went somewhere on vacation, reunited with old friends or something like that but nothing has actually changed.

I feel like I want to do things like cook, I can even see work in a positive light too, and I really hope that this never stops again.

Yesterday I was out with my girlfriend, and I remember I saw a bar, which made me think of bars back from my childhood, with wooden benches outside and big umbrellas on them. I remember I would eat there with my family or friends, it's not really a specific memory, just knowing that bars like this exist, and knowing I visited them and seeing one made me cry. Not from sadness, but I wouldn't say from happiness either, it was just overwhelming. These are feelings I forgot I can even feel.

She's called our family ""toxic"" and refuses to speak to us because we won't legitimize her feelings. To be honest, we've done little else.

127,"Hi everybody

I am in my mid-thirties, divorced from a narcissist and have been struggling with depression, OCD and ADHD since my teenage years. I am currently living off the money I got in the divorce and an unable to work, and never really have been. I've never finished my higher education and until two years ago had never lived on my own. I never held a job longer than six months before descending into deep depression.

I've just been to my psychologist (who is great) and we were going through my 'schematics': the angry child, the punishing person, the demanding person etc. and I suddenly broke down crying over my dog that died thirty years ago. 

See, my dad was (is) a very aggressive man who used to kick my pets and I've hated him because I blamed him for my dog's uterine cancer.
My dad had an explosive personality and you never knew when he would go off. He never really hit me, only once in the face but he did spank me often and hard. I would run away and climb up trees to get away from him and the lured me down with the promise be wouldn't spank me and then he did. I was petrified of him and hated him to point I fantasized about killing him.
My mum used me as her personal psychologist and would say very harsh things: we had to sell our house because of you, we were almost divorced because of you, I could've aborted you (I'm the youngest of a large family). The last one she told me just a few years ago. She used to punish me by locking my in the cellar with the lights out and would sometimes crank up the heat so the boiler would start making these creepy noises. I've always been terrified of the dark and since the age of eight trained myself not to be afraid by locking myself in the bathroom in the dark.

My psychologist said she would be heartbroken if her young son would train himself to withstand punishment. She told me my upbringing was abusive. This shocked me. I knew it wasn't ideal but I now that's also how my parents were brought up themselves so I understood they just did the best they could. I've always felt loved by my mum as a child and by both parents as an adult.

I've forgiven both my parents and have a very close bond with them now. 
But I also recognise that how they treated me as a child was indeed abusive.
I've since have had problems with boundaries. Putting up boundaries scares because I'm afraid of what will happen if I stand up for myself. That's how I've been sexually assaulted many times, have attracted narcissists and always end up getting the short stick in workplace situations.

I'm just so heartbroken and confused now. It's as if I've opened Pandora's box by admitting the abuse. I love my parents.

129,"Semi-long post ahead: 

My boyfriend has been really struggling with work because he has these symptoms and he feels really bad about it. This, on top of pressure from work and his family. Lately what happens is that he gets to his building, and then starts to feel unwell, and then he heads back home. That, or I take him away from his building so he can calm down somewhere, usually at my house where we just talk it out and he’s okay again.

One night, this happened again but a bit more extreme. He left his house (he works the night shift) and told me he didn’t know where he was heading. Eventually he told me where he was and I left work to meet up with him. I took him to my place to talk and to calm down. He did calm down eventually, then when we started talking about what next steps he could take re: work, he started feeling really weak and I couldn’t talk to him because he seemed very disoriented. He would talk but it would sound like he was sleeptalking, almost gibberish. So I took him to the ER because I think he was maybe having an anxiety attack.

The ER doctor did a blood test and some other lab tests and told me everything was fine, physically. But she strongly recommended that he see a Psychiatrist for what’s likely to be depression, and that a strong support system for him is needed. To be honest before these incidents, we had been talking about taking care of our individual mental health together, and scheduling consultations when we can. I think now is really the time, especially for him. 

I need some advice on how I can support him and help him through this 😔 First is to prioritize seeing a psychiatrist and actually getting the help he needs. I promised to go with him and get a consultation soon. After that, what can I do? How do I support him emotionally and mentally, say, on the daily? What concrete things can I do or say that would help?

Now, the past few days he was doing okay and I always made it a point to acknowledge his progress and express how proud I am of him doing okay again. But tonight it happened again and he almost left work and now I feel helpless and worried again :( 

It’s difficult to see him not okay, and at times I feel useless not knowing exactly what I should do whenever he feels unwell before he heads to work, or when his mom has said something to him that invalidates his feelings, or when I feel something’s up again. I just really want to help him and be there for him the best way I can, but sometimes I don’t know what to do. It’s also hard for me to stay strong, but I’m doing my best. I’m just very very very worried. 😔

Sorry it’s my first time to post. I’m nervous about the replies but I know I should seek out help any way I can. Thank you, folks!

TL;DR! My boyfriend has been having frequent anxiety attacks and it has been affecting his work and our relationship. How do I help him through this and support him as his girlfriend?",05Nov2019,1
130,"My wife is struggling greatly with her mental health. She had been prescribed Zoloft and Ativan for many years for GAD, and the latter became a destructive force over the last year. Now that she is no longer taking that, she has began drinking heavily as a replacement (for about a month now). Around 2-3 pm each day, a switch seems to flip in her brain where she loses all ability to control her decision making. It is always the same - she walks over to the store and buys white wine. She knows it will cripple our marriage, but she downs it, becomes intoxicated, and passes out. She also hides alcohol around the house now and compulsively lies in the moment when I catch her. 

While I am at work, I am constantly wondering what is going on when she becomes unresponsive by text or phone call. Of course, I know exactly what is going on. 

Each morning, she feels great remorse and shame. She seems to understand the consequences and vows to not repeat the same mistake...until she does a matter of hours later. I am very concerned for her health and safety and it is definitely affecting my own performance at work, where I serve in a very senior role. The ability to balance the stress of both is becoming impossible. 

I’m looking for any advice from folks who have seen this behavior before. There are major concerns with medication and alcohol abuse and I am unable to break the cycle with her. She has been resistant to professional help.",05Nov2019,3

I don’t want this post to feel to long so here’s a brief overview of the last few years of my life that’s made me spiral out of control mental health wise:
Moved back home as couldn’t cope financially
Brother (12 years old) diagnosed with rare childhood cancer
Had to stop work to support mum and dad and brother and be there for his last 6 months
Brother died 
Lost job due to time off
Had to get loans to cover my own personal bills 
Broke up with girlfriend of 9 years 


Things started to look up for me:
Got a new job
New girl friend 
Really happy with where I was 

Had debts still with previous partner and was lying off more than what I was earning so borrowed more and more and have slipped into massive debt. The new issue then is one of the loans I took out was in my ex partners name I didn’t realise this at the time, my new job deals with peoples finances and she’s reported me to them so now I’ve been suspended with pay pending an investigation.

They’re just friends but it feels like no matter how hard I try, I can’t get over this idea that he should be with her instead and that he secretly wants her instead, despite how much he tells me he loves me. 

I can’t seem to compartmentalize our relationship at work,  and I seem to have a preoccupied attachment style - I keep expecting him to figure out that he doesn’t want to be with me after all. 

How do I get over this constant jealousy and build up my self esteem? It feels like I understand my thoughts very logically but my body is so fight-or-flight and I can’t stop ruminating. I bumped up my SNRI dose which has helped a bit, but it still feels like I’m suffering almost physically from anxiety every single day.

Then came the depression. I took counseling, on different kinds of meds, exercising+ walking dog outside everyday. 

I did good during the first year..then the death of a mentor who actually saved my life (via diagnosis) died traumatically. I'm getting behind in assignments but I had a plan to get myself out. Then my academic advisor told me my academic future looks bleak, even with a 3.79 GPA. She said ""you're not going to do well in this field if you can't get a handle on your grief"" even though I told her I already recognized I needed help and I'm going to grief counseling soon. I don't even remember everything she said but it made me suddenly second guess everything I had decided. My nerves are so bad now. I had class right after but I skipped because I was panickingand I don't hide my feelings well (I didn't want everyone to keep asking what's wrong). I had a panic attack and couldn't stop  

I feel like I need to check myself in for depression (they keep insisting a hardship withdrawal) but I come from a family of military ""will yourself out of it"" people so they won't support me through school anymore. They're already upset I didn't get a job with my bachelors. 

Also I'd have to go far far away because my practicum is at my local psych hospital.

I’ve also been told by my friend that my personality has changed a lot since my inpatient stay. 


On top of those I’ve also been experiencing hallucinations that appear to be getting worse.

143,"Hi! So yesterday I got into a really ugly, one-sided argument where I got berated for saying the word manic. To give you context, I’ve been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and was talking with someone who also has been diagnosed with their own disorders. This is just to say that we both deal with our own issues and that I’m not someone to just carelessly use terms related to mental health.  

In a text after work, I was explaining the day I had and made the comment that for whatever reason, I was feeling a little manic yesterday. The person I was texting informed me that they wished I didn’t use that work so I apologized, stated that I didn’t mean it maliciously and that I was just trying to describe my state of being but that I wouldn’t use it in the future. Even after apologizing, I was patronized for using the word and was made to feel like a petulant, ignorant, and as if my intentions were to make fun of mental conditions which of course that’s not at all the case.

This made me feel absolutely horrible and I went into my second job yesterday in tears for the way I was made to feel. I’m not looking for pity or anything but I want to get other people’s opinions on whether using the word manic to describe your actual state of being is wrong? I’m not bipolar and would never make light of it by saying “omg, I’m feeling so bipolar today” because that’s obviously fucked up. But is “manic” something that people find to be a bad term?

148,"About a year ago, I had a traumatic experience at work. The gist of the story is that my beloved boss of almost nine years threw me under the bus, stopped speaking to me, and I lost my job in a way that was very likely illegal. I ended up suing them for wrongful termination and we settled out of court. 

I trusted my boss. He was like a father figure to me. We were EXTREMELY close platonically, and losing my relationship with him was devastating. I sank into a very deep depression and became irrevocably disillusioned with work and work relationships. I realize now that they ultimately don't give a shit about me, and will throw me under the bus, too, if it serves them. I still believe this today. Thankfully, I came out of it on the other side having had a true spiritual awakening. I feel like a new person, and am able to see the experience as what I needed to have happen to move me on to the next part of my journey. My life is great, although I am very reticent to trust the people I work with. 

All of this being said, I can't forgive him. I have tried VERY hard. I've been writing about it, and reading about it, and asking other people for advice. For the past couple of months, I've been mulling it over whether or not I should send him a holiday card just saying ""hi-hope you're well. You're in the my thoughts,"" as a sort of act of catharsis, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I don't want to hang onto this resentment anymore, but I just can't seem to shake it.

Sunday was when I really lost my shit. Walking places with everything feeling strange, contemplating what would happen if I just laid down in the grass and ignored it all, feeling insane.

Self harmed after ~19 months clean, and last time was the only time in probably like 3+ years. 

But then at times I was just like...fine? More of that mix today and yesterday. Felt tempted to just wander the fucking streets in a daze this morning. Almost went and just laid down in the cold on the pavement in my apt’s parking lot last night. Feeling like I want to just get out of whatever the fuck my life is and I don’t want to do it, even though everything on the outside is totally fine. More violent intrusive thoughts than normal, like wondering if I’d snap out of it if I got hit by a car. Just wanting to do fucking *something* to wake up.

162,"Hey guys,

For the past few years, I am realizing how many of the people in my life face mental health issue and don't know how to bring it up or deal with it? I'm doing my master's in public health right now and I honestly can't bare to see so many people suffer in silence because they don't want to burden others, so I really want to do something about. I myself was in a dark place for some time but finally am seeing light, or at least doing okay right now. Even with my own experience, I sometimes do not know how to help the people close to me that are going through hardship alone.

**In your own opinion, when you think of mental health, what do you think is the biggest issue in healthcare in regards to mental health?** 

I sometimes think those that seek help for their issues get misdiagnosed because it's hard to measure mental illness. Then there are those that confide in others in hope to get help but don't really get it and sometimes people don't really believe they are experiencing mental health issues, which is even worse.

I'm in that phase right now in my career where I want to do something and I will but I need some help because I want to understand these gaps in mental health to the best of my ability, so something purposeful can be implemented.

164,"Hi there, I’m hoping someone here can help me out. Long story short, one of my best friends has developed bad depression over the last three years and it’s taking a toll on her and me. I don’t want to make any generalizations about people with mental health problems because I know many people seek help and are aware of the issue, but this friend’s mental health issues are very detrimental to my own. 

Little background to get a sense of what’s happening, some days it’s good, some days it’s not. When she’s having a bad day it’s like everyone has to have a bad day. Today I was talking about how excited I was our school had new cafeteria options, and she just said it’ll probably suck in a month anyway. I was telling her how excited I was to take AP classes next year and she told me I would just complain about the workload. 

And I get it how much it sucks to feel like you’re in a pit, but *I* can’t mentally handle her being like this constantly. I asked her if everything was okay, if she wanted to talk and she just said “I’m fine” over and over. I know she does it because she doesn’t want to feel like a burden but I don’t know how else to help. I tell her I’m there for her and I get insulted. I already have some anxiety issues and this doesn’t help a bit. 

I’m just torn because when she’s herself she’s like a sister to me. And I can’t be mad at her because I know why she gets like this, but I feel like a punching bag every single day, you know? She just seems so unaware of the effect she has on people. I see so many people with mental health issues who take responsibility for it and who have a network of people supporting them and I want that for her, but I don’t know how. She would 100% benefit from therapy but her family can’t afford it. I want her to know I’m there for her but it’s taking a *heavy* toll on my own life and mental health. Any advice on how to help her respectfully? Thank you so so much.",05Nov2019,1
165,"I started taking Wellbutrin a few weeks ago and have noticed that I get angry SO easily now. Not just annoyed, but furious, over basically nothing.

166,"I’m always so out of it. I used to be kind of sharp but now I just feel slow and dumb. I never get jokes very quickly, and I’m really bad at school. I did use drugs a lot when I was younger, and have cut it down a low in the past year to the point that I’ve been high or drunk maybe 6 times in the past year. 

All my friends die drugs too though, and I’ve talked to them about it and they just think I’m weird when I say it.",05Nov2019,3
167,"I am a 24F who has never been diagnosed with any mental health issues, or any issues at all. I haven’t seen a doctor about my health, but in March of this year I decided to get a therapist and take a depression evaluation but quit after 3 weeks and never got the results. I do not know if I am depressed or not and I feel like I’m making it all up or overreacting if I actually say that I am; although I won’t lie, I do wish I had something wrong with me just to explain what is going on.

Ever since I was in high school, I noticed that I would not eat if I was very sad. At the time my serious boyfriend of 5 years had broken up with me (I know, how serious could it have been at 15 but we were talking about marriage), and I stopped eating, pretty much only eating when around people (at the family dinner table, lunch with friends). But the amount I would eat started to decrease. 

By the time I was a freshman in college I would have hunger pangs so bad from not eating all day that I literally couldn’t do anything. Over time I got used to them. Since that time, I’ve been in another 5 year serious relationship however it’s been very taxing on my emotional health. In short I no longer love him but he doesn’t care and loves me anyways and wants to stay. But he’s not the problem, so breaking up with him won’t make me happy so I see no reason to leave. It’s all very complicated and right now we’re teetering on taking a break for a while. 

However I’m pretty sure that feeling like crying when I think about eating is relatively new. Only this year I believe. And to my knowledge I have only actually cried while eating once, and iirc it was kind of forced. As in I just needed outside stimulation to make the tears come, I was already super sad and feeling like I wanted to cry, so I pulled up some super sad videos. I don’t believe I’ve ever naturally cried without any stimulation while eating, in fact crying like that is hard for me in general. 

What usually happens is that now when I feel like I should eat, I just get that feeling. The one where it feels like a giant wave is going to burst from you and you’ll melt in a puddle of tears. But then it stops right as it would convert into an outward physical sign. Like I’ve stopped myself from expressing any outward sign of the emotion, but I won’t be able to anyways unless I find something super sad to relate to. I’m sorry I’m not describing it well, explaining this is hard for me. 

I have researched maybe trying to see if I had an eating disorder but I’m almost certain I don’t. While I am underweight (and being underweight bothers me on its own), my weight itself doesn’t fuel my eating habits. Starving yourself just because you don’t feel like eating doesn’t meet the qualifications. 

I am really lonely. I have severe attachment issues and tend to be all or nothing in relationships. I have very unrealistic wants and desires when it comes to how people interact with me and I can’t exactly make myself be different about it. So I’ve kind of come to terms with the fact that I’ll be lonely forever. Additionally my motivation to “make things better” is nonexistent. Probably because I don’t really believe things can be better. I don’t really see the point of life, and taking the time and money and energy to eat, let alone make food seems like an insurmountable mountain. I should also mention that I only feel like crying in response to eating when I’m alone. If I don’t feel alone due to being with people then I won’t feel like crying.",05Nov2019,1
168,"**TRIGGER WARNING: ABUSE**

This is long. TL;DR at the bottom but I don’t think it’d make much sense if you don’t read the post in its entirety.

I know this is a stupid question and that I shouldn’t be asking people if I have a mental illness but I don’t know what to do and a few opinions would be comforting. Be as blunt as you want, tell me I’m being dramatic or silly if I am. 

I should start off my saying that my mom (43) sees a psychiatrist, is on medication and has been suffering from severe depression, Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder Type 1 since she was about my age, maybe a few years older. I know it’s important to mention that because it’s a risk factor.

Now it’s time to describe myself and and my symptoms, which’ll be all over the place because that’s how I am unfortunately. But I’ll try my hardest to sound coherent and at least make this shit flow.

Bit of childhood background, I was raised in a low-income family, my parents were both abusive in every way possible (verbal, sexual, physical, emotional/mental, neglect) like one parent contributed to one side of abuse and the other parent to the other. I grew up witnessing severe domestic violence inflicted on my mother and I witnessed her manic episodes. I changed schools at least 6 times due to unstable housing which sometimes required us to stay in a homeless shelter. I was endlessly bullied in school since I was in 3rd grade and that didn’t end until I graduated high school.

I had my fair share of teenage angst in high school from being bullied at school and at home and thought I was depressed blah, blah. But now that I look back on it, I wish I could tell my 15 year old self that she hasn’t *seen* depression yet. I mean, maybe I was depressed but I’d take how I felt internally then over how I feel now.

Everything changed once I turned 18 and graduated high school. I don’t know what happened. The first thing I noticed was that I dropped my favorite hobby (writing fiction) cold turkey. Between the ages of 15-18, I had written two novels and now I couldn’t even get a sentence out. I was stuck. It seemed that I just didn’t know how to do it anymore. I was crying every single night, feeling horrible about myself. I thought about suicide almost every day. I hardly ate. I was so small. When I turned 19, these feelings and emotions remained but they intensified. I still wasn’t writing, I hated myself, I took a few loose pills I saw hanging around the house. I didn’t care what they were or what they could do. I just wanted them to heal me. If they killed me, then oh well. Win win. To be honest, I can’t even remember anything that happened last year besides being miserable. It’s all a blur to me.

This year I turned 20. And I met tons of new symptoms or weird things that weren’t happening before. Starting February 14, 2019. Like mentioned, I have a history of sexual abuse. Three men in particular played their own part: my father, my grandmother’s boyfriend and my first cousin. Don’t wanna get into details but that cousin ended up flashing himself to me regularly and it was like... a massive trigger. First night he did it, I cried all night and didn’t sleep until 4am, the next day at my college, I was incredibly jumpy and had periods of running out of class because a panic attack would sneak up on me and I’m in the public restroom sobbing on my knees. However, I got through that. It took a few months. But ever since that event, nothing with me has been the same.

I don’t even know where to start, like, there’s so much shit to unpack, but here we go!

My depression symptoms like sadness, emptiness, irritability, suicide ideations, feelings of worthlessness, loss of enjoyment/motivation etc are always, always here and have been for the past two years. There’s never a moment went it’s not. But these other things are new. I struggle heavily with paying attention. In school, I can’t stay focused in a lecture for even five minutes without having to occupy myself with something different. At home it’s hard to follow along in conversations with others. I notice that my lack of social skills is quite annoying to them. It’s kind of like they’re talking to a robot when they talk to me, there’s not a lot of input or emotional reactions. But that’s mainly because I don’t feel comfortable with my family. I am quite forgetful. I always forget to do routine chores. If I’m leaving the house and I lock the door, I take a few steps before I panic, “Did I lock the door??” Better go check and make sure. Completing tasks and being thorough, whether it’s school work or housework is too difficult for me, to the point where I get overwhelmed.

My thoughts are always crowded, there’s never a moment of rest because I’m always worried or stressed about something. I’m extremely sensitive. Extremely. Someone says one little thing or does something that I don’t like and I’m livid. It’s like I have this thing in my head where I believe that people are a threat. Even those I’ve always known. My feelings about certain people fluctuate and I either like you or not. But this changes rapidly, so I could “hate” you for two hours and then I love you again. I used to ruin friendships because somehow, I felt that these people were not my friends and my insecurities/worries would drive them away. I’d tell them that they hate me and that I annoy them and that they have better friends than me. Everyone is mad at me, I just know it. 

When I’m really stressed out, that’s when things get bad. Suddenly, the world is against me. The guy next to me on the bus is tapping his foot purposely to get under my skin. The lady who followed me from aisle 3 into aisle 4 is watching me and following me. Who knows, she probably has a plot to kidnap me or kill me or something. The students in my class who are laughing behind me are laughing at me, they’re absolutely making fun of me. And at home, my aunt (who I live with) hates me. She’d do anything to get rid of me, I’m the last one she’d save in a fire. 

The worst part is that when I am in this state, no one can convince me otherwise. Because *I just know it*. It’s quite pathetic and frustrating.

Also, when I am this stressed, I tend to have a hard time sleeping at night. I feel like there are bugs crawling all over my lower body as I try to sleep. That’s no analogy, that’s how it feels. Like roaches or something are crawling all over me. When I turn on my flashlight on my phone, there’s nothing there. But I feel them. And now I’m scratching my skin until it’s red, feeling like/knowing there’s a presence in my room and crying at 1am.

I try not to stress myself out to that point because it’s one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. I’m better off without it.

My self esteem is really low and so is my self confidence. I hate myself 99% of the time. But there’s something else that I’ve noticed that makes everything so confusing. I have periods where I feel okay. Periods where I don’t hate myself, where I’m not suicidal or really depressed. I’m in one right now. These periods don’t last really long (maybe a week or two long) and they aren’t that great, but whatever. In these periods, I feel like my depression is gone. I think to myself “maybe I’m not really depressed, maybe it was all in my head after all”. I have motivation to write, I’m creative, my mind seems to be working, ‘cause usually it feels like my mind is frozen. Not frozen, I can’t find the right word :( basically it feels like my brain doesn’t work when I’m in my “normal” state. A little exaggerated but it feels like I have brain damage or that my IQ is dropping.

Anyway, when I’m in my fake happiness period, that disappears. I suddenly feel like I can achieve my goals, I walk in school feeling like I’m more interesting than the other girls. I feel good about myself. I feel like every guy who looks at me must like me. Then when this is over, I crash hard. Back to my normal depressive self. It sucks.

I think one of the worst parts for me is that I truly feel like I have no identity or personality. I am always imitating another woman or trying to mold myself into another woman. Sometimes even physically. It’s like I don’t know who I am. I don’t have a personality.

I think I’m gonna end here. My brain hurts and I know I should’ve been more descriptive but I just can’t do it right now. Please excuse all errors made and thank you so much for taking time out to read this. I’m also open to any questions or PMs.

TL;DR: I feel that I have either BPD or BD because my mother has both and I think I may be showing some symptoms of them that have been persistent since February 2019. However, it could just be me being dramatic but I’m not sure.",05Nov2019,2

171,"I noticed over the last few years that my interest in social media blossomed into a full on obsession and I drove myself crazy by comparing looks, Likes, followers equating that to me self worth. I had to drop my main platforms to claw my way back from the brink. My last set of Twitter posts were very dark and full of self loathing. After I posted them a switch went off in my brain and I realized that I needed to get out. So I deleted Instagram, Twitter and made my Facebook private (friends and family only). I thought this would help me heal, however lately I have noticed that on friend chats I have become very impatient and bitchy. These chats are generally safe space because everyone knows people there in person, even if their opinions such.
I have told off people that I have known, perhaps not very well, but I was able to tolerate them before. Now, when I read something stupid I am likely to tell them off and then block!
It’s happened 3 times now in the span of 2 weeks. Not sure if I need to be worried or if this is a healthy reaction to sticking up for myself, regarding my opinions (and plain facts!) as more important than trying to make peace with someone who, it turns out, is not that important to me and is a condescending, smarmy, little pick anyways. 
Anyway, pro: off social media, limited access to photos and video that harm my self esteem, getting more assertive, cons, becoming more critical, opinionated and bitchy.",05Nov2019,1
172,"I once read someone ask on this sub; ""I wonder what it's like to be mentally healthy."" I consider myself mentally healthy. I have no history of depression, anxiety or any other mental illness. Sure, I've had my ups and downs, feeling low, feeling unloved, feeling unworthy. But nothing to be called a mental illness. 

This is my post, trying to explain what it's like to be ""mentally healthy.""

As mentioned, I have no history of any mental illness. I have never been admitted to a hospital due to psychological concerns nor met a therapist. I've had a healthy upgrowing, even though I were, at periods, bullied for various reasons. But I did have friends around and feel like I've had easy connecting to other people during my life. I guess this has been part of my protection. Whenever I felt down, I have turned myself to my family or close friends for support, and they have always been there for me, as I have been there for them. During my late teenage years I battled alot with insecurity and identity issues. At periods I drank and smoked weed a lot as a way of coping my insecurity issues, but I went out fine. I got into the study of my choice, found a girl I truly love and she truly loves me, and I have never been more content with my life than I am today.

Sometimes I might feel guilty for doing so well in life. Like, what did I do to deserve being this content in life? I don't know. Nothing special I guess. There are loads of people who are much better people than I am, and it seems to be no guarantee of being mentally healthy. Perhaps a tad of luck with genes and environment? But why me? So many people are suffering in this world. Why would I deserve to be happy?  
Sometimes I am also scared of when the catastrophe will happen. There is no chance I can walk around feeling this good all this time. Sometime, something awful will happen to me. Someone close to me will die. This is unevitable. Am I sturdy enough to get through such a challenge? I can only hope.  
Somtimes I think being mentally well makes me weaker to tackle challenges in life. What will I do when a true challenge is presented to me? Will I conquer it? Will I bow down?

I usually end up reading on this sub about different issues people are battling with. And I wish things could be better for all of you who are truly struggling with mental illness. I wish I could have the strength to help someone in need. I wish I would have the courage to see love when no one else does for someone. I wish I could help more than I do, if I do. I wish I could see the people behind the masks so I can be there when you feel unwell. I wish we could all help out each other more. I wish I could. Because I truly believe, despite whatever surroundings or genes we have, we all can and deserve to be happy.",05Nov2019,17

174,"I have struggled with my mental health for a very long time. Depression, dissociation, self-loathing, suicidal thoughts (one unsuccessful attempt.) I haven’t had good experiences with therapy or medication in the past and have found ways to cope with it on my own, which includes some unhealthy mechanisms. (Substance abuse, isolation, punishing myself.)

This is where the subject gets touchy; I’m not here to be judged or harassed, so please do not attack me. I know lots of women/couples struggle to conceive and don’t want to hear about a woman being ungrateful for accidental conception. I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub; I’m not sure what is the correct one and I just need some help. 
A few weeks ago I discovered I’m pregnant. I do not want to be. My husband and I have had failed pregnancies in the past that made me realize I really don’t want to be a mother. I never have been fond of children or babies, I wasn’t one for baby dolls as a kid. 
My husband and I of course had the parenting conversation as we were getting to know each other - he’s always wanted to be a father, but was okay if that wasn’t the way our life turned out. 
Upon our recent discovery, he’s ecstatic. I’m not. At all. 
My depression is through the roof. I feel trapped, killing myself is no longer an option. It would destroy our marriage if I opted to terminate or for adoption. I keep trying to play along, make the best of it. I am failing hard and don’t know how to begin to approach the subject with him or anyone else. 
We can hardly afford our bills, I don’t know how will we afford this or if I could even afford a therapist. 
The most consistent solution in my head is to wait til after the birth and kill myself while the baby is young and does not know me. I have not been taking care of myself properly, I’ve had several break downs involving alcohol, which I ABSOLUTELY know is wrong. And then the thought that I’ve already damaged its development sending me even further into this dark hole and I return back to that desperate need to escape reality. 

I don’t know who to talk to, where to turn, how to cope. 
please someone tell me there’s a support group for this, or that they’ve experienced something similar and it had worked out positively. I should be falling in love with this little life inside me, but I hate it and I want my autonomy back. I feel so alone.

Ive combed my thoughts for psychological defense mechanism and logical fallacies to ensure that my truth, would be THE truth. The most objective view of reality i could find. Now, ofcourse, i cannot type the sum of all that in a single reddit post, but i will write the one of disturbing truths ive discovered, the posts that other subreddits deemed ""wrong"" according to whatever.

I ask only to be proven wrong. Because if i am right well, there truly is no hope for any of us.

Well here it goes:

White feather campaign.

All  this talk about equality and feminism is ultimately bogus and just a  manipulation tactic to pit men against each other for the benefit of  society.

But dont take my word for it:

As psychologist Roy Baumeister [said](https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/?_%20php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0):

&gt;“What  seems to have worked best for cultures is to play off the men against  each other, competing for respect and other rewards that end up  distributed very unequally.” Whereas women get rewarded for “being” men  get rewarded for “doing” – “Men have to prove themselves by producing  things the society values… That basic social insecurity of manhood is  stressful for men… but that insecurity is useful and productive for the  culture, the system.”

One of THE WORST offenses of this kind was the ""[White feather campaign](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/White_feather)""

&gt;In  August 1914, at the start of the First World War, Admiral Charles  Fitzgerald founded the Order of the White Feather with support from the  prominent author Mrs Humphrey Ward. The organization aimed to shame men  into enlisting in the British Army by persuading women to present them  with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform.

In the end the biological truths reign supreme.

And one such truth is that our pursuit of equality is pointless, infact it is pointless in all sexually dimorphic species.

The main idea behind sexual dimorphism is using statistical odds to achive some kind ""success"" in a chaotic system.

In short, men are dice and women are an arbitrary standard based on which a dice roll is decided to be ""good"" or ""bad"".

Dont take my word for it [machine learning is based on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo)

Just like in the video you have 1000's of ~~men~~ bots tasked with a ""job"" to survive. In the end scores are tallied the top % of ~~men~~ bots are kept while the rest are discarded. What works is kept what isnt, isnt.

\---That is why it is pointless to tell ~~men~~ bots to ""just work on your self"", beacuse as much as you work on your self the function that defines the % of ~~men~~ bots that are kept is dynamic.---

\---The standard ~~women~~ always adapts so that a certain % of total pool of ~~men~~ bots is discarded. Repeat ad infinitum and you get Einstein at the expense of countless ~~men~~ bots.---

However not all is lost. The theory of [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract)  says that, basically, long time ago life was hard and death lurked  around every corner. One day 2 weak men (weak being a crucial detail)  have decided to work together in a world that was defined by the law of  nature ""might makes right"". It is these 2 weak men that have built the  foundation of civilisation. Weak men were the founders because strong  men just took whatever ever they wanted. Strong men dont need  civilisation they prosper regardless of anything.

Now i have simplified the situation to get the point across but i didnt affect the truth too much.

The  truth is that women are also subject to a standard however since men  are more expendable, the amount of women who didnt make the ""machine  learning cut"" is substantially lower than in the case of men

Equality  will never be achieved unless women willfully revoke their power of  selection because as long as the cycle of men competing continues, men  who survive the cut will, by deduction, be superior than women and  therefore not equal, while the rest die.

The social contract and civilisation has died long ago, we can still revive it.

Or  we can continue to rabidly pit men against each other in the  gladiatorial arena of life like ""civilised savages"" the Romans were",05Nov2019,1

I've always felt this way in high places, like wanting to jump when I'm in a high building or something, and apparently more people feels this way, so I thought it was normal, but I've been experiencing more and more of those feelings with things that doesn't make any sense, like throwing my phone over the window.

183,"Not looking for advice here, I'm asking if there's a condition I'm overlooking.  


Personally I think I'm somewhere on the spectrum but my symptoms are vastly reduced when under the affects of caffeine (when I'm ""hyped up"" so to speak) or on alcohol (social inhibitions gone) to nearly non-existence.

  
Sometimes I'll hold eye contact especially when I tell myself to do that, other times I won't.  It's completely random.  


85% of the time I'm happy being asocial or only spending time with a SO, 15% of the time I crave social interaction.  


But in all of these situations, if I focus on correcting the behavior I can.  In the past year I moved to a new area knowing no one on the  tail end of a relationship ending.  I forced myself to attend a meetup that had 70\~+ confirmed attendees and I basically spent 10 minutes splashing water in my face and prepping myself at the venue.  When I actually showed up, I had a ton of fun.  But it feels like I always need to prep myself for this.

I'm also extremely direct and not afraid of confrontation which I'll handle as logically and nicely as possible.

Can someone like me still be considered potentially on the spectrum if I can fake my way around it socially?",05Nov2019,6

However, in the last few days I’ve been feeling much better and things are starting to feel normal again. Now I don’t want to waste the therapists time, or my parents money if I’m feeling ok now, but at the same time, this might just be a brief period of feeling ok and I might feel horrible again in a few days so I don’t want to cancel the appointments when it took so longer to get them.

186,"So luckily for me, my depression and anxiety don’t manifest themselves as a day to day thing. I’ll go through months of being “stable”, and then I’ll go through a stressful thing or have something happen to me, and I’ll start getting anxious, then panicked. I have GAD with some panic disorder thrown into the mix. I’m medicated, and being followed by a psychiatrist.

Basically, I feel, after 2 years, that my meds have stopped working as well. I feel like I’m falling into a depressive episode. I’m only starting to get sexual side effects from my meds now after 2 years, so I’ve been feeling pretty numb down there. It made me a little anxious, and now the anxiety (or something else) has caused my appetite to just drop to almost nothing. I can barely look at food now and not gag a little. I’m always feeling kinda nauseous around food. I’m also tired a lot, and if I have a day off, I can sleep until 1-2pm. I’ve also been getting cold and hot flashes. I’ll wake up sweating profusely, take off my blanket, but then feel chilled and feverish. I feel like I’m wasting away, and I don’t know how to snap out of it. I have an appointment with my family doctor and my psychiatrist at the end of the month. Usually I get out of these “funks” but the last time it hit me hard, I wasn’t able to and I had to be medicated. What are your guys’ methods of mitigating this downward spiral?

189,"I've had a sinus infection for weeks (I have an appt tomorrow) and just started ADHD meds for the first time as a young adult and they're messing with me. 

I commute an hour and a half each way, four days a week to go to school in a program for something I care about. But because I spend so much time in the car, I really don't have a life in either place because I don't have time. It's also messing with my studies. 

My best friend keeps having depressive isolation episodes, my other friends have drama. My other best (guy) friend that I have history with, has gone uncharacteristically AWOL and I'm assuming he's dealing with shit, so I'm trying to let him. He knows I'm here when he's ready, but it's difficult. 

For background, I moved back in with my parents last year after splitting a car in half, so I could heal from the resulting injuries. 

My dog and cat are happy and not alone while I'm gone while they're there. I work the days I dont go to school and I am going to pick up hours at the gas station (it's a chain and they're happy to let me help out at both) in the town my school is in too. That job also kills me with it's dead endedness, but they work with me and that's nice. I feel like I owe them a little.

I'm just feeling so lost and lonely. I want to move to the town my school is in so I can try to have a life there. But I will have to work more and so my animals will have to be alone more and won't have my family and their pets.
On the other hand I will be able to do what I want with them and myself without having to worry about what my parents think like I do right now, which is probably the hardest part about moving back home. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be more grateful for everything they've done for me. But I miss my freedom. 

I also feel like an outsider in my program already. Flashbacks to high school being the wallflower that people like fine but don't invite places or have inside jokes with, etc. 

I'm just feeling lost, alone, and confused. I don't know which feelings to act on right now, or if I should just move further away and start all over again. If anyone made it this far, bless you. And I'm not really religious, haha. I just don't know what to do, and more than anything, just need some support and encouragement that I'm not fucking up every single thing I do.

190,"Firstly I just want to say I'm very thankful for forums such as this, we all need some kind of outlet to vent or a place to seek help. I don't really know where to begin so I'm just going to dive right in as best as I can.

I (24m) have been in a constant battle with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I wake up and do my best to put on a brave face. put my mind to rest and give effort to making the day as good as it can be, and within an hour I'm stoned and basically paralyzed on my couch. I thought it was work that was making me depressed at first, so I left my job about 2 months ago. And while I no longer have the stress of working in a stressful job environment I now face the overbearing stress of unemployment. I don't have anything to lose, except maybe the roof over my head if I overstep my boundaries (I live at home) or my car if I can't keep up with my payments, you would think that the situation as is would motivate me to do more but no matter what I just feel paralyzed. I feel like I'm not in control of my mind and now I feel the same way about my life.

Earlier this year my Mom got a marijuana card due to a condition she's currently dealing with, so we've been pretty stocked up on weed for months and I've pretty much been using it daily just to function. To be honest though at this point it feels more like a distraction, and I truly hate the notion that I need a distraction from life every day, it makes me feel weak and like I cannot cope with any sort of struggle or disappointment.

My social life is pretty much in shambles. I was abruptly separated from two of my best friends recently, one moved away to start life anew with his fiance earlier this year, the other is currently in prison (it's been about 2 years now and hes due for release sometime next year). My 3rd best friend moved out of town years ago and only comes to visit every now and then, so aside from phone conversations I don't see him very often. I have plenty of people whom I could maybe consider friends, I know them mostly through networking (I am a musician and I go to events here and there). But despite that I don't feel a particular closeness to them, at least not in the way I do of my best friends. I've never really been good at meeting people, I struggle a lot with my self worth (I'll get more into that shortly) and I feel very insecure when talking to new people for the first time, which I often feels leaves a bad first impression. Overall I spend pretty much all of my time alone because of this, I'm a little introverted but I enjoy the right type of company. And I feel like I often rob myself of opportunities to meet new people because of my insecurities.

Knowing all of that it's no surprise that I struggle with women as well, but my struggle with women isn't as simple as my general struggle with socializing. I've had some very negative experiences with the women in my life that have caused me to question my self worth over time, as well as develop some serious trust issues that plague me to this day. I meet women every now and then that I find attractive or show interest in but then negative thoughts just flood my head until I'm discouraged to pursue them, and then that just puts me in a mode where I basically just hate myself.

I could go on all day but I'm thankful to have at least gotten that much off of my chest. I really feel oftentimes that I have nowhere to turn and this just makes me feel worse because then I feel trapped. I tried to go to a doctor years ago and all they did was give me a prescription for a  drug that probably would have made things worse ( I don't take medicine) and I don't really trust anyone I know to talk about my issues. Therapy is likely my next step, overall I'm just trying to find the root of my issues and why they affect me so deeply and not just trying to run away from them. If anyone has any perspective or advice it is truly appreciated.",05Nov2019,1
191,"To preface: I'm a 23-year old man, and I've been officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. 

Everything feels so hopeless. I feel so lonely. 

My gf and I of seven years broke up recently (I did it because I felt we'd drifted/grew spart), and I feel so lost. We're still friends, and I don't miss her in that way, so that's nice, I suppose. She har her own problems, so it ended up with us being together everyday - even if I wanted to do something else. 

Some days it feels like I haven't grown up since we first got together. I really don't have anyone to talk to, except for a few friends, but it feels like I'm bothering them. 

I used to be pretty determined about what I want to do for a living, but recently I have begun doubting it. It feels like part of my identity is missing. 

I've tried inviting myself to events, or inviting others to events to try to get to know new people. It almost always ends up with people not being interested in talking with me. If I'm drunk it helps, so I really look forward to parties, because it feels like that is the only time I can be myself, but that also worries me because I'm afraid of becoming an alcoholic (I know I can control myself, I only drink like once or twice a month, but then it's like half a liter of pure vodka, beers and such). 

I also really want bodily contact like hugs and cuddling, but I don't know anyone who wants as well. I had a friend that I used to cuddle, but suddenly she didn't want to anymore, and I'm worried she finds med disgusting or something.",05Nov2019,1

I just started University and live in a dorm inside the campus. Being a university student is great, I made some friends and we talk a lot. However lately I started to think that I was a non-essential part of the group. Not that they did anything to make me think this, these are really all in my head and I fucking hate that. For example, I have an insecurity problem, big time. If someone tops me on something I'm remotely good at, I get jealous,and I try and fail miserably to stand out. I always try to get noticed and be the center of attention. I make jokes for the sake of making a joke and sometimes I knowingly humiliate myself in the process. And I have this fucked up thing, in this friend group I text with someone a lot. Mostly I send memes and I'd like to think that she enjoys them, and she tells me so. However when that friend gets close with someone else on the same group, I get jealous. Last night they went to a concert together and I didn't want to go because I was tired. Totally normal, right? Well 10 minutes later I was depressed because they were spending time together. I know it's not a normal reaction but I legitimately can't help it. I always feel out of place, like they don't want me. Couple of hours ago one of them texted me, 'hey come on, we are going to play some cards.' Apparently the two of them went out of campus to buy wine. That's also pretty normal, but they agreed on this privately and while that's also pretty fucking normal, I still got jealous and felt I was the odd one out. Our friend group consists of 11 people (the ones I'm talking about are just two of them) and we drank wine and played cards as 5 people. It was fun but we also chatted quite a bit. Turns out one of our other friend is homosexual and one of them is bisexual. That's great of them to come out, it was a really nice conversation, but for some reason it felt like they were out of my league (friendship wise) and it really confused my mind. That's another thing, I'm always thinking about this stuff. It really gets in my head. Anyways then the two friends I mentioned above (the one I texted) took a walk around the campus because one of them had to share something with the other. The other two went to the toilet and I sat there alone for a minute or two. And during that time I felt like a piece of shit. I felt like they didn't want me there, they didn't like me when normally they were acting normal. I'm sorry this post is getting very long but I really needed to vent and I really need advice. I was thinking of therapy but where I live, the 'good' ones are pretty rare and I don't really have that kind of budget. I'm sorry if this is inappropriate for this sub.",05Nov2019,2

It's not a social thing, people dont bother me but I have an immense sense of guilt every time. I feel guilty and get hyper sensitive while its going on. I dont want to have complicated orders, always get water unless the waiter isnt busy at all, always tip a ton extra, dont ask for anything if they forgot something....  if a place is busy I rarely go in. I always do self check out to make it easier on workers at grocery stores. 

Stupidest part is that I've worked in the food industry and still do (management) for years. I know people dont mind serving me, but cant get past it. I won't go or try to make plans during busy dinner hours. I won't order fancy drinks from restaurants that I want to try. I wont ask for an order to be changed in any way at all.

When we first got this assignment I was excited at the prospect of it. I used to love to write years ago when I was in high school but haven't really written anything original in years because I never had the time or motivation. But now it was for class so I was looking forward to it.

Skip ahead two months and I feel so frustrated every time I have to work on it. I've started and deleted three really shitty projects because I either hated them completely or couldn't make them go anywhere. My depression and anxiety have both been really bad the past while and I feel like all my creativity is gone.

My mom has some undiagnosed mental illness, and she's always been crazy; and thus, my living environment has been extremely toxic. I've grown used to it, but this was compensated through constant argument. I'd asked for therapy in the past, but I've been so overwhelmed by academics and extracurriculars I thought it'd be counter productive, just overwhelming myself more. But for my whole life, or at least since my sister left for college (I was 11), my mom has taken her anger out on me. She'd justify this by saying that she does other things, like cleaning around the house, driving me places and doing the laundry, which is true. I am way to dependent on my mother. Anyway, my mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few months ago. So now, she has even more anger and stress in her life, and even more of a burden gets put in me. When I try to help she says ""I didn't ask for your help"" but then she says I never help her. I have aspirations to get into an Ivy League college and she says I won't get in and I don't work hard enough. She says everything I do, even if it's studying, is a waste of time and I should focus on something else. And yet today, the one time I say ""please stop saying these things I can't fucking deal with you talking about my college"" she starts crying and says I don't understand the situation. Maybe I'm in denial. But what I do know is that these last few months of my life have been so hard on me and I'm not in a healthy mental state at all. So I come to you.",05Nov2019,3
