1,"My mental health has been horrible for as long as I can remember. Once I turned 21, I turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism. When I turned 25 I decided to get a grasp on my mental health. I started exercising, went to therapy, quit smoking weed and cigarettes, and worked really hard to find who I really was. I knew alcohol would hold me back from this journey, so I quit drinking before I started my journey. Quitting drinking opened up a lot of doors for me. It was difficult at first, but I was no longer exhausted and feeling sick all the time. It was really difficult having to face my emotions instead of drowning them out, but the more time I spent processing them, the easier they became to deal with. 

I’ve been sober for 1.5 years. This wasn’t my intention. I intended to spend one year without alcohol just to show myself that it should never be a daily thing. Drinking has a time and place and when you’re sad and alone isn’t it. I’m getting to the point where I’d like to reintroduce liquor to my life in moderation. I’d like to get buzzed at a party, I’d like to have a drink on vacation, and I’d like to have a drink with dinner when celebrating a big occasion. Obviously, in my year and a half of being sober I learned that this isn’t necessary, but I just have to know if I can. 

My question is: for those of you who used alcohol to cope; were you able to go back to casual use? I feel like once you’re labeled an “alcoholic” there is no going back. I guess I just hate identifying with this label when I don’t think that’s the case. I’ve smoked weed since I quit, and I found I was no longer interested like I used to be, so I stopped buying it. I tried smoking an e cigarette one day when i was stressed out, and I found that I didn’t have an interest in that anymore and threw it out. I’m hoping maybe I’ll have a drink and think it’s alright but won’t make it a regular thing, but I’m afraid. 

TL;DR: I’ve been sober for over a year and I’d like to try drinking in moderation. Have any of you abused alcohol and were able to go back to drinking in moderation?",04Sep2019,2

3,"a lot of my thoughts have been making absolutely no sense whatsoever, not even to myself. it's just absolute jibberish or real words but just random and senseless and repeat over and over for no reason in my head. i've also been dissociating for about two days straight now and i'm just freaking out because this doesn't usually happen to me. i don't feel present and it's like my brain itself is [zalgo](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Zalgo).

Also, on the delusions and such i’ve been seeing cats all day, which isn’t weird because i gave cats but i have black cats and i’ve been seeing white ones, i saw one run upstairs and one running in my garden when i woke up and i just get so scared because i feel like i’m all alone in this and i want someone to speak to but i feel stupid for asking for help when people will probably think i’m making it al up but it’s so scary",04Sep2019,1
5,"I've been Depressed for about 5 years and at the start of 2018 I had my first Major mental breakdown and ended up in hospital, since then I've been in CAMHS and it caused my social anxiety to skyrocket to a whole other level during this time I've been on different medication for my depression and anxiety but none have worked so I stopped. A while ago my Psychiatrist said i had a lot of Aspergers traits so i went for a diagnosis, when i got my diagnosis my Psychiatrist said it was normal for me to be depressed because i'm not accepting my autism but I've been depressed many years before I got my diagnosis and i feel like everyone around me forgot about my depression.  I feel like everyone in my family doesn't think it's there and it's just my social anxiety and it's starting to make me feel horrible because i don't want to remind them that i'm still depressed because i'd feel like i'm attention seeking but i don't want to let it go because i feel like i'm in the worse place in my life right now. In my eyes the only reason they don't think i'm depressed is because i stopped self harming a year ago and that because I stopped I don't think about it but that's not true. I'm more suicidal than I've ever been and the only reason i refuse to act on that is my Snake because i know my mum hates snakes and if I went she would get rid of her so i'm going to keep fighting but i feel like i'm barely supporting the weight on my back and i'm waiting for it to inevitably come crashing down again.

Ill notice it then everything is like ultra vivid and I feel uncomfortable. Its like walking into a classroom and everyone stops talking and looks at you. Thats the feeling I get when i get the vivid/aware feeling. I feel wierd and I dint feel normal anymore. I am 15 and smoke weed a lot, maybe its because I am burnt out? I cant tell what it is and why I get it. Its effecting my classes because Ill zone out into a tunnel of thought of why the hell I feel like this. Does anyone else get it? What is this? Why?

We're not good enough friends for me to help him so its awkward and I don't know how to deal with it.

I can't really change the conversation.. as it's not really a normal point but if I keep talking about it, he gets deeper and more of me not being able to help 

I've offered to go to biking, and just chill and we do do some stuff but.. not really enough to be friend friends.. he's also like 6-7 years older then me (19), that would bother me a tiny bit.. I'd don't feel qualified giving life advice to a 26-27 year old

9,"As a middle child, feeling overlooked and unimportant is common, and I was one of those people who felt the effects of this.  Naturally when I was younger, I was confident and a leader for those around me.  I loved making people laugh and met new people with ease.  

Even then, however, there were signs of my fear of rejection.  When teachers or coaches gave me criticism, I took the criticism personally and scolded myself for not being better.  This wasn’t a huge problem for me then, as I was still confident, had friends, and had prowess at school and sports.  My elementary school time was fun-filled and exciting.  Popularity never really crossed my mind, as everyone was nice to me and had fun with me.  I still had problems with frustration of criticism, but nothing red flag raising.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, I had a fear of rejection, which only gets worse with time.

Then, middle school happened and our two elementary schools merged to create a unified middle school.  At first, I was eager to meet new people and quickly made new friends, some which I am still friendly with today.  Around this time I also got my first smartphone.  I began to realize groups of my friends began hanging out without me, and this knowledge, added with my friend telling me that I used to be the most popular kid in school (still unsure if this was true or not, but at the time I believed it) really took a toll on my confidence.  My craving for social status became insatiable and I tried to force myself back circle of friends which I had once been a part of.  I was unsuccessful, and despite making a new group of friends a year later, I had already convinced myself I was the problem, and that I could never fit in (I already saw myself as sort of an outsider because of my ethnic name and ‘unique’ description I got frequently).

A 6th grade year which should’ve been remembered for finding a new circle of friends I would get close with in the next two years is now remembered as the last year I believe I had some confidence.  A rocky 6th grade ‘relationship’ and some ups and downs (,and in retrospect, it had way more ups than downs,) stole my confidence. The lack of confidence seemed natural at first, such as getting nervous talking to a cute girl.  However, by 8th grade this had developed into nervousness talking to anyone who I deemed ‘cool,’ or just new people at all.  One of the red flags which appeared around this time is my tiredness and procrastination.

I still had my group of friends, and my friends from swimming, but I became spineless.  In fact, when a girl agreed to go to semi, then changed her mind I wasn’t mad in the slightest, and was more relieved I didn’t have to bear my own awkwardness.  

Freshman year was a huge time of change.  I had started to realize my anxiety talking to people, and decided I would make an effort to talk to new people everyday.  However, since the underlying issue wasn’t social anxiety, I was still able to become friendly with new people.  I failed to see that I wasn’t inviting friends to hangout like I used to.  As my friend group fell apart to new people, drugs, and sport team friend circles (sports teams tend to form their own clique, and I play for a club outside of school), I looked outward.  I remained friendly with my once close circle but we gradually drifted apart.

By sophomore year, I was determined to find a new friend group and once again have a circle of friends at school which I longed for.  Yet my fear of rejection had amplified, leading to believe I had social anxiety.  By believing I had social anxiety, I brought my awareness to my conversational skills which only hurt my social skills making me more awkward.  I probably could have found a new friend group, as some of my friends from my old circle had invited me to hangout with their new friends.  But when we hung out, I was hit hard with social anxiety brought upon by fear of rejection and isolated myself.  

During summer, after sophomore year, and after 2 months of practicing conversations and reflecting, I realized I social anxiety isn’t my main affliction.  I could hold a conversation, even with people I was slightly intimidated by once I got to know them a bit.  However, by the beginning of junior year, within the first few days, my old habits of isolating myself and anxiety of social interactions locked up.  This time I knew something else was up.  But what?  That’s when I found a link off a WikiHow page which described fear of rejection.

I looked up fear of rejection, the symptoms matched perfectly.  Where this stemmed, I’m not sure, all I know is the fear is irrational and controlling my life negatively.  While I still have a close group of friends from my club swim team, I miss the days where I was friends with everyone.  That’s why today, from my main account where my friends may possibly see (I’m still not confident enough to tell them my affliction, but hopefully soon I can gain the confidence), I am ready to finally fight my fear of rejection.  So far, I am committing myself to putting myself out there, expressing myself more (even when it’s negative), and facing rejection.  Since I was young, I had always told myself, if I had to die then I will go down swinging.  Now, I believe it’s time to apply that to my life (with lower stakes obviously), which means I will try, as it is better to try and fail than to have never tried.  I will need motivation, however, as anything telling me I’m wrong and don’t need to change may sway me.

Please, let me know your experiences and motivation, as I need all the help I can.

TLDR:  I have had a fear or rejection most of my life, but believed it to be social anxiety.  Now I am realizing the cause and am trying to fight it.  Please give tips and stories or just motivation.  Thanks!",04Sep2019,1

11,"Being lonely is hard. It's so unbearable to feel. 

What's hard to realize though, is that I'm surrounded by people. I have friends, I have people to talk to, but I still feel so horribly lonely. To the point where I never know if the happiness I feel around them is real. It doesn't help that sometimes I feel like they don't care at all.  Recently, I had a really bad breakdown near my sister and her best friend, who I thought I was close too. I was locked out of my house so they drove me to my sisters, all while laughing in the front seat and having the music on a loud volume while I'm crying in the back seat. I don't want them to be depressed, but it almost felt like they didn't care, not to mention it was overstimulating and making me panic even more. I apologized so much after the event, and a month later they both have barely even talked to me. It makes me feel so ashamed.

It feels so impossible, not being able to feel connected to *anybody*, and not really caring after a while. It makes me isolate, because I mean, if I don't connect and feel lonely, what's the point?

12,"For some context, I recently transferred schools and I’m staring my sophomore year at my new university. Even when I was a freshman the first couple weeks was rough and had me thinking about my life choices. Now it’s the second week at my university and I have been feeling lonely, and I think I am getting anxiety attacks (or not, i’m not really sure, which is why I’m here). I’ve never had any history of mental health problems either.

To preface this first one, the whole day before I was in a depressed mood and on and off crying because I was alone all day. 
The first one happened about 2 days ago when I was driving back to school from my parents house.     

These ambulances were extremely loud and going down a road that leads to my parents house (looking back, yes the road leads there but it’s also like 10-15 mins away from the house) and I was convinced something happened and called both of them like 3 times each. It was like my mind was convincing me that something really terrible happened to them. Eventually they told my sister that nothing was wrong.

The second one was today, I sat down and was just completely overwhelmed and worried that I didn’t have enough time in the rest of the day to cook my dinner, read for homework, and do laundry. I got extremely stressed, and couldn’t hold in tears. It was only 6 pm. I had plenty of time, looking back at it. I usually never tell my family what’s going on in my head but my mom video called me twice today and both times it triggered tf out of me. I told her what’s going on but she said to give it a week or two. It was like i don’t like seeing her feel bad for me but i was really trying to hold in tears the whole time. after both calls ended i broke down in tears. 

Sorry for the long post but is anyone able to identify similarities between my post and you? I know i should go to a real doctor but I just want to try and get an idea.",04Sep2019,1
13,"I recently had a trip to the hospital due to stress, but while in there, the discussion was made about how stress effects your brain to the point of physical issues. I was diagnosed with Schizo-Effective Bi Polar Disorder, but my doctor decided to give me anti-anxiety medications to see if my PTSD had issues.

I watched one of my favorite YouTubers, Ralph Smart with Infinite Waters, and I saw the 7 day vegan challenge. What he said made sense after hearing about what stress does to a human body. If you eat meat, their suffering carries over into the food you eat.

On a scientific level, this makes perfect sense. The more stress an animal is put through for their meat, the more bad chemicals that are in their body.

So I made my own version since I heard that I needed the fish version of Omega 3's for the proper chemicals on how my brain worked. I went to pasture-raised meat (and believe it or not, it was more economical to go this route), and over time I stopped getting paranoid.

Granted my racing thoughts were still there, but I actually tested the theory during the variant challenge to see if processed foods would still make me zone out. Q'doba was now starting to hurt my stomach.  

Just today, I caved and had about four hot dogs over a span of 8 hours.

Oh God, I've been horrible all day. 

I have slowly weened myself off of the PTSD meds for about a week. The diet theory seems to be working so far. The only problem I have is information overload and racing thoughts.

Does anyone else want to try this theory? (Note: do not go off the meds like I did. They were very low dosage and I still take Trazadone for insomnia).",04Sep2019,1

For years now I have always felt alone but the last few months have been awful and I don't know what to do. I try and fool myself into thinking everything is fine. I'm fine. Life is fine. Yet, during the night, like it is now as I write this? I am falling to pieces. 

And I've tried to tell my friends (only three and they are all online friends).... They don't really get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I should say I am 27. No car (the one I had died and I couldn't afford to get it fixed or a new one). No job, because of the no car. No college, because I suck at math and also no car. No IRL friends. I don't have much going for me. People keep telling me to walk to places to get a job but the thing is I live in the middle of no where. It'd take me hours. And then there is the ice and snow during winter. Severe storms during spring and summer. The roads are crap and we don't have great drivers here. And not to mention, here and the nearest town? I could get hurt. Or taken. Or killed. Yet, I am lazy, according to everyone. I guess they think I am happy with my existence. If it was safe to walk, you bet I would. 

On top of it, I live with family. My mom is awesome but she's always sick. I feel like crap because I cannot do much to help her. A+ kid I feel like. 

My grandma is here too and she's probably the actual Devil. She is very . . . . mean, is the nicest way I can put that. My mom told me horror stories about when my grandma tossed ICE SKATES at my mom. Tipped a bookshelf over near my mom and more. My earliest memory of my grandma? She got mad at me when I was at the dinner table and wouldn't finish something, she came over to where I sat and took me by my neck and slammed my head into the dinner plate/table. I was five.

When I was 13, the school called about me because they found out I was depressed and self harming. I had to see a therapist before I was allowed back in class. I came home from school and my grandmother slammed me into the wall, yanked my sleeves up, spit on me, told I was not apart of her family and I could kill myself for all she cared. She doesn't want a freak in her clan. She then called everyone she knew and told them I was a ""freak"" and a ""cutter"".  Let me just say, it didn't help my mental health. She's tossed me into walls, slapped me, hit me, tossed me to the floor, and called me every single name you can think of.  Fat, slut, whore . . .  I could go on with the names but yeah, just think the crappiest words you can call someone and I bet I've been called it. She also grabbed and tossed my favorite snow globe when I was younger too. At me.

And she is even worse now with the name callings. She still gets physical but she denies it all. She'd never hurt a soul, she's perfect. 

I just wish I could make things be different. Do I have a future here on Earth that is going to be decent? Good? Will I find love(hard to find when you are a bald female, lost my hair at 14 to alopecia and when you tell people you wear wigs they bolt fast)? Friends? Happiness? What we all want and search for? 

I'm just . . .  alone. Horrifyingly alone. Besides my mom and the few people online, who aren't always online since they have their own lives, I have nothing. 

And as of lately, I am crying a lot more. My chest hurts. A few days ago I broke down late at night and I literally think I felt my heart breaking within my chest. 

I have NO idea how to stop feeling alone. I have no way to meet people. No money to meet people. No car. Nothing. I'm so tired of feeling this way.

My issue is that I cannot find how it would manifest through childhood and adulthood under these circumstances, just when the child is old enough to remember. I've had many mental health issues through my life and I'm trying to see what all could tie together while also trying to come out of the deep trenches of denial.

I hope this doesn't break any rules. I'm not looking for any kind of diagnosis, just clarity.",04Sep2019,1
26,"Sucks when you're having actual health problems. I blacked out and fainted yesterday and my friend found me laying on the floor.

Coupled with my memory problems (how do you forget someone you talked to for over 2 years?) and the first place my brain goes is cancer.

It's cool, I have an appt with a neurologist in October but goddamn is waiting for that going to suck",04Sep2019,2

28,"I have been depressed for a very long time. I was on zoloft most of high school and when it didnt work anymore I was switched to prozac. Prozac made me feel erratic and my lows where scary low so I ended up quitting anti depressants entirely. Recently its gotten to a tipping point. Ive been depressed this past year or more because of many reasons that include not being good at anything I can get a job with. To not knowing what I’m doing with my life  and all my friends moving at the end of the year. Im currently in college and failed my first year of it because of my depression. Very recently it has gotten very bad. I have lost 20 pounds from not eating and loss of appetite, and have been feeling intense feelings of anxiety and depression worse than I’ve battled before I feel isolated worthless alone and more. I for a brief times during the day start to feel normal then it goes back to this. I have an appointment with a mental health professional September 9th but I feel like the battle with these feelings have gotten worse and idk if I will be able to pull myself out of it.",04Sep2019,5
29,"I’m a guy in my mid-thirties. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my late twenties when I went through a cognitive evaluation by an ADHD specialist in my area. After I was diagnosed, I was prescribed Adderall (extended release, 20mg twice per day), and it made a dramatically positive impact on my life. Like, it helped me to feel like I was more in control of my thoughts, and simple jobs stopped taking me three times longer than everyone else. 

Over time, however, I’ve become incredibly anxious and defensive. My anxiety and defensiveness is translating to anger and cruel outbursts in my marriage. Now, I’m not saying that this is because of the Adderall. But I’m not sure to what degree, if any, the Adderall is contributing to these feelings. 

I would like to find a psychologist or counselor who is able to help me sort through some of the feelings I’ve been experiencing. But I’d also like to get—I’m not even sure if I’m using the right terms here—like, an overall psychiatric evaluation? I guess that I’m concerned that the ADHD specialist that diagnosed me was only looking at my symptoms through a very narrow lens, and that maybe I was misdiagnosed, and that what looked like ADHD was actually some kind of anxiety disorder. 

I guess that I just want a more comprehensive evaluation that tests for many different possibilities so that I know what I should be focusing my attention on. But I’m not sure what I should be looking for or how to find it or to whom I should be talking. Should I begin with a psychologist who would then, as part of my therapy, help me find someone who could administer an evaluation and tell me if my current diagnosis and medication are right for me? Or should I start with a psychiatrist, figure out the meds, and then move on to a psychologist from there? 

I just don’t really know where to start and I feel lost. I’m not even sure if I’m asking the right questions, or if I’m making presumptions that I shouldn’t be. Thanks for any advice that you can give me. 

tl;dr: I want to 1) find a long-term therapist who will help me sort out my feelings and modify my behaviors, and 2) get a psychiatric evaluation to see if my diagnosed ADHD is actually an anxiety disorder. Which one of these two things should I do first, and how?",04Sep2019,1
30,I was recently prescribed Zypine 10 mg by my doctor for clinical psychosis and ongoing depression and I was curious if anyone has had any personal experience with this drug.

32,"Most of the text is copied from another one of my post, but I guess I just wanted to get the most help I could get lol.
I am a 14 year old girl. I don't know if I have something different about me or what. I don't know if this is not normal or probably just being a 14 year old, but I have some symptoms that I don't think are normal.  They include:
-I never change my background or location of apps on my phone. Same place, everytime I try to change them something feels off. Same thing with a bunch of other examples. I always sleep with the same blanket, with another blanket on top of that one. These are just two examples. I am not a neat freak, like my locker and room is a complete mess. I also hate changes to schedule. If a practice is changed to an hour early or late, my plans are shattered. I literally feel like I don't know what to do and just not want to go anymore.
-I have trouble with talking with people. Not normal introvert, like I don't know what people are saying to me. They will say a comment or story and I say cool. Sometimes I guess people probably want a little more. I also have problems figuring out what people mean. Like if it's a joke it will take me a while to get the punchline. Or even if it's serious I think its a joke. I also just blurt out random comments all the time that apparently don't have to do with the conversation. (According to my friend) 
-I hate when people yell. My mom yells at me, a lot. She has a problem, but not so bad. Whenever there is something louder than something else, lien yelling, there is a ringing sensation. (Not hearing a ringing, but more of a echo? Don't know) and it just stays for seconds after it ends.
-I have tantrums. I hate them. I will scream and smack myself while bawling. It's not unconcouble, but there really hard to stop. They get set off by yelling, and other things. When I have one it's because I'd otn know whats going on. My emiontions are like a dump of different types of emiontions.
What do you guys think? I'll be happy to talk more since I didn't get a lot of things in here",04Sep2019,2
33,"I've had this problem longer than I can remember. I was sleep deprived since elementary school, because I'd stay up too late trying to make the time I had at home worthwhile before having to go back to school the next day. I still do this as an adult with work.

In the last 10 years of my adult life, and entire childhood, I have never once felt satiated enough with the day that I'm ready and willing to lie down and sleep. Not without copious amounts of booze or weed. I spent a good \~3 years binge drinking, before sobering up. Then I spent a good \~2 years getting high every night, after my state legalized.

I've had dozens of hobbies over the years, they're fascinating for days or a few weeks then all interest burns out. The only higher callings I've found that actually left me feeling satiated were high-stress, and then I was dealing with being under high-stress 24/7 just to feel like my life wasn't empty. I don't understand how people can keep hobbies, and I can't seem to enjoy them for very long. Same thing happens to my careers, I can't stay in a job much more than \~6-8 months before I'm crawling out of my skin ready to leave.

Genetic testing shows something that's got me in a philosophical quagmire. A dopamine receptor mutation that's gotten a lot of study of late. Reading into this, under animal studies it's literally called a ""Blunted Pleasure Response"". I know my brother was supposed to be on Ritalin in elementary school, but our parents blocked any formal diagnosis and I know they used to prescribe it to kids that didn't have ADHD.

Is this ""The Human Condition"", Depression, or is this what undiagnosed ADHD looks like?",04Sep2019,1
34,"I can't recognize it anymore. But I can feel something that opposes me now in my head and it's strong. Has a barrier in my mind that stops me from coming close to what I was once before. It's like my mind won't allow me to recognize my old self as sane and won't let me change.

I am a very deeply disturbed person. But I don very well the mask of strength and rationality that I even fool myself. Oh how confusing it is for me to be me inside my head. It makes me give up the idea of even trying to fight for answers that now I just accept and welcome illness when it comes. But enough jibber jabber. Let me tell you what's wrong. It is the whole truth, nothing but the truth. All honesty. 

* I've been fighting the urge to confront people about things that deep down I feel a piece of me is asking me what I'm doing. I can hear him yelling and he's so small and he's surrounded by his nightmares and he keeps talking to me hoping something will change. All this anger and hatred is in me. I feel myself being wiped away and now it feels Ok for some reason. I feel a calm and a hug of new coming with a blanket around me and it feels like I have time to explore what this newfound way of thinking is.
* I think about killing myself. I've considered all possibilities about what I would feel since I don't do so well with pain but I have also considered occasionally inflicting it upon myself to build a tolerance but I just forget about it and let it go. I also like to think about heaven and hell. I have both equal beliefs about going to one place or the other. It depends on how..austere God can be. I also think about where I could go in the world, who I would meet and what I could be destined for if I'm not dead. I like to think about it in times of stress of boredom on college since I think about never having to do this work or worry ever again or listen to anybody again and maybe I can sleep. Oh so well
* I have tics in my head. Where after I do something like scratch behind my ear, something will initiate and another me, in another universe, I can feel it in my subconscious, is scratching hard, so hard and never stopping. It's like I can feel his pain and it's such a frustrating feeling even for me as I can feel that impact of his nail scratching until it hurts and bleeds. It starts making my head physically spin and my muscles involuntarily tense up and I start flexing my hands  and curling my feet. Then I start talking to him and pleading to something in the universe that's making me feel that way to STOP IT. And it does. It forgets about him. I don't know what happened to him but I imagine he scratched a whole in the side of his head all the way out the other side so now he just picks at air.
* I'm not sure if I truly love my family. I say it all the time. All the time. I say it in monotone mainly. I give hugs constantly and it's mainly just for the contact. Not for the emotions. I tell them I love them mainly just to say something. Anything. Oh, I'm a real talker. I'm just have a deep belief I don't truly love them. But I will surely put that emotion aside and give more hugs. So I keep thinking that ""What If I killed them?"" since I have thought before that if say my mother died in a car crash I would think ""Oh, that sucks"" because what a change it will be and how much of a drunkard my father will be more than he already is. I just don't want to deal with it. I don't want to kill them generally, their not bad people. But they sure do now how to step and tap dance on a fella's nerves. Y'know? I noticed that I never cry when my family members die. I think of them fondly. Such as my grandfather. A great man. A handsome man. A hero, really. But I never am sad. I just think of how good he was and how much I appreciated him. And I reminisce every now and then. He is not gone from my memory. He will live in a comfortable spot in my heart. Until it withers and dies, then he will go somewhere else. Heaven I presume.
* I have a hard time believing I could be insane or ill. Because even though I have a little bit of awareness left. It's getting killed off it feels. Like troopers breaking into homes and taking them away. Even as I read all this there's a little piece left telling me how it is and it's like I ignore it but I hear it and that blanket of content is relaxing me. I will most likely be off this computer and thinking that I'm not showing extreme enough signs of illness. But I'm going to go see a psychiatrist tomorrow. I just thought I'd get a little rough draft going. Don't worry about me folks. Everyone in my life is ok. Even me somehow. Because even as I have only told you a little bit of the story, I still think it's never enough. And that I will be ok.",04Sep2019,2
35,"I have been soul-searching trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, career-wise. I've become obese, depressed over not being where I want to be in life. Been single &amp; no intimacy or even affection from another woman since 2012 when I was only about 190 lbs, and even on the rare occasion when there might've been something I shut it down because I just didn't want someone to deal with me.

My family hates that I don't have a stable job or career track and the pressure just compounds everything onto itself, and the few friends I do have are finally taking off on their own paths. While this brings me joy to see them overcoming and winning at life finally, I look at myself in the mirror later and think about it only to eat or sleep off that awful feeling of failure I get in the pit of my stomach.

I don't see a way out, and since I can't afford a counselor for my mental health I'm at an impasse here. I'd be willing to answer Redditors who actually have professional experience dealing with people like me. Sorry, but I'm only posting here because I financially have no more options and the depression of everything piling on top of me will drive me to shit I'll regret later if this isn't somewhat addressed.",04Sep2019,3

37,"Hi,I need an help regarding something I did in the past but still haunting me

I had my first time handjob in Chinese massage parlour so here is what happened

So while going inside there was a girl who I am not attracted to at all and didn't want here aswell fat,short, unattractive face and bit old I guess

So I asked can I choose girls the lady said “yes”

They asked me to go to room and she brought girl she was nice looking and interested but for some reason I said no

The second girl looked my type I said yes but she doesn't seems interested and then she started massaging back and for every 1 minute so I used her phone to message and talk it was irritating so I asked her that I want another girl because I don't want to ruin my first time

And she left and the main lady bring that ugly girl I said no I want different girl she said everyone left only she is available and she was kinda rude this time so I said okay

Then that girl did the remaining massage and the handjob the handjob itself was good but bit rough and she did it quickly and after that she even lied to me when I asked why you've done it quickly

But when I returned back I couldn't take that - girl who I am not attracted to or to be more accurate whom I hate for her looks and with ugly personality (she lied to me) was the first one to touch my cock sexually it's just bothering me,i couldn't stop thinking about it even after a year….I can't stop thinking about “she is the first women to touch me sexually in my entire life” and I couldn't change it,how could I get past it ?

39,"Hello, first off I want to start by saying if you read this entire thing I appreciate you and hope that you are doing well. If you don’t I still hope youre doing well but the other people are better. My story is long because I don’t want to leave out any key details that might be important for you to know somehow idk. Like if I don’t tell you everything you wont be able to help me. 

About 4 months ago I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in the form of Pure O my compulsions are almost entirely mental. It all really began my first year in College last fall. I rushed a fraternity I was anxious I didn’t feel like talking to the older guys I was afraid they wouldn’t like me and I was still never sure it’s what I wanted to do. I sort of used my more outgoing and cool friend to introduce me and mooched off his popularity to help my chances. I don’t want you to think im a complete hermit because I did talk, I knew some guys from my high-school and even the guys I didn’t know I mightve  been shy around at first and but I started to talk to and get more comfortable etc. It seemed like a lot of kids were nervous and kind of in the same boat as me.  Basically I love to look for proof in this that I do or dont have social anxiety a theme I try to figure out often.

I was smoking weed heavily, I started taking dabs everyday, that were dirt cheap and tbh im not so sure they were the safest. I noticed I was started to talk a lot, ask a lot of questions, engaging and trying to connect with the stoners I was friends with and this wasn’t really there thing they wanted to be high and not that productive or converse. One of them started to call me the leaky pipe because of how much I talked and how I wanted to share everything with everyone. Which was pretty hurtful and a little harder to shake off than normal guy teasing type stuff if Im being honest. Anyway it kept on going this way. My cool friend from before who also joined is pretty similar to me, anxious, intelligent, a stoner, and focused on becoming  a better person. He introduced me to another friend. This guy was the biggest stoner of us all he’s the reason I got into the dabs (the timelines a little fucked but it doesn’t matter). He was also a psychonaut. He was extremely intelligent he helped me with my math homework by doing it all in his head he hardly needed to study and was naturally brilliant. You see where this is going he got me excited to try shrooms. We talked about how people gained crazy awareness and knowledge from taking shrooms, how you naturally gravitated towards healthier foods, basically I was 18 and dumb. I took the shrooms about 2 grams and the actual trip was pleasant I remember not many visuals but bright colors for sure. I didnt really think about anything when I was on them actually just enjoyed the trip music sounded great, and I had peaceful meditative feeling. The next few weeks after the trip werent so good. I isolated myself in my dorm room, I didnt want to go to class and I was far more interested in googling everything I could about psychedelics, how to have good mental and physical health, and the Meyers briggs personality test. I remember taking a lot of personality tests, reading about chakras, the third eye, I stayed up until 4 in the morning writing a DMT research paper. Shroom friend and my roommate reassured me, they said look your an ENTP(Meyers briggs) thats your personality. I cant remember why I was obsessed with personality tests I  think I thought it would help me make decisions about what I wanted to study, because I always had a lot of stress about chosing what to study, and it would just be helpful and a guide in my life. I was particular about the results I wanted to make sure that the ENTP was for sure what I was and that It was accurate. I thought about it during lecture, I researched on my laptop around campus. I remember shrooms friend said that I was like him, a “THINKER”, I remember being consumed by what that meant, I knew he must be depressed he had this hopeless look on his face constantly, he was always sleeping, he hardly ever seemed happy. I thought maybe Im depressed, maybe it just means I am intelligent like he is. “Yeah I know excercise is the cure to all our problems” he said, I was pretty sure he thought that he and I were both depressed. He would also say “you’ll figure it out” and I would ask what and he would just say I would figure it out, always saying that “You’ll figure it out”. “I don’t know, nobody knows” was his final answer to what I needed to figure out. I researched the psychadelic stuff so much because I needed to know what it was that I had to figure out. One night when I was pretty stressed out he called me a thinker again, he compared it to when you worry that you might be gay even tho you’re not but you question it. He said thats how I was acting I suppose. 

Thats when the panic attacks happened. I took a dab and the room started spinning, I started to become overwhelmed with a feeling of fear, I couldnt breathe, I couldn’t calm down. I went home for the weekend and went to an emergency mental health clinic to talk and they thought I might be Bipolar. My doctor believed i might be bipolar based on my manic behavior, all the researching and isolation and cleaning at 2am. I wnet back to school smoked again and had another attack. My mind was attacking me with these quotes “you ever have trouble getting it up, I have” -shroom friend, I started to fear that if I was like him I would get erectile dysfunction even tho ive never experienced it. And some other quotes I honestly cant remember from another player in the story a girl (ill get to that). I called my mother and I told her I was having a panic attack and that I needed to come home that I couldn’t stay at school anymore. So I went home, I withdrew from school and now I’m home focusing on therapy and getting ready to start my life over. 

The girl mentioned before is one I knew in high-school. I sort of had a little crush on her. She has red hair, pale skin, an attitude, she was always labeled a crazy girl, she had a resting bitch face, she is very intelligent, in a lot of high level courses somebody who I looked up-to intellectually. I even interviewed her for a gender documentary I did for AP lang, mostly asking about times shed been dress coded and how she felt it was unfair. She also mentioned she had a problem with authority. Anyway I went to see this girl  the weekend I went home to be evaluated. I went to her dorm room after picking her up from work. We both took dabs in her room, talked about my ex gf and her ex best-friend. I told her about my anxiety and what was going on with me. She showed me her diary, a black shadow figure she called mother that haunted her in her dreams all her medications. Her room was dark, purple and black themed. She had a brain sculpture on her desk, plants, art, shes a painter. That night I asked if I could sleep on the floor she invited to me to sleep in her bed with her. For an hour I though of engaging her physically, of doing anything, until finally she turned around sighing probably at my lack of confidence to make a move and wrapped herself around me. I was surprised but content.

WARNING SLIGHTLY SEXUALLY GRAPHIC

 I started to feel her breasts, I moved my hand down towards her you know what and asked if it was okay she nodded and I fingered her. She pulled out a condom we had sex it wasnt that great I didn’t feel ready to do that with her. The next morning she gave me the greatest blowjob I will probably ever receive, like the greatest. After I came she starred into my eyes waited and started tugging on my dick again all while starring in my eyes, “do you want another one?”,  i said no thinking she had done enough and my shit was still sensitive. “No?” She asked surprised and I said “well I mean yeah”. She started going to work again I managed to last a little longer this time. Why am I sharing this? Because her sexuality is a large part of who she is,  she watches a lot of porn shes a sub and also she said “I dont get people having sex either, you just roll around and kiss”. She didn’t like kissing she hardly ever let me kiss her. I think this is a good Segway into talking about her mental health.

She said that she fed off of other peoples energy. That her therapist said she had empath like qualities. She would sometimes get a physical sensation from looking at something or an emotion. Body dysmorphia. She said she manipulated people. I said I think i do to she said no I think u just think u do. She also didnt think that she existed. She said she would look in the mirror and not recognize herself. She said she was an idea not a real person. She also made me watch this show called the big lez show and its a dark comedy about basic human interaction on youtube and has a lot of psychedelic references.  The main character sees himself being created in microsoft pain on a trip and shit like that. In the show one of the characters says “all of us are just your subconscious” to the main character. Other people are just your subconscious something I remember another friend of mine talking about a long time ago. “This is when I questioned my whole life” she said as she ripped her dab pen. I should mention now there was a reason she showed me this show. I was telling her that I thought I had social anxiety, I said “I internalize what everyone says to me”, “well yeah thats your personality” she replied. I know we are made up of our experiences with other people and they influence us and thats probably where the other people are your subconscious thing fits that and we should all be kind to each-other etc. But i couldn’t stop thinking about it for months. I told her i was thinking about starting therapy and she warned me that “it wouldn’t help”, when I asked why she said “i dont just question other people I question myself”, “remember real isnt better”.  “Just come to me if you have questions”. Of course I didn’t I went to my current psychiatrist and she evaluated me longer than most others she said ur a complicated person. She thought maybe you have bipolar disorder but I dont think so. Early on she  thought that I had ocd, I read about it and I said I dont think I have ocd. She gave me a dopamine based depressant and I took it when I was on vacation in arizona and it made things way worse i started googling really obsessively I went through stages thinking I was a psychopath, that my dad also was, that I was a horrible person. I felt like i was going to die again and my mind would not stop. I was also obsessed with the idea of being an empath because some guy in college told me he was and he thought i was so i started researching empaths looking for some kind of answer. My psychiatrist said before i ever told her about the crazy sex girl that “it seems like you dont think you exist”. Because of my empath googling and fear of being a psychopath and trying to figure out what i am who i should be. This of course freaked me out and made me certain that I had whatever illness sex girl had. I remember one day it seemed like all my head would do was replay a couple quotes from her. I knew she was into witchcraft type shit and i wondered if she put a spell on me or something. I felt so doomed and that I was going into psychosis another fear of mine.

Finally when describing my thought process my psychiatrist said “thats ocd”. Because i thought i had every mental illness under the sun. “I thought u had it from the beginning” 

I started an ssri sertraline and literally the next day or the second day I felt completely normal. Like I couldnt stop smiling, i purposefully thought of a sex girl quote and wasnt distressed. I was communicating with my family loving my life. The next day it was the same thing except after I took the med it took a little longer to start working that same way. And the next day a little longer and so on. I warned my family I said these might be the last few days and hours that I feel like myself. Its honestly unreal how different I felt for a few days, I was completely fine. My psychiatrist said there was no way they would work that fast, and I wondered what had happened, i still do.  Im now on 200mg a day of sertraline. Starting and adhd med and I had to take xanax and some anxiety meds at the start but dont need anything like that now. 

The next few months I got over my obsession with her and dont think about her daily anymore and rarely do ever or fear being like her. However I still fear that I have depesonalization disorder and that i dont think im real. I dont fear that im not real i fear that i think that im not real. Especially because of what my “compulsions are”.

My ocd:
My compulsions are preparing for conversations im going to have. All day long. 
Thinking other people describing what im doing or how I am. Like my sister telling my mother “braydan is  good at public speaking” which is true and i actually enjoy public speaking i gave a great speech at her wedding and its one of the reasons i question if i have social anxiety or not
I get nervous for like a class presentation or whatever that im gonna mess up but i dont think i really worry about other people laughing at me or anything
I google obsessively
I reassure myself and seek it from others

However I really cant see my compulsions as compulsion because of how automatic they are. Yes ik mental compulsions are that way. But it seems like they are my thoughts i dont feel like im trying to do them. I feel like my brain just processes info this way. You look at a car and think i like that car i might look at it and think of a conversation i might have with someone about why i like the car or something. I think ive read this is what depersonalization is or can be like.

Im not good at doing exposures because i dont feel confident i know what my true fears are or what exposures to do and im lazy. I dont meditate or excercise. For this reason im starting a 3 week couple hours a day ocd outpatient program that is amazing and heavy on erp and i feel hopeful about it. Even though everyday i still question my sanity. 

I forget how far ive come since some of those days spent panicking the entire time. I am doing better and even forget about my condition for a few hours some days.  This is long and i doubt anybody read it, or REDDIT but if you did you can pm me about your mental health situation or if u think im crazy or not or anything. Theres probably some typos or important things im forgetting, ocd is telling my right now i left out something huge because im not attached to my memories because im depersonalized but whatever its long enough. Thanks for your time.",04Sep2019,2
40,"I'm 16 years old.... Ever since I was 5 my parents have physically hurt me with hands, bottles, belts, pans, plates, shoved me into doors. This is because I didn't listen. For example, she would say put this cup away but I would forget and then I would get hit. I remember when I was 7, I got hit with a metal rod and it bent. Another time was when I made a card for my teacher but I colored out of the box... Mom hit me with  a stainless steel bottle on my head... That was 3rd grade, I told my teacher my mom hit me  and people came to my house to talk to my mom about it. After they left she started crying asking me "" why did you do this me ""... Other times dad hit me with belt for talking back to mom when she was wrong. He threatened me saying 
"" one day I will hang u on the wall and whip you with my belt "" that was when I was around 10 
I'm 16 now, they don't hit me that often because I'm more mature. Sometimes when I don't listen she says "" this is why I hit you "" 
BTW my parents aren't drunk or addicts they r regular people.
How it affects me : 

When I was getting beaten like once a week, and my little cousins used to play with me and mess up I used to hit them until they bruised and cried. 

I got into a fist fight with my dad recently 

Now : my mom slaps my autisic brother when he doesnt listen and now I have thoughts about hurting her because of what she did to me and what she does to my brother. Outside of the physically hitting she also doesn't support me and also mentally bullies me.

Why do I have these thoughts, do I blame my actions from the influences of my parents? Am I traumatized? Can I recover?",04Sep2019,6

42,I’ve ignored my mental health issues for a while because I thought I could suck it up and make it on my own but I’ve been falling apart lately. I’ve been to therapy before and started treatment to help with my anxiety and other issues but I can’t afford it anymore so had to stop. I feel like when I try to talk to my friends or my bf about what’s going on they act like it’s something I can control or just stop. I know they mean well but sometimes when I talk about what’s going on inside my head they’ll question it to death to a point where I feel like crying. I try as much as I can to use methods to cope with what I deal with but lately I’m hanging on by a thread and nothing seems to be helping. I don’t know what to do.,04Sep2019,2
43,"I really wonder how common this is. It has been happening to me since I was a kid, starting with people directing it at my parents, with the discourse eventually transitioning to me. Every once in a while it just happens and it is usually somewhat intense. I also get asked quite a few questions from time to time about what I have. I have gotten it from relatives, strangers, acquaintances, and the one significant other I had. I wouldn’t be surprised if I am leaving a category out. I have never been quite sure how to handle it. My reaction is usually curiosity mixed with mild amusement, and sometimes a vague feeling of wanting to crawl in a hole. I will also list all of the professional opinions I have gotten, whether they ended in full-fledged diagnoses or remained mere speculation.

I will ask what gives the person their impression and the most I get out of people is usually that it’s something vague that reminded them of someone they know already. The one thing that kind of blows my mind is the high level of consistency between the different passionate armchair diagnosers and interrogators.

46,"Hello, I wanted to ask for help on a chronic issue of mine.

I’m a 24 years old and I have an issue I’m dealing with since I was 14 years old. As I’m grown up I noticed that I’m always the last person to turn things in, or I spent three times as long on something as everybody else. I just figured that I was doing something right and everyone else was wrong. I seem to be staying younger while everyone else grows up at warp speed. The possibility of catching up seems increasingly remote, and I wonder why I should even try. It just seems like my brain is wooden, like it won’t move when I want it to, and there are all these things inside that I can’t take out.


I’ve gotten very good at hiding the slowness — starting things way before they’re due, working from home constantly, lying when someone asks how much time I spent on something (which means I’m working for free a lot). But I’ve just lost the will or the ability to compensate anymore, which means I’ve lost the will to do anything.


That made me wanna run out of my society and live a lone and work less as much as possible. I can’t be in society. The society seem to function in a way that I’m not familiar with. That built up a lot of pressure inside me and one day I decided to move away in a society that I don’t know anybody at, and live alone and work less as much as possible. So that’s what I did for 3 years and it was quit reliving and then out of no where I had a psychosis break down and it forced me to see somebody I know for a long time like my family. Which made me to move back to my society that I know everybody at, and now I have the same problem again and it’s devastating. 


The thing is, in all of my years I have never met somebody that have the same problem like me. I tried to talk to some psychiatrists but none of them seem to understand what’s going on. I feel like I have a very deep mental issue and it need to be diagnoses by someone who really put the effort and time to know exactly what is going on, but I can’t find any.


What else can I do?",04Sep2019,2
47,"Ill keep a long story short but my OCD centres around being schizophrenic or developing schizophrenia to the point that my OCD mimics the main symptom (voice hearing). It does this through dialogue (thoughts) that I am aware my brain is creating but cant control. I am aware I am a hypercondriac and have seen many psychiatrists and psycologists that have assured me none of what I am going through is schizophrenia related but rather clear clut OCD. I will give a couple of examples of the dialogue that goes on in my head in case anybody else suffers with the same intrusive thoughts and hopefully it will allow them to take comfort in their diagnoses rather than think they are going ‘insane’ or undergoing a psychosis or have schizophrenia. Examples include

Sitting in class and having the thought ‘I really need to focus now’ My OCD voice (intrusive thought) then replies with ‘I’m not going to let you do that’

Telling my girlfriend ‘I love her’ My OCD voice (intrusive thought) then replies with ‘Do you really’ or ‘No you dont’

Having a conversation with a colleague. My OCD voice (instrusive thought) then questions ‘Why are you talking to this person.’ 

I would think am i becoming schizophrenic. My OCD voice (intrusive thought) will then reply with ‘yes you are.’ 

Even as I’m typing this my OCD voice (intrusive thought) is saying ‘you dont need to post this or dont post that.’

So if you experience these kinds of intrusive thoughts take solace in the fact that it is not schizophrenia nor auditory hallucinations but rather your brain playing tricks on you to mimic the symptoms of something you are scared of. Feel free to let me know what you guys think and wether you struggle with this rare but uncomfortable form of OCD.",04Sep2019,2

51,"So for context I'm 20 and starting up my second year in college and work 5 days a week which I wouldn't be surprised if this amplifies my symptoms. So my first thing is that I have really bad stress issues followed up by ADD. I haven't been medically recorded as having any stress disorders but I haven't seen a professional about that anyway. But ever since my senior year of high school my stress issues have just gotten worse and worse. Nowadays whenever I begin to stress out my hands clench up and I can't open them followed by my body tensing up even more than my normal state of tension. The part I don't understand is that I can open my hands, and I know I can but in my head I keep telling myself I don't want to open them even when I know I want to. I don't have multiple personalities but I feel as if I am fighting with myself over how to react to myself. This happened very frequently last semester and now that the new semester has started I want to avoid having more meltdowns. Thing is I've tried doing things to help calm myself down but I'm always tense and never feel completely relaxed. I'd say I feel genuinely relaxed maybe one day every 6-8 months. When I'm sitting down in a chair my shoulders tense up and my body stiffens just own my own. I want to get better at dealing with my stress but I don't know how to go about doing that, and the last therapist I had didn't really help. I've got other problems like paranoia (which I think is caused by my body tension) and this weird (small) hallucination I see randomly all the time ever since freshman year of high school but that's the biggest one I've been dealing with recently.",04Sep2019,2
52,"Hello everyone, I'm a 19 year old male and I feel I'm at a tipping point. My mind feels like it's been becoming less and less sharp for like a year now. Here  are some things I'm dealing with

• serious anxiety and obsessive thoughts over small or unimportant things (today I couldn't decide if I  wanted to cuff my jeans or not and it destroyed me)

• overthinking EVERYTHING. I overthink things that used to be second nature. I overthink basic motor skills. I overthink moving my limbs and seeing/reacting to things.

• I play college baseball, and for the past 9 months I've been fighting to keep my ability to throw a baseball. I can play catch with my dad, but we had our first practice today and I overthrew my throwing partner 4-5 times. It's humiliating because I know I have talent but it's trapped right now. I overthink my throwing motion, I can't stop thinking about making sure my arm action is perfect when I throw. When I play basketball I focus so much on making sure that my form on my jumpshot is perfect that it gets messed up and I miss everything. I can't focus on a target because I'm so focused on making sure I'm doing everything else perfectly.

• things that I can't really comprehend bother me. I don't see how my mind can see a target that's 30 yards away, and accurately throw a baseball to it. It doesn't make sense to me, so my mind doesn't let me do it. I don't see how I can react to a pitch and hit it in a split second, so my mind fights it.

The anxiety and obsessive thoughts are getting unbearable. Every time I feel that I'm naturally good at something, it's like I have to overthink it, just about lose the skill altogether, and then gain it back. 

Notes: I'm on a very restrictive diet due to my stomach bacteria being out of wack (likely due to antibiotics I took according to my doctor) so getting enough calories is hard. I only feel somewhat normal if I have a 1,000+ calorie meal.


Please help me. I feel like my mind and motor functions are slipping away.",04Sep2019,1
53,"On my fathers side of the family there are many people ( aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins and grandparents) who  have for lack of a better term other than hermit, have sort of checked out of life in one way or another. In other words, they have no history of long term partners or marriages, no children, few friends, no home, no job or at least a career that went sideways and never recovered. They are all generally kind people and I don’t mean to say they are bad people because of the way that their lives have progressed. In fact, all of these people are quite intelligent, kind, and a pleasure to be around. However, they all had the capacity for brilliance but did nothing with it.

My father is the same way as many of his relatives in regards to his life path. He was a successful businessman and we lived a relatively charmed upper-middle class life in our early childhood until he just gave up, so to speak. He essentially was fired for doing lots of unethical things (with money not anything horrifying) and he has never returned to do the kind of work a man with his education and brilliance should be able to do since I was around 10. For context, even with his flaws, my father was responsible for saving/ generating huge thankless corporations millions of dollars in profit in his position (legally FYI, he was fired for personal expenditures issues)

As I have grown older I have learned more about the circumstances of my fathers life. Before he met my mother he was really in and out of jobs. Very capable, but also someone who was very comfortable being lazy. 

However, he differs from his relatives of the same generation who are like him because he had children. I learned that my father never wanted children and that I was the product of an accidental pregnancy and when I learned that, I became very aware of how it was that my father could be a caring, doting parent and still do the things he did that kept our family in financial ruin which traumatized me as a child. 

And now we get to the main part. I am very much like my father in temperament and that scares the fucking shit out of me. I am grappling with the desire to do something with my life I can be proud of and the very real fact that I may not have the character to see it through. I believe I want children but I do not want to be someone who sleeps through life and damages another human being. I also do not want to miss out on being a parent or having a successful career because I was too scared or lazy to see things through. I afraid that I will end up watching my life from the sidelines no what what path I choose.

55,"Slight run down:

Im 21 now, I have a good apartment, decent job, loving boyfriend, I'm going back to school in the fall. I'm in a safe place. I remember this really starting to become an issue when I was 15, maybe 16. I remember when I was a kid having nightmares for weeks on end and being so scared that I just refuse to sleep. That still happens now. But I would have patches of time where it'd be nightmare free. When I was in high school the shift started to happen where I was having more nightmares than I used to but still had long lengths of time where I'm nightmare free.

Since I was 19 it has progressed extremely to where it has become nearly every night I'm having multiple nightmares, waking up constantly. There are very few and very far apart times where I was able to sleep through the night and didn't have nightmares. Like I'll go 6 weeks with nightmares, have one good night of sleep then it's back to nightmares. I wish I was exaggerating. I was on a sleeping medication  but went off of it due to the side effects and it did jack to help. And over the last two years it has really gotten bad. When I sleep next to my boyfriend (we don't live together) I don't have nightmares as often and typically able to sleep through the night. We have a really good relationship, I love him with my whole heart and feel safe, secure, and protected when I'm with him. But over the last two months even when I sleep next to him I'll end up having nightmares.

The dreams are typically always carry the same theme (of me just about to be murder or being murder, having an overwhelming feeling of needing to hide, someone breaking in), there might be slight variations of where I'm at, who's in it, and there's been times where I have the same nightmares before. There's this little pattern I've noticed. I'll have the usual nightmares of being murdered, etc. That's typically what happens, I'll wake up about 3 or 4 times a night and once I fall back asleep I'll just have more nightmares. Then they'll gradually get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse until I just refuse to sleep until I can't do it anymore. Then im lucky to either not remember what my dream was about and get some sleep or have a usual nightmare which aren't as real and just horrifying. But no matter what I always have nightmares. The last two nights though, things have been getting worse from the usual ones. Prime example last night was really bad:

I had a dream that I was in this house, it didn't feel like home but it was a little familiar to me and I just felt overwhelming fear and a need to hide so I found a spot to hid underneath the couch and I watched as this black figure walked around trying to find me. Then it stops and is just starring at the couch and I feel like it knows I'm there. It races towards me and everything goes black. Next thing I remember is being at the door of this like kinda old and ruin down house with two people I didn't know them but there was some relation I had to them. The realness was surreal, absolutely surreal.  But we entered the house and I was attacked by something and I was on the ground and these two people weren't doing anything to help. They just stood there, frozen, just watching. Then I woke up. It felt so god damn real I had to keep telling myself that it was just a dream. I woke up still feeling scared.

The thing is I know this can't be normal or healthy but I've dealt with it for so long that I've just kind of accepted it. But I also don't know anyone who has experienced this. Anytime I talk about my nightmares to my close friends or boyfriend they and boyfriend  just seem worried and say things like jesus christ, and just don't know how to respond. I don't want to have nightmares anymore, I want to be able to sleep through the night at least. Have other people dealt with constantly having nightmares? I just don't know where to begin to deal with this and hopefully make things better.

56,"So this morning I had my panic and starting some self work and I remembered from the night before listening to an audio book on critical thinking that in science the process is more important than the outcome, this must have stuck with me today as during my morning panic planning and thinking session I thought about my process for self improvement and wondered if I actually had one (process) and I do and its terrible, especially for my mental health.

I wanted to share this with the community as I'm curious to get feedback for this but also because I'm now wondering if everyone has a system of self improvement/ problem solving that they are simply unaware of and I would love to see how other people work on themselves if they are willing to share.

I'm now going to carefully pull this apart and start putting together a better system but it caught me off guard that I'd never really noticed before and I wanted to share before I'd put something better together.

Current:
Wake up feeling like I know what to do or worse completely lost.
Panic.
Start wracking my brain for better solutions to everything.
If lucky implement something new.
If unlucky get a migraine and a downward spiral for the day.
Listen to audio books and watch YouTube videos that make me smarter.
Repeat until one idea stick for longer than the others.
Lament and have a mini break down if said solution fails to cover most ongoing progress.
Drop everything eventually as it isn't optimal.

Pros:
I do actually learn things and I also do improve my cognitive abilities.

Cons:
I burn out constantly, I never really make long lasting progress in any one given area and I tend to feel helpless overall.",04Sep2019,1
57,"I really wanna vent this story out. I’ve really only told my parents about how betrayed I felt that night. Ive never told anyone else what happened, as I feel ashamed and embarrassed about what happened. Just a warning that this is sort of a read.


I was very misunderstood as a child. I’d yell and break things, rock back and forth as a coping mechanism, have breakdowns, and this all left my parents really confused. My therapist was really bad to make it all worse, even now my parents agree, and it wasn’t until recently I was diagnosed with autism.

So one night, I don’t remember why, but I’m having a tantrum again. It’s late and my dad threatens to call over our neighbor, who is a cop, to come talk to me. I take it as a bluff, ignore him, and continue yelling. Except this time my dad wasn’t lying - five minutes later, a loud bang came from the door. My heart stopped and I turned to the source of the noise. My dad opened it, and I see the man in his uniform.

He asks my parents what’s wrong. My dad tells him how loud I’m being. So, the cop looks at me and yells, “why are you being so loud? Why are you disrespecting your parents?” And the sort. I don’t like the way he’s treating me, so I yell at him back. We both continue arguing. At this point I’m basically cornered by wolves and nobody is standing up for me. My sisters shyly look at the situation from their doors and my parents are behind the cop. My chest hurts and it felt like betrayal and sadness were pressuring it greatly.

I scream that I want to kill myself. It came out of nowhere. I’m not sure if I really wanted to in the moment, despite my bad circumstances. I was emotionally neglected as a child, I was bullied at school, and had a horrible horrible teacher who only made my depression worse. But I’m not sure if what I said was true. Maybe it was so the cop could be more empathetic, or to make my parents feel guilty. I don’t remember.

In Florida, it’s required that if a person states that they want to hurt themselves, that they be admitted to a mental hospital. So, the cop calls his coworker to drive down here and take me to the hospital. Moments later, he handcuffs me and takes me outside. I’m terrified, ashamed, and hoping that nobody is looking outside their windows. I felt like a criminal in that moment. I felt like a bad person.

The other cop was much nicer. He was tall, had dark hair, and on the way to the hospital he played some heavy metal tunes. I believe I’m choking in my sobs and I’m basically bawling out my eyes. despite that, we have some small talk and I’m trying too hard to make it seem that I don’t care about the fact that I’m in the backseat of a police car.

Once we arrive, he puts me in handcuffs and I ask him why. He tells me that he wouldn’t have put them on me if I didn’t keep threatening to run away once I got out of the car. I stay silent for a second and respond with, “touché”. He chuckles and brings me in.

We both wait in the waiting room and have more small talk. I think it was about TV shows, but I remember making him laugh a lot. So once the nurse comes and takes me to the room, the cop leaves. The nurse tells me to change into the gown and it feels like forever until another nurse comes in to ask me questions. She’s older, nearing her fifties, and has frizzy blonde hair. She tells me that I’m so young and questions what I’m doing here. I tell her why and tell her that I’m bullied a lot at school. She looks at me and smirks, “fuck those girls, they can be such bitches at your age.” We continue to talk for thirty minutes until I’m left alone for hours. It’s dark in the room but I can still see the fluorescent lit halls from the outside. In that moment, I just wanted to be with someone. I felt so alone and I was still trying to comprehend what was happening.

So the ambulance comes and they finally take me to the mental hospital (I was just in a normal hospital before). It’s really late, maybe midnight,  and I’m in the office. The lady asks me questions. I answer.before she shows me my room and tells me that there are workers who come in when everyone is sleeping to check in on them. The lady pretty much tells me the basics - can’t wear wired bras, can’t carry weapons or drugs, etc etc.

The next a girl, I believe who is five years older than me, sits next to me. She seems very sweet and gentle and tells me that she knows why I’m here. I ask her how, and she says that she could hear the conversations last night (the rooms are really close to the office). 

Everyone is there for different reasons, but most of them were there for suicidal reasons or violent reasons. Everything else is a blur - we watch movies, talk, do crafts, play outside... then once a day we are supposed to talk to a psychologist. Some kids have been there for months, and I’m trying to leave early, so I lie to the psychologist about how I’m doing better. later that day, I’m released and my parents pick me up.

Last year I was in school when I said I wanted to kill myself to my counselor. I was SUPER depressed and I didn’t even think I’d make it past high school. Of course, cops came, and I started bawling my eyes out because it reminded my of when I was 11-years-old. It was SUCH a long day, but my mom was there to support me. My best friend saw the ambulance and had a gut feeling that it was for me so she blew up my phone and asked how I was doing. Unfortunately we aren’t friends anymore but I appreciate that she checked up on me at the time.

I’m better now mentally. Im in such a better state of mind and I’ve accomplished so many things that I wouldn’t even dream of before. I just feel compelled to vent out this story that makes me so emotional for whatever reason. Thanks for reading :)",04Sep2019,1
58,"This has been weighing on me for a long time. I can’t talk about it with anyone I know, I even chickened out telling my therapist.

Fuck. When I was a kid, I tried...to kill my sibling. I won’t prove this, I don’t want any identifiable information about me.

My family acted as if it never happened and so did I. I was sent to therapy as a diversion and I seem pretty functional on the outside.

I have so much to say, but basically that day I can’t remember why I did it. I remember moving something on tbe fridge and then I remember seeing my sibling’s battered body afterward. I don’t even remember *doing* it.

So what is this? DSM wise etc?

I’ve been dealing with insomnia, and I just remembered that I fuckin tried to set a building on fire last year. Why? I remember thinking fire was beautiful but not much else.

(I also have some history of fire being an obssession in my subconscious but that doesn’t explain the gap in memory.)

I was not caught, it was put out quicky and I didn’t do a good job besides.

It is not as much of a memory blackout as the memory from childhood is but I’m thinking ??? because it was sort of buried. I wonder what other things I’ve done I don’t remember.

Last year I tried to get new hobbies but nothing sticks. I just give up. I feel like any goal I have is useless since there is no one to share it with.

I also don't care about anyone. I can't recall a time where I missed someone or was nastolgic about some moment in the past.

I recently lost touch with all friends because for what ever reason when they message me I am unable to get myself to reply. 

I have thought about ending it but the concept of self harm is just not something I can do.  If I could end my existence without out any pain I would do it.

When you had a childhood that severely stunted you emotion growth and self esteem, to the point where you learned what disassociation is, and have avoided feeling all your emotions in there entirety; how do you learn about yourself?

Life has been tough just lately but I think I’ve probably made it tougher by beating myself up and putting myself down and I’m starting to see how much of a pattern this is in my every day life. Enough is enough, something has got to change and I think it’s got to start with me and my mind set. I’ve done a little research into books on self love but I have no idea where to start, the options seem never ending. Has anyone else tried a book and can you recommend anything specific? If it wasn’t a book, what else did you try and how did it help you? I’ve seen a lot online that seems angled towards a more spiritual sort of view point and, not wishing to rule anything out, but I’m not sure that’s really what I’m looking for. I just want some practical, no-nonsense advice to help me try to be a bit kinder to myself. I feel like I’m ready to be the next version of me and I want to take better care of this one.

63,"Right now I’m on quetapine, duloxetine, divalproex sodium(valproato semisodico in Spanish) that I got when I went to a neuropsychiatrist in Mexico. I feel like they do nothing, plus the quetapine knocks me out and makes me so sleepy and tired all day(I’m on 100mg) I seriously dislike them because I’m even less able to do things because of lack of motivation and being tired, though I do have problems going to sleep so it knocking me out isn’t so bad, it’s the being so tired all day I can’t even sit on my computer to play games I just get tired and distracted.


Thanks to my girlfriend she sometimes gives me some of her adderal to help me clean and stuff, I honestly really like it because I’m able to do one thing without getting bored so easily or getting tired plus i always do clean even tho it’s the last thing I want to do. With my previous psychiatrist in the US he wouldn’t prescribe me anything that i could “abuse” and it made me mad because i knew it worked for me, I also sometimes get anxiety attacks and they get pretty bad so I wanted something that would calm me down quickly so that was also something he said no to.


I’ve taken so many different depression and anxiety medicine but I don’t notice improvement because I always seem to go back to attempting to kill my self. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever be stable and able to lead a “normal” life, part of me wonders if there’s even a point to keep living when my life is so shitty and the medicine I take makes me feel like shit and my suicidal thoughts are still alive and very vivid. 


Right now I don’t have money or insurance, i probably won’t be able to really speak to someone for a while(i have a lot of debt, rent, and a minimum wage job that isn’t 40hrs a week) but I’m hoping to get as much info as I can to finally find the medicine that would actually help me. Any tips? Advice?",04Sep2019,2
64,"This sub has been the wide world of self pity, so here's a tip for all the malcontents.

Instead of wallowing in your inefficacy, get mad at yourself. Do it in the same way you would grow angry with someone you love who does nothing every day of their lives. Recognize that you are failing yourself. Get mad about it. And then do something about it. Clean your room, cook a meal, start a fight. 

Do SOMETHING and stop bitching. Your life is your responsibility, no one else's. Grow up and work on yourself. Whining about the world is just a method for shirking your responsibility to pursue your own happiness.",04Sep2019,0
65,"25 y old female here. I have struggled with social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder all my life, as far back as I can remember. This is accompanied with feelings of sadness/depression and emptiness. In university, I just barely got my assignments in on time. I went to an excellent university and did well in a challenging degree though. Sleep schedule was completely a mess and I felt pretty friendless. (Insomnia on stressful days leading to late mornings). Yes, there were people I tagged along with but I just felt like I didn't connect with them as was a burden. I was called ""needy"" by some but others were nice enough. However, since leaving university I haven't been able to really stay in contact with any of them as I guess I was not that close to them. It was so bad that in university, I pretty much had every meal alone in the dining hall (where everyone goes in groups). Since graduating, I have attempted to work and get jobs but I had such bad social/general anxiety that I cannot talk to those I work with or just freak out and have insomnia all the time. Getting any meaningful work in these circumstances is not possible. 

I have been mainly unemployed since graduating trying various medicines and supplements to get better. What has worked for me so far is Omega 3 fish oil and thyroxine 50mcg. These allowed me to really understand how others think (which I was so disconnected from my whole life). They also removed a significant amount of fog in my mind. I am not diagnosed as hypothyroid - my levels are normal except for TSH which is a 5.6 on a scale ending at 4.2. Increasing the thyroxine any more gives me anxiety so I think I have reached an appropriate amount with that.

The next phase since the increased clarity has been intense meditation and exercising. These are providing some more headspace to figure out what's going on with my mind. It boils down to this - I have these intense emotions during social situations (usually intense sadness when I think someone doesn't like me or I have said something wrong or I am acting awkward) which just don't ever go away. The day after the stressful situation (say a group meeting for charity volunteers), part of the emotion is still there - either pain or sadness. And while I can get out of bed and eat food and pretend to be normal at home, I can't concentrate on anything - like reading, talking to people. And these leads to more sadness and the cycle continues. I have tried antidepressants such as sertraline, fluoxetine, agolmelatine, bupropion, venlafaxine but they don't help, I am guessing because I don't have major depression. Vortioxetine did help but it numbed my out completely and I was very confused about who I was or how I should act (something I struggled with before I was taking it already ; i have identity issues). I have also done a lot of CBT over the past few years and I am kind/generous towards myself but I have this sneaking suspicion that I really need medication for these mood issues. I would love you guys' advice on this.

Ps. My psychiatrist is starting me on psychodynamic therapy in a few weeks time.",04Sep2019,2
66,"After suffering roughly 10 years of depression, I still naturally avoid my triggers, but recently I've been procrastinating a lot and found myself using the popular tab on reddit, where I've been exposing myself to loads of triggers, often going the extra mile to seek them out on purpose.

I've been able to rationalise the thoughts that used to send into spirals for days, and tuck them away in a nice little logic box, but I realise that despite feeling fine for 5 years or so now, the triggers are ultimately still there and I actively have to push back the thoughts even though they don't even really make sense anymore. It almost feels like the catharsis of picking at a scab, and it's hard to stop in the same way, as though if you pick it off it might heal better next time. ...Though I think I'm getting a little ""sore"" from it, as there's a small need to validate the box (which I can't really do because it's pretty violent in nature).

I'm mostly writing this to consolidate myself, but I'm unsure whether I should stop myself or continue leaning into it. Any thoughts?",04Sep2019,1
67,"I keep dwelling on the job I left a few months ago. On the one hand I wish I had left on better terms, but I was so angry at the time I couldn’t get a handle on my emotions.

But I keep dwelling on the wrongs they did to me. The guy that bullied me, or the 3 horrible co-workers, or the incompetent boss, or how nobody wished me good luck. I feel like going in &amp; telling them off. I keep replaying it all in my head, having conversations with ppl that couldn’t care less. My anger is poisoning me.

I’m trying to move on to my new exciting career. It pays better &amp; I should feel good about myself. So why can’t I let it go?",04Sep2019,2
68,"I recently went back to therapy, with a new therapist. Going in, I gave her a written summary of things I wanted to work on. I don't think she read it, and I was so nervous in the intro session I just rambled. So I don't think she's got a good history. But I don't think she's listening.

Today, I wanted to talk about how my reactions to social situations affect my ability to keep a job. I have this deep-seated ""thing"" where I feel like I don't belong, and the best thing I can for anyone is to not be around them. I've always felt this way, ever since I can remember. The best gift I can offer is my absence. I have learned, logically, this isn't true, at this point. Multiple people have told me that it isn't the case and that people actually notice/care if I leave, so I'm working on not doing that. However, the internal pressure to leave is still there. With friendships, this translates to me just sort of banishing myself. With work...well. It gets uglier. I've lost every job I've ever had to a manifestation of this. Coupled with the desire to flee is a severe lack of confidence, not entirely misplaced, in my ability to perform my job. When I do inevitably fuck up, the internal pressure to flee becomes irresistible, because I've proved myself to be a problem and I can't see a way around it. I can't cope with the social pressure of having to renegotiate the changes to the social landscape caused by making a mistake because I feel like I can't read the land well enough and I am so deeply ashamed I can't even begin to try.

I don't know why I'm like this. Part of it is deep uncertainty over my ability to accurately assess how people feel about me. I never know if people actually like me. Pair this with the certainty that they shouldn't, and it gets dark fast.

To me, this seems like a problem with my own ability to assess situations and problems with my own self-worth. However, she seemed to be reading from a slightly different book. She kept talking about how I had ""trust issues"" with my boss and friends. Which...I don't? I trust them. The only thing I don't trust them to do is stick around if they see how screwed up I can really be. But honestly, that's just a human thing, I think. Isn't it? It is unreasonable to expect everyone to always stick around, regardless of your behavior. That's reserved for dogs and grandmas. But she thinks I need to work on trust issues, as though I think the people in my life have it out for me. Was she listening at all? The only person that has it out for me is me. And I do have some reasons to question my abilities as well, which she didn't seem to want to hear.

And she went on to say that she wanted me to try to think of situations in my life that ""running away"" actually solved something, to try to figure out where it comes from. I'm sitting there thinking, lady, when I was a tiny child I used to wait for the aliens to remember they left me here, because being left with the humans HAD to have been a mistake. I do not know where this feeling of being an outsider comes from but it's always been here. To which she said perhaps something ""happened to me"" that I have fully repressed. I find that extremely alarming. I do believe memories can be repressed, because trauma makes brains go all fucky. However, I don't think going digging for them in therapy is a good idea because memory is malleable and false memories are a thing. If she starts trying to dig out some kind of memory, I am noping the fuck out of there. I do have fragments of some very unpleasant things, and that's enough. Maybe that is what made me feel like an alien? Could be? I don't know.

TL;DR I feel like she wasn't listening, and this repressed memory stuff is alarming. Any opinions?",04Sep2019,2
69,"Okay, so I’m a perfectly average young adult, 23, male. I live my life, I have a good job, a wonderul girlfriend, very good and close relationship with my group of friends (we are four, like brothers), financially okay (I guess, I already started to gather money to move out from the family house, I have a paid out 94’ car, a relatively expensive hobby that I can support, etc.), and generally a good life. I have no negative medical condition or anything.

Yet, sometimes some small thing can trigger something in me, and from then I feel this overwhelming sadness. Like, that deep shit, when I literally ask myself, why the fuck I feel this way?! I can’t do anything about it. My girlfriend always tries to cheer me up and that helps, but ultimately never solves the problem. I have to talk about something or sleep a few hours or just do something that made me forget that I’m sad. Then it happens, the whole sadness shit and drama disappears. Like it never existed.

The whole thing happens occasionly, sometimes more than other times. Also it never stays more than a few (let’s say 3-4 hours) before vanishes.

In my country mental health problems isn’t handled like in the typical western countries, so I’d rather keep myself out of the system.

70,"Two days ago, I had my first job interview. It went great, was so pumped to hear back from them. Everything was slowly coming together, I had control back on my life.

And then yesterday happened. I was an emotional wreck. All day, I could do nothing but curl up in bed and cry. I think I even had a dissociative seizure, I'm not sure though. My memory of it is really bad. Today, everything hurts. It's taken four hours just to get out of bed. I haven't eaten in over 24 hours. I took my medication though, so there's a plus. But my migraines are back, my ribcage hurts again and my back hurts. Everything hurts. I was going to go to the Dr today, but I just can't.

71,"I have been mentally ill for a long time, on stable medication (Zoloft and Ritalin) and over the past few months I became more and more unstable - relapsing back into self harm, alcohol abuse and general high risk behaviour. That kind of relates to me falling for a guy (with whom I am in a happy, healthy relationship as of now). 
But I feel myself becoming more and more unhinged. Im usually a very rational person but whenever his tone (in texting) slightly changes or he doesnt reply asap I get really sad and upset with myself, as well as when he leaves my place or I have to leave his place. In the morning I feel okay, then I get usually really depressed in the afternoon because I cant see him and various other reasons and when I see him in the evening I feel okay again. 
I can deal with long(er)term depression, nornal mental states or highs but having this constant up and down within the day is exhausting. 
Also I don't want to become the ""crazy girlfriend"" trope and weigh down him / our relationship with my mental issues. i cant even self harm anymore (which is my go-to to regulate myself) and I really just want to get a baseline again. I can live with being depressed but this is more destructive than I can manage.",04Sep2019,1
72,"My brother is very cheery around us and he always looks average. He’s had a few slips here and there with my parents but...who hasn’t? 4 days my parents found out he kept the extra money from his student loans to himself and they pretty much called him a terrible son for abusing his parents.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. I vividly remember when my parents gave him a lecture when he shoplifted for the first time when he was 13, the reason I bring it up is because my parents told him this is the second time he stole something that wasnt meant for him.

He was understandably upset at the time and I thought he got over it. Well he didn’t... this morning I was using a voice recorder to judge my own singing voice but I left the phone in the car when I arrived home.

My brother said he had to go somewhere and took the car for a 30 min trip then came back as cheery as ever. I got my (still recording) phone from the car and played it back... about 5 mins after my singing end my brother enters the car and just lashes out at everything around him.

I heard EVERYTHING and I’ll try to simplify the speech as best I can.

He said “Why does every damn thing I do always bite me in the ass?”

“Why can’t I be a good son just like the rest of my siblings?”

“ Why the fuck does all the shit that happens in my life always has to be negative” 

Afterwards he just breaks down and cries while repeatedly saying

“If all I do is hurt the people around me then why the hell do I exist? This isn’t fair I never asked to be here!”

“I wish I was never born, I wish I wasn’t your son” x5

I’m in junior college and work food service. Yes there’s a reason for this, some of it my fault, most of it is not.

It just doesn’t seem right. When I’m sitting in a classroom paying to learn chemistry, or making less than 80 dollars in a day after taxes, I can’t help but think I’m some sort of sucker. I’m sure the internet doesn’t help, but I see plenty of people finding what they love and seem to be making good money doing it. 

Essentially I’m lost. I understand success doesn’t happen overnight but I wish that I could direct my efforts towards something more deliberately that will yield me the results I want, not what society tells me to do. College 9-5 til 65, then die.

There just has to be another way. I’m 22, willing to work hard, no mortgage, no relationship, and no kids. Now’s the time I feel like.

In recent years I have opened my consciouness to undefinable level. All the emotions and visualizations in my mind, in other dimension have been become so real that it is not different from the reality we are used to.

Every thought that i have, is represented by some sort of movie in my head. I see places I have never been, mechanics that consist of thousands of gear running all together meanwhile feeling every contact point in myself e.t.c. Things i think about lead me to so many different feeling and experiences.

If i go next to a house that is on fire, I see that I am actually  burning inside feeling, how flames are burning through my skin. I can allso add other people or anything next to me. My friends for instance and expirience a moment in my head that feels like it is actually happening. This - imagination thing has a representative value to what is happening with my body, mind or anything else related to me. Sometimes when i cloose my eyes the imagi in front of my vision is so strong, that I cant differ closed eyes from open. 

I can also play minigames. I imagine that there are bunch of shrooms  falling down to my vision from nowhere. Then i add a shopping cart that i can control with my mind in order to catch them. It is very entertaining.

I imagine thet it is raining and physically feel rain hitting on my skin. It is like a virtual reality - Every concept is possble to make with specific laws and ways things work. I am amble to fly, teleport, or use any other unreal possibility in regular life, meanwhile feeling as it is real and actually happening.

I see creatures in my head, like some cripple that is rotten all over the pace. With in time i learned to communicate with them. Now i can play rock&amp;paper&amp;scisors with him. Sometimes they wave hey at me, or show any other gesture that makes me like they are making an actual contact with me. I see people that other things would describe gods, spirits.

I can be a cat, while feeling how i can actually wiggle my tail that I dont, or do have. I imagine that i am some grain in a filed, and I feel how I am being cut and taken somewhere by some women in 18s in Russia.

I am super sensitive to weed- when i smoke everything gets super psychedelic, more bright, colorfull as it would be lsd trip.

I won't write further, because I don't know how much intrest you guys have, but feel free to give any opinions. I have my doc, that really teached me how to deal with this. However, any medicine  anti-psythotics for example does not stop it. I have learned how to live with it and sometimes it is really benefitial, but sometimes i feel very bad about not being able to talk with people, my friends, just because things are so-unrelatable to what they feel. It is really hard for me to make a connection with anybody, however im doing fine with it and I believe that there is always solutions.

Hello,
  My name is Srushti. I am 23 years old and  currently doing a research project as a part of the M.A Clinical Psychology Course. My research is on adult survivors of child sexual abuse. The reason I chose this topic is because it is a very critical one - survivors experience long term effects of what happened in their past and it debilitates their ability to live life fully and freely as adults to a very significant degree. Often the effects are so subtle that the person may not even be aware of how they are being debilitated.  

I am conducting this research to understand the general problems and blockages faced by adult survivors of CSA so that it can contribute towards generating intervention and counseling steps/methods/practice ideas to help the survivors. 

I understand that this is a sensitive matter but the participants' confidentiality is fully maintained in this survey. No details compromising the identity of the person need to be provided in the survey. 

I hope you will pass this around to your friends (both male and female) and help out in this endeavour.

Thank you so much🙏🏾",04Sep2019,10

I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ADHD.  I can clearly remember feeling overly anxious as a child.  My second grade teacher was the first to notice.  My parents found the notion ridiculous (I don't blame them, I had the most perfect childhood).  They took my teacher's observation seriously, and continued to be the supportive parents I have always had.  I honestly didn't learn about this until I was 17 or 18 years old.  I had no idea my teacher thought I was depressed.  It hadn't occurred to me that I was at that age.  Looking back, I'm sure I was.  I've had suicidal feelings as a teenager, and even sometimes as an adult.  I'm a logical and rational person (usually), and have always kept it together enough to rationalize my way out of those self destructive behaviors.  Don't get me wrong, I'm plenty destructive, but I'm a relatively high functioning individual.  

I've been depressed lately.  I usually don't talk about this sort of thing with my friends.  I feel like it sounds whiny, needy, desperate, attention seeking, pathetic, and also...I don't want their advice.  It somehow makes things worse.  The two people, Carla and Christian are my best friends.  They know everything about me.  One could argue, they know me better than I know myself.  Other than my child, I place my relationship with them above little else.    

Against my better judgement I decided to tell my friends about my current, and particularity bad depressive episode I'm in the midst of.  I decided to share after I snapped at them one day.  They asked what I did one Sunday afternoon.  I responded with something along the lines of, ""Why?  So you two can talk even more shit?""  Waste no time on pondering if I'm just being paranoid.  I'm not.  They are.  If I decided to explore the issue of them not including me in conversations about me, they would say, ""Its nothing I wouldn't say to your face,"" (I believe that to be somewhat true) or ""Its not like we haven't all done that to one another at some point,"" (again, also true).  Carla said I was being way too defensive.  I told them I have been going through a rough patch (depressive episode) and that it was difficult to talk about.  Christian's insensitive response was, ""All of this because I asked you what you were doing yesterday?""  I'm still SO angry about that comment by the way.  I ignored it to keep the conversation productive, but it irks me.  Carla was nice about it.  She invited me to lunch.  She said that she should have been a better friend.  I told her it wasn't her fault.  It was no ones fault but my own.  I told her it felt like I liked her and Christian more than they like me.  I cried.  I told her it was difficult to get help.  I told her I know I need to make changes to better my situation, but making those changes are easier said than done.  

Changing my meds is a really scary concept.  They have a profound affect on my mood.  Going without my meds, I get angry, sad, and sometimes start crying for no reason and can't stop.  I am afraid I'll say things I'll regret or do things that will ruin my life.  Blowing up at work, crying at work (or anywhere in public), being not so nice to friends and family, or being more depressed and tired than I am now, are risks that I will have to take if I want to try a new medication.  It takes weeks for you to figure out if they are working.  If they don't work, I'm afraid of what I might do.  I need to exercise, have a sleep schedule, eat healthy, avoid screen time, read, and find fulfilling hobbies.  I need to avoid alcohol and cigarettes, and spend more time outside.  I *know* the cure for depression.  Deciding to do what I need to do, is quite another.  I don't want to do any of those things.  So here is where I wrestle with myself.

I have my BA in Psychology.  I have been taught that mental illness does not mean weakness.  I can regurgitate everything a therapist would say.  ""You aren't lazy, you're depressed.""  ""It is a common misconception that people with depression and ADHD are lazy.""  (\*\*Despite the quotation marks, I am not quoting anyone.  I'm just generalizing things I've read and heard on a multitude of platforms over the years.\*\*)  Hearing that I'm not lazy is such a relief...sometimes.  I don't know that I believe it.  I get that labeling a disorder makes it easier to treat.  One can find common ground with others going through the same things.  Behavioral scientists can build treatment plans, and map out behavior patterns.  On the other hand, would I be the way I am if I didn't know about my depression diagnosis?  I guess people who have to work hard every day to gather/hunt for food, carry and/or process water to drink, and maintain shelter every day wouldn't even think twice about being depressed.  It seems like a luxury afforded to the privileged.  My great grandma wouldn't have said in a million years she was ""depressed"" while bringing up her eight children.  She simply didn't have the time.

If I KNOW what I have to do to feel better, and CHOOSE not to, doesn't that make me lazy?  Stupid?  Depression makes us tired.  Well I can get up and go to work because I ""have to"".  Why can't I decide I need to go for a run?  Don't I ""have to"" go on that run, just as much as I need to go to work?  If I know that a brisk walk will improve my mood, help me loose weight, help to relieve the fatigue I feel, why don't I do it?  I know better.  I drink wine.  I eat fast food.  I sit on my ass all day sometimes.  I know better.  I know what to do.  Yet, I still don't.  Lazy or depressed?  Depressed because I'm lazy?  Lazy because I'm depressed?  Depressed because I eat, or eat because I'm depressed.  Its a chicken or the egg question.  

There is a difference between depression sufferers and depression over-comers.  What is the difference between the two?  In my case I have support, I have enough money (usually), I have a home, food, and clean water.  I am blessed with a higher education and a safe, happy childhood.  This leads me to believe that I am too lazy to change.  Perhaps Christian is right to scoff at my self-induced problems.  

So here's what.  I know I'm being perceived as being lazy.  I think I am being lazy.  I know what to do in order to change.  I need to change to be a better parent, employee, family member, and friend.  The things that mean the most to me; family, friends, and my job...haven't been enough to make me change.  Perhaps I have just resolved my own query.  That's what makes lazy and depressed people different.  When everything is all on the line - at the most basic level of personal happiness - we still remain stuck in our cycle of feelings of worthlessness --&gt;  idleness --&gt;  guilt --&gt; anxiety --&gt; self induced social isolation --&gt; despair --&gt; self hatred --&gt;  worthlessness  --&gt; idleness.  You get it.  I made up my own flow chart just now...off the cuff.  I have no doubts that other like-minded individuals would make up their own flow chart of very similar emotions.

If you've made it through this far and have feedback, I very much look forward to reading it.  

\*\*I am NOT looking for sympathy...hell, not even empathy. 

\*\* I am NOT in danger of hurting myself or others.  ",04Sep2019,7

He comforted me and told me that its ok to feel this way, and even tough he doesn't really know what its like to go trough this, he'll still accept me.

103,"I struggled with anxiety and depression for over 4-5 years, I have diagnosed social anxiety and severe depression, and I am currently undergoing examination for possible psychosis. I do take Efexor 150mg for anxiety and depression, and I felt like it helped with the social aspect of the anxiety, but then it got worse and worse once the social aspect was okay, and now it is back again. The depression has been the same all of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with intrusive thoughts, skin/nail-biting, anxiety for almost everything. I believe that I have OCD and Compulsive skin picking, I have really low, almost nonexistence self-esteem, and my depression has gotten worse over the years. I feel guilty about everything, and my intrusive thoughts, the images of sex with random people, murder, violent acts make me sick. And I do blame myself for them because it is MY head.

&amp;#x200B;

I have these impulses to buy things, spend money in other ways (giving it away, gambling...) And yea it is a nice thing to do, but I do need it myself. When having a conversation I just can't focus or pay attention no matter how hard I try, and then I answer and regret answering it afterward and get so guilty, I feel like the worst person for lying, and sometimes I also lie and get guilty and feel like complete shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so scared if I just tricked myself into believing that I have OCD and CSP because what if I don't have it? Do Do I pretend to be sick? Am I making this up?  There are only so many questions that I can't answer, and I need answers to be calm, but my anxiety has gotten worse and worse over the last four years, and I want it away now. It is too much.

I have voices in my head, but they don't bother me as much as my thoughts.

109,"Heyo! I think a small amount of back story might be necessary to ask my question. I grew up in a household that was a little abusive. There were tons of loud fighting, holes in walls, etc. I moved out, things were fine for me, my mom finally kicked out the dude. I moved back home and my brother is the exact same. Seriously this kids room was more holes than wall, broken windows, door was splinters. Wild lol. He’s in a mental health facility a few hours away and will probably stay there till he ages out. 

That being said, I’m pretty jumpy around loud noises, not sure if it’s related but whatever.  So anyways my mom got into a massive fight with her (now ex) boyfriend last night. Same stuff, screaming, holes in walls, glass breaking, etc. I’m usually fine with stuff like that, I know I’m gonna be fine, but it scared me to no end this time. It was almost like my fight and flight response were racing for dominance. It was really odd and not fun tbh lol. Went to my partners place to sleep, still pretty frazzled. 

Now all of that is relatively normal but what really caught me off guard was while I was trying to go to sleep it was like I was hearing glass breaking and screaming and banging? I was still really spooked and stressed. It just seemed so real at first that I thought someone might be breaking into cars or the house. I looked around but couldn’t find anything. So I went back to bed and just kept hearing it, very quiet most of the time, it was hard to tell if it was real or not. No one else heard it so I’m going to assume that it wasn’t actually happening. 

Every now and then I have mild visual hallucinations. Nothing wild, I’m thinking it might be something with my eyes and not a mental thing. But this was really different.

Over time my friend started to descend into depression and thoughts of suicide. He confided in me plans to do it, why he wanted to. I was able to convince him to seek professional help, but past that I'm not sure what happened.

About two months ago I was sober&amp;clean, hadnt self-harmed in a year and was taking my meds every day.

Right now I'm drinking and using again, started self harming again and stopped taking my meds. 

This is mostly due to me not seeing any progress and also feeling overwhelmed with all the intertwined issues I have. I don't have anyone  who I can go to for support as I'm not in therapy and my friends/family really aren't equipped to deal with this. 

It started with me relapsing with drinking and using. I then decided to stop taking my meds without tapering down because I don't feel like they have any effect anyway. Lastly, I also self harmed again in a really desperate moment and now it feels like a normal option again.


All of this is especially stupid because I'm still trying to get my life together but I can't deal with all the set-backs. 

Basically I go to meetings, look for therapy options, and try to sort some other shit out all while undoing all the positive effects which that pro-active appproach could have.

I don't know if I have a specific question or am just looking for interesting insights from other people.

I am a very sensitive person. Loud noises like a motorcycle revving up or men yelling make my head spin in panic. I tend to only watch documentaries on nature and science because I cannot handle a storyline involving people experiencing things and implying emotions because I feel it as if it is happening to me. I cry everytime I watch Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I cry in a lot of movies and comics and so on. I recently read up to the most recent chapter of an online webtoon that has ruined my life lol I can't get over the situation the characters are going through and it physically makes my chest hurt. The most triggering genre is tragedy/romance that involves someone losing their memories. I hate that I can't just be entertained by a good story. I have to feel everything and thus I can only relax when watching documentaries and the only game I can play is Spider Solitaire lol. From as early in my life as I can remember, I have deeply connected with fictional characters and would try to have my family members see why something was so tragic and why is wasn't bothering them.  

Does anybody else have this experience? I don't think it's just because I'm an emotional person. This stuff literally effects my functioning on a day-to-day basis. I figure I am an empath. I go to therapy for multiple anxiety disorders as well as adhd and depression. I have emotionally absent daddy issues. My personality type is INTP-A/T.  Childhood trauma caused my accumulated stress. Multiple heart rhythm conditions that are supposedly harmless like arrhythmia and mitral valve prolapse as well as being born with multiple heart murmurs. Sometimes avoid listening to music because of how it effects me emotionally. I tend to enjoy lighthearted movies that won't mess me up like well actually they all tend to kill me inside. But I swear I am running out of documentaries to watch and have even rewatched many of them. I like true crime but if it's psychological, I get sucked in, too. 

I would describe this ""killing me inside"" and chest pain as a tightening of the chest and a slight sense of loss of reality. Like maybe acute depersonalization? I have experienced derealization before.  Are some fictional situations triggering to me? Or is this normal for empaths? My middle sister is also kind of like this and she throws up easily in stressful situations since we were little.

I have not spoken to many people that also go through this. So, please. Tell me your experiences and why you think it happens. What types of things are you triggered at or sensitive to? Do you get the ""heart squeeze"" too?",04Sep2019,1

I had a pretty bad depression a few years ago, that time I hit my lowest and was thinking about I might not need to be here.. But I got out, I defeated it and after changing everything, people around me, new apartment, new job, got my degree, new hobbies.

For a while I felt genuinely the happiest I have ever been. I loved my life.

And a few weeks ago it just hit me again. I was still saying I'm happy, but more and more it feels like I'm lieing to myself.

I got a really high paying job, no dept, nothing bad in my life and it just hit me from nothing.

130,"Alright so, I (23F) had been seen my therapist for about 6-7 months now, although I’ve started my journey about 1 year and a half ago.   
My first therapist was specialized in TA (Transactional Analysis); I went in mainly for anxiety related to my academic results and status. She did not make an actual diagnosis, but in the end of my year with her she made a “step” backward and appointed me to my current psychotherapist, which is specialized in systemic relational therapy and EMDR.   
She mainly suggested me EMDR therapy, but also added that, if the situation wouldn't change, she advised me to go seek help to a psychiatrist.  
Well, my current therapist is really good: I get along with him really well, he's got experience and I really opened up with him, even on topics I was actually holding back purposefully with my previous psychologist. I come from a family which has got strong biases against psychology and psychotherapy, mainly because my older brother has been in therapy as a kid and got no results and did not resolve his own situation (I still do not know his diagnosis, I know he has ADHD, but still has got also some Asperger/antisocial traits). When I told my parents I wanted to seek help, they basically tried to convince me to not do that because ""Eventually your therapist will convince you to bring us too and we'll have to pay double, for nothing"". My therapist actually proposed to bring at least my mum when he learnt about the situation, but when I said to him I did not want to, he did not insist. So yeah thank you mum and dad.  
Also, he was able to diagnose me with dysthymia (which is an actual illness?); and it is actually something I've ALWAYS felt, even when I was really little, and although growing up things got better, I'm still struggling with it.   


So what is the problem? I think EMDR is not good for me. What we had been doing in these months was mainly focusing on my past and my familiar situation, but I do not have major traumatic events going on in my life, and often the ""little traumas"" are so small that I even cannot remember them precisely. All I have is sensations, faded memories, histories that I've told myself over and over, ruminating on them. And he has of course hard times working on me with EMDR.   
My main struggle remains dysthymia, and is something I feel like I need to resolve in order to gain my balance back, and deal with my other problems (aka my brother which is not able to sustain himself and lives still with my parents past his 30s, my future career, and other daily struggles). And he's not helping me with it at all; I still self sabotage and do not know how to deal with myself, and my behaviours are gradually getting more and more self destructive.  


So basically, I'd like to switch to CCT and ACT (which are also the recommended therapies for my condition). I've talked to him today about this (I haven't said I'd like to switch to CTT), and he was really nice; he proposed to set a little aside EMDR and switch to the systemic-relational therapy, or even just help me find another therapist.  
Also, he said that according to him, I don't really need psychiatry right now.

Honestly, I do not know if I should just switch or not. I’ve given myself 2-3 days to figure it out. What would you think about this?  


TL;DR I'm dealing with dysthymia, my therapist is specialized in EMDR and systemic relational therapy, is basically focusing on my familiar problems in order to set right my dysthymia, still I don't think it is helping at all. He proposed to me to use EMDR only when necessary and focus my therapy on a systemic-relational approach. Should I still find another therapist and switch to comportamental-cognitive therapy?",04Sep2019,1
131,"Hello I need some help. Some advice of some kind :) 

I have OCD and therefore frequent intrusive thoughts about death and other stuff. Because of that my mind is often going on and on about the same shitty thoughts. 
 
I've been trying lately to focus on other thoughts than the intrusive ones. Not like thinking positive or trying to look at them rational, but really trying to focus on other thoughts that isn't related to the intrusive ones. Like thinking about movies I like, making top 10 lists and analyzing them. Thinking about my friends and things related to them. Everyday kinds stuff :)

However my minds constantly goes back to the intrusive ones, and i get more stressed the more I try to think about something else. I have a really hard time keeping focus on these thoughts and letting them flow naturally. I don't know if I'm trying to much to control my mind. 

Does anyone relate to this or have some advice? It would be really helpful &lt;3",04Sep2019,2
132,"It's been 1 year and half since I (23F) started my journey into therapy.  
My first therapist was specialized in TA (transactional analysis). I've seen her for about one year, mainly because of anxiety and my academic results. She never did an actual diagnosis, helped me a little bit, then she stepped back and appointed me to my current psychotherapist, which is specialized in systemic-relational therapy and EMDR, for the latter one mainly. She also added that if the EMDR did not work, she'd suggest me to open up to psychiatry.

Anyway, my current therapist is really good. I can see he's got experience. First of all, he diagnosed me with dysthymia (and is just satisfactory that I have a name for something that I feel since I was a child), also, I really opened up with him about problems concerning my family, which I held purposefully back with my previous therapist mainly because my parents scared me out. My family had previously been into therapy when I was little because my older brother (now in his 30s) suffered from ADHD and other stuff (which either my parents never talked me about or simply was never diagnosed) which was never been cured since the therapy was interrupted, so my parents thought well to advise me against therapy because if my therapist knew about my family situation, he'd convince me ""through psychological tricks"" to make all my family come back to therapy. LOL.   
So now I have an older sibling which is not able to take care of himself, depends totally on my parents, and which I'll have to take care of when they'll die (he does not want to see a psychologist, too).  


Still, my family is something I can live with happily for the moment, my dysthymia is not. But since he's a systemic-relational therapist, he's of course focusing on my family and my relationship with each component to see if he can spot traumas to resolve my dysthymia. Which is something that maybe can resolve it on the long run, but right now leaves me with self-sabotage and destructive behaviours. And of course, negative thoughts which are played on a loop.  
So, right now I'd like to switch to cognitive comportamental therapy or ACT (which are also recommended therapies for my condition). I've talked to him today about this, not saying I’d like to switch to CCT, and he was really nice: he proposed to either just set a little aside EMDR and switch to systemic-relational therapy, or even to just help me find another therapist.

133,"So I've been playing my favourite sport for over 6 years, I've been on the brink of quitting a few times.

I'm not enjoying matches or training anymore. I just don't look forward to playing it. I have some teammates who I just don't get on with, there's around 3-5 of them who are in the school year or two above me, they don't insult me directly, it's hard to explain but I have a gut feeling. They just seem off... when I talk to them they reply with an odd tone, it's sort of an arrogant tone mixed with the voice of someone lying to a young child. I don't trust them, I just want them to leave me alone and not to talk to me. It's hard to do that in a team sport though, especially when there's over 10+ in a team at one time, it's a bit like a 'boy who cried wolf' situation, they used to lie to me and leave me out of stuff a few years ago and when they compliment me during a match I don't believe them. I believe they are mocking me and I end up not believing them, not believing in myself, messing up, having what sounds like panic or anxiey attacks, etc.

It's affecting my mental health within school and my friends. I've spent years working so hard to fix my mental health and improve my confidence buts it's starting to crash down again. Mental health issues such as my paranoia I've finally managed to push away and ignore 4 months ago is coming back. It's affecting my friendships and I'm overly suspicios of people I once considered friends (not close friends). It affects my concentration during school and my eating and sleeping habits.

I don't want to quit the sport, the season ends in a few months and the team will be split based on age group, me staying with my friends and the others are moving to an older team. It's really badly affecting my general mood and I've got a deep, unjustified rage at them. I don't usually have a short temper but I feel pissed whenever I see them. I'm tempted to shout at them and let my anger out but that isn't right. I don't know if they deliberately mean this but I feel like I'm slowly being driven insane and I can't properly handle these next months.

Any advice? Is anyone else going through this?",04Sep2019,3
134,"At 16 years old I started working for ""MM"", we provided rehearsal spaces, instrument tuition, song-writing advice and performance skills sessions for young people. We also organised gigs/tours with other young bands as part of a community outreach kind of thing.

A few years in (I was maybe 19 by then) a new kid started to show up, around 15 or 16 years old. He was loud, obnoxious even, but very talented. He was a confident performer and had people in stitches backstage. I liked the guy. He came to sessions for a few years and then grew out of it as they inevitably did. I'd see him around sometimes and we'd exchange brief pleasantries then go our separate ways.

I didn't think much of it until a few months ago when I saw he was dating a girl that I knew, social media connects people in strange ways sometimes so he came up as a suggested friend and I added him. We said hi, asked how we were each doing, I asked if he was still writing and playing etc. Just the usual. Then later on I see his girlfriend is having a baby, I say congratulations, he says thanks.

And then I hear that he came off his meds when his daughter was born, but after a few months off them, he took his own life last weekend.

My first thought is ""that's terrible news, I hope his friends and family are ok""

My second thought is ""there are too many cases just like this""

But now my only thought is ""he must have been suffering and now he's not...maybe its not such a bad way out""

It is a very intimidating thing to try getting help especially when suffering with anxiety and such.

I wanted to create a resource where people share their own personal stories and experiences so those who may feel alone can read others experiences and feel less excluded from the world as well as learning techniques for dealing with mental illness that may not involve medication.

136,"Hi, I am 20 years old, and I have been suffereimg from this weird thing for last 3-4 years and I have literaly tried everything I could, but nothing has helped a tiny bit, and now Iam im the worst state ever. 
So, what happens is that whenever I try to do the smallest of tasks, like bringing something from nearby shop, helping out someone in any small chore, read anything informative, watch an informative video, watch a movie, or literally doing 'Anything' at all, I start feeling a weird headache, and it keeps getting bigger and more painfull, as I force myself to do that task. When I talk about any kind of bigger tasks, the headaches gets so big that I just have to quit, and I just can not do it however you force me to. 
It doesnt feel like the normal headaches, I feel like some kind of acidic fluid or something is getting filled in my brain, and it causing the issue, I dont what the actual cause of headache is, but thats just how I imagine it. 
This headache started a long ago when I was in school. I was a very promising student for the teachers and my parents. I wanted to become a scientist, and I used to work so hard, I didnt waste any time at all. But then, one day, when I was playing my favorite video game of all time, my mom shouted at me, for not paying attention to my studies those days. It was at that moment, that I first felt that headache for the first time. Then onwards, I always felt it whenever I played that game, and that game became the worst thing to play. But slowly slowly the headache started to get triggered by other things as well. It kept spreading and spreading into all things, and now Iam here, where I cant do anything without the headache. 
I dont like to do anything, no productivty, no enjoyment, i hate going out, i hate driving or riding, i hate studying, i hate creating something, i dont enjoy life at all, and all my dreams have shattered, all because of the damn headache. Anything i used to love, i hate it now. I dont attend my college at all, and just keep lying in bed using mobile and computer. 
I have no idea what is wrong with me. According to internet Iam supposed to go to a psychatrist, but Iam too ashamed to do so. I feel like the psychatrist will think iam a fool and then i will be seen as a weirdo to my family for pretending to be mentally sick. Everyday, my life is getting worst and worst and I cant do anything at all. If anybody could help me out, and give me some confidence, then I might take some steps, otherwise, i dont know for how long i will just keep suffering.",04Sep2019,1

I didn’t see him again until I was 11 years old and he was 14 so pretty much we had very close sibling relationship but that relationship stopped when me my mom and two other siblings had to move because she had gotten a new job in Indianapolis and believe me I hated living there because my mom didn’t have much money to feed us but she made sure her kids had food in their stomach and because we were staying in a bad neighborhood. We stayed there for a year until my mom moved us back to the place we to live and we were nothing but happy. 

I was happy until the day (I was 12 at this time and my birthday was next month) after Fourth of July when my dad and uncles were drunk and having a great time and left. Me and my brother came back from the store for junk food so nothing strange. I went to my Dad’s room as I usually watch tv in there when my brother came in and gotten on top of me that I told and beg for him to get off before he kissed me and left the room leaving me in the room crying (he was 15 at this time).

Because of him, I was too scared to my parents and that I almost committed suicide in my school bathroom and was sent to a mental hospital where I stayed for 3 days (also I was born prematurely and I’m already suffering from mental health issues as of now) and that I can’t get along with kids my age. The whole school knew about it and I had to be homeschooled. I didn’t tell my mom until I was 14 when I accidentally let it slip to my health teacher and she told my counsellor after school that day where CPS and Police got involved because my brother ran away. 

My mom cried and hold me but I couldn’t see my dad for a whole year. It’s 5 years later and I haven’t seen or heard from him since. I’m 19, just graduated high school, and now getting the help I need in order to work and to keep my anxiety. Now my mom or my dads side of family hate my older brother and disowned from their lives.

142,"Whether someone wants to commit suicide is their business, whether someone has threatened to hurt someone else is a matter of law enforcement, and whether someone “can take care for themselves” is not for the government to A). define and B). decide. 

The idea that simply because someone says they want to hurt *themselves,* the government takes their freedom away is so egregious an over step of citizen liberties. The number of people “saved” as a result of this tyranny is unknowable, (personally? I think it’s low, really, really, really low).  And regardless, I think it was a mistake, and has opened a door to something worse. 

I was involuntarily committed. I essentially had a panic attack accompanied by OCD like tics and rituals (constant  forehead rubbing, muttering to myself). My mother called an ambulance and I consented because I thought it would be ok to talk to someone. (That’s how a lot
of these stories start, family members, “concerned friends”—anyway)  Because of these tics, I was told that “I couldn’t take care of myself” over very animated protests to the contrary. They told this with authority to a 26 year old woman, not to mention verbally fluid and resistant woman, they had known for half an hour. My rights as a FREE CITIZEN were STRIPPED from me on the basis my behavior was generally strange and they personally didn’t get it. YOU CANT STRIP SOMEONE OF THEIR FREEDOM BECAUSE THEY LOOK WEIRD TO YOU. I said this, a lot. They locked me up for 12 days. 

I’m 26, healthy, not a danger to myself or others, never expressed or indicated that.  What the hell is the government doing telling a 26 year old who is not a retard and has working limbs that they can’t take care of themselves. They LOCKED. me. UP.

The fact that the government allows a room full of strangers to decide they know you better in half an hour than you have known yourself for 26 years. To decide what “good” means for you as it relates to your life. And they don’t need evidence, it’s just their word. And then of course they give you meds, so many meds, they have meds for everything ! and if you take them for two weeks they let you out. They don’t “get to know” you, they don’t “treat” you. They pump and dump, then send you home, and they BULLY anyone who is passionate about having their personal freedoms stripped, implying THAT’s childish.

145,"Okay, so ive been dating this girl for about a month, its been going quite will but last night she really opened up to me about her personal beliefs and what she believes in with regards to the universe/inter-dimensional entities. Long story short, she opened up telling me about how since she was 13, she met a friend (in the real world) who can communicate with a parallel universe (which is essentially the DC comics universe). She claims her friend is the daughter of the Joker and Harlequin. According to my girlfriend, she currently exists on this planet, as well as in this parallel universe. She claims to be able to communicate with her parents in the parallel universe, although her friend is much better at ""getting through"" to them. When her friend communicates with the ""other side"", my girlfriend says they do it on video chat and they compare the messages they hear from the other side, and according to her they always end up being very similar.

What is worrying to me is she says she is quite often troubled by the issues going on with her life in the parallel universe. She says she used to cry every day because she was so sad about possibly not being re-united with her dad in her other life. She claims her strongest bond with anyone is with her inter-dimensional father. I could go into a lot more detail about the specifics she told me, but I feel its not necessary. I am just wondering if possibly this is just an overpowering fantasy that she still believes in, or if it is a serious mental health concern. She is currently 17, and says that her life on earth is secondary to her life in this parallel universe.

147,"Some context: my wife has really bad OCD. Not the fun type you see on TV where the house is always immaculate, but more the spend an hour washing your hands while sobbing because you don't feel clean or not going to the bathroom more than once a day because then you'll have to wash your hands.

She wasn't honest with me about it when we started dating, but I'm not exactly an attractive guy so I tried to make things work. Things got bad when we had been dating for a few months and my mom got real sick. She's out of country so I decided to go and my girlfriend wanted to support me so she bought a plane ticket too. This was the start of her OCD manifesting while she was with me. It got so bad that the day before we left she threw away our packed suit cases because she might have touched them with ""unclean"" hands.

The trip back to my home country was awful. I won't go into details but by the end of it I had decided to break up with her ( I know I should have been a better boyfriend). Once we were back home and I told her she was quite upset. She promised that she would get help if I just stayed with her. I guess I did love her (or maybe I was just afraid of returning to that incel life) because I agreed. It took forever but we found a doctor she liked and we started going every other week. She was reluctant to take medicine at first but the doctor was fairly insistent so she agreed.

With medicinal help it was a complete turn around for her. She still had OCD and still had her rituals, but she gradual began stopping them and becoming a much more open person. She wanted to try new things and we started being much more adventurous together. 

Things were great, 3 years later we got married. We were already living together so not a lot changed. One year later (a month ago) my contract ends for my old job and I get a new one on the other side of the country. The pay is a little better, but I am working 12 hour days now and rarely home. 

The problem is, we didn't really prepare for me changing jobs and I didn't realize it would take a month to get on the new company's insurance. Her medicine ran out about 2 weeks ago, and with the added stress of a new city and me not really being home, things have gotten much worse. I came home last night with her sobbing because she needed to shower because some water in the sink splashed her in the face and she didn't want to shower alone.

My insurance came in yesterday, but when I tried to talk to my wife about going to a new doctor she's really resistant. She tells me she doesn't want to take the medicine any more because she's fine without it, it's too expensive, it's a hassle to go get, and it didn't do anything anyways. She doesn't believe me but I can tell the difference even if she can't. I love my wife. I want to be supportive. I just don't know what to do. Even if it's not medicine I still think it would help to have someone to talk to who knows how to help.

I realize there probably isn't much advice anyone can give, so I guess I'm just venting. Sorry for wasting your time.",04Sep2019,2
148,"This is not a joke I have been absolutely fucking traumatised, I was lying in bed, minding my own goddamn business when I felt a little *scuttle* on my shoulder, I look down AND THERE IS A MONSTROSITY OF A SPIDER CRAWLING AROUND ON MY SHOULDER I mean no joke this thing was huge so I jumped up quickly and feel onto the floor and tried to get it off me BUT NO, I thought I had got it off me but I turn and look in my mirror and ITS ON MY BACK so trying my best not to scream (my whole family is asleep) I slap that absolutely nightmarish creature onto the floor and it scuttles off into a carrier bag so I trap it in a glass and just sit there,staring at it traumatised until my dad came and saved me and he congratulated me on my brave actions (I felt too bad to squish the poor thing EVEN THOUGHT ITS RUINED ME FOREVER)  and now I’m never sleeping ever ever again. You may think I’m joking about being traumatised by this but I have a huge fear of spiders and I’m seriously scarred by this.",04Sep2019,1
149,"mental health is deteriorating. upset at how mean people can be. i have nothing and all i want is health care. i feel like im not asking for much but everyone else seems to think im asking for everything. i came here for support and i am getting the same reactions as the people around me in real life who are offering no support. everyone is telling me that im wrong, that im lazy, that im not trying when that's the furthest from the truth. im lucky that i have a roof over my head. it makes me feel so bad for the people who dont even have that and are being treated terribly and told they cant do anything.",04Sep2019,1
150,"I just had a terrible day, and I was hurting so much, but I did something that really helped. It's nothing magical, but I do think this can help a few of you guys if you decide you want it to.

  I started repeating a mantra in my head that I am using to make myself see that whatever I'm upset about, no matter how much it feels like it won't, will indeed pass. No exceptions. That's the most important part: NO EXCEPTIONS! I think its really important to have something like this, even if my specific mantra doesn't speak to you. Somewhere inside you, you know you're worth it, that you'll be okay, that life isn't black and white and the world is not as bad as it seems, you know that and you're tired of hearing it because doesn't feel like it at all; there's something keeping you from actually believing it when you're hurting so much. When it feels like your world is in ruins. But  it's an illusion. A really, *really* convincing illusion. You need to be able to remind yourself of all of this when you're in a crisis. 

My personal mantra: being kind to yourself is harder but it hurts less. I repeat it over and over. Being kind to yourself is harder but it hurts less. Being kind to yourself is harder but it hurts less. 

Here's why. I tell myself: That's why you use positive self talk. Not because it's easy or because it's what your therapist said or what a random redditor said. You do it because it hurts less. Admit it - ""this is really hard for me"". So fucking hard, so why keep trying, right? The thing is, I don't know about you, but I'm on thin ice and  I can't deal with hurting anymore. I've been through a lot these past few months, weeks, and especially today. I'm so goddamn tired of trying, of supporting myself. It doesn't feel natural, or worth my time. It's so hard. But you're tricking yourself; you belittle yourself, you feel worse. So much worse. ""Be kind to yourself"" sounds cheesy, but that's because your brain has been taught somewhere down the line that there's an exception for you somehow, that you're not worth it. But I think you really know deep down that you are. So be kind to yourself - it's harder but it'll hurt less than hating yourself. PLEASE help yourself hurt less. Believe it or not, you have that ability, TRUST me. This part is important! This is what you can control; literally the ONLY thing you can control. Allow yourself to take advantage of this. Being kind to yourself is harder but it hurts less. So do it anyway. 

Whatever your mantra, pep talk, etc is, it needs to remind yourself of something your brain can't fully convince itself is true in a crisis. This is really helping me stay away from hurting myself at the moment, so I wanted to share. I just want to stop hurting. This is how I do it.

TL;DR: If you're really struggling right now - whoever you are - be kind to yourself, because although it's not as easy or convenient as hating yourself, I promise it hurts less. That's my mantra. And if that doesn't speak to you, find something that does that can help you remember that you are a person too. That you are worth loving. At the end of the day, we all want to stop suffering. So please try to help yourself feel less pain. You. Are. Worth. It. No exceptions. You deserve a break -  you know I'm right. So give one to yourself.  

If this helps even one person, then I'll be glad I spent an hour writing this ...😂",04Sep2019,7
151,"long story short i didn't make the tennis team and my mom's being pissy about it and i feel like shit and yay puffy eyes hehe

we ended up arguing because she said i didn't ""fight for the position"" and ""had no actions"" to improve myself

""all bark and no bite""

it's true i haven't acted, but she hasn't considered the fact that i'm blowing my ass off for geo, which takes most of my time, and i have all honors, which is pretty heavy

plus, she has the same problem, so then i yelled at her ""you too!"" and she was all like ""oh THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT \[you little shit\]"" being a passive aggressive big ass ""fuck you"" and stormed off and now she's watching her fucking phone upstairs

she's trying to get me to quit tennis -- a sport i had been playing for well over four years ! yippee!!!!! all because i didn't make the team freshman year!!!!! yippee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and also she says i won't be able to do anything in high school bc my time is gonna be ""full of other things"" and would you look at that i'm crying again yay

she also called me an idiot so i mean that's fitting for someone like me :)

i want to make the team next year but she says if she were the coach she wouldn't even consider me for the lowest ranking",04Sep2019,1
152,"So ever since I was around 8 I noticed wierd things about a select ammount of mh memories. The weird ones seemed to have a different sense to them? Almost an emotion I dont recondnize, while at the same time it having a flavour but not being related to flavour at all. To put it in easier terms, I would feel something like smelling and tasting but it is neither of them. So a whole new sense? Its odd, whats most odd is that it tends to link to nostalgic memories, but not every time. There isnt an exacf pattern to it. As an example, when I was 5 I had a memorie linked to eating too many jolly rancher's then vomitting. I can describe the feeling linked to it would be a bitter sweet flavour? Thats as good as I can explain it. Thats the closest one to a so called ""flavour"". Most are nothing like that. Its hard to explain. Some can carry heavy emotions with it. Songs can also be linked to them",04Sep2019,1
153,"Though this may not seem like a mental help post off the title, it most likely fits here. Im a 16 year old almost 17 in a few weeks, I should be in grade 12 but I’m 4 courses behind. Around February of this year I fractured my ankle and had potential for surgery if I didn’t stay home and rest, and my school wasn’t willing to supply homework for 2 of my classes (and the other 2 only provided work that covered 10% of what they actually did, minus tests and all that Jazz) so I failed, and I was thankful.

I was thankful because I hate school, I hate the anxiety of attending everyday, of walking to school, I wonder if that stranger thinks I walk wierd, anything I could possibly think others would think about me I thought. At school I feel as if I could just throw up. 

I had about 8 months away from all that and it was bliss, but of course there was the lingering thought going back, My mom is a single mom and none of her children could ever go through with their education completely because my dad was a bit of a A-*Hole to say the least (he wasn’t around in my life luckily) she has hopes for me. She went to grieve with her family once my grandfather passed 6 months ago, and has had many many things stressing her, one of those things recently was me going back to school. 

I don’t want to disappoint her, or even stress her for that matter since she has High BP and is at the risk of a heartattack, I don’t want to be the reason she has a heartattack because she deserves so much better than that so I’ve decided to suck it up and go to school, even though I know for a fact I’ll be on the verge of clinical depression (if not suicide) but I’ll have to risk it. 

Now the topic of the title, my brother (best brother in the world no /s) has been saying it’s fine if I don’t want to continue high school, since he doesn’t care this point, I’m old enough to think for myself, but if I’m not doing high school I examined to
Him my anxiety. He asked if wanted to get therapy but I have no clue what that’s like so I told him idk. We talked for an hour and he convinced me to get to to school, and he suggest 6 courses per semester, 12 total over 1 year so I have both grade 11 and 12 done over and I can just chill for summer and a semester after that. 

He also said that for my own good he could put my PS4 to rest for the time (which if I go through with this option of 6 course per semester is
It what I’ll probaly do) I’ve talked to my best friend about the school situation (nothing about my mother or my anxiety) and he says I should just take another year since I won’t be able to mentally and physically manage 6 classes of work and night school would allow for less time to even do work. 

Though the guidance counselled will tell me and my brother what do tomorrow. I’m freaking out honestly, I love my family and I don’t want to disappoint them, but:

There was one thing my brother said that made me smile and give my hope(?) any college or Uni could look at my track record and think this “this kid got set off by one semester due to medical reasons, but he came back into school and put in twice the work of any other student and somehow made it out alive” and that though made me think that it might be worth it plus I could do my mother proud, but it will destroy me mentally. 

Any thoughts, also if you read this all I sincerely thank you, I’m sorry if the grammar and wording was wierd I’m just typing this all very fast and frantically",04Sep2019,1
154,"Hey guys, 

It's all in the title. I'm a 3rd year middle school teacher and my depression and anxiety have gotten worse over the past few months. My doctor put me on Prozac in July and we switched to Lexapro two weeks ago, after I had a very bad depressive episode. 

My doctor and therapist both suggested FMLA and so I applied for 3 weeks off. I feel guilty about leaving my students for a few weeks, and the impact it could have on faculty if they have to cover my classes. I have full intention on getting all of the work done before leaving and having it taken care of. My first day of leave is on Monday, and I'm scared to let my teammates know. 

I already let my sister know and she said, ""this isn't the type of job you can just leave for that long."" (she's a teacher also) her words are making me feel even more guilty, and I just need to know others have made this decision and felt better about it.",04Sep2019,3
