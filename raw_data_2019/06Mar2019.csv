What are other ways that could provide a similar type of emotional release? The only thing I can really think of is exercise. Any other ideas for actually getting feelings out of my system? ",06Mar2019,5
1,"Hey everyone! I was wondering if people can relate to something I’ve noticed about myself the past few years (I’m sure some people can) and if anyone had any strategies they use for situations like mine. I want to improve my mental state. I’m (24f) from the USA if that matters.

I only feel so depressed it’s difficult to even go out in public or so happy that I can’t even handle it. I’ll be in one state for a couple of months of constant depression before it does a 180 and I’m so ecstatic that it feels super weird. 

Obviously I like the overly happy me better but it is so extreme that it almost hurts my body and feels like when you are a kid and super excited at Disney world or something.

Anyone have any strategies on feeling more neutral? I’d gladly just have a month of feel average or less extreme. 

Thanks and sorry if this post doesn’t fit into the sub. ",06Mar2019,1

3,"As the title says above. I’m mentally scattered, lazy, and I lack will power to change anything. I’m pretty well versed in knowing what I need to do to change my life. I just have a hard time actually physically doing it. And persevering at it.  I’m lazy, and unmotivated. I’ll wait til the last minute to do anything I need to do.  My brain is always scattered. In moments where I need to put my brain to use, (like at work) I get really flustered and confused very easily. And I end up having to leave the room for a second so I can calm my nerves down. It’s damaged my self esteem and self worth. I always feel less smarter than others because I can’t mentally keep up. I have a “what’s the point” attitude because I feel like my brain is wired to be this way. So I end up in this endless cycle.  I purposely went to the ER and told them I was having migraines and went blind for a second (I wasn’t actually having migraines and no I didn’t go blind). I did that so they can perform a CT scan just to see if my brain was out of wack. Maybe they’d tell me something? But it came back normal. I know that. I know sounds pretty stupid. I’ve gone to therapy a few times and explained my situation to them. I didn’t really find it useful. Although they said my best bet was medication. But here’s the thing. After a few weeks of taking the meds, I saw no progression. I am aware that meds are hit or miss, and take time. But eventually I lost the will power to even go to the therapist.

11,"TL;DR at end

Hi- this particular thing, which I will explain in a second, has been happening to me for years. It has made functioning like a regular human very hard for me in some situations, and leaves me frustrated as to why I cannot simply feel/act normal- and I don't even know why it happens. If it helps in interpreting my situation, I have been diagnosed with the following things: GAD, depression, gender dysphoria (although I doubt this last one has much to do with this particular problem, it certainly could, which is why I'm listing it).

So, if I'm out in public for more than, say, 2 hours (unless I am in school- this is the only exception. There are no others.), I become extremely anxious and tired. I have trouble breathing, focusing, my face begins to flush and get hot (which causes me to feel embarrassed, which only makes the flushing worse), and all those delicious symptoms of anxiety we all love so much. This makes things like getting together with friends (even just to chill at someone's house), spending time with family, going to academic competitions (which I do often, but they never go well for me due to lack of ability to focus), field trips, and going to the mall/anywhere in public to run errands or something very, *very* difficult for me. In situations where I have to interact with others or with my environment more, I may have a good 30 minutes of mental clarity and being in a generally good mood before I begin to feel anxious, tired, and very, very depressed. 

What's wrong with me? I've asked my therapist about this and she suggests I may be worried about the expectations set on me by society, but this makes absolutely no sense as I am well aware that when doing things such as going to a friend's house or just to the grocery store, I am not expected to ""perform"" well, and going out in itself does not make me anxious (unless I am anticipating getting anxious and depressed, which is quite embarrassing. I am actually currently writing this post in anticipation of reaching that state tomorrow during a 10-hour academic event). 

So, reddit, what I'm asking is three things: one, what exactly is happening with me? I have a friend who experiences the same exact thing so I know it's not just me. Two, do any of you experience anything similar, and if so, how do you deal with it? And three, how would you (either from personal or professional experience)  recommend I try to prevent, control, or cope with it?

TL;DR: When out in public for more than a few hours at a time, I become anxious, tired, and depressed. Why?

Will be crossposting this to a few different subreddits for a maximum amount of interaction as I am getting a bit desperate- this is affecting my ability to function like a regular social being and makes me just want to sit on my ass in bed doing nothing but watching youtube and playing video games, because I know that at least that is safe.",06Mar2019,2

I hate that I'm even making this into a problem, but I feel like I'll never look how I want to, and I have zero confidence in myself as a result.

We have a 2 year old daughter together now, I have no history of mental illness in my family but my fiancee just did some research and there is quite a bit of mental illness in her father and mother's side.

15,"You see, I've always been a weird kid. Always anxious, always alert and always concerned that something bad would happen. No one was surprised when I was diagnosed with two anxiety disorders and major depression last year, and no one even seems to notice my mental health has once again started to decline after a few weeks of improvement. All those mental issues are quite obvious through the way that I act, but recently I've been having a reoccurring issue and I have no idea what it's all about. 

When I was eight, I started getting really delusional that my mom was planning on killing me, even though I knew it was totally irrational. I never experienced any form of abuse and the only direct threat to my life had been two years earlier, when a landslide in mom's hometown killed 400+ people, but even then my close family wasn't affected. With the paranoia, came the homicidal tendencies and I would often find myself in the kitchen grinning at the thought of stabbing someone - anyone - with one of those big knives. I never told anyone about this because this was about the time social phobia started to kick in.

Eventually the delusions and the desire to freakin' stab someone went away, but whenever I have a depressive episode or when my anxiety is particularly bad, these thoughts come back and I am left wondering if I have another mental illness I'm unaware of. I'm afraid to act upon these thoughts and in several occasions I've had to physically stop myself from twisting my cockatiel's neck while I was petting her or testing a lethal dose of antidepressants on my mom. It's not like I forget that murder is wrong or that I am actually quite empathetic, but I always have to rationalize the weight of my decisions moments before I take them and this is making me horribly scared of myself. 

The delusional thoughts also creep in every once in a while and all of a sudden I have to be reminded that there is not a secret plot organized by my loved ones to kill me at once. Still, it's hard to convince myself of that and I don't want to turn on my close friends and family because of something I rationally know isn't true. ",06Mar2019,2

She called me over in the middle of practice (which immediately made me start panicking because I though I did something wrong) and started asking me where my gear was. I started attempting to explain that I hadn't gotten a chance to get it yet, but I was out of breath from both practicing and panicking and tried to answer, but my words were all jumbled which made me panic even more. Then, she started asking me if I was okay and telling me that I seemed nervous and stressed. She tried to tell me that she's a lighthearted person and that I wasn't in trouble, but all I could think of was ""She thinks I'm an idiot.""

(Here's the thing: I can't exactly tell her that I'm nervous because I don't like 1 on 1 conversations and being the odd one out or asking questions that might be deemed stupid. Not only because it's not something that you tell your coach, but because I actually could not find the words.)

She tried calming me down, but it made me panic even more until she just ended up giving me the paper with all of the team information (I had forgotten to grab it before) and telling me to go back to practice. I think I might've made a fool of myself.

Here's the part where the anxiety comes in. I was talking to my mom about the experience and as an offhand comment, I said, ""She probably thinks I have anxiety or something"" to which my mother replied, ""You probably do."" Now, my mom is no medical professional, but it made me concerned. I don't like to speak unless spoken to, and I often think way too much about past mistakes. Does this seem like anxiety?

I did not want to be in public places, seeing people would make me so exhausted. I would sleep even though I didn’t do much. I felt like I was I was delusional or living in a simulation. Which sounds crazy! But there rlly is no reasoning when I’m like that.

Possible TW: Suicidal thoughts mentioned briefly

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the last year of my degree, and my mental health has been pretty rubbish. I've talked to friends about it a few times, but I usually understate it - it's a bummer of a topic and I worry I'll lose my remaining friends if I keep bringing it up, as I'm already a bit negative (I'm working on it) and I think that turns people off.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with aspects of mental health since at least the first year of sixth form (UK education typically the ages 16-18) where I had what I think in retrospect was possibly a sorta depressive episode (not sure of the technical term) for about 2-3 months, in which I felt suicidal and very lonely and lost in life. This, I think, was mostly due to losing a few friends moving from school. This changed when I became best friends with a guy with a big social circle, and we got on really well. Sadly, it has since transpired that he's a scumbag (it's very serious, but I'd rather not go into details here) and we all cut ourselves off from him. I'm still friends with a few people from that time, but only a few I talk to on any regular basis, and I've moved hundreds of miles away for university so we only see each other a few times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first year of university I was doing okay; I already knew a lot of the content going in for that year, so it wasn't too heavy with work. I was in a relationship that lasted 8 months, but I noticed it was becoming dependent and we thought it was bad for our mental healths so it ended. In my second year, I moved into a house with a group I didn't entirely know, and one of them I was very incompatible with: very loud music in early and late hours, smoking drugs which stunk out the house &amp; might've gotten the neighbours on us, once even ordering class A (the ""most illegal"" classification in the UK) drugs through the mail to our door, etc. and I felt anxious and unhappy pretty much every day: his music was so loud on some days that I couldn't take a phone-call in my bedroom, and I felt like there was nowhere I could relax or chill out. Asking them to turn it down worked sometimes, but they'd often not respond for a while and I **hate** confrontation so that stressed me out and made me sad too. They also had to be asked on a daily basis (they'd turn it back up the next day) and would always argue that it wasn't too loud (the rest of the house agreed with me).

&amp;#x200B;

Paired with being in university late every night, a miserable house life, and not getting enough sleep, toward the end of second year I became very cranky and rude and I pushed away a few friends who I knew from a trip abroad. After second year, I realised that the hours I was working had made me very toxic (for 8 weeks leading up to the exam period, I was in the library 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and it totally ruined my personality for months - luckily I didn't take this out on many people), and since then I have been striving to a much healthier work-life balance. In any case, I have a much better control over how I express my emotions now, and I know my work limits better, so I think that problem is solved, which is good I think. Additionally, my housing situation changed this September, and for the first time in two years I finally don't feel permanently miserable all of the time at home, which I thought would fix everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back a tiny bit, on my birthday in January last year I invited two close friends (I invited a few more, but they were busy) on a night out, but I drank a bit too much and had to sit down. They went dancing and forgot about me for about a few hours, and I think that was the point that really started validating some of the issues I'm about to describe. Eventually, they came over and seemed to find it funny I was still there, and then went back to carry on dancing without even asking if I was alright. After a few more hours, I'd sobered up enough for it to properly hit me emotionally, and I walked for a few hours home crying (I didn't want to get in a taxi or anything because I didn't want to have to talk to anyone about it). They didn't ask me the next day where I'd went, or what happened, which is what hurt the most.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I decided to distance myself from them, because I figured that's not what friends do, but it's hard because most of the friends I'd made in uni were in a group with them. Sadly, that group changed quite a lot gradually and now has a very toxic (in my view) drinking culture. They established a system whereby if you didn't go to a certain number of drinking events in a row (typically there would be multiple such nights out a week, and I'm not a big partier so I would go once every 2 months or so tops), they'd remove you from the facebook group chat - funny ""banter"", I guess, but it was the only place I talked to a lot of the close-acquaintances-but-not-quite-friends I had. I tried seriously saying to one of my closer friends (one of the ones from my birthday) there that I thought it was unfair to do this, and they added one of the 'points' to me and laughed in the chat, which made me really upset. I left the chat then, and lost regular contact with most of the people. They seemed to think I was overreacting and being ridiculous, but they were serious about removing people (they had already removed some) and others agreed with me in private that it was toxic so I don't think this is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, most social outings (this group is 20+ people and makes up a substantial minority of the people in my year group that I used to talk to) are organised in that chat, which means I'm now rarely invited to anything but the biggest stuff organised by the society for my course. At some point last year, I asked to be added back while drunk, but I left again a few weeks later after finding out everyone in work (a lot of us worked at the same company over summer) had organised a trip to another city with literally no-one mentioning it to me ^((another friend also hadn't heard about it, and I know they don't dislike her so I don't think it was personal -- It just makes me feel like I'm forgettable and no-one gives me a second thought most of the time, especially since I was working with them daily)). That group chat was being filled with pictures of everyone out having fun and it just made me so miserable that I went home from work on that Friday super sad and crying.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for mainly that reason, for the last few months, I've pretty much been lonely besides my housemates. I talk to a small few close friends on messenger from university, but we rarely talk in person so it's not the same, and I don't know how to change that since there's such a long-standing precedent of our friendship just being chatting online.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also becoming increasingly volatile in my mood. For the past year or so, I have weeks when everything feels fine and I'm confident and happy, but then it's like a switch flips: the smallest of things brings me down. If someone does something minor like flake on a plan, or seem slightly abrasive when talking to me, then my internal composure falls apart, and I fall into a cycle of self-loathing (though I don't take it out on that person, of course). Small stuff also can reverse my mood quickly in the other direction - sometimes someone drops a random compliment about something my way, and I end up cheerful, over the moon, and feeling like everything is perfect for days: I'll get all household tasks done, finish coursework more productively, exercise, eat better, etc. A few weeks ago, a friend of friends who I had never directly spoken to started a conversation with me about dogs randomly on facebook, and it brightened my week because it validated that this group of people doesn't have some shared secret dislike/exasperation towards me, and just generally it was a nice conversation even if it wasn't of much depth.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle to get out of bed most mornings, and tend to sleep in for hours because any dream I'm having feels preferable to having to deal with the day^(I should add: I'm generally able to keep to commitments punctually, so I haven't devolved to a degree where I'm actively damaging my life other than socially - I always make my morning orthodontic appointments on time, etc.), and my social skills are worsening because of this whole mess, since I talk myself out of going to events - I figure no-one wants me there and I'll feel even worse afterwards. I've forced myself to go to things, and sometimes it helps, but most of the time it's counter-productive because I end up overthinking the tiniest things, get miserable, and end up feeling worse, and as I don't talk to anyone about it, the next few days are just even more miserable and even more lonely. Sadly, pretending I'm happy and the whole ""fake it until you make it"" thing just isn't really helping. I went to a big uni event in a spur of the moment decision last night, got a bit drunk, and ended up overthinking all of this, sitting down in the corner and crying for a few hours. A friend noticed but we're not close enough that I can burden them with something like this so I just pretended I was okay and I think I made up some excuse, and eventually let them get me an Uber home.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any advice from anyone, especially if you can relate to any of this. I don't think I have depression because from seeing people I know suffer from it, my issues seem a lot more situational and come and go on a weekly basis. Having written this, it feels like a lot of my problem is that too much of my general confidence in my social relationships lies in external validation, but I have no idea how I can change that.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something therapy might help with? I've thought about it, but never very seriously, and it's one of those things where I see people who're much worse and struggling with suicide etc. and I feel guilty taking already-strained mental health resources: the UK mental health resources, especially in London where I am, are very stretched. I'm also worried that if I speak to people I know about this then they'll just talk to me more or overcompensate out of guilt, and that's the last thing I want to happen, since it'd just validate all the worries I have already.

26,"So I’m in my first year of college, and I had to do a reading of a reflection I wrote in class. Long story short I thought I could get over my extreme social anxiety and just push through and do it, but unfortunately I completely freaked. One of my classmates even turned around and asked if I was doing okay because I looked like I was going to start sobbing. I didn’t end up doing the reading. So, my question is should I tell my professor about my anxiety and why I didn’t try to participate today?

27,"Hi all. I am very proud to say that totally I officially ended a toxic relationship with my former partner.

First off, this is not a post to bash my ex. I have nothing but love and respect for him. But after a long, exhausting, drawn out relationship I realized I needed to love and respect myself more than a guy that I have encountered several failed relationships with. He has had his chance multiplies times and never capitalized, it's time for me to move on a find better.

It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. Although I am not in any way wanting to start a relationship or get involved with someone else, I am really excited to eventually find my soulmate. I look forward to having someone that I share a home with, that I adopt cats and dogs with, and to be with someone who actually wants to be a part of my life. However, I am most excited to fall in love with myself again. Depression has really fucked with me, my health and my well being, but I'm hoping this recent change will help me to continue to move forward and look after myself.

I want to give everyone a gentle reminder that life is too short to be anything but happy. Please do not settle for mediocre, abusive or unmeaningful personal or romantic relationships. You deserve nothing but the best and I hope we all discover it when the time is right &lt;3

29,"TW!!! disordered eating


Hi I’m a 19 year old girl who is prescribed lexapro and doxycycline(skin) and around last fall i lost a bit of weight on purpose. Around almost 15 pounds. Which for me is a lot considering I’m 5’5 and before I️ lost the weight I was around 113 pounds. To be completely honest i loved I️t. People telling me i look sick, telling me i need to eat more ect the whole deal. My brother told me i looked very ill and in some sick way, i liked I️t. 

Recently have been ~trying~ to eat more. I know im gaining weight but I’m too afraid to weigh myself. I told my mom i was gaining and she seemed really happy and told me she could see it in my face and i don’t look so gaunt. I was supposed to be happy too but that stuck with me. I want to be so tiny i disappear 

I went from having my VERY SKINNY friend tell me to send her photos after i eat and that i was too skinny, to her telling me she probably wouldn’t fit in my old prom dress. Implying she was smaller than me I️ guess. Also other friend said “yeah she’s bigger than you but height wise, not like width” so that made me feel like shit. 

So anyways back to my actual reasoning of posting this. In elementary school i was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed adderall. Thinking of going back to the dr to tell him my ADHD is acting up and i think i need some meds just for the sole purpose of it makes you lose weight. (I know i know) or i could try diet pills but those scare me for some reason. Not sure what to do. 

PS: i do not think fat people are bad in ANY way. Do not think they are unattractive at all!! It’s just me!!! I dont know how to explain it any better than that.

31,"Hi all! This is a throwaway to protect my privacy. 

So I have been seeing a therapist to deal  with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. Things have been going well so far, he has helped me deal with a few different situations in my life that have cause a lot of mental problems. We were working on one today, and I was mentally guiding myself through a bad situation that happened several years ago, so that I could finally process it.

The first time, it was like I was in first person. Everything was normal, it was pretty unpleasant. I got a lot of tension in my body and I was pretty upset by the end, but he told me to just focus on whats happening with my body. So I did, and the discomfort eventually dissipated. 

The second pass was weirder. When I mentally got closer to the situation, it seems like there was some mental wall that initially would not let me go through. After that, it seemed like I was viewing the situation in 3rd person, with a birds-eye view. Everything proceeded as normal. And I came back around mentally with the same physical issues I had before. I opened my eyes, took a few deep breaths, and I was relatively ok again.

The third pass is when it got bad. At the beginning of the memory, everything was fine. When I got to the pivotal moment in the memory, it turned hellish. The protagonists (if you want to call them that) voices turned demonic and their faces started distorting in terrifying ways. I was able to follow it through, but I was a sobbing mess after. It took me a little while to calm down. 

I don't understand why this happened. It makes me reluctant to try processing it again. Has anyone experienced anything like this with a traumatic memory?",06Mar2019,1

Just venting...
I work in the mental health field as a PSR (psycho-social rehabilitation specialist)  I have a caseload of clients suffering from various mental health conditions. I work with them on reducing anxiety, controlling emotions, positive redirection, coping skills and the list goes on and while I excel at rehabilitating them I have recently struggled with applying those same skills to my personal life. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and while I have other stressors in life right now work continues to be the biggest of them all. I am about 2 months away from finishing my graduate degree, preparing for my upcoming wedding, working around my fiancé’s crazy work schedule, not to mention I feel like I’m not as close to my friends as we are getting older and drifting apart making it difficult to have normal communication. Many days I find myself working with my clients and then coming home and waiting for my fiancé and while he is amazing and listens to all my vent sessions, I’m still overwhelmed. I don’t have the typical coworker relationships with any of my coworkers they have at least 15+ years on me and we work individually with our assigned clients, we typically work in the field (all around town) so it’s extremely rare occasions we see each other. I’m trying to ride this whole thing out best I can but it’s becoming draining. My fiancé has recommended taking a mini vacation away from everything just to unwind which is extremely passed due...but then I get anxiety about taking time off from work.. I will figure things out I’m sure. Thanks for listening

I then have to get out, but on four swipes of deodorant, 4 things of moisturizer, change, put four squirts of perfume. Then, I try the back door handle four times, lock and unlock the back door four times, do the deadbolt four times then try the handle four times. I have specific steps, all in fours, I do this with the stove as well, then the front door, which I do the same routine twice, go back, do the back door one more time, and take certain steps back to my room.

45,"I am having a tough time figuring out if I'm ""normal"" or not. My fiance came from a pretty suburb, with a upper middle class family. I came from the middle class as well, but my youth had a bit more trauma. Divorce, sexual abuse, drug abuse. My parents split when I was young and my mom was the one with her head on her shoulders. She was the one with the big house and the white collar job. My dad on the other hand was a bit more rough around the edges. An alcoholic, by the age of 7 I was cleaning and cooking around the house. By 13 I was my dads drinking buddy. He taught me to race cars and he was always a womanizer. In adulthood I noticed that there were always 2 conflicting sides. One side (I gave her the alias of Eliza, my middle name) was doing drugs, having lots of sex with many different people, sometimes more than 2 a night. She was having sex for money on camera. Cheating on her boyfriend with no remorse. Then there was my other personality, she is the one that the world saw. She was happy (except when she wasn't) she seemed well adjusted and going places. My question is, does everyone deal with this sort of angel/devil type thing? Do I just have the personalities of my parents? Or is there maybe something mentally wrong with me?

When we were together, I was the happiest I have ever been in my life, everything felt amazing like you could have told by looking at my face that life is great (now it feels like an amazing dream I had). Until she decided to breakup. I was really fucking shattered and God knows I tried EVERYTHING to keep this girl in my life but she didn't give two craps about me and dumped me like garbage. I treated her like a queen! Always took care of her, told her everyday how lucky I am to have her and how beautiful she is and I'm the length of my relationship I NEVER let her pay for a single thing that's how much she meant to me. Well when she dumped me, it felt like the end of the world, cried over her for days and later realized she wasn't worth it. But I still do think abt her everyday and I feel like I'm going mad (for still thinking or caring abt this girl who treated me like garbage and later dumped me like one) I was insecure before her and now I'm more insecure abt myself so I cover myself in designer clothing in hopes that I'll have more people talk to me or like me or literally give me some attention or ANYTHING. That's how insecure I am, and I HATE it.

Well to the point, now that she's gone I feel LONELY AF like I can't describe. Sometimes it feels like I'll never find anyone. Idk if this hurts more because I loved her or I loved the idea of being in a relationship (because that was the first time I ever got that much attention in my life) sometimes the second option seems right because I really wana get back into a relationship (like in general) and sometimes the first option seems right because I want to be in a rs with her (idk why I still like and miss her) I literally have such a small circle of friends which adds to my loneliness. Right when my ex was helping me a little bit to come over my insecurities, she left. She left me in such a bad spot and I feel soooo fucking helpless that I cant describe.

47,"A little background :) 

Recently I was in a car crash on my way to work, giving some ligament injury in my hip. I couldn't walk for a month. It forced me to disassociate from everything I cared about, my friends, school, my job. I watched everything progress without me in addition to the flashbacks of the crash. It's difficult to be a passenger let alone drive to work or school. Today was the first day back at college and everything was anxiety inducing. I want to disassociate even further from my friends because I rarely had discussions past people asking me about the crash. I go to work for the first time on Friday and I fear that's going to be even worse. I visited my coworkers today and although they all wanted to make sure I was okay, all the people cluttered my mind and stressed me out. I have to been okay, but it's not like I can break it down without being the downer on everyone's day. 

It all boils down to when I'm alone at night, trying to put all of these thoughts to rest. I rarely even feel tiredness at the right time anymore. The entire day is incredibly exhausting, almost as though I feel the eye bags droop further by the minute, but once I'm in bed it's like it never happened. If I even try to ignore the black hole in my chest I've found that I twitch from the tiredness. Almost like intense spasms that only stir me awake longer. Then let's say I do fall asleep. Well at that point there's a 50/50 chance the sleep will be riddled with nightmares and sleep paralysis. I feel I've lost so much sleep that I'm becoming less functional in my daily lifestyle. 

I don't know how to help myself. I honestly don't think I can unless I'm willing to just wait it out. I don't see myself being the postive and reasonable person I was before, and it scares me because I don't know why I was able to forget how to do that. It's as if I never had that ability in the first place. With the financial setbacks from the accident, my parents won't be able to give me the help I need and I certainly can't either while attending school. Maybe there's not much advice besides those that include paying for a therapist or medication, but I'm willing to try anything. Thanks for listening. ",06Mar2019,4
48,"I don't know what messed up neurological mechanism is responsible, but I discovered ear rape helps me focus... so I'm rolling with it. Bear with me! I know it seems counter intuitive, and it's not for everyone, but ear rape helped me through many tasks. Those god awful, distorted, saturated meme tracks guide my mental process.

I struggle with serious over stimulation anxiety. I used to have a panic attack if I went to the mall for over an hour. The world around me seemed to attack my 5 senses until I just couldn't take it. For months, professional help yielded no results, so I scoured the internet for answers. One day, as I scrolled through a mental health forum, I saw a post about using ear rape to cope, and I was surprised to see a number of people in the comments reported it helped with anxiety.

The next time I got over stimulated, I put on an ear rape playlist for the hell of it. My initial reaction was to laugh. Unlike the ads and smells at the mall that were obnoxious in a subtle way, the ear rape was so blatant that the only way I could think to react was... laughter!

Right away, it snapped me out of my panic attack. As I continued to listen, the familiarity of the songs, especially the ones from my childhood, comforted me, as if to say ""everything will be alright"". I also found that turning a song into so-called 'ear rape' reduces it only to rhythms, and I love how decisive and repetitive the rhythms are. The volume, although quite loud, was usually consistent, which added an element of predictability, and when it was unpredictable, it made me laugh.

From there, I started listening to ear rape when doing assignments. It just seemed natural to help me focus. Of course, I'm not using ear rape as a substitute for professional help, but it is a good coping mechanism for me. I'm also careful not to turn the volume up to the point where it damages my hearing. To this day, listening to ear rape to boost productivity is the weirdest thing I've done that actually works.",06Mar2019,0

I don’t know what sparked this personality in me. I always thought it might have been my broken family life as a child. Your brain is shaped by your environment around you, right? My mom was very emotionally unstable. She would scream at me and my brother constantly. She’d scream directly into my ear for God knows how long while crying hysterically, then go to her room, slam the door and cry in her bed for an hour or 2. She was fucking crazy. 

And when I had anger issues, she dragged me to therapy for many many years. She never realized she needed it herself and that she was the problem. 

I turned to going after people, blackmailing, threatening, DDoSing, Doxing and more. My brother turned to drugs to cope. We were both messed up as kids. He died 2 weeks ago. The drugs finally got to him just because of our fucking mother.  

This isn’t something we could just get over. It’s scarred us for so long. But I also wonder if I’m just crazy because I hide away in my room. I’ve learned to hate the world. I’ve learned to channel that hate onto anyone that doesn’t like me. I need approval maybe. I don’t know. All I know is I do this shit and I don’t like it.  
 

I’ve noticed lately that I’ve really begun to derive pleasure from emotionally hurting others. Going after them. The people they care about all for revenge. When someone hurts me, I have to hurt them back in the saddest attempt ever by trolling them relentlessly. I need people to see I’m sensitive, insane and maybe if I threaten them enough, they’ll finally talk to me. It’s a strategy I’ve used many times and it sometimes works.  
 I don’t like when people don’t like me so much I’m willing to make shit worse just so maybe they’ll be forced to talk to me. That’s a psychopathic tenancy.   
 

Maybe I think I’m just like every other scumbag guy. The ones that cheat on his wife/girlfriend, gaslight them, make excuses to what happened, then beg for their forgiveness and try to get them to think they won’t do it again and they’re sorry. But they’re not. They just want to suck that person back in with their manipulation. What if that’s me? 

Knowing that I’ve ruined someone’s Twitch show.Knowing I’ve disturbed a Discord server and everything of that like…..I like it. When the attention is on me. I have this sick need to have the focus on me. I’m very self-centred and selfish. The second someone disagrees with me I have to go off on them. I get as much info, keep any pictures I’m given and any information they’ve trusted me with is fodder for blackmail. I see all of that as leverage in case they are to fuck me over. I say to myself that I care about my friends, but I’m easy to go to that lengths if I’m hurt. I can’t trust anyone. Everyone always eventually bans me from their shows and wants nothing to do with me. There is no permanency in life. Everyone I love fucks me over and we all die. I always have to get in the “I’m glad your dad is dead” or “Fucking get cancer and die” or “Kill yourself”. Because I am a sensitive childish asshole and I don’t know how to act like an adult.   
 

But knowing I’ve ruined someone’s day just because of some stupid minute reason I make them feel that way, it fills me with joy. I cause so much shit and it’s all my fault, yet I blame others for my actions because there’s always 2 sides to every story, and I always have to point the finger. So seeing someone cry and stop their show….it means I’ve won. I care more about that than having a friend. 

I always have to get my way, otherwise I keep this immature shit going. “Either listen to what I say or I will do this thing to you. I will not allow you to ban me/ stop being my friend” etc. I’m manipulative and have the mindset if you’re feared, then you’re respected. I don’t want this. I want to be better. I don’t wanna be like my brother was before he died.

Literally every time I tell her how she makes me feel because sometimes she'll come home nervous and take her nerves out on me, it'll end up with me being blamed and she'll call me abusive and say something insulting like when I get older she'll be in a nursing home and I'll be abusive to her. Then I end up feeling guilty and apologising when I know it should be the other way around. Or sometimes she won't apologise but she'll be really kind to me and kiss me on the cheek when just an hour ago she was being mean and making me feel like sh\*t.  I suspect I have ADHD and I also tried to tell her I have trouble focusing, like I physically can't focus even on things I'm interested in because my brain always wants to do something more stimulating and she says ""thats how everyone is"" and my dad agreed with her then she just said it's because I'm lazy. I don't know what else to do, I cannot talk to her about anything. She'll some how make it my fault, and make herself out to be a poor innocent victim. She has done things I consider emotionally/physically abusive (mainly emotionally) and if I were to bring it up to her she'd say ""thats not abusive"" or ""hahaha you're still on about that, what did I give you trauma?"" or something. I didn't mention this to my Pysch and I'm going to, I feel like holding it in has given me stress. Sharing my feelings with her just makes me feel regret and feel worse than before. **Has anyone else been through something similar? Is this a form of manipulation or what? My** Great Grandmother I know was very cold and mean, my Nanna is so pedantic and 99% sure she's severely OCD, and my mum is a hypochondriac, OCD panics about the worst case scenario as it becomes real in her head. I feel like I'm the only generation to have a degree of self awareness and is not a mean person.",06Mar2019,2
55,"Sorry this is going to be a wee bit long. 

I can't remember a time when my life was really exciting, but it wasn't bad either. I was happy with my life living in a small village without any friends, reading comics.

Fast forward to my late teenage days, my mental health started declining. I got diagnosed with ADHD and OCD started taking over with depressive episodes. And after taking my meds for some months, I started putting on weight. At the same time, I started my college.

Didn't take much time before I lost my self esteem completely. My grades were bad, I was getting overweight. The future I was dreaming started looking grim. After a year of being completely invisible in my bedroom, I got some friends. Days got better, I started enjoying life again. I was still depressed, but I could cope with it. When college ended, my grades were much better, I was enjoying life and all.

But after college almost all of my friends left for pursuing better things in life, I still wasn't ready and so I thought of taking a break of one year, get my shit together, practice a lot and try to get into an art school. But it backfired. Without college I didn't have much to do, or even if I did, that freedom didn't really allow me to do something productive other than sleeping. I ended up with double the weight I already was. Lost my motivation to do literally anything I loved to do. My dreams and ambitions took a back seat. My memory started getting worse, depressive episodes were frequent. My temper was something destructive. It wasn't only my life and career that was getting ruined, but my whole family was suffering for me. 

After some months my family forced me to go to this new Therapist in town. This new guy almost ""forcibly"" made me do the things I like. Sent me on trips, even sponsoring some. Made me take an apartment of my own. A slight change in my attitude came after some days of therapy. When I saw whatever the therapist was doing work on me, I got a bit of my courage back and fought back against my head. It was really stressful, my temper and mood was really bad, but I started seeing a difference after a while. Plus I wasn't very alone in this, this therapist of mine really helped. Although I'm still living off of my parents' money (a lot of people in my country do, the lifestyle is pretty different), I'm trying get a small job. I'm still kind of sad and hopeless, but I'm pretty optimistic now. My body language, the way I talk has changed into something normal. I'm more pleasant to look at now. I have started losing weight. And only after a couple of months of seeing this therapist, he today has told me that I've already become a source of inspiration for his other patients and I deserve a lot of credit for it. I feel pretty good. Not overtly happy or something, but I'm having that warm, nice feeling inside me right now.

I still have a very long way to go, but I'm optimistic. I still don't have any hope for my future, but I'm preparing myself to get ready for whatever my future holds. ",06Mar2019,4

57,"I don't know how to explain this apart from calling it ""having imaginary friends"". The thing is that when I was a depressed and bullied teenager  I would cope with my loneliness and fear of going to class everyday imagining an alternative life where I would go to school and have lots of friends. With time I would give those fictional friends a face, a name, a personality... And would imagine myself interacting with them and being loved.

As years have gone by I'm starting to do better thanks to therapy and I actually have good friends now. But sometimes, when I'm feeling sad or something bad happens to me, I still go back to that imaginary place with those imaginary friends, and I don't know if this is a weird thing to do, if I should talk about it with my therapist or if it is a thing that a lot of people actually do and shouldn't care about it. I'm afraid I'm being creepy by doing this, and don't feel capable of asking people around me because I'm afraid of them leaving me if they find out I'm weird.",06Mar2019,1

But few months ago very pretty girl who is way out of my league talked to me and we started dating, which was of course by far the best time period of my life. But after about a month she said she wanna break up, which was devastating for me, now even after 5 months i still feel depressed, feel like there is no point in doing anything, cuz i'm sure i wont find a girl like her ever again.

the thing which make me sad the most is that i feel i could've done so many things differently , which should've saved the relationship. Because i was very new to this, i really messed up many things related to our relationship. I feel i could've thought deeper and done things differently.

I tried to counter this thought process and told myself past is gone, things always happen the way they meant to happen and there was nothing i could've done to change things. But several times a day, mostly in mornings, i feel this deep despair of wasting the opportunity of living a happy satisfied life.

This has caused people around me to not trust me entirely... Also depresion is huge in my life bc of abuse from my narcisistic dissmisive yelling and explosive father who up to this point hasn't recognised his wrongs made me lie even more thru my life.

I never had a personality, dad controlled everything and embarrassed me every time he got the chance, just to prove he was smarter. No arguing was allowed and his point of view was always the right one. Recently he has told me that I dont have to do all that he has to say.. Really? But when I corrected him or made a comment he would shout/ make sarcastic remarks of how stupid the comment was or entirely dismiss me.

67,"Okay any background info that could be important: I've always suffered from some type of depression or mood disorder, anxiety, insomnia, and add. Usually I'm moderately to severely depressed for a couple weeks then go to a happy and stable and everythings great period. I do sometimes feel a bit too good during this time. Past couple years my depressions have been less frequent but more severe when they happen. There could be other stuff and there probably is but a bad experience with mental health services when i was 15 makes me avoid therapy and psychiatrists that talk to me rather than just prescribing what i need. I'm currently prescribed 20 mg adderall up to 2 a day which i don't take every day, i take 20-30 for homework on some afternoons/evenings, sometimes 40. Also prescribed temazepam 15 mg for sleep. In general my sleep schedule isn't abysmal, its not the best but I'm usually rested enough. I've also been sexually assaulted and currently have a case open with my school against my assaulter. I've been struggling a bit with sleeping pill abuse but the timing of that doesn't line up w/ these symptoms so I think its unrelated.  I also for the past few days have had a very very small appetite barely eating half a meal a day if that.. but i dont feel hungry or tired bc of it. I'm getting over a cold, but usually colds dont cause appetite loss like this for me. Ive never had a problem with most of the symptoms below. Day to day if i'm not depressed (not currently) I usually don't feel too bad besides the paranoia. Thats all the stuff i can think of that matters. Ok so as for whats been going on lately....



For the past few months I have been getting more and more paranoid all the time, especially walking home alone at night or in my apartment at night. At first it was just regular checking a lot to see if I'm being followed which is what i should do, or double checking that i lock the doors to my apt, etc. now its to the point where i feel intense fear if i see man out late at night when I'm alone, sometimes i wont go to my friends apartments if i have to walk home alone after, sometimes i get convinced someone or something (i dont believe in ghosts or spirits or demons really but when I'm in this state its a possibility to me) in my apartment to the point where I'm double check the locks multiple times before i can sleep, etc. 

The night before last i took adderall too late, only slept 2 hours, the next day i felt fine as i was rested before that and then night came, i felt overly energized and couldn't sleep till 5 ish am when i finally took 2 Benadryl's. Sometimes this happens to me when i dont sleep, i go into this like hyper awake state. I was feeling a lot of paranoia and i was laying in bed and i heard clear as day something whispering my name. So clear i jumped and sat up. After that i thought something was in my room and when i turned the lights off besides my lamp, i could see these black lines moving all around my bed and room and i assumed it was proof of demonic energy. It was light enough in my room to where it wasn't just seeing shit in the dark. After staying anxious about it for about 30 min i realized i was probably just being paranoid and the benadryl kicked in so i fell asleep. 

I've heard my name whispered once before this and i wasn't sleep deprived that time. Ive also thought i heard radio chatter (prob a misinterpretation of my air conditioner) and was convinced someone was bugging my room and i was somehow getting feedback from the other side. I was sober and rested that time too. I know it could be the lack of sleep that caused the visual stuff but the connection to the ongoing paranoia and hearing my name scares me.

now tonight, i'm not sure if this is related or not, because what happened tonight could just be adderall. but i was getting this intense buzzing? Ringing? sound and sensation in my head. Not tinnitus, not in my ears, like in my brain and skull. It didn't hurt but would speed up and slow down if i paid attention to it. It was really bizarre. 

I don't know what i'm asking for, maybe just some thoughts on what this could be, if its severe enough to see someone for or if i should wait it out and see if it gets better. I really hate mental health offices as i said but if i'm truly losing my marbles this time i'll go. ",06Mar2019,2

76,"Hello all. I am 40 and have decided that it is probably time to sort my mind out. 

I am in the UK and I am not sure if I need a therapist, councillor, psychologist or psychotherapist. 

I have issues with OCD since I was 6. I went to see my doctor last year and she gave me a phone number to call - I did so and it was a “signpost facility to guide people to information on the the website”

Father who was already severely disabled through stroke, died when I was 6. I lived with loving mother - who hasn’t had a friend since my Father died and rarely leaves the house. With no family around it was a very isolating experience (although I did play outside with local children). When I left home for Uni (where I failed after smoking with housemates for 3 years, I made no other friends)
and again at 23 to move in with some local close friends (beyond that and my mother I never spoke to anyone else really)

My wife is the first and only relationship I have had. I met her on a dating site on 2004. I adore her, she is gorgeous
I and admire her, but she isn’t a good friend. She isn’t into anything I like
(music,film,concerts,gaming,clubbing) and in her free time just chats with friends on Facebook. 

One of my obsessions now are that I have smoked weed daily since I was 16 and although it is destructive I have no wish to stop it. I have to hide it from my mother (16-18,21-23) and my wife (24-40) who both highly disapprove.  The hiding alone is very stressful.  I start dabbing concentrates from when I wake until bedtime as there is no smell and I can do it in seconds.

Another is masturbation to online porn. Again, daily since 12 - so 28 years. Yes that’s before the internet - i used to run a bulletin board system from my bedroom when 12-14, then early internet. Now i watch cam girls every night for 3-4 hours. My wife goes to bed early.

I have always hated how I look, as in, I feel I am the most loathsome creature. I hide my face where I can, and just blank out how ugly I must appear when talking to people. I have self harmed from 14-22
with pins and cigarettes.

I have never had a conversation with anyone where I’m not more worried about maintaining eye contact than what is being said. I rarely listen fully to what is being said.

I bite my nails and the skin around them, worse than most of the examples I can see online. They hurt constantly.

I have 5 children, 10,10,8,3,2 and feel I could be a better father without these issues.

I am semi retired, in 2004 my obsession made me build a high growth web company that I sold in 2017. I worked 20 hour days for 10 years can’t work out what to do with myself now except smoke, and I can’t snap out of it - and don’t especially want to.

77,"Self care is super important, people go to great lengths to take care of themselves, trips with significant others and/or friends, spa days, meditation, yoga, cheat days, buying a new pair of shoes, etc.  But why is taking care of yourself with a medicine so wrong?

I have been a sufferer of depression for most of my life, my parents can attest to this, it is not something I just made up because I was sad one day.  I have been in and out of therapy since I was 8 years old.  I have tried SAD lights, exercise, herbal supplements, making new friends, trying new things, tanning, changing my diet, none of these things alone are enough. So I take an anti-depressant. And you know what? It helps me, a LOT. I feel well enough to exercise, I am not so tired, I can go more than a few hours without feeling overwhelmed, tired and helpless.

And, as you can guess, being majorly depressed for most of my life has had its consequences, a constant struggle in my marriage, failed past relationships, failed friendships, currently failing friendships, a daily struggle to make sure my children know how much I truly love them and to stay on top of the parenting tasks which are sometimes close to impossible to achieve for me.  I have a lot of guilt for my part in these failures, because at the end of the day who is to blame but me?

And it just doesn't fucking help when self-righteous people tell me that I shouldn't be on the meds, I shouldn't rely on them.  Maybe I should try this or that, or maybe just smoke a joint man... Do you think I haven't tried all of those things?  Do you think I want to have to take meds every single day just to be okay? No I don't Brenda... thanks for the unsolicited advice. 

I have friends and family that medicate using cigarettes, caffeine, exercise, pot, sleep, shopping, alcohol, almost any vice you can think of that LOVE to tell me how awful it is that I take an anti-depressant. And let's not even mention that I have both of my kids on meds as well.  For severe anxiety and ADD, they love to comment about that too, like I am hurting them with medicine rather than trying to help them... That's so fucking rude, I don't tell them consistently that I disagree with them smoking pot from sunrise to sunset so that they can even function at a basic level. (Also, I don't disagree because its their business and they are tending to their lives as they see fit and not hurting themselves or anyone else...) but why the stigma with mental illness and medication for it?  Why does everyone, from friends, coworkers, romantic partners, teachers, etc feel the need to tell me that they disapprove of how I take care of myself?

79,"I know this is a long one, but I really need your help. 

Almost two years ago, I went on vacation with a friend. A few nights into our trip, we ended up meeting a guy who gave us some MDMA--we were drunk, stupid, and figured we were on vacation, so why not? 

There are few things I regret more in my life than taking that pill. I have never felt so immediately out of control and out of touch with reality, and yet so convinced that I was finally seeing the world clearly. We were on the beach and saw headlights coming towards us, but I'd lost my shoes. Instead of leaving them behind, I insisted on running back along the shore to find them, despite knowing that the beach was closed at this point and that there were patrol cars on the way.

I managed to run back to my friend before they caught up to us and she couldn't believe how unreasonable I was being. Unfortunately, that was only the beginning. After that, my mind was racing a mile a minute and I couldn't stop rambling about this sudden ""revelation"" I'd had about the human condition. 

Essentially, I had this thought pop into my head that humans are animals, and that we are sentient beings, but we're the first species of our kind and that our brains are still grappling with instinct and emotion vs. rational thought. I suddenly saw this as a way to explain all of the problems in the world. Here are some pieces of ""evidence"" I thought of to support this: 

\- humans self-medicate with drugs and alcohol to numb not only our emotions, but consciousness in general (being heavily intoxicated allows us to run at an almost-instinct and emotion only level, removing rational thought)

\- since developing consciousness, humans have always been at war with their consciousness vs their animal/bodily instincts. However, it looks like we've slowly evolved to be less violent and more empathetic throughout history. This would suggest that as conditions became less dire, our survival instincts were deemed less essential, allowing us to slowly evolve past the extremely territorial, war-hungry, violent traits of our ancestors... 

\- I was then convinced that although human bodies haven't really evolved for some time, our collective consciousness is constantly evolving, and maybe that IS our evolution from now on--our evolution is now less concerned with evolving our bodies, but evolving this consciousness that nature has only just started to form in our species

\- maybe the current political dichotomy in our country (republicans vs. democrats) represents a pull between two camps: those who still prioritize our primal hardwiring for safety, shelter, reproduction, more of a survival of the fittest mentality (right to bare arms, right to property, anti-abortion, etc) and those who prioritize rational thought/compassion and are less affected by the aforementioned instincts (support social programs, reproductive rights, race and gender equality, etc)

\- technology can be seen as the evolution of our consciousness. Like, in some way, we recognized that perfect consciousness isn't currently attainable in a human body with the flaw of our animal instincts, so we're building machines in our likeness that are free of said flaws

Clearly, I was out of my mind. I've tried MDMA before, and that was definitely not what we were given. For 5-6 hours straight, all I could think about was this huge revelation that humans are animals and that we're the first animals to have rational thought and that we're an imperfect evolution, caught between primal instinct and sentience, and that we're all doomed to grapple with this polarity forever (or until we naturally evolve to a point where our brains are more equipped to handle this division, or evolve to phase out the primal instincts in general, but then what would keep us reproducing and evolving? Isn't that the very essence of nature itself?). I sat outside smoking and rambling all of these weird theories into my phone's voice recorder because my friend had long since fallen asleep. I couldn't find any paper in our cottage so I wrote out my thoughts on the back of a cereal box. I finally tried to go to bed, but I could hear what sounded like faint sports commentary and cheering, like there was someone watching a game on tv in another room.

Since then, I haven't experienced the same kind of total break from reality, but sometimes I still find thoughts like the ones above popping into my head. Like, I'll be reading something in the news and I'll suddenly start to think ""it's because we're all animals and..."" but then I'll immediately feel deeply disturbed and have to try to focus on something else. 

It's been two years and I'm still getting these random thoughts about the strange theories I came up with during that one horrible drug trip almost two years ago. Every time, it sends me into a panic and I can't stop worrying about having caused some serious irreversible damage to my mental health. I've been really stressed out lately and I've noticed these kinds of thoughts popping into my head more and more. Does this sound like I'm schizophrenic or is it maybe PTSD? 

Why is it that I can't think about human nature without feeling like I'm going to have a complete breakdown? Were these revelations factual in any way? Are they common knowledge, even? If so, again: why can't I think about it without feeling like I'm going to break my brain?

Thank you to anyone who read all this. Any insight/support would be greatly appreciated. I'm feeling so scared right now. ",06Mar2019,22
80,"I've made posts on here before about how I've been. On Sunday I took another overdose which lead me to be in hospital for a couple of days. I was seen by the crisis team and they've now arranged for me to have the home treatment team visit me regularly, I've also had my meds dosage increased. The thing is last time I took an overdose when i left hospital i felt like I had a bit of strength again to fight my thoughts but this time I feel like I have non. When I saw the crisis team in hospital this time I even told them that I'm most likely to attempt to kill myself again in the next couple of days. The other thing that has scared me was when I was talking to the crisis team member I had a strong urge to grab the needle and stab my arm repeatedly because I felt really shit. But during that urge i had a brief thought of stabbing the other person with it and it scared me. I'm just scared that I'm going to get those thoughts again :( today all I've felt like doing is either stabbing a knife straight through my arm or going to the viaduct near me and jumping off it. I think even if I try to kill myself several times more and am unsuccessful the crisis team would be unwilling to have me put in a mental hospital (probs due to funding or something). I was wondering whether there was anyway to get someone like a family member request me to be placed in a mental hospital because at the min I'm likely to attempt to kill myself again soon and with the thought I had of harming someone else. I'm from the UK just as an fyi.
TL:DR- I'm a danger to myself (suicidal thoughts and have attempted) and have had one thought so far of harming someone else. I want to know if a family member could have me put in a mental hospital so that I would be able to attempt to take my life again.",06Mar2019,3
81,"I’m just desperate at this point. I really just want this to stop so bad. I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t anxious and terrified and nervous and angry for more than a couple hours. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, panic and social anxiety disorder years ago. I’ve been on a multitude of meds, none of which worked for me. 

I’ve been trying to contact a counsellor through my work but the line is always busy. I called a suicide hotline last night because I was cradling my bottles of old pills and a bottle of whiskey. I wanted to do it but the thought of my poor heartbroken mother is too much to bear. I’m such a coward.

The voice in my head won’t STOP. I just want it to stop. “You’re too fat, too ugly, you’re bad at your job, everyone knows how stupid you are, you’ll never be anything more than mediocre, everyone is sick and tired of hearing about your pity party, nobody cares, kill yourself” 

Idk what to do anymore. I’ve tried CBD, CBT, workbooks, meditation, the gym, it won’t stop its relentless. I’m desperate

84,"*(tw: mentions of self-harming)*  


I have a long history of self-harming and dealing with passive suicidal ideations (w/o the actual attempt or intent of dying). My depression was manageable for the most part, in the sense that I could still function and pretend that I was okay, so I never really felt compelled to get help before.

&amp;#x200B;

But two months ago, it got really bad to the point that I could barely get out of bed, I lost my appetite and interest in everything, and I felt hopeless and was tempted to self-harm literally every second of my waking moment. I was forced to look for help, but since mental health resources were scarce where I'm from, it took me a really long time before I finally found a psychiatrist who was available to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

By that time, the worst of...my 'episode' had worn out. It felt bizarre; like one day, I just woke up randomly feeling a lot more clear-headed. I still have a constantly low mood, and I'm unmotivated / withdrawn, but I can at least eat now, get out of the bed, and force myself to do things if I really have to.

&amp;#x200B;

I still went to see my psychiatrist since my appointment with them was already booked, and I was told that I may have dysthymia (or the kind of depression that was considerably milder but doesn't really go away). I was prescribed with antidepressants (20mg fluoxetine) and was advised that I check back with them again by the end of the month.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this was my first appointment with a psychiatrist, I still feel hesitant to take the antidepressants because I heard the side effects could be really bad, and that once I start taking them, I can't just randomly decide to stop on my own. And also because I feel relatively 'better' now, so I'm not sure if I should still take the medications. I still have healing wounds and past journals to prove that I was definitely feeling suicidal not too long ago, but on 'okay' days like this, I get doubts and fears that maybe I was just overreacting at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

**For those of you may have longer experiences with antidepressants (and/or therapy), do you recommend that I still take the medications anyway and that I keep seeing my psychiatrist?**

&amp;#x200B;

85,"Anxiety is just the tip of the iceberg. Along with anxiety, I have a severe phobia. I can not be seen naked or see anybody else naked without having a severe anxiety attack. I can also not show much skin without having problems. Because of this, I wear long sleeve and jeans/joggers every day to prevent my anxiety being triggered. During my anxiety attacks, along with the common symptoms, I often hear voices and lose touch with reality.

I have no way to treat or cope with my anxiety because if my parents find out, they might abandon me again. The closer my parents get to me, the angrier they get. I don’t want to lose them again.

88,"Small back story, I’m depressed and have anxiety. I’m also borderline anorexic. I have been Medically Suspended from my job following an overdose and just want to be back. The other day I tried to write what was on my mind and here is it. Hopefully someone can make me feel not alone?🤞🏼


Do you know what’s really sad? Because i’m sat constantly trying to distract myself and keep busy, I keep finding myself checking my phone over and over again to see if anyone has messaged me. To see if anyone cares enough just to ask me how I am to check i’m okay. Not one single person has messaged me. ‘Friends’ saw me get taken to A&amp;E last weekend, not even one of them has sent me a message just checking in, am I expecting too much here? I assumed that once I opened up and allowed people in I wouldn’t feel so alone, but the truth is, in this week, I have never felt more alone than I do now. Knowing people know, yet still no one cares enough to speak to me. I have been so proud of myself this week and I have been trying so fucking hard, but I have no one to share that with and no one who cares about my progress and how i’m getting on. This time last week I had spent the night in hospital on a drip, 7 days on and I have been free from self harm, I have been eating at least 1000 calories a day, I have cut down on pointlessly walking to burn calories and I have been fighting against my mind. That takes a lot of courage and a lot of power and I am exhausted. Who am I fighting for if no one is interested in if i’m okay or not? All I want is to be back at work and for things to go back to normal, I am fighting so hard to achieve that, but it’s extremely demotivating when I have no one to share my pride with and no one checking in and showing they care. Maybe i’m asking too much, maybe I really am alone. 

Maybe I really am a burden to people and should leave everyone alone. I should have learned by now not to expect anything from anyone but I can’t help myself, I just want to feel loved and cared about. I waste too much time checking to see if my messages have been read, if people have been online since I wrote to them. I waste too much time thinking about reaching out to someone yet never doing it because I fear the rejection I am so used to receiving. I waste too much of my time worrying that a little message will annoy someone and make them want to mute me or never speak to me again. I don’t want this life. I just want someone to care and support me throughout my recovery by just being there and just being a hand to hold when things are all a little too much. Obviously my s/o is the light of my life and is my absolute rock, but everyone should have a friend, shouldn’t they? A friend who can provide love and kindness, a friend who can put a smile on my face and distract my mind. A friend who I can talk to about complete nonsense and have a laugh with. Why can I not have that? I guess I don’t deserve it. I just want a friend. This sucks. I’m not giving up, i’ve been doing it alone all these years, so maybe thats just how it’s supposed to be. No one wants to be my friend and I need to accept that and move on. I want to work on me and discover who I am. Lonely.

90,"Hi, I am a 16 year old college student in the UK. I really do not know where to start because I dont entirely know what my issue is.

Over the last few years (since year 8 (about 12-13 years old)) I have has constant what people say mental illness symptoms. I had bad facial eczema on my face (google it if your interested) and was bullied for it. Verbal abuse, people laughing at me, trying to hurt me etc.. This continued well into year 9 until I eventually stopped feeling any of it at all. I felt dead inside, barely feeling happiness or anger or anything and lacked empathy when talking to my friends. This caused me to lose many friends but some of them still stuck around which I am incredibly grateful for. This continued until yr 11(15-16 years old) when it finally started to see an improvement and felt true happiness in a long time. I got pretty good at masking my emotions, smiling whenever I had to so that people would not ask anything. I was afraid of them worrying. I started to punch walls and furniture when I got angry or upset and I managed to hide all of this aswell.

Now that I have gone to college, it feels like its starting all again. I feel like my eczema is getting bad again and even though people say its fine, I feel like my eczema is getting bad like they are lying to me even though I 100% trust them. I opened up to some of them about all of this and they all said i should of and still should go to the doctors about this. I have occasional, what I think are panic attacks but im not entirely sure. I have weeks were I just feel down and tired all the time. I have lost a fair amount of weight for no reason even though I eat the same amount. There are mornings that I have to force myself out of bed. But when I talk to my friends about this, I always feel like im lying or that they think im lying and I have no explanation or reason for this. I do not want to go the doctors because of this because parts of me think this is all made up and I could never tell my family about this.

I rarely punch things now and I rarely have thoughts of suicide. I got pretty good at controlling this i guess. I really have no idea what to do I feel lost but I never know why or anything.

Thanks for anybody who reads this and even more if you respond. I had to force myself to this and It helped a little and I understand if you dont care about any of this.",06Mar2019,10

No one it allowed to call him out because then he plays up how he’s “fucked up in the head” and how no one understands and we’re all against him. It’s been like this for so long it seems like my whole family just bottled up emotions and is all messed up and quiet because of this. At family get togethers, outside family members even notice how much we all do not talk and how weird it is. It sucks because no one is allowed to have any emotions in my family, good or bad, only him. We only have to think about him.

Through it all I kept a public face and plodded forward.  I got help and got medicated, and then I got real help and got off of the meds.  All of this, and finding my desire to get back into doing what I loved has taken over 5 years.

I'm a 49 year old man and I am doing well.  

BUT

Before it all went bad there was someone who I thought was a friend, who I mentored, that word got back to me was shit talking me behind my back.  I confronted them, they apologized profusely and I let them back into my life.  Then they stole some of my work and tried passing it off as their own.  This time when confronted they called my work hack... So I cut them completely out of my life.

My career was stalling around here, partially due to marriage stress partially due to the start of my depression

Later I lost a contract because the owner said ""he heard bad things about me"" and didn't want me in his establishment.  The following week, guess who had that job.  The ex-friend.  I was offered a better contract elsewhere and the ex-friend messed it up so badly they were fired within weeks.

They came to me to apologize, blaming others for the ending of my old work contract.  I did my best to ignore them and move on... but I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety.

Through it all, I managed to keep clear of the ex friend... mainly.  A few run ins where I ignored him.  He began to get brazen, invading my personal space, stepping into conversations with others.  I was ambushed by a friend of his asking to explain MY BEHAVIOUR .  They seemed surprised by the history I recounted but others backed it up.

He had a package delivered to my house as a means of apology..  I had moved twice since we last were friendly.

People treat the anxiety I feel when he enters a room like it is a joke.  I am larger though he is about 10 years younger, people joke that we should have a cage match.

102,"After being unemployed for 1+ years after giving up my stressful job (high stress, I got down with clinical anxiety &amp; depression), I finally landed another job in a much smaller company 2 1/2 months ago.

I just walked out from it yesterday afternoon, not with a concrete reason, but I have this intense gut feeling that I don't want to be there.

The job itself was ok, had some annoying customer but no big deal. I got along with the rest of the guys too. The only thing I can really put my finger on is that I don't like my boss.

Here's what I would describe him, based on my interactions with him.

* Not very agreeable, keep pushing his opinion, sneers at your rebuttal as if it is not good enough.

* Capable of saying whatever things that is convenient at the moment.

* (Maybe a cultural thing but) His manner of speech to those beneath him can be belittling

Now normally, I would just say that he is just another hypocritical stuck up boss, but my instinct is telling me something else, that I should stay away from him.

All this while I brushed this feeling off as just something in my head, but with my anxiety symptoms flaring up quickly in the last 2 weeks, I chose to trust my instinct this time, gave my notice and walked out (Still in probation, so 24 hrs notice). This is the most outrageous thing I had done in my working life so far.

Here are some other significant events.

* A sales guy dropped some hints, saying ""when 3 out of 4 guys in a group leave, who do you think is the problem?"" (3 out of 4 exec staff in the company had left, only my boss remained, and we new hires are the replacement for those 3)

* When I gave my notice, we had a long talk, I had a feeling that I had been gaslighted to feel that it was me who had not voiced my problems earlier, and the boss is always open to listen to our concern &amp; ready to  compromise to make things work for us. I had no evidence for any manipulation here, but my instinct says otherwise.

104,"This may be a bit long as there is a lot of detail to try to shorten as much as possible. My grandmother is 84. She sits and writes ""stories"" that she calls ""books"" that basically ramble from one topic to another, just sentences apart. They're more so, ""I remember when..."" or ""Back when I was living at x place..."" type of statements and just start out in the middle of nowhere and talk about odd things. 75% of it doesn't make sense from a common sense standpoint. The events that happened and the things she said/did/claimed to have seen earlier in life indicated that she was having severe mental issues possibly since childhood.

This grandmother somehow raised 3 kids - my mother (now 61) and her two brothers (in their late 50's). However, their lives were rough. My grandmother constantly moved them from apartment to apartment, claiming she couldn't pay the rent, the kids moved from school to school every year and such. My grandmother was never financially stable. Her day-to-day life has always been out of order, she never knew the right thing to say or do and that sort of thing. She quit or got fired from lots of jobs due to hallucinations, false accusations against the employer and general rebellion (""I'm not doing x tasks, I don't care what you say!"" mindset towards employers). She would get a car from the car lot and want to ""give it back"" to them when it needed repairs or maintenance, wanting to get another in a cycle. A lot of her jobs were nurses-aide related stuff, so sitting individually with older people in their homes. They said she left their dishes dirty/greasy and didn't wash them properly. My grandmother would claim that the woman she was sitting with was ""really a man with strap-on hips"" and just all sorts of absurd things. She would claim the house owners left the doors unlocked all night, that the house was surrounded by woods and just be scared all of the time. Yet say that she was never scared.

Present-day: She hates everyone and has for a lot of her life. She makes up blatant lies against neighbors, family members and people that she knows. She can't watch the TV/news without judging the reporters, saying they're ugly, that they ""must be Asian because they have black eyes"" and making odd comments that don't make sense. Sometimes given her description, I think she's hallucinating and not seeing what we see. She thinks a neighbor from 20 years ago two houses down has basically set up speakers/mics throughout the neighborhood to torment her. So she hears sounds of people dying (she calls them ""death tapes""), screams out of nowhere, footsteps, grinding sounds, loud music, sexual stuff, etc.  She once called the bomb squad from a store and told them that someone in the attic of the house next door said a bomb would go off in xx minutes. It was raining hard and she said there was a ""crackling noise like something was about to blow up.""  That in itself didn't even make sense. Bombs don't crackle. My mother had taken her by the store and she went in to buy something and made the call. When they came back, there were police  and bomb squad people everywhere. The authorities would not take her for a mental evaluation. We haven't been able to get her help.

She has problems functioning in general. Doesn't know when to go to bed or get up. Opens the blinds and curtains at times like 4am. She wants the curtains near her bed wide open all night long. A couple of years ago, she started running over to look out of the window every 1-2 minutes. She'll go from the living room window to the dining room to the kitchen window looking out of each curtain. Then back and repeat. Hundreds of times per day. She has nothing to do and nowhere to go, but she'll get up at 6am and be pacing from room to room for an hour or two, then go back to bed. The same during the day. She'll pace for hours from room to room for no reason. There are times when I go into the other room and she's so anxious that she's standing 2-3 feet from the TV and can't even sit down. The dog picks up her anxiety and likewise flips out. She runs to the bathroom sometimes 1-2 minutes apart, claiming to her daughter that she ""didn't finish"" the first time. She was too anxious to finish peeing. Unable to cook anything without burning it (decades-long problem), will drink out of dirty glasses, can't wash dishes/utensils/pots properly and is unable to open a package with ""open here"" on it. She seems to have had problems following directions for all of her life, so she'll rip a big hole in the side of a package rather than ""open here"" as directed. If you challenge any of her rants at the TV, she'll turn on you and start saying you're siding with them. Then if that fails, she'll start making up lies about what the TV or newspaper said and they didn't say any of those things. She is a very chronic liar for a lot of things. No idea why. She has done that for all of her life.

Supposedly decades ago, some doctor or something diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia with high anxiety. Boy is it high. I have come across a lot of people with mental issues and I have never seen anyone like my grandmother. I assume her hallucinations are the paranoid schizophrenia and her delusions are mostly the persecutory type. She relates events, objects and people that have no relation to one another. 

Is this some form of psychosis or something? Most days she just has this wild, blank stare out of her eyes. Every time we take a family photo, her mouth is hanging wide open and she's staring with wild eyes into space like she's see a ghost or something. ",06Mar2019,12

They said I told them I had it and they will not change their records. They based this I believe either on the medications I was on or the fact that i already had a mental disorder. Or it was an error by the staff. My med provider sent a letter stating my diagnosis and purpose of medication, but this does not resolve that false information has been passed to other parties.

 I also had an extremely hard time getting anyone to work with me. I am just wondering if it was not a mental health diagnosis, say diabetes, if I would have been dismissed as I was. I've reached out to state agencies, nami, disability resource, and a lawyer to understand. Nothing has developed yet and through this process my medical information became public record.

Not really looking for anything, just wanted to vent and suggest checking your health records for accuracy. 

Has anyone else had to deal with this, what was outcome? How do you prove you have never been diagnosed with something you didnt even discuss or have history of?

Stay strong.

 I apparantly had been listed for anger issues because I said I felt angry on a new medication and that I overdosed because I said I felt very loopy on the meds. My doctor's words defending me, not mine. The whole situation which goes deeper than above has me distrusting the medical profession and regretting seeking help or being open.

I stepped outside in the morning and heard 4 loud gunshots. Looked up to see a dude running away and a small woman wailing and sobbing. I rushed to her aid after making sure the gunshots were done. After all was said and done and the police arrived, here's what happened.

A guy was being pursued by a shooter in a car and tried to use the woman as a shield. She was very nearly shot, and even reported feeling bullets whisk past her.

109,"I guess I've been struggling with anxiety for most of my life (24, M) but did not know it was anxiety until very recently. I would always procrastinate projects and events in high school. EVentually leading INto college I found myself actively trying to avoid social events that revolved around drinking (not much of a drinker), however now I am realizing that by staying in most weekends I kind of lost out on the social aspect of college. Combined with that and my continual procrastination of work due to being overwhelmed by a bunch of projects led me to failing 2nd year and changing my career field.

I find that the only way to cope with all the thoughts in my head is either to use CBD oil but that only gives a minor relief or I just get high so that my mind isn't continuously racing around.

114,"We are open to any advice you guys may have for us in terms of acquiring funding or support for our mission to utilize art therapy to help with stress and low morale on our high school campus. 

Who are We?
Our team consists of Collin Stewart, Kyle Gorgonio, Andres Roa, and Jesse Lapid, and we are seniors at Cypress High School located in southern California. We are mental health activists who want the school environment and community to be more aware of the psychological impacts of school standards. Because of the expectations to get into a good college and the belief that good grades will set you up for a good future, students have constant anxiety which impacts their overall mental health. The creation of this group was made to counter this problem and make people more aware of this issue.
What Do We Do?
We had several plans at first, starting from planting more greenery into the campus to painting murals around campus to, where we are now, having a Saturday Academy event at our school. This Saturday Academy event will consist of students painting on canvases to relieve stress as well as learning self-defense, as part of the partnership we have with “Action!” The overlying title of this event is “Martial ARTs” because of this combination of painting and learning krav-maga. With this event, we want students to know of their outlet options to take them away from all the stress. 
What are Our Goals?
Our goals consist of helping students find positive outlets to deal with their stress. This comes in the form of painting, running, sparring, and other forms of physical activities. We really want students to know that they are not alone and that we all have to cope with these expectations. From this event, we hope students and adults will be more open to addressing these issues so that they can become stronger as individuals. 
What is Our Future? 
Our future actions consist of this Saturday Academy event and helping make this effort last beyond our years here at Cypress High School. We really want people to know their options so that they know that they are not alone. For the sake of mental health of students, we hope that these events have a long-lasting impact.",06Mar2019,2

Then the OCD went crazy. He couldn’t put anything down for fear of it starting a fire and he couldn’t walk away from his car because of all the checks he had to do.

Lately for me, things have been overwhelmingly tough at work and with school. At first I was incredibly stressed and I felt like my emotions were out of control, but now I feel totally numb. I have no motivation to do anything, I can't hold a conversation, I feel totally empty, and just mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted. Just completely burnt out. Its affecting my work performance and people I work with as well as customers have noticed (I work in customer service/retail). 

Tomorrow I'm going to my GP to discuss my options for help. Something I would like to do is take about a month off of work for stress leave/short-term disability and to attend regular counseling sessions. I guess my question is whether taking the time off of work is a good idea or not? Work is my biggest stressor - my manager is absolutely awful and I can't sleep at night because of the dread of coming back to work. 

I'm worried my manager or coworkers will shame or judge me for this, and I'm worried about repercussions for when I return to work. I also feel bad about leaving them since our schedule is already made for the next two weeks and my manager would have to replace all of my shifts.

My best friend moves very (painfully) slow and I’m used to it but it’s just straight up annoying and frustrating how slow she is. 
For example, if I am driving us somewhere, I get in my car, sit down, buckle up, turn on the car before she even opens the door. She delicately opens the back door (four door) and places everything in just *so*. Once we’ve arrived at our destination, she stays buckled up and just stares off into space while I unbuckle and get my things together. She doesn’t notice I’m ready to go until I’m opening up the door, and then by the time I’ve closed and locked my door, she keeps the passenger door wide open while she gets out and checks herself out in the mirror. This drives me absolutely up the wall because 1) I live in a very big city that’s known for sex trafficking and am constantly on guard. After one negative experience I am even more aware of my surroundings and know to move quickly when I’m out and about 2) I’m ready to GO and it feels like she’s being slow on purpose 3) I have to lock and relock the door because of the way my car is
Even if I’m not late, I want to walk fast or drive fast or get ready fast. She pointed this out while I was going 20 over on the highway because she had somewhere to be and we were running late BECAUSE OF HER and I wanted to slap her.

I feel at a complete loss. At the beginning of the year I tried, and very nearly succeeded in, killing myself. I have battled with myself since I was a young child and have suffered with self harm and suicide attempts several times throughout my life. Right now, I feel very much as though I’m drowning and everybody around me is just watching me.

I moved to a different country to live with my father and haven't been able to finish any school programme due to my inability to focus and anxiety.

I'm lately having some kind of fear and anxiety attacks, where I think that my life is doomed and that I'll never be able to have friends/a good job/people will hate me. It's collateral damage coming from bad friend relationships, where I've been rejected because of my poor posture and perhaps even bad breath. Although I exercise daily and still am able to have fun with things like music, video games, maybe even rapping, I always do back to the thinking that I'm not worthy of a normal life. I struggle with anxiety because I (sometimes) walk funny and hunch a bit and because I haventbeenlucky with befriending the right people, after being rejected and hated because of how I am I now am afraid to even go outside and sometimes I'm having huge battles within myself. One part of me that tells me that life is beautiful, I'm good looking, I'm smart and creative, fights with the part of me that tells me I'm useless, have no real education or skill, have no chances of having friends or a girlfriend due to my inability to focus on a conversation without my mind shifting it's focus on keeping a good posture or even keeping attention while talking to someone.

134,"I apologize in advance if my writing is confusing or unnecessarily detailed this is my first post.

Im gonna give a little backstory of our relationship/ the circumstances. My buddy is 2 years older than me, we met through work and starting hanging out and fucking around together on the job around a year and a half ago. Eventually it turned from a casual coworker friendship to actually talking and hanging out outside of work. Now it’s at a point where he’s the person I talk to the most besides my gf. We’ve gotten really close and started talking about our personal struggles and we’ve had some pretty deep heart to hearts about stuff that neither of us discuss with anyone other than our girlfriends.
I thought I knew him pretty well.
He’s always been the “popular” type with lots of friends always going out to parties. He seems relatively happy in life and confident.
While he has all these friends He’s said to me that I’m one of his only “real friends” and I’m the person he talks to the most besides his gf and he feels more comfortable with me than her. But last night he opened up in a whole new way that kind of shocked me.
He asked if I had tumblr and said he uses it quite a bit (had never mentioned tumblr at all in any previous conversation) and I didn’t so I said I’d download it and check out his page. He immidiately sent a long text along the lines of “don’t judge me please and don’t show anyone” apparently none of his other friends not even his girlfriend know about his tumblr. So he went to bed and I checked it out, his whole feed.
His entire page was extremely dark and concerning. A good 2 thirds of it was posts about wanting to kill him self and suicide  in general. The rest were other dark posts about being hurt by someone he loves “his gf” and other really sad troublesome ideas. It was sprinkled with pictures of people who were often blood-covered, crying or doing drugs. But all of them were sad looking. He talked about how nobody knows what he actually feels inside and nobody knows how unhappy he is. 

So what I’m left wondering is why did he choose to share this with me? And is he okay? Is it just an outlet for him to express these thoughts or did he show me this as a cry for help? Literally not a single thing on his feed was about anything but despair and pain. And he wanted me to see all of these thoughts. He has a dark personality and that’s a trait we share so we get along well. I have these thoughts too but I keep them inside and don’t share them with anyone but the fact that he wanted me to see this and see his pain makes me wonder if it’s a cry for help?

I woke up this morning to a text from him on an unrelated subject and so far we’ve been talking about other things today and pretending like it never happened basically.

But I don’t want to let him open up to me like that and make him feel like I was scared away or ignoring it. I have no clue how to address this to him and talk about it and ask him if he’s okay. Anybody been in a situation like this or have any advice?

136,"tldr at the end. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, theres just no one irl I feel comfortable asking.

This is something I've been wondering for a while. Years ago I had a breakdown in college, talked to my counselor, and they recommended I see a therapist. Talked to my general doctor a few months after, they also recommended I see a therapist.

Last year I went to see a therapist. They wrote a list of things I might have, but no diagnosis, and the experience was draining and expensive. Didn't go back.

Recently I tried out a free screening at a psychology practice, and now they're offering a mental health assessment...for $300. I don't know if this is typical, or if this is even where I go to get a diagnosis. They said they'll be able to pass on the information to a doctor as well...huh? Is that where I'm supposed to go for an official diagnosis?

The whole system is confusing to me. Who gives you the diagnosis if you have a mental disorder? Is it a doctor, a therapist, a psychologist, or someone else? 

My situation isn't critical (no thoughts of self-harm or suicide, thank god), but I have enough symptoms in common with adult ADD that I've always wondered. I've also taken online assessments for anxiety and depression and scored higher than I thought I would. 

I'm 25 and live in the US, if that's relevant. I just would really like to have something close to a definitive answer, so I'm not wondering about this for the rest of my life. It just feels like I'm spinning in circles.

tldr; Who gave you your diagnosis? Where did you have to go to get it, and how did they determine that you had it? ",06Mar2019,1

143,"So, let me take it back a little so you guys can see the whole picture. When I was in the 6:th grade (12-13 years old), I started to really dislike my classmates. I felt as if I was alone in my grade and I had no one to talk to. During this period I started learning everything I could about physics, astronomy and a lot of other things. This went on until the beginning of eighth grade. For some reason I became more social then. At this point I started socialising (at school) more and more to the point where I pretty much stopped learning more things in my free time. But it wasn't like I had less free time, at that time I just thought that I grew out of my old hobbies and learning in general. But recently, about two months ago (I'm 16) I started learning things again. At the same time I became less satisfied with my day to day life in school. Could there be a relation between my lack of socialisation and me becoming more interested in learning?

But they’re telling me terrible things, and to stay away from certain people. I’d tell my therapist, but I don’t want it to ruin my chances of getting a good job in the future. Is this normal for someone suffering from depression and anxiety?

I am 20 years old and live in Margate, Kent. I have to move back to the West Midlands tomorrow and will need to register as homeless.

149,"To elaborate I’m Female 30 in think UK, married with no kids. People on the outside think I have a nice life, nice home etc but recently I feel like everyone else’s problems are getting on top of me because I worry about them too much.

I’ve summarised below:
My Husband is in a high stress job and is currently being bullied by his boss. Has had a bad rash on his face for the last year (suspected rosacea). It’s really getting him down and I wish there was something I could do to make it go away. We’ve also had to deal with his father being treated for stomach cancer which was hard going for his side of the family.

My younger brother is (I suspect severely depressed) he is facing redundancy for a second time. The last time he was redundant he was unemployed for two years. He is also still living with my parents and is single. He admitted to me when drunk that his last relationship broke down because he admitted to his girlfriend that he had intrusive thoughts and she dumped him (she was a nurse). I lie awake at nights worrying that my bro is going to do something bad to himself.

My older sister has learning disabilities since childhood and sometimes struggles with everyday tasks. I worry about the future when my parents are no longer around how i am going to cope with looking after her in middle/old age. My parents are still in there 50s at the moment but I’m starting to realise that they won’t be around forever. My mum is suffering with arthritis and issues with her spine. She has also has depression in the past and can sometimes go through manic episodes.

I’m also dealing with some close friends who are suffering from mental health issues which I feel is starting to effect me.

Basically I’m worried about a lot of people I am close to and it’s starting to take its toll on me.

I know it sounds like first world problems but I just need someone to tell me it will all be okay even if it just from some internet strangers. I feel so selfish just worrying about how this all effects me when I need to be a good wife/daughter/sister and friend. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so what are your coping mechanisms?

156,"     So the other night I was at my roommates party with all of my sorority sisters and I accidentally drank too much and it brought on a panic attack. This has definitely happened before but it's the first time in a while, and I although I don't remember much, I was crying and saying I wanted to kill myself and breathing so fast that I couldn't catch my breath. Is this worth talking to a therapist about?
     My sister who has been diagnosed with anxiety had always told me I had symptoms of anxiety like her, but I never really gave it much thought- especially because I've been managing really well on my own until recently. Lately though my appetite has been weird, I've had a lot of trouble concentrating, and my suicidal thoughts (not crazy suicidal- just like 'oh it'd be easier to be dead. people will get over it. let me think of ways i could end it' kind of stuff"") that I don't think I'd actually ~act on~ are returning
     Nothing bad has ever really happened to me. I've just always weird mental health, but I just never really thought I had a reason to tell anyone about it and I could figure out how to manage it on my own, and when I competed myself to other people with mental health problems (this sounds ignorant now that I'm typing it out) I thought I couldn't possibly have anything wrong with me.

Point being- should I try and see a therapist? I know our campus counseling center doesn't get back for months and I don't really have the money, and I hate bothering people with my feelings.

159,"Hiiiii,

22f, broken up with my girlfriend of 3.5 years.

I’m diagnosed w depression and psychotic features or a schizoaffective disorder but only recently. 

I could go in depth about how this happened but 🤷‍♀️ I’m so sad and scared and overwhelmed. I tried to talk to her before the end of February but she refused to talk to me about our relationship. I explained that I understood it was hard but that there are problems with our relationship that we needed to talk about so we could be better. She didn’t want to. I feel like she just tells me what I’m doing wrong, and I just want to know what she needs. Well, told. I keep thinking in *we* and *us* and it’s breaking me. I don’t know how to stop thinking about it. She won’t talk to me anymore, and so her mom texts my mom. None of this feels real. 

Yesterday I had a terrible panic attack and she called my mom to deal with me, then left. She paid her half of the rent (!!!! Just now) and said I’m on my own. She took the car and the bed. She had been telling me over and over that I couldn’t take “our” cat that I paid for and take care of and feed, but I told her I’m keeping her. I know I’m struggling but I’m always a good cat mom. I’ll have to rehome my best bud Simba because he’s an old boy and I can’t afford his needs, but he was originally my brothers and he will be in good hands. He’s gotten me through the last several years especially and I owe him his best life.

I’m going to get some assistance and counselling tomorrow (as soon as my mom can drive me) and I’m being referred to a psychiatrist and psychologist by my new doctor. 

I’m using my savings to pay my rent and rent for next month so at least that’s something, but I’m hoping assistance comes through fast so I can get my new medication and everything else I need to do 😩

My mom has been a saint and is helping anywhere she can, but particularly with cleaning and hugs and essential oils.

164,"This is my first post here on Reddit. I made an account because due to my line of work, seeking mental help or comfort from a therapist can put my career in danger. I hope that you guys can understand and could help clear my mind and allow this torture to go away. 

For the longest time ive had issues with my masculinity. Ive always wanted to be this gruff, manly, badass figure. Due to complications, I did not join the military. I felt lost for a long time, believing I was living a life that I wasn’t meant to, but eventually found a semblance of peace in that I was mostly financially independent and living by myself in a major US city at only 22 years old. Also, I figured that if this is my life, it was meant to be this way. I wanted to be known as someone that fought in a war and was brave, went through some epic turmoil etc... I don’t know why I wanted that but my heart felt the need. Instead I became a ship captain. 

Recently in life, my confidence, appearance, and ability to speak to girls went from night to day. In high school, middle school, I couldn’t hold a conversation, never had a solid gf I could fuck. every day, never had a true first love. Due to the demands of my job I quickly changed, meeting a new girl every few months. My skin looked healthier, my sense of humor was much better, my social skills were great, I was a better me. I believed in myself, and felt I was living a badass life. I was young, had my own apartment, a cool job, motorcycle, height, looks, etc. I believed in what I was. 

Eventually I met a woman that used me. At that time I was at a low point. I hadn’t had sex in a very long time, 2 years. One girl I dated I couldn’t even get it up, and the next girl only gave me a hand job and then left me because I wanted to hang out with my friends instead one day. I was meeting girls, yes, but once the bedroom hit? nope. 

I had watched gay porn before and was turned on by it. I wasn’t against having gay sex as long as the guy I was with was androgynous, to the point once could say only the dick made it obvious that was a guy. Eventually I met a gay guy that was passible to me, looked hardly like a guy at all, and we fucked. Oral on both side, I briefly received anal, and it was awesome sex. At first I didn’t regret it. Its been about 8 months since then and I wake up in the morning hating myself. I don’t feel cool, I feel emasculated, I don’t feel like my childhood figure. No offense, I feel like a fag.

Ive been with my current gf for almost a year now. This is my first long term relationship where I have sex almost every day. Long story short I’m in love. When I had gay sex, maybe Ive been bi the whole time, just with guys that look effeminate. Ive always liked girls. My last ex hurt me so bad that I was so disenfranchised with women as a whole and said fuck it. Ive had gay thoughts before, had crushes on guys before in school, but never acted on it. Ive never been attracted to normal looking men. Convincing trannies yes. 

I’m sorry for the long story, but I walk around and my OCD keeps ruminating “You had gay sex, you had sex with a man” as I walk around. In the past month ive been depressed, my confidence is at an all time low, my self image is destroyed, I’m ashamed of myself, how could I do this? Every time I try to be dominant i just feel awful about myself and my ocd reminds me that I’m a “fag” and worthless. When I’m with my gf I’m my old self, but away from her I’m nothing.

174,"I’m realising that my reactions to things are intense at best, but mostly very true extreme and desperate.

The guy I was seeing stopped speaking to me, and when he did finally contact me, he drew my attention to the fact that it had been a mere four days and I’d managed to call him maybe more than twelve times, text him countless times and attempted to contact him through different social media platforms.

I have had a couple good days when I have been feeling sad but able to deal, I’ve been active, cheerful, interested, then something will set me off and I go OFF. 

I completely panic, I feel like I’m literally not going to survive what’s happening and the feelings, and I don’t want to survive it. I can’t stand the thought of having to go on this rollercoaster and it’s only been FOUR DAYS of non contact.

I had a lot of suicidal ideation last night. My thoughts totally spiralled. I went from feeling sad and crying to writing furiously in my diary, to then trying to call him, crying constantly feeling panicked and overwhelmed, to taking 2 Ambiens to calm down, then he blocked my number and I messaged him saying how can you do this to me, how can you turn your back, 
to walking to a tunnel near my house and knocking myself over the head with a rock, walking straight to the shop near my house and drink too much, to taking more ambien, calling Lifeline and thinking about suicide. 

I don’t understand why I cannot let this go. Every night I just have horrible nightmares about him sleeping with someone else or waiting for him and he never comes and it’s triggered such a desperate sense of loss, I feel like I want to die. I cannot go though this rollercoaster every single day. I feel I can’t trust my head. I have a good day and then I just lose it. 

I cannot cannot cannot stand the thought of feeling this way. I cannot go through life feeling like my heart is shattered in my chest, I would rather die than have to feel this all.

I was so angry at him for cutting me out and then when he explained his half of things I cried and wanted to die because my desperation and constant attempts to contact him created the situation I’m afraid of, and the last thing he said to me was ‘I read all the messages you sent me, and you can delete them, but not from my memory.’ I didn’t swear at him, but I was clearly upset and angry and told him I hope he has a nice life and that he doesn’t just go around hurting people and using the excuse of ‘hurt people hurt people’

Now I feel worse than I did before, because I feel terrible about myself, that I can’t seem to CONTROL any of this, that I can’t stop this desperation and even when I’m asleep I’m crying out in my sleep and yelling no no no no please 

Everyone keeps saying ‘you’ll get through this’ but I don’t want to get through this
I cannot take months of this, of this instability, of total clear thinking and then collapsing

does anyone have advice for me? if it helps i'll say i'm not serious, it's hypothetical, but i need to know. how do you kill yourself with dignity? with pride? because even if i see it as an action that takes control of my life others will see it differently. and i don't want to leave behind pain, if it was selfish and egotistical then i'd just do it without a thought, but it's not, it's a rational decision i'm arriving at after thinking long and hard about certain things. and I wish I could leave in a dignified manner that wouldn't have people being anguished and hurt because of me, angry, have to deal with my body and all the bullshit that comes with it, how it would hurt my family's reputation even though i never claim it's their fault. I wish I could leave without the community seeing me as a coward, a loser, selfish, self-centered, weak. I wish I could leave without people pitying me or seeing what happened to me as sad, a tragedy, pathetic, instead of a decision i arrive at as an autonomous individual who's given it a lot of thought and decided it was the best action to take. but no, the social stigma, everything about it, makes it so much harder to do. and the legacy i leave behind due to it is what i'll be defined as by people, what my identity will be. people can't understand and agree, wish me the best and respect my decision. i have to stay alive for other people even though i'm not happy (and won't ever be, and it's not just happiness, there's no meaning or goal anymore and won't ever be, this is my circumstance) i'm not doing anything useful and i'm worthless (really), it's still frowned upon for me to off myself. 

is this post going to get removed and i'll be judged for rule breaking or given some hotline number? or can people answer my question? how do i do it with dignity?",06Mar2019,1
