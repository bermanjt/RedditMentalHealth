&amp;#x200B;

I sat down with my good friend Colin (@colinmcindustries) for a conversation on Humor and the role it plays in supporting mental health.

1,"Hi all. Been a long time lurker of Reddit for some years now but recently felt the need to post. Not sure where to start...

I was fairly recently signed off from work after suffering stress, anxiety and depression some months ago. I confided in my boss about my extensive issues (including work) and they told me to take the week off, so I did. I went to the doctors and they signed me off for a further two weeks. Work had been very stressful at the time and had clearly impacted on me.

Upon returning to work, my boss did not conduct a ""return to work"" and I found myself within the exact same stressful position I was in before being signed off. Within two weeks I was called into my boss's office because I'd failed to set up a rather important meeting. This meeting was very difficult to set up because it was for many Directors or Chief Officers and they never had the same times available. I became overwhelmed and buried the situation, something I tend to do when I am struggling. Thinking I had a mutual trust with my boss after our initial conversation some weeks ago, I tried to explain to them that when I am struggling, I can let things get on top of me because I'm overwhelmed. This was then followed up with them saying that they felt it was nothing to do with my mental health but actually because I was incompetent. This threw me off because in previous, similar roles I had thrived and I was a pivotal member of the team. Far from incompetent. 

All I could do at this point was apologise to my boss. I apologised for letting them down and their reply was ""You haven't let me down, you have let yourself down.""

This conversation has stuck with me for months and caused me great distress and worsened my situation. Am I making a big deal out of nothing? I hope by posting this somebody can give their opinion.

Thanks",13May2019,1
2,"After nearly a year of depression, I have finally started to crawl out of it and feel like I might be getting a hold of my life. I can even feel a hint of ""happiness"" in the horizon at times. Traces of light you might call it.

It feels great.

I know I still have a long road ahead to catch-up to being ""normal"" but I know the worst is over. I hope. 

I dread I might relapse into it at some point, but at least now I know that I am capable of enduring.


So my point is, you can too. Don't give up. It's a tough battle, probably the toughest of them all, but you have to keep going.

You are worth it.

You are loved.

You are not alone.

Stay strong and safe, brothers and sisters.",13May2019,4
3,"This has been going on for about 3 years now since I went through a very traumatic experience in my life. 

I have had trouble feeling emotions and expressing them, if anything upsets me I’ll feel that emotion for half a second before it’s completely gone and then I’m back to a flat affect. I don’t understand why this is happening or what exactly it might be. 

I have been suicidal and severely depressed before and this doesn’t feel anything like depression. I’m not sad, I’m not numb, I just can’t feel or express emotion properly anymore. 

It’s starting to become a problem; someone will get upset with me or tell me something meaningful or emotional and I’ll have no emotion behind my responses. This is especially prevalent with my family, I can turn on my ability to be empathetic with friends but it’s not true empathy. 

Any help or advice to try to overcome this would be greatly appreciated",13May2019,1

7,"When I was pregnant, we had an argument about finances. My dad was stressed because she was taking out high interest loans without his permission. I was trying to help them through it. She got angrier and angrier and eventually exasperated shouted ""stay out of our business and I hope your baby dies"" (I was six months pregnant. I was stunned, lost for words, and never got involved in their finances after that.

She has never helped as a grandmother. My MIL has been 10 times more supportive than her.

She was verbally, emotionally and physically abusive towards me as a child. She would insult my appearance (nose, hair, weight) during arguments. She would curse at me with disgusting words including the c-word. I remember her kicking me in the stomach when I was seven years old. She said my dad had a heart arrack because of me, she said she miscarried because of me

She was never involved at school. She would spent $70 on a pair of heels but if I needed $70 for school camp fees, it was supposedly 'expensive' but she'd reluctantly agree to pay. She would never look at my school work, never read my school reports, never came to prizegiving

She would say the most irrational and insane things especially when angry. If my dad supported me she would say ""if you like her so much, why don't you just go fuck her then?""

She neglected my emotional and physical needs. She never did my hair (I have curly hair which requires proper management), she never made school lunch, she never talked to me or hugged me

When I was 9, I gave her $100 that I had saved up from gifts and pocket money because she needed money in an emergency (to pay test fees for an course she was taking). She didn't say thank you, she didn't repay it, and denies that I ever gave it to her on the first place

When I was young like 8-12 yrs old, She would call up my friends and tell teachers the ways I misbehaved or acted out at home. I would be so embarrassed, because during parent interviews it would just be her complaining about me. 'she doesnt clean her room', 'she yells at me and shouts at me' , 'she's having a tantrum' , 'she says curse words' (while never saying anything about the bad things she does)

Everytime I acted out at home, she would threaten to call my friends and embarrass me.i took a drug overdose at 14 and ended up in hospital getting my stomach pumped and she didn't visit me

She would say the weirdest things to me as a child. She worked in psychiatry so she would say things like 'stop acting like a schizophrenic' and 'they give shock treatments to kids who misbehave'

Many, many other things but I'm tired of typing.

I used to think she was a narcissist but I think it's worse. She's an actual psychopath Am I right to cut off my relationship with her? She won't change because she's a psychopath?

8,"I've experienced all the telltale signs and symptoms of depression for the majority of my life, and have been convinced I'm clinically depressed for quite a few years now. However, I have no way of confirming my hypothesis, seeing as I feel like I can't talk to my parents about it or seek help in any meaningful way. I've tried various manners of coping that don't involve seeking a professional (talking to friends, distracting myself, taking plenty of time to myself to rest and recharge, etc) but they all seem to only work for very short periods of time. I'm really beginning to think therapy or medication would be a very good option for me.

Don't get me wrong, my parents have always had my back and are some of the sweetest people in the world, but the first time I tried to tell them about my potential mental illness, my mom ended up immediately blaming herself for any and all of my suffering, which shattered my heart seeing as shes only ever done her best to love me and provide for me, something for which I'm eternally grateful. My dad reacted negatively as well, blaming my feelings entirely on me being a teenager, my hormones being out of whack, all that. I didn't have an opportunity to describe my situation/experiences/symptoms to them to potentially change their minds, as you can imagine. It's been about 4-5 years since, and ever since then I've been horribly afraid to ask for any sort of help, or letting them know how I feel at all. Now, I'm rapidly approaching college/university age, and with all the expenses coming with this time in my life I'd feel horrible asking my parents to spend even more money on therapy. I could go into more depth, but this post is already a major wall of text as is.

What are my options? I obviously have no experience seeking help so absolutely any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day.",13May2019,2

In any case, does anyone have any experiences, advice, opinions, about SSRI's for treating anxiety disorder and panic attacks? He also has depression as a result of his anxiety.

12,"I discovered this today and it explains better than what I can put into words.

http://flyingmonkeysdenied.com/2016/01/10/what-is-a-whistleblower/

I'm in crisis. There is NO free or sliding scale clinic that has been effective for me, for any counseling or therapeutic intervention.

If you resent the fact that I was raised as a young child in an Upper Middle Class background, this post isn't for you. Please understand and ignore it.

One back ground isnt better than another.

There are traits &amp; beliefs about my education, lifestyle, religion (I'm atheist), spending, saving, work skills, expenses, housing &amp; health care needs that will be different for everyone.

I do not have a mental illness.

No criminal and no addictions.

I've had private pay therapy in the past with PhD and M.D.'s in Ivy league institutions and private offices.

It was also to supplement some of my Masters Psychology studies that was blended with my other Masters degree.

I cant get work anywhere that pays a sustainable wage with FT daytime only hours in an office setting.

I was a Corporate WB

""Most are unjustly shunned and left socially isolated, victims of smear campaigns and targeted relentlessly for personal and professional blacklisting.""

(What I need &amp; can't get)

""A fortunate few are taken in by other humanitarians who are in positions of wealth, social status, or power.""

""Whistleblowers in corporate environments are often fired, blacklisted, and suffer serious financial and social harms.""

In career forums, I recd responses from much younger ppl to ""pack up a duffel bag, move across the country with no financial plans or job set up for me when I arrive.""

""Work at Home Depot,Walmart, Target"" as those employers have no right to choose a suitable candidate or as If I had not applied.

If you want to know more details about my work history or latest subsistence jobs since the Whistleblowing job feel free to PM or chat.

""Just wing it take anything"" yet no explanation why I have not been offered ""anything.""

I've worked in H.R. I'm not lacking that industry knowledge.

I'm a middle aged woman experiencing middle aged health issues that require 8 hrs of consistent sleep, housing and healthcare.

I lack all three.

Pls research on your own time about shelter living, affordable housing income limits, wait lists, qualification criteria, SSI/SSDI, Medicaid, Medicare, clinics, work force agencies bankruptcy laws and labor laws if you wish.

I dont qualify.

I need an income to cover my own housing, health care &amp; non dischargeable wage garmishment.

I'm in my early 50's, filed EEOC's for age discrimination and settled out of court.

That causes problems in terms of trying to get hired.

The lawyers had me sign non disclosure agreements and gave me a settlement that has dwindled down.

Employers have turned me down for low income jobs bc they know I'll need to keep looking. Its obvious if you meet and speak with me I'm not a fast food, retail or cashier. I dont live with parents, am not collecting SS and have no spouse.

Its an economic, financial and legal issue that isnt mental health (as its root cause) but because I've mentioned ""S"" the assumption is that it is mental health.

And in financial, career section, I get cussed out vehemently by Millennials who dont know how to engage with an older woman who has maybe 9 yrs left to work and has lost everything is in pre-menopause with active symptoms that require non PP specialty care.

The free, low cost therapists admitted that their clients are generally from poor to middle class backgrounds, less educated, lower work skills, needing the basic things I need, but cant help them get it either.

The goal at this level isnt self-actualization. I've had that. 

But no one can help with the shelter, income, garnishment, savings, healthcare needs. A sustainable job can address it, one that I cant get.

The MSW social workers who arent therapists said ""I dont know what to tell you."" ""I dont know about WB whistleblowers, non dischargeable garnishment, and how you can rebuild your life knowing you have appprx 9 yrs left to even possibly work in a prof job bc corporations push people out.""

* SS pays on avg $1200-$1400/month

* Minus medicare and Fed grad loan

There is nothing left to live on.

Many older ppl have spouses or live with adult children bc SS doesnt pay enough.

I've lived on my own for 30 yrs. Picking a random stranger from craigslist at my age is dangerous. There are plenty of stories in the (homeless) forum that describe the thefts, instability of roommates, overt addictions and mental health problems that were not disclosed until after move ins.

People having partners move in and then throwing the new person out.

I need my own space for my own peace.

But I cant live on NO income or LOW income that will keep me living in my car.

If you want to PM or chat, I'd be grateful. I've tried with one other kind person who was close in age to me, and he was attentive and empathetic, but didnt know what else to suggest.

There are NO FREE Govt handouts, no free tax payer housing.

Govt welfare programs keep people in lower class, one step above a heat hole unless they have a spouse or relative to take them in. 

I will die if i cant work in a sustainable job that allows me housing, wage garnishment payback and healthcare.

I dont need financial help on reading insurance and loan documents or understanding my obligations and terms.",13May2019,0
13,"I don't know how I'll put this in the best understandable way, but here I go.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reccently noticed how odd I am when it comes about emotions, some events reassured me that. Reccently, in the middle of the class I had a smile on my face, and I was laughing silently and hysterically, and just couldn't stop and there was absolutely no reason for that to happen, it got to a point that the teacher joked about how I was smilling abnormally, 10 minutes later, it was as if nothing had happened, I got back to normal, but I had a ""blue"" atmosphere in my feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get to a high level of anger in a very easy way, to a point I even imagine and wish for bad things to happen to members of my family and my friends when I'm in a mood, but a few minutes of nothing happening, it is like I didn't had any negative thoughts, and a lot of times I question myself why I ever felt that way and imagined such horrible things I get even sick to imagine right now, that always, fades away in a matter of minutes, and sometimes comes back.

&amp;#x200B;

I get pessimistic, optimistic and neutral in every day, right now I'm neutral, but I can tell the exact hours of today when I felt the other two. the most extreme case was in my birthday, when thinking about the date, I suddenly went incognito and googled methods of suicide, only to a few minutes later I simply feel a genuine happiness about the day, but this time it had no histerical laughs or weird emotions in between, just a normal happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I alternate between shy and to have a urge to socialize, I wish the absence and the presence of people, in rare cases, in a confuse way, I wish both. Even in my ""Social mode"", I can't stand to stare into people's eyes for too long, in an ocassion when there are many people in the same room as I, I just can't do something besides staring to nothingness, and when someone talks to me, the visual contact has to be broken, as if my eyes wants to scape in a pavlovian way from the other person's look.

I'm not put off or scared by it or anything, I just want to make sure he feels heard and supported.

24,"Since my teenage years (I'm 23) I've suffered from anxiety disorder and depression. In my 20's it has only worsened and developed into what I believe has become a disability, since it has significantly impacted my ability to hold a job, and interact with others. 

It has gotten to the point where it has developed physical symptoms: chronic backaches, headaches, nausea, shakes, and nerve pain. I have to separate myself from stressful situations or vomit when I get too stressed out. I have PNES, which is basically seizures brought on from psychological trauma. 

My chronic pains make it exhausting to do things like take a shower or even do my hair. 
My anxiety has gotten so bad that I don't even want to wake up in the morning and loud sounds and bright lights trigger my nerves. I recently broke down crying because I've tried everything to make the sound of construction and traffic through my window and nothing works, and it goes on ALL DAY! Because of this my my nerves on edge all day and night making it almost impossible to function normally. 

Sometimes I can't look people in the eye, or conduct a normal conversation without getting angry or irritatied and having to stop and breathe until I feel calm again.

26,"I know that there's a lot that's wrong with me but there's something specific that I'd like the community's help with today.  That something specific involves my emotions.  I'll explain as best as I possibly can exactly what is bothering me but I'd first like to start at the beginning.  This is going to be a long post and I'm really genuinely sorry if it takes forever to read.  I hate to cramp all of this together but I don't know what else I should do. 

I've been depressed for quite some time.  I honestly can't remember when it started.  I was a happy kid once upon a time but now I'm just a fucked up teenager who doesn't know what the hell is wrong with them and truly doesn't understand her own mind.

When the depression began, I knew something was wrong but I really didn't care.  It's just another thing that's wrong with me.  At first, it was slow.  I began to feel more and more sad about everything.  I cried all the time when people said terrible things about me to my face.  I discovered self-harm and then everything changed.  Sure, I was depressed, but now I could fix some of those feelings.  I could get rid of them until they were rapidly and inevitably replaced.  That worked for a while and that's how it's been for a while.  I'm depressed and I cut and cry and quite literally smile when I see the million different ways I can hurt myself and act upon those ideas and ways.  

For the past few months, about since the beginning of 2019, I've been very suicidal.  I want to die so much.  I hate myself and how insecure I am.  I don't have a reason to live.  I research the countless ways to kill myself and then look up from my phone at my mother and send her a fake smile when she looks up at me to see what's wrong.  

She (my mom) actually knows about the cutting.  She doesn't know that I'm terribly depressed and very suicidal.  She just thinks that I'm sad sometimes and that my abusive father is the sole reason for it all.  She's not arrogant or a narcissist for thinking that it's just my father.  That's what I told her and it's not entirely a lie.  

I was wearing a flannel shirt about month ago and I had the cuffs unbuttoned because they were a little too tight.  I had my arm propped up on the edge of the sofa and she saw the new cuts and the scars from the old cuts.  She very seriously told me that we needed talk upstairs and so we did.  (I appreciate the fact that she didn't make me talk about it in front of my siblings.)  I told her the truth.   I told her that it was a particularly traumatic experience with my father one day that triggered it.  (I really don't want to talk about it.  I physically flinch when I think about it even though he didn't hit me.)

Truth be told, it wasn't just my father that caused all of this.  My mother too sometimes says horrible things to me about me but she never means it like my father does.  I've never been her favorite and she's always favored both my older and younger brother over me.  (The older brother that I'm talking about isn't my oldest brother.  My oldest brother is in college rn but he lives at home.) 

On top of it all, I'm a closeted pansexual who lives with a hardcore Catholic family.  I like the concept of God but I don't want to believe or support God when he's practically the face of the Anti-LGBTQ+ movement.  I don't believe what they believe.  I don't want to either.  I have no problem accepting myself or my sexuality.  I am who I am and I'll love who I want to love.  

Despite the fact that my family is religious, my father is still abusive, controlling, manipulative, and a lot more.  Yeah.  Life really honestly sucks.

So this is basically my life story.   Congrats.  You've made it this far.  Now, moving onto what I really want to talk about. 

I feel like my mind is dying.  The only memories I have of my fourteen-year-long life so far are fading.  I can barely remember anything anymore.  I find it difficult to read books because my imagination is so dead.  It's just not enjoyable anymore.  

I find it hard to clean my room or do anything.  I spend too long in the shower because it's the only quiet place in the house. 

I feel so numb all the time.  I can't feel happiness anymore.  I actually can't feel it.  It's like I'm standing outside and the sun is shining on my face, except the sun's rays feel heatless even though I can physically feel them.  I've been a very emotional person since I was a child but now all of that is fading.  Even the horrible things people say to me don't hurt like they would two or three months ago.  I guess it's for the best because my mother has been checking up on my wrists and is making sure that I'm not cutting anymore.  I can't cut but at least I've lost my reasons to cut, and I haven't lost those reasons in a good way. 

It's frightening.  I can't feel anything anymore.  I'm scared that I'll never get my emotions back.  I've even lost my capability for deeper thinking.  Now my mind feels so shallow. 

I've lost any emotional connection I've ever had to any members of my family.  I know I care about all of them but I literally can't feel that I care about them.  It's like my sunshine metaphor.  The fact that I can't feel my connections to them scares me so much.  I'm terrified all the time. 

I know that this post is getting to be stupidly long.  I'm sorry.  I really am.

My family doesn't let me go anywhere and my only friends are online.  We all have a discord server where we talk about everything we all love and originally bonded over.  Even they don't know the real me.  They're all so important to me and I truly know that they are but I can't feel it. 

This is really honestly a stupidly long post.  I feel pathetic.  I hate to rant about this is much but it feels incredible to get to actually tell someone about it. 

Thank you for listening.  I really do appreciate it.  I'm going to go to bed now and I'll respond to any responses in the morning.  It's currently 10:14pm.  I'm going to try to get some sleep.  

Thank you again.  — Parker.",13May2019,1
27,"I’m basically like every other teenager who is angsty and hates life most of the time but I find I can’t cope like other people can. I’m in the IB program (junior) and I feel that I’m not cut out for it but dropping out now would disrupt everything in my life. I get so stressed that I lose my appetite and will often go without eating until I nearly feel like passing out even though I want to gain weight not lose any. I feel so overwhelmed to the point where I’m just numb to my bad grades and almost feel like I want to fail because it feels inevitable. More often I stay home just to feel a sense of protection from laying in bed. I still attend school where I’m not noticeably missing a lot of it, but my dad yells at me for not trying and missing school. I don’t work as hard as I could but I don’t know how to anymore. I feel like I am doing my best to do my best but inevitably become a lazy piece of shit like always. I feel frustrated about my own personality and abilities in school (I’m pretty convinced I have some degree of ADHD) that I accidentally starve myself (not for body image issues, I already feel too thin) and when I get upset I hit myself repeatedly on the head hard enough to leave a lasting headache because no one can see this form of self harm. As much as other teenagers I talk to mention that they have mental health issues, I don’t know of feeling this bad is just apart of being a teenager.",13May2019,4
28,"Hi guys. So as the title says I have that weird issue where I hate being around people like I'd rather stay home playing videogames than hang out with my friends or go to a family gathering. But at the same time I hate being alone. I always get that feeling that no one cares about me or loves me. I always feel like I will die alone and no body would even attend my funeral. I have no idea what to do. Have any of you guys been in a situation similar to me? Or does somebody have any idea of what should I do?

Btw going to a therapist isn't an option in my country. I'll get called names and people would treat me as if I am insane or retarded and I don't want to deal with that

29,"I discovered an article on whistleblowing today.

I'm in crisis. There is NO free or sliding scale clinic that has been effective for me, for any counseling or therapeutic intervention.

If you resent the fact that I was raised as a young child in an Upper Middle Class background, this post isn't for you. Please understand and ignore it.

One background isnt better than another.

There are traits &amp; beliefs about my education, lifestyle, religion (I'm atheist), spending, saving, work skills, expenses, housing &amp; health care needs that will be different for everyone.

I do not have a mental illness.

No criminal and no addictions.

I've had private pay therapy in the past with PhD and M.D.'s in Ivy league institutions and private offices.

It was also to supplement some of my Masters Psychology studies that was blended with my other Masters degree.

I cant get work anywhere that pays a sustainable wage with FT daytime only hours in an office setting.

I was a Corporate WB

""Most are unjustly shunned and left socially isolated, victims of smear campaigns and targeted relentlessly for personal and professional blacklisting.""

(What I need &amp; can't get)

""A fortunate few are taken in by other humanitarians who are in positions of wealth, social status, or power.""

""Whistleblowers in corporate environments are often fired, blacklisted, and suffer serious financial and social harms.""

In career forums, I recd responses from much younger ppl to ""pack up a duffel bag, move across the country with no financial plans or job set up for me when I arrive.""

""Work at Home Depot,Walmart, Target"" as though the employers have no right to choose a suitable candidate or as If I had not applied.

If you want to know more details about my work history or latest subsistence jobs since the Whistleblowing job feel free to PM or chat.

I've worked in H.R. I'm not lacking technology, or job search skills.

I'm a middle aged woman experiencing middle aged health issues that require 8 hrs of consistent sleep, housing, exercise, proper nutrition &amp; healthcare.

I lack all of the above.

Pls research on your own about shelter living, affordable housing income limits, wait lists, qualification criteria, SSI/SSDI, Medicaid, Medicare, clinics, work force agencies bankruptcy laws and labor laws if you wish.

I dont qualify.

I need an income to cover my own housing, health care &amp; non dischargeable wage garmishment.

I'm in my early 50's, filed EEOC's for age discrimination and settled out of court.

That causes problems in terms of trying to get hired.

The lawyers had me sign non disclosure agreements and gave me a settlement that has dwindled down.

Employers have turned me down for low income jobs bc they know I'll need to keep looking. Its obvious if you meet and speak with me I'm not a fast food, retail or cashier worker. I dont live with parents, am not collecting SS and have no spouse.

Its an economic, financial and legal issue that isnt mental health (as its root cause), but because I've mentioned ""S"" the assumption is that it is mental health.

In the poverty/finance &amp; career sections, I get cussed out vehemently by Millennials who dont know how to engage with an older woman who has maybe 9 yrs left to work, has lost everything, is in pre-menopause with active symptoms that require non PP specialty care.

The free, low cost therapists admitted that their clients are generally from poor to middle class backgrounds, less educated, lower work skills, needing the basic things I need, but cant help them get it either.

The goal at this level isnt self-actualization. I've had that. 

But no one can help with the self earned housing, income needs, garnishment, savings, and healthcare needs. A sustainable job can address it, and is one I can not get.

I ask myself, ""Why stay alive?"" There are no loved ones who would be left behind. It's just me and no one else.

The MSW social workers who arent therapists said ""I dont know what to tell you."" ""I dont know about WB whistleblowers, non dischargeable garnishment, and how you can rebuild your life knowing you have appprx 9 yrs left to even possibly work in a prof job bc corporations push people out.""

* SS pays on avg $1200-$1400/month

* Minus Medicare and Fed grad loan

There is nothing left to live on.

Many older ppl have spouses or live with adult children bc SS doesnt pay enough.

I've lived on my own for 30 yrs. Picking a random stranger from craigslist at my age is dangerous. There are plenty of stories in the (homeless) forum that describe the thefts, instability of roommates, overt addictions and mental health problems that were not disclosed until after move ins.

People had partners move in and then throwing the new person out.

I need my own space for my own peace.

But I cant live on NO income or LOW income that will keep me living in my car.

If you want to PM or chat, I'd be grateful. I've tried with one other kind person who was close in age to me, and he was attentive and empathetic, but didnt know what else to suggest.

There are NO FREE Govt handouts, no free tax payer housing.

Govt welfare programs keep people, one step above a heat hole unless they have a spouse or relative to take them in. 

I will die if i cant work in a sustainable job that allows me housing, wage garnishment payback and healthcare.

I dont need financial help on reading insurance and loan documents or understanding my obligations and terms.",13May2019,0
30,"I’m tired of feeling this way. I’ve always been a somewhat depressed person with anxiety since I was younger but stupid shit happened in my teens and early 20s to make crap worse. 

Up until last year I was fine and pushing down all the bad shit. One day I was extra stressed and smoked weed...just scraped my bowl. 

Boom....major case of depersonalization/de realization. I thought I was dying. For the next few months it was on and off until I got medicine. Was doing okay about 90% better. 

Now I’m up and down. I was so so good for awhile and now a few days ago back at it again with the in a daze feeling. 

I’m sick of this shit. I want to feel normal. I want to FEEL. I want to be a real person again. I want to be happy. I want to cook. I want to clean. I want to go on adventures. I used to be that kind of person, now I’m only that person like half the time if that. I’m scared of going back into the black hole that is depersonalization and depression.

31,"So, I keep running into issues where I tell my boyfriend I really need to talk, but he'd rather play video games than listen. He runs to other peoples sides, though, when they are going through a rough spot, I finally asked him why he'll drop everything to talk to his depressed friends but won't for me. He simply said, ""Well, they are depressed, and you're not."" First, observation is how the hell do you conclude that not having depression means I don't need someone to be there anyway. But secondly, I realized he really doesn't know... I didn't think I was hiding it so well... We've been together for about 1.5 years, and I'm a cutter only 7 months clean, which means he's been around them and he's seen them.  But he really doesn't know that just 6 months ago I attempted to kill myself, it was a first for me, the lowest I've been in my life. I was so alone then, no one to confide in, so worthless, so hopeless, so strongly believing it can't get better, and might as well end it now.  I have so many days where I have to fight with myself not to cut, try to convince myself it's not worth it.  Tonight it's so low again, and I want to cut to die... but he still tells me I'm not depressive... How do I tell him?.. How do I tell him without him not believing me bcuz I hid it so well?... How do I sit alone tonight with no one to talk to and not decide to die?...",13May2019,1
32,"I am a young dude (15) and I think that there is something wrong in my head.A lot of the times I end up thinking about self harm or suicide. I don't know if it's real or not and that I think these things truly.
A lot of the time when I think about doing these things, after I shut myself down, telling myself that I don't think these things, that I do it for attention and that I'm lying to myself? That I'm just a young dude and it's probably just hormones or something I guess. I end up blaming myself for my thoughts of self harm or suicide. I've thought about stuff like this for a good amount of time (maybe a year or so? Longer idk). I tell myself that I am wrong for thinking of this because there are actual people who have these problems, and I'm not one of them.
I mean how could I? I'm not upset all day or am antisocial. I have friends that I talk to in school and have relationships with people, but I still end up thinking about it. I think about harming myself. I know I won't act on these things. I don't think I will. I have self harmed in the past and I think I have tried to kill myself when I was younger, but when I think about that I still shut myself down, telling myself that it wasn't real feelings and that I was a kid and those are just things you feel as a kid in life. You get upset and you do dumb shit I guess.
The question I'm asking is, is it normal to think of these things? Am I just an emotional teenager? Do I really feel these things or is it just hormones

34,So randomly through out the day I get these feelings like I'm cut or hurt. I'll use my last experience as an example. Earlier I was sitting around using my phone doing normal stuff and i got this feeling in the back of my leg behind my knee and I was imagining this cut about a quarter to a half inch deep going all the across the back of my knee. I try to just not think about this when it happens but it absolutely won't leave my mind and I can almost physically feel it. It really messes with my head and the only way to feel better is imagine it getting stitched up and healing into a scar but I have to focus on keeping it as a scar or it turns into a cut again.

I want to know what I can do to get through the challenging times? The times where I feel like death is more appealing than life, not because there aren't reasons that I want to live, but because it feels like dying would better than dealing with life as it currently is. In terms of severity, my most immediate problem that I've resorted to is alcoholism to cope with my issues. So much so that it's impacting my physical health, but I continue to drink a 5th at a time. No matter how much I convince myself that ""I won't drink today"", I haven't managed to make that true. I feel that's because it distracts me from my immediate ""personal hell"".

I'm 21. One of my goals at the moment is to graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I previously attended college immediately out of high school for a degree in business, but only completed 6 out of 21 attempted hours due to not taking any responsibility and making no effort to succeed, which resulted in loss of financial aid. I wasn't interested in education at the time and especially not an education in business.  CS is one of the few things I've found that I feel passionate about (things like AI and machine learning are very interesting!), but going through the process of getting enrolled in college again seems like the world is on my shoulders. The problem here? Anxiety.  I've managed to struggle through making phone calls to admissions and submitting most of my required documents, something seemingly benign but apparently quite difficult for me. Yet over the past 2 weeks I've avoided making the calls that I need to finishing enrolling for the summer term; which is only two weeks away.

I won't delve into my current living situation too much, but I've been given until the end of July to get my own place. I have no complaints about that, as the people requesting this have been more than gracious to me over the past couple of years, but I'm broke. Literally 0 dollars to my name and in minor debt (though increasing by the day thanks to interest, go figure.) I can't even imagine how I convince a prospective employer to hire me when I haven't worked in over 2 years, and I've been a bum doing nothing meaningful in that time, along with having little prior work experience. I have a car and can reliably get to work, but how can I prove my value as an employee when I have no background credentials?

36,"hey all, first time poster here. today has been a horrendous mental health day. actually, the past 6 months have been. 

without making it super long, I've suffered from depression/suicidal ideation and anxiety for 10+ years now. in the past year I've moved 3 times, had 5 people i know die, escaped an abusive ex, became homeless for a short period of time, lost my job, became the black sheep of my family, and lost my 2 best friends of 7 and 13 years. 

needless to say, it's been a shitty time. 

each day I wake up expecting a soap opera to happen and it usually does. living like this for the past 10 years has been rough on my mental health, but the past year has worn me down the most. the time between bad things has become shorter and shorter. 

lately I've been having a lot of thoughts about suicide. my personal thoughts are complicated, but short hand is I don't WANT to kill myself, but I feel it's quickly getting out of my control. I have been thinking seriously lately about starting an anti depressant. 

my worry is that if I start an anti depressant, I will follow through with killing myself. i know that can happen sometimes with folks since they'll have the motivation to. I do see a therapist who primarily does cognitive behavioural therapy and has done wonders for me the past 4 years I've seen them, how ever my mental health has just become too much.

I guess I'm just curious to folks: is the risk worth it?? I want to work more towards bettering myself and growing, but I fear no matter my next step it'll result in suicide.",13May2019,1

tl;dr at the bottom

December 7th, 2017 was the day after my 18th birthday. after a long night of partying, i had accumulated around 8 grams of marijuana and single beer for another round of partying the next night. (this was a crazy time of my life, actually this day was the end of that time) running late to school that morning, i decide to roll a joint for the drive. i smoked it, pulled over at a park, put it out to smoke the rest after school, and left. as i was pulling out, i see a cop pulling into the other entrance. now, around two weeks prior, me and a couple of friends were skipping school and smoking at this park and one of them decides to do a burnout in the parking lot. the cops were called and we “successfully” ran. (remember, a crazy time in my life but back to the story) i, being high and dumb, assume this time it was the school cop checking to see if kids were skipping at the park since it was near the school.  i never assumed the cops would still be searching for me. i pull out not thinking much of it and drive to the school. about halfway there, the cop gets behind me. i was still thinking it was the school cop. i go the speed limit, following all the road laws, and am preparing to talk to the cop when i get to the school. (me and him were kinda cool, so i was just gonna tell him i just woke up and pulled over at the park to put some stuff up) as i pull in to the school, though, he turns on his blue lights. i pull over into the small parking lot right past the front gate of the school and open my door slightly because my window didn’t roll down. i look back and see two cops, tasers drawn, as well as a police dog all looking in my direction. i follow orders and end up being thrown against the hood of the police car, threatened with felony charges because it happened in a school zone if i didn’t give up names of dealers, and sat me in the back of his car for hours. everyone in the school knew instantly and, according to friends, that’s all anyone was talking about in the hallways. finally, through some miracle, they dropped both charges (evading and possession) and i was sent home. 

ever since that day, the sight of blue lights or even having a normal conversation with a police officer leaves me shaking. sober or not. since then, i’ve been pulled over twice, and both times i’ve had a panic attack from hell. i’m talking shaking for hours, not thinking clearly for hours, being dizzy, having a hard time breathing, heart beating at the speed of light, etc. 

only about an hour before posting this, while driving home, i pulled out in front of a police officer. didn’t even see him or mean to at all. as soon as i realized what i had done, i stopped breathing. i completely zoned out and went the exact speed limit for the entire next road. i was completely dizzy and my heart actually slowed down an insane amount, but i could feel it through my entire body. when i got to the end of the road, cop still inches from my back bumper, but no blue lights, i go straight. for the entire half a mile road, he rode that close and i did not breathe at all. i look behind me, see him flash his headlights, and turn left. the entire ride home i spent freaking out. shaking, trying desperately to catch my breath, my entire body went numb, and my heart felt like it was slowly falling out of my chest. (i actually had to come home and smoke some weed so i could calm down enough to even type this) 

i’ve never experienced anything like this before, and it was so incredibly scary. if anyone could give me some insight into what happened during that little episode earlier and why the panic attacks are happening anytime i get pulled over it would be greatly appreciated. 

tl;dr: got pulled over and had a very scary interaction with the cops the day after my 18th birthday (facing felony charges with prison time) and since then nearly any negative interaction i have with the police give me an insane panic attack, the most recent one being unlike anything i’ve ever experienced before.",13May2019,2

39,"I'm a 39 y/o male, that will be 40 in July. I can't remember a time when I haven't dealt with mental health issues. The last 18 years have been the worse.  The first 7 of those years I spent in terrified agony in a room in my parents basement.  I was unable to do anything. I had severe panic attacks and was agoraphobic with a healthy dose of depression sprinkled on top. I lost all contact with friends and most of my family. Everyday was a waking nightmare and I just wanted to die so that it would end. After multiple times of puking and pissing myself I was finally able to stay in a car long enough to make it to a Dr. (it was seriously a 3 minute card ride) but took me a year of failed car rides to get there. With the help of medication I was able to get a job right next to the Dr. office, and was really only able to work there because I had a vehicle and told myself that if I freaked I would just go home. Didnt care if I got fired or not. I met a girl who was working in the next shop over from us. We hung out a few times at my parents house. I didn't tell her at first about the issues. After about 2 weeks I told her and she didn't seem to mind. 

Fast forward a couple months and I had become dependant on her, she was my ""safe person"". She became pregnant and we moved into an apartment 5 minutes from my parents. Every Dr. appointment, or anything that was not with in a 5 minute car ride from the house she had to do alone. She would drop me off at my parents house and i would sit there in panic until she returned. It was rough but I made it to the birth of my son. 

Fast forward 11 years and as i sit here writing this, I'm still basically in the same boat. Sure I can go a little further from home as long as I'm with her, but I can't be alone longer than an hour and a half without breaking down. I can't work and when she has to go to work she drops me off at my mothers work and I sit in the car until either she picks me up or my mother can drop me off. My son is 11 and her daughter from a previous is 14, I can't take them anywhere to do normal dad &amp; kid things..actually other than going to the store 2 minutes from out house I can't do anything with them. To be honest I have them ride there with me because I can't go by myself. I'm an emotional wreck always on edge, every night I pray to die in my sleep. I just can't take having to live like this anymore.  I feel like a giant burden. I mean can you imagine  being in your 30's and your gf has to pull your 7 y/o out of class to sit with you at home because she has to go to work...This life has been totally wasted on me..well thats the short of it. There are obviously way more details and BS I have put my family through.

 So long story short I think it might be in the best interest of my kids and gf if I just admit myself to some assisted living place. So that she can move on and my kids might have a chance at a normal life. After 18 years of this I don't see any other logical way. I can't seem to beat this, and don't feel like a man or a father at all. It's just gone on to long and even though i pray to die in my sleep, I would never kill myself.

40,"     Idk if this is even in the right subreddit but I needed to post it somewhere. I don't love anyone. Not just in a romantic sense. Like...at all. I have friends, I guess, but I don't have any affection towards them. I value them for the entertainment value. Like you would a good television show. Obviously you don't have any real emotional connection with television characters, they're just good for a moment of entertainment. I mean..I like to think I love my mom..she's the one person I think I might..but part of me isn't sure. If she died, part of me thinks I wouldn't grieve for her so much as for the fact that being around her is less hellish than around my dad. I feel like even with her I more value the enjoyment she gives me than I so her. Everyone just feels..expendable. Like if I lose them and find someone else to replace them quick enough it doesn't matter. I mean, that isn't a normal thing to think, right? And I don't know if I've always felt this way or if it's new. I mean, I think I used to care about individual people, but I don't know for sure. It's funny, the thing that made me notice this was watching television. I saw how much the characters really cared about each other. Needed each other. How there were people each of them really couldn't live without. And I realized I didn't feel that way. I realized other people did. It's not that I'm some psycho who wants to hurt people. I have no need to see anyone hurt. In fact, I think my sense of empathy is rather strong. But there's no one really special to me.

41,"Hi all,

I’m just looking for some help. My brothers wife has recently been put in a psych ward after posting a disturbing video online involving her children. They had been separated for some time. She has a history of mental health issues including very serious forms of physical abuse to her husband and mental abuse to her children. She has been put away and cannot see her children for 30 days. She won’t be able to be alone with them for a very long time. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice. Personally I would prefer if she doesn’t have much contact with the children for most of their lives. However, I want to be compassionate, regardless of what she’s done or would’ve done if things haven’t been noticed. I understand that mental health can be tricky. I don’t want to blame someone who might be incapable of understanding, in a given moment, what she might be doing. But I’m honestly wondering how to proceed with life. I know I’ll be needed more in my brothers life for support to him and his children. But I know she IS going to see them again. I know she’s not gone from my life like a bad ex. She has blood in this family. So how do I treat her? How do I show her compassion without losing a sense of what she’s done not only to her own family but to my family. How do I act the next time I’ve seen her. It’s not like anyone can act like there isn’t a fucking ginormous pink elephant in the room. How do I act around her parents? How do I show them understanding and compassion? It’s all lost on me.",13May2019,1

I’ve tried reading reviews online, but don’t know how much weight to put into them because it’s really personal and subjective.

47,"I was feeling miserable today so I tried to journal and let it out. My brain felt foggy, I couldn’t concentrate on anything, my whole body was tense and I felt overstimulated by everything. I kept starting to cry at random and was full of rage, and then I’d feel numb. Rinse and repeat for the whole day.

I’ve been feeling like this a lot lately. I’ve been desperate for someone close to me to help me but I can’t bring myself to trust anyone enough to ask. I shut down and change the subject, and try to hide that I’m shaking and my mind is in complete chaos because I don’t want them to know.

I’ve been having breakdowns that escalate to self harming and considering suicide. This has happened while I’m doing something important too, and I have to stop what I’m doing. A few weeks ago I was driving, and out of nowhere I just needed to pull over. I had an intense breakdown and only hurting myself would calm me down. Then I was numbed out, and went on with my day the best I could.

Writing this out in my journal and rereading it made a lightbulb turn on in my head. I looked up articles about ptsd symptoms and it was as if my journal entry was the entire article.  ave been avoiding talking about these things.

52,"I don’t know what I have but I know something isn’t right. In my life I have had a lot of delusions that have effected my life due to how strongly I believed in them. I didn’t realize I have been having delusions until a few months ago, ending a year-long delusion. First, it started when I saw an mk-ultra video in my recommended (probably because I enjoy Shane Dawson and criminal investigation). I clicked on the video and watched it. The channel was all about mk-ultra and I binged it. I felt my experience being in an abusive household connected on this person’s claim about being in a “mk-ultra satanic cult”. I didn’t see the flaws in the story at the time. This person claimed to have dissociative identity disorder (DID) because of the trauma. I’m not sure how my brain connected a to b but eventually I came to the conclusion I was inside an mk-ultra cult. I googled mk-ultra and my city and one article saying there was an mk-ultra base in my city was enough evidence for me (despite me usually skeptical, I’m not sure why my brain didn’t work on this). It slowly developed into an obsession. I began telling everyone online (who wasn’t my family) how I’m in mk-ultra and that my parents are under mind control. I didn’t tell anyone in real life because I was super paranoid that they were part of the cult too. I would watch mk-ultra videos every day, and I don’t even think I watched anything else. I then began to believe I had DID. It started with harmless “alters”, to an obsession. I learned about DID so much. This became the new thing I’d watch. It was super believable not only to me, but to the people who actually have DID who I talked to about my “experiences”. My list of alters kept growing and growing to no end. I even spent my own money on a book about DID. I didn’t feel like myself and my friends saw it too and confronted me. I began to believe more outrageous stuff as time went on like instead of my mom just having an abortion, my mind twisted the memories and I thought I killed my baby sister by throwing her in a wood stove. The delusions just kept getting weirder and weirder. Finally a year later I had a breaking point where I relapsed with drugs and watched a horror movie because I thought it was the only way to “see the truth”. After that horrible trip (and breaking being two years clean) I was finally able to be my skeptical self again. After seeing how bad it got, I looked into schizophrenia. Despite not having symptoms I ironically started to have catatonic episodes after I learned about that symptom. So I had to stop because I recognized I was falling into a delusion again. I asked my mom if she thought I was schizophrenic and she said no. I looked back at my life to see if there were any signs and I realized I’ve been this way for a while. Once, I thought I had 8 ball fractures in my eyes and cried to my mom about it and she said I didn’t have them. Another time I believed in the “subliminal binaural beats music” thing and would listen to it religiously (even when I sleep).

Things that might be related but I’m not sure: 1. I suffered great trauma as a very young child. 2. I think I may have a dissociative, depersonalization, or maladaptive daydreaming disorder. I’ve actually been on and off if I actually have it for years because I’ve always lived in a “fantasy” world in my head. I often feel like I’m constantly daydreaming, and even in stores and shit I’ll be in a daydream about some fantasy world and it really effects my ability to get shit done. I’m not sure if it’s a disorder or I’m just childish. 3. Things, especially dark objects, will look like they are growing in size if I look at them. I know they aren’t real. Sometimes if I stare at where the wall meets the ceiling it will start to jiggle. My first memory of this happening was when I first took drugs, and it usually went away but due to prolonged drug use and then my suicide attempt with overdosing on the drug it hasn’t gone away so it’s probably brain damage.

I cannot get a professional diagnosis btw I’m in a bad situation. If you have any idea how to help me please tell me, I really need help.",13May2019,1

55,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but maybe more people will see it and I'll get some answers. Tl;Dr at the bottom.

Years ago, maybe 15 now, my mother was on some pretty heavy medicine for bipolar, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Her boyfriend at the time is was pretty abusive and he kept her drugged up and she was in and out of mental hospitals. My sister and I missed a lot of school because we would have to go stay with our dad for weeks at a time so he could ""deal with her"" while she was away. We were old enough (high school and jr high) to stay by ourselves, but we weren't given the chance. He would ship us off whenever he could.

From what I remember, she got injured in a softball game and had shoulder surgery. Shortly after that, she apparently had a bad reaction to the surgery or the medicine because she had seizures a lot. They were very bad and I had to call 911 several times as a 10 year old. I really don't remember much from this time except it was around the time my parents divorced, my grandmother died, and I wasn't old enough to really know what was going on. I wish I did now.

Back to her boyfriend. He didn't like me at all. He knew I was too smart for him so he did everything he could to get rid of me, including trying to send me to the military. I didn't give in. My sister was his favorite for, well, other reasons which I would find out later. She's four years younger and didn't see the same things I saw. She got away with a lot for being his favorite. Looking back, I think he kept her around so he could control her later and also to deal with his ""desires"". To the best of my knowledge, he never succeeded in this. 

My sister and I confirmed independently just tonight that we experienced the same thing in regards to my mother. We each went for walks with her where she would have a break and try to walk into someone's home. She claimed she grew the flowers or planted the tree in the yard and that she lived there for years and wanted to go in and sleep. This was before cell phones became as popular as they are now so this would cause lots of issues, sometimes with her having to be driven home by police. We were helpless back then with her.

I found out a few years after the split up that the ""doctor"" who had diagnosed her and prescribed her medicine wasn't actually a doctor and wasn't actually able to write prescriptions, but he was the only doctor her boyfriend would let her see (I can confirm as true). Coming from her, I'm not sure how true this is with her history of lying, but that's what she told me.

Lately she's been having the same issues as she did back then. She's widowed and twice divorced. She's living with a new guy, and my now adult sister is living there as well. My mother has destroyed her boyfriend's heart medicine, told him repeatedly that he's going to die, lose his job because of his heart condition, and that even his kids won't be there to help him or be at his funeral. She's also caused problems with his grown kids, saying that his son is molesting Jos daughter, does lots of illegal drugs, and (worst of all, for her at least,) is gay. 

He asked her to leave this weekend and she had a fit. She accused him of abusing her (not true) and that he doesn't take care of her (also not true. She doesn't work. He does). She was never like this when I was growing up before her surgery and especially before her boyfriend when I was in highschool. She has taken on his personality which she always complained about but she also now doesn't want me to come around with my kids because she says she doesn't need anyone. I can't bring myself to visit because of how she is. I'm not proud of not visiting, but I can't force myself into someone's life who doesn't want me. She is toxic and I'm worried she might hurt someone badly. I asked my sister to start recording everything, just in case.

My question is this: assuming she didn't have anything actually wrong with her and was wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar what effect would those pills (I forgot the names of them, probably still out there and I might remember if mentioned) have on a mostly healthy brain? She seems like she's been reprogrammed somehow and definitely not the person she was before she took them. Or, is that just how mental illness works and this is totally ""normal"" behavior now? How can I find out for sure which it is? 

I'm not looking for a diagnosis for her since I'm can't know what's in her head, but I am desperate for resources so I can maybe get there help if she needs it or learn how to deal with her new ""normal.""

To;Dr my mother had surgery almost 30 years ago. She had seizures, mostly controlled with medicine but then a possible misdiagnosis, prescribed medicine for schizophrenia and bipolar, wondering adverse effects if wrongly diagnosed and using strong medicine like that.

I'm 18 (F) and started on medication over a year ago after getting out of rehab. My meds changed a lot but for the past 6+ months I've been on Adderall, fluvoxamine (OCD/Depression) and lamotrigine (bipolar).
In rehab I met a guy who became my fiance after 6 months. We were living together, had no arguments, were best friends and got each other off of drugs. The relationship ended abruptly and was followed by months of no contact. This was about 8 months ago. 
The breakup sent me into a spiral, although I felt as motivated as ever and somehow became the best version of myself even throughout the horrible pain i was feeling 24/7. 
The past 3 months or so I've lost all my new close friendships because I hate leaving my house. I used to bug my friends all the time about going out or going on random walks, so this isn't like me. I won't even leave my house for school anymore and am falling behind completely after being a star student. I no longer have motivation to meet new people or even talk to the friends i have left. Emotionally I'm numb, my hobbies don't entertain me anymore so I'm usually just sitting soing nothing all day. I constantly feel so uncomfortable or anxious just existing, and I'm not the bubbly, excitable person I normally am. I feel like a zombie or a hallow shell
I used to be big on meditation which helped my mental health sooo so much after my breakup but no matter how hard I try to force myself back into it again, it's like i can't find the energy for it. This is different from any episode I've ever had before

61,"This has been a question floating above my head for some time now, and I've been itching to get some sort of answer. 
As a young artist, it's not much of a surprise I would come across fanart, or stories that involve a touch-deprived character. But whenever I do encounter these posts, they sort of hit close to home in a way I can't really describe. I did a little bit of research, and it seems awful similar to what I'm going through lately. 

Let's start from the beginning. As a young tot of between the ages of 5-9, I was never given much affection. I didn't pay much mind to it, and I never tried asking for it, in fear that the idea would be rejected (I was living with my Aunt and Uncle at the time). I never really notice it; it was sort of put in the back of my mind.
Fast forward a few years to Middle School, now. I'm currently in the eighth grade, and will soon be put into High School next year. At the start of the year, I had a friend sleep over and we hung out. We told each other secrets we would tell no one else, and we'd laugh about irrational fears or dumb jokes we told. Eventually, we had a cuddle session (Don't remember what caused it). I remember feeling tense and uncertain; however I also felt as if I seriously needed it, and had been yearning it for a while. However, my thoughts were also whirling, and afterwards, we never had a cuddle session again because I felt fearful of attachment and being left behind in some way. 
As the year went by, the thought kept surfacing on how much I wanted affection from the people I cared about, but in reality I felt the need to push them away and avoid their interactions. There were two occasions where this ""starved"" feeling would resurface. Once I was under a severe amount of stress and was fighting a fit of tears, and was hugged from behind. I so badly needed that interaction, and it calmed me down very easily. Another time when I was feeling unwell, my head was down on a table, and that same person had pet me on the head (sounds weird, I know). When they pulled away I suddenly craved more of it. 
I've been craving affection for so long without realizing it, but I don't feel comfortable saying it out loud, because I always thought it would make me ""weird"". I always felt I had to distance myself away from physical interaction, as much I wanted it. 
Warm blankets, heaters, long hot showers, and cuddling stuffed animals recently have been soothing these urges, but I still feel as if I need a person to give me these comforts. 

I just want to know if these show if I'm touch-starved? It's been bugging me for a while now, and I wanted to ask someone I wasn't entirely close with because I didn't want to be judged by someone close, or make them feel weirded out.",13May2019,3
62,"There's a very long story I want to share about how I got PTSD. It involves betrayal, abandonment, physical and verbal abuse, manipulation, threats of suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

It's coming up on five years since the big incident, and it's really been stuck in my mind lately, so I just want to get it out there...

This story involves three people. For the sake of keeping their identities anonymous, they will be called Ino, Pinya, and Myrl.

Ino was my best friend for 12 years, from the time I was 9 to just after I turned 21. I was an awkward kid with undiagnosed Asperger's, and she was pretty much my only friend. For that reason, I overlooked a lot of her abusive behavior. She would physically hit me and insult me, and if I was having an anxiety attack, (which involved bouts of anger), she would completely invalidate my feelings and tell me, ""You don't have anxiety, you're just an asshole."" But because she was my only friend, I did my best to ignore it.

Around middle school, I met Pinya, and she became a second friend. While we didn't click quite as well, I appreciated the fact that she was nicer than Ino, (she wouldn't hit me, at least). This made Ino insanely jealous, and at some point, she even slapped me in the face because I had followed Pinya to a class instead of waiting for her to get out of class. This resulted in us splitting up our friendship for about three months, but I eventually forgave her, and we were friends again.

As time went on Pinya began to change. I'm not for certain, but I think she may have had narcissism. She began to go around acting as if she was better than everyone else, putting others down, and if I disagreed with her on absolutely anything, I would get verbally abused and insulted. She was especially manipulative as well, even going as far as to threaten to kill herself if she didn't get her way. At the end of our friendship, I told her how abusive and mean she was being, and she told me to my face, ""At least I know I'm better than you."" We haven't spoken since.

Beyond that, I didn't learn until about 2 years ago just how bad Pinya was. She and I had a mutual friend, (my now best friend), who I will call Save, (who prefers they/them pronouns). Save lives overseas, about 7 hours ahead of us, and they told me that Pinya had told them, ""If you're not online to talk to me when I get home from school, I'm going to hurt myself, and it'll be your fault."" It would be around 2AM for Save by the time Pinya got home. Eventually, Pinya's abuse put Save into a massive panic attack, and they were finally able to build up the courage to block her and cut all contact with her.

Fast forward to around sophomore year. Ino ended up with a medical condition that made her drop out of high school, and for a little while, she was living in another city, so I was only able to talk to her online. We were still fairly close in that sense. After I turned 18, graduated, got my driver's license, and got my first job, I was able to hang out with Ino in person again. By that time, though, she had moved back to the city I lived in and never even bothered to tell me. Regard, I still wanted to hang out with her, and we began to do things together on my days off. Eventually, I learned that she had made a new friend, which was Myrl, and once Myrl found out that I was hanging out with Ino in person, she became insanely jealous and hateful toward me.

When it comes to Myrl, I tried to be friends with her. I put forth the effort for it and got no reciprocation. I even bought her a shirt, and she didn't even say thank you until Ino told her to. Needless to say, we did not become friends.

As time went on, Ino got to where she had to mention Myrl in every conversation we had. This upset me because of the amount of hatred Myrl had for me. When I confronted Ino about it, asking for just a little bit of loyalty, she threw it back in my face, saying I was ""jealous and possessive"" and that I ""didn't own her."" Honestly, I don't think a little bit of loyalty is too much to ask for. If someone hated her, I never would have been friends with them. But because I was afraid of losing my best friend, I did my best to overlook it, even if it did still make me angry at times.

The last time I saw Ino, we went to an anime convention together in another state. It was a trip that I had saved up for for 2 years. I paid for the entire hotel room, let her bring two of her friends to stay in the room with us, paid for all her food, everything. For the whole convention, Ino is very distant. She doesn't want to participate in the activities, and all she wants to do is sit in the hotel room and text Myrl. At that point, my gut instinct was telling me something was up, so while Ino was in the shower, I took a look at her phone. I know it's a terrible thing to do, but I'm glad I did it. I saw her conversation with Myrl in which she was complaining about being there the whole time, and the last message I saw said, ""I wish you were here instead of Tealinia.""

I was absolutely heartbroken. It was the worst betrayal I had ever experienced in my life.

I was a broken mess, crying in the hotel room, and when Ino got out of the shower, I eventually told her what I saw. Ino told me that it was just ""ego pandering,"" trying to make Myrl feel better about not going to the convention, (which I later found out was a lie), and like an idiot, I believed her. Looking back on it now, I wish I would have kicked her out of the room and made her find her own transportation back home... Since I gave her the benefit of the doubt, we finished the convention and went back home.

When we got back home, Ino didn't talk to me for two weeks. I confronted her about that, and she told me, ""I can't trust you because you looked in my phone."" Like an idiot, I kept trying to hang on, but eventually, I said, ""If you don't want me in your life anymore, just say so."" So, our friendship ended.

Immediately after our friendship ended, she began to spread lies about me. She told people that she ended the friendship because I had ""views that made her uncomfortable,"" (that I was racist, sexist, etc., which is an absolute lie). I later found out that she had been planning to end our friendship all along, and that what she was saying to Myrl was true. Even further, I also found out that she became friends with Pinya. Birds of a feather, right?

But anyway, that entire experience left me with some serious trauma... It's become an intrusive thought, it's destroyed my self-esteem, and it's given me some terrible abandonment issues that I'm currently trying to work through with the love and support of my current friends. I just wanted to put it out there. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",13May2019,2
63,"I feel like I’m pretty and skinnier than I am but I’m actually overweight. I always think I’m the best looking person in the room when in reality I look like a chubby slob.

64,"This will probably be long. 
Backstory- I’m an alcoholic, diagnosed panic disorder, and I have body dysmorphic disorder.
There’s lots of other things like depersonalization, symptoms of depression, and some physical health issues too. I just know if I get into all of it this post will become a novel haha 
Those three things that i first mentioned, all combined, are making me fucking crazy. I drink to stop the panic attacks, then feel depressed and fat because I drank. I mean I do shit I never thought I would, most because I’m drunk and insecure late at night. I’ve cut myself multiple times because I think “well I’m already covered in stretch marks so what one more scar, I wanna feel something” I have major insomnia because of the alcohol. If I start to get withdrawals I start having really vivid, disturbing dreams. I sleep about 2-3 hours a night. I’m also a giant hypochondriac so if I think about it too much I start freaking out and panicking and thinking I’m having a heart attack l. 
I just can’t believe that between everything I struggle with, the body insecurity is what makes me wanna hurt myself. 
I mean I can’t watch a fucking movie with my boyfriend-who by the way, I’ve cheated on when I was feeling sad- without crying when there’s a cute actress on screen. Which is fucked considering the things I’ve done wrong to him. He’s allowed to find someone other than me attractive. But in the moment of insecurity and jealousy I can’t think rationally.
I’m just going off on a tangent now but I think you get the point. I don’t wanna kill myself or anything. Just needed to express my feelings I guess.

65,"Not sure why, but when I turned 18 I developed major Hypochondria. I'm almost 20 now &amp; it still plagues me, but it's slowly getting better. A really huge thing that I think helped was I stopped googling symptoms I was having &amp; I started to keep busy so I wouldn't have time to think about the anxiety. I hope this helps someone ☺",13May2019,1
66," I don’t think that anyone in the world can answer the questions my compulsive worrying is looking for. I don’t think any medication can subdue my anxiety enough to enjoy a full day. I used to look for comfort in so many different people around me but in the end only felt guilty. I knew when I called that the person who picked up the phone would only feel bad for me for so long before they needed to get back to their life. I feel a relentless cloudiness. There is no happiness without intrusive dread, no love without guilt, no day without worry. I obsess over the fact that I may never get out of this headspace because so many people seem to never do. I don’t want to die but I use suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanism for not seeing a purpose in my life. I don’t see a therapist because I can’t believe that it’s not just a job to them, and I narcissistically think that nobody can understand my issues because they lack the depth. How can you understand what you don’t feel? There is no answer but I keep searching until I’ve ruined everything beautiful around me.",13May2019,2
67,"I feel so bad. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for at least a couple of years now.

My partner is currently going through a bad patch, and I’m still struggling myself, have been off my meds for the past week because the surgery didn’t get my prescription right so it’s been rough.

I feel terrible and selfish and horrible but I’m finding it so hard to support him. I just can’t seem to muster up the sympathy or empathy although I try. I’m not telling him to his face to get a grip or anything. He didn’t go into work today, but I still had to get up and get our children ready and off to school. Even when I feel like stepping out in front of a moving vehicle I still have to push on. I’ve never been able to say “you know what, I’m not feeling good I’m gonna stay in bed” unless that day falls on a weekend when he is home or when the children aren’t home.

I know he’s feeling bad, but I just can’t be around him right this second, posting here in the hopes that it helps me get it out my system because I feel so shit right now.",13May2019,1

We were all mentally prepared for it for years now. But you can't prepare yourself for the overwhelming sadness you feel when you get that phone call. The shock you feel the couple of hours after that. It didn't hit me until last night. She's gone.

69,"This might be a very general question but I’m wondering if anyone might have any insight into the array of mental issues that I seem to have accumulated throughout my life. I’m 24 years old, male, and I’ve graduated college and am working a decent job, and while I’m not well adapted to society at all, I can fake it enough to get by and even succeed in a lot of situations. I’m haunted by a lot of issues in my life though. I’m just very good at hiding them well. 

A lot of them are rooted in a deep subconscious anxiety. I have paruresis, or shy bladder, which makes it impossible to urinate in a room where another person is nearby. An exception to this is if it’s a complete stranger who I somehow perceive as not a threat, like a child or an elderly person, and if they’re not right next to me. Another exception is if the room is very loud and I have a very private space like a urinal blocked off by high walls or a stall. Other than that, it’s impossible for me. I’ve tried many different techniques to no avail. 

Somewhat related to this is severe performance anxiety when it comes to things like singing, dancing and raising my voice. Clubs and open bars full of dancing are my worst nightmare and I avoid them when I can. I’ve never once in my life sung or danced in front of people, even in situations where it’s been necessary, like for my job. I just went through the motions and if it was with a group, mumbled along. It’s embarrassing and makes me seem really boring because of the things I refuse to do. During my high school prom a couple girls tried to pull me onto the dance floor, and as much as I wanted to go (I really did), I nearly had a panic attack and pulled away and walked away to a quieter place. It just about ruined my night and I have many memories like that where I feel like I’ve not been able to have fun with other people or express myself like I wish I could. 

I have a very addictive personality, especially with certain things like marijuana and stimulants. I’ve been  through periods where I was heavily addicted and even using other drugs as well on top of that, and not being able to stop or function emotionally without them. Luckily I’m in a position where these things aren’t available, and I feel like I’ve gained a lot more control than I used to have. It’s been a few years since that period in my life and some things have gotten better like my income and my living situation, so in some ways I’m at less of a risk for that but I can still feel that part of me burning in the back of my mind and I can still feel it come out at some times with things that are available to me like alcohol and sex. It’s there, and I think it’s somehow connected to the anxiety I mentioned. 

I’ve never been able to wear clothes properly or know what to wear, how or where to get a haircut, how to make myself look good. I look eccentric. I also look a lot younger than my age. I’m 24 but I could easily pass as 18 or younger, and I have a lot of self-loathing about that, and I wonder why I have these young looks when other people in my family don’t. Because of all of this I come across as weird because I look young and struggle to dress well. I’ve had more shopping experiences than I can count where I’ve gone into a place, looked around for a long time and spent too much money on things that either don’t fit well or look as good when I get home. Haircuts are always a stressful experience for me. 

On top of all of this, I’m just overall eccentric. I read a lot of books and learn languages easily. I don’t want to compliment myself too much but I’m intelligent. I didn’t do well in school because of a lack of interest but I always scored very high on standardized tests and I ended up being a straight A student in college once I found the major that interested me the most. I will be honest, I have a tendency toward narcissism at times and when I was younger I had a superiority complex. I think I’ve outgrown that for the most part and that’s been good for me. I think when I was young I just didn’t know how to process being so weird. 

So at least something is working in my brain, but it’s totally unbalanced. I almost always prefer being alone because of how many little stresses there are when I’m with other people. I don’t watch the same movies as people and I don’t read the same books or have the same opinions a lot of the time. Conversation is often stressful. Like I said, I’ve gotten good at faking these things, and I can be normal for a little while but it’s exhausting. 

I have been diagnosed with ADD (inattentive type) by a doctor before, and I was only medicated with a norepinephrine inhibitor and not a stimulant, and I went off the medication because it didn’t help and made me very nauseous. I was on Lexapro for a few years previously and it didn’t really help much. I can say I’m probably happier now than I have been in most of my adult life, but I still have all these problems and I can’t find one category to fit them into. I just don’t know what I am or why I have these issues. I do come from a family with personality disorders. My father is very cold and aloof and I don’t have much of an emotional connection with him, and I felt a lot of fear around him as a child because he wasn’t very nice to me. I also have a mother who was very overbearing and controlling when I was young. It’s complicated because I love my parents, but the way they acted toward me for so many years has left deep scars I’m sure. 

If anyone had read this and feels like they know a category I fall under, I’m curious what it might be. Am I just a person doomed to have these issues because of my childhood or do I sound like someone with ADHD or Aspergers syndrome? I don’t know what it is about me. I wish I had some insight.",13May2019,1
70,"I spent my entire life with people who said that it gets better. It never did. I took action and improved things, but it never got better unless I made attempts at improving my life and these didn't always work.

76,"Ok so not sure what im looking for by posting this. But I have been having a rough time for a while now. I cannot bring myself to go to a psychiatrist/theripist. I reached out to one a while a ago and he said to call him but I chickened out and ghosted him (sorry random theripist guy). 

I know I need help by someone. But I know for a fact I am not able to help myself. I am so closed off when it comes to talking to people for some reason. I would walk in there they would ask ""how are you doing"" and my dumb ass would say ""im fine hbu"" and the whole hour or so would be them grilling me for answers and I would give them short answers then play them off like they are not a big deal. I might litterally have a panic attack from being asked about my problems. 

Its like im stuck im a loop. I realize im fucked and need help. Then I realize im to chicken shit to get help, and its this back in forth battle where the chicken side always wins. 

So.... In an effort to try and make it easier on my self. I decided to write down some stuff. Maybe make a nice little chart so I can hand it to the doc and say ""read that it will save us both some hassle"". Gonna spend a bit of time adding to the list to make sure I grab everything. 

Here is my list so far: 

Symptoms
  - no energy at all to do anything
  - short bursts of energy here and there but short lived and infrequent. (around 30 minutes to a couple of hours very roughly, but never a full day)
  - want to be dead. But do not want to die, could never do that to my family. 
  - mentally not there. Its like the first 5 minutes after you wake up and your brain is still booting up, except it doesn't and I can hardly function. No idea how I still have a job. 
  - terrible memory
  - cannot get up in mornings
  - cannot go to sleep at night (sometimes ill have a existential crises kinda feeling when I start to doze off and it will wake me back up)
  - at night is when I really getting a feeling of dread/hopelessness and thinking about what the point of living is. I have had times where I had to get up and drive somewhere late at night just to cope. Usually ill drive to a McDonald's or tims and grab a drink then sit in my car in a parking lot somewhere.
  - annoyed by everything
  - short burst of anger at dumb things
  - being around people especially triggers anger/annoyances
  - when in airports it helps to put in ear plugs and forget that other people are around me
  - life seems more and more like a dream or a movie, and its like I am watching through a tv screen. 
  - my perception of time is skewed. Sometimes a week seems like a month. Sometimes a week seems like a few days. 
  - no interest in anything at all. Even Netflix and youtube are not that interesting but they are low effort physically and mentally so I default to them. 
  - excessive worry about dumb shit. I get more worried about going to a 1 on 1 meeting with my boss (which I do weekly) than I am doing things like playing my guitar live in front if an audience. I also get more worried about TSA officers questioning me than I do going on planes/flying metal death machines. 
  - In general I just do not know how to interact with people like a normal person would. 
  - excessive eating
  - worry that everything above is me faking it
  - panic attacks (have died down and not happened recently thank god)


What I want
  - to have energy
  - to live in the moment and not dwell on things
  - be able to interact with other people without overthinking 
  - overall just worry a lot less
  - to not have the sudden urge to jump of a bridge late at night
  - be able to focus on a thing (Work, a hobby, whatever)
  - actually experience something as being fun and interesting like when I was a young kid
  - have a more stable mood
  - have a functional brain again",13May2019,3
77,"I will find something that interests me. I will think of days farther ahead in my life and not look into past. I will keep positive thoughts and walk away from guilt and regret. I will keep in mind there are people out there who know it's ok to have problems and that One shouldn't be going through problems alone. I will always believe I'm smart and I can do this. I'll focus on things one by one and if there are hurdles in the path, I won't think the why/how/what of them and simply move onto next thing. I won't dive into the circle of negativity ever. I will work out the triggers that tempt me to hurt myself and avoid them.",13May2019,59
78,"I feel at a loss. My mum died when I was 11 and now I’m 24. I didn’t feel very affected by it as I was brought up by my nana mostly anyway. I’ve recently realised I hate being on my own and somewhat hate myself. I would distract myself with the attention from boys and go relationship to relationship. Now three of my last relationships have ended because “they can’t make me happy” but the truth is no one can because I hate myself and have too high expectations from my partner because I want them to love me when I can’t and I stress over small things that aren’t perfect. I don’t know if this has anything to do with my mum but I need to change the way I think. My ex split with me a month ago and has been in and out of my life since then. Now out. I feel very alone and could easily go back to dating but know I must sort this. I’ve considered suicide a few times over the last month. I wouldn’t hurt myself though. I’ve experienced panic attacks and just a complete mental breakdown. I’ve went to GP and been given antidepressants. I’m on a waiting list for reduced price counselling. There are a few advice centres, I went to one today but they changed to appointment only and can only book tomorrow 11am-12pm so I have to wait until then to call and not sure when appointment will be. The other place is drop in but only thursdays. I finally told my dad how I’m feeling and he just called me and said there’s stuff about mental health all over the internet and it’s probably been put in my head from that when I don’t have any problems, it’s nothing to Do with my mum because that was 14 years ago and he and his parents didn’t have therapists and they went through a war.

You must still love me as a friend right, after all you still had on that choker I gave you last time I saw you. Or maybe I just imagined it- saw what I wanted to see? If you cared you’d answer my calls- you’d come over to see me. You would have asked where I had been all that time when I was in the hospital. But of course I know you still love me! After all you wouldn’t still wear the present I gave you otherwise. You wouldn’t have complimented me at all if you didn’t feel the same way. When I think you must love me I’m on top of the world! I think that you’ll gladly accept the letters I want to send and return my phone calls. When I think you hate me, I sink into a deep despair and I want to give up on life. All my efforts become a waste. I realize I’m going crazy with uncertainty. You must love me right... of course my feelings are returned. No... if you really cared you’d answer me back right?",13May2019,2
80,"I've felt… dead(?) for the past 2 years or so, like I don't know what to work for in my life anymore, it makes getting out of bed a bit of an ordeal, like I've no energy to get up and be productive because… I… don't see where I'm going with my actions. 

But then my anxiety makes me get up because ya know, I still have lectures, like I still try to make plans to force myself out but… I end up only going out for the sake of not being stuck in my dorm room. Alone.

I've a SO that is (putting it bluntly) part of the reason why I'm in this state, but is merely a catalyst and not the cause.
I've had a huge falling out with a certain group of close friends, and now I have no one close.

I punched the walls so many times that between my knuckles, I’m bleeding. I got tired of it and I nearly jumped out of my window. My grandmother saw me and she talked me out of it.

We were together for 8 months and i was very sad and upset cause we were best friend's and now she doesn't even look at me. 2 month's after the breakup she started dating someone else, it suprised me cause it was out of nowhere and broke my heart even more. During the time of the break up my friend's stop talking to me and laughing at my comments and jokes like im just background noise.  this on top of the breakup made me feel even worse. I started started struggling at school and lost the motivation to try harder, ive started giving up on school. All of this has made me feel sad, alone and disappointed with myself.

86,"In 2007 my mum passed away very suddenly. Horrible. 

2019, a person I was with ended things with me in a very traumatic way, and hasn’t spoken to me since. Hasn’t even apologised. This break up has hit me the worst than any other. She was abusive, manipulative, controlling, had severe anger problems and is just not a nice person. Anyone that’s had any dealings with her doesn’t have anything nice to say. Even her own sister is afraid of her anger outbursts.

Despite knowing how badly she treats others, I still miss her. Coming from an abusive family doesn’t help, I’ve normalised shitty behaviour. 

Since she broke up with me I’ve been depressed, anxious, suicidal. I haven’t cleaned my apartment for two months. I want to clean it. Because I hate living this way, but I can’t be bothered. I don’t see the point. 

I don’t want to be alive anymore. I can’t be bothered to do anything, go anywhere, talk to anyone, can’t be bothered to eat, to sleep, to wash. I can’t be bothered. I don’t do anything but sit around listening to music. I don’t have the energy to do anything else.

my response: Yes IT IS TOXIC, but IT IS also a trait of Histrionic Personality Disorder, a real fucking mental illness, and Border fucking line personality DISORDER, a illness i HAVE! this morning i almost cut again because the content that was posted was too triggering, i already feel homicidal towards humanity and i despise deep down people, and seeing that made me feel 10x worse, i wanted to swallow a full packet of Valium and Zoloft, i wrote 3 aggressive facebook statuses, and i cried myself to sleep, and somehow me making suicidal gestures means my suffering was fake? none of you understand what it means to be a male with BPD and narcissistic psychopathic tendencies. 

i wish many times if i would be dead, i want someone to reach out and show they love me and not attack me. I have long had fantasies of destroying the planet somehow through dumping garbage, destroying the environments, the fact no one understands my disorder and my mental intellectual disability is debitiltating and if things do not change soon i will eventually act on my thoughts and kill myself. most of you have bipolar, schizophrenia, depression or anxiety, but none of you know what it is like to be a severely oppressed rejected virgin male with BPD and NPD and a mental disability. The pain i feel can not be understood by anyone, this is why i plan to one day write a long manifesto, get the public eyes attention somehow and commit suicide on broadcast TV or etc as a message so you can all remember my name. i am having a eppisode now where i just wanna fucking break n cry myself to death but i won't, io want love.

Yes I’ve tried counselling-I only found out that the tremendous guilt I carry is real and validated.

Yes I’ve tried medication.  They don’t work for me, and yes, I’m religious about taking them because I know it can screw you up if you take them at different times or not as often as you should.

No I don’t cut myself-I’d just worry people and I feel bad so I don’t want to.

95,"I originally was diagnosed with depression when I was 18(5 years ago) and have improved greatly, I currently take the Paxil anti depressant. After getting a control on my depression I began to notice that I am most likely bi-polar. The anti depressants were doing a good job of controlling my mood swings. However I’ve been told/read of the negative effects of Paxil and additionally think I am ready to get off it. 

Problem is I don’t if it’s just the withdraw from not taking the Paxil or the the bi polar just being more noticeable with less depression, but I generally really good, except my mood swings. It’s mainly my anger, when a tiny thing happens I get really frustrated.

I was wondering if there are alternatives to anti depressants that are a little easier. Maybe something with less side effects or less restrictions.

I recently moved even further away from my family and friends, so I have had to do a lot of personal reflection lately about what I truly want out of life, and how I wanted to get there. 

Being so far away from my family has drastically increased the symptoms I suffer from regarding anxiety and depression. Over the last few months it has taken every cell in my entire body to pull myself out of that hole and to move toward a healthy/positive outlook on life. 

At first I had absolutely no idea how I could possibly feel any better. Through an incredible family/support system I was able to admit I needed help and I sought out advice from a therapist and psychiatrist. It took a lot longer than expected to improve, so you can imagine how frustrating it was when all I wanted to it to be fixed right away. 

I have found that it is not enough to simply take medication.. that is the first step (and an important one) to treat anxiety and depression. Many people that suffer from these diseases also have an issue with their general outlook on life without even realizing it.

Once I made myself aware of my own thoughts I realized that I was the main person bringing myself down.. not anyone else. Me. 

The first step to changing this is to catch yourself having those thoughts and then sit in them for a second and then choose to flip the thought around to a positive one no matter the difficulty. Each time you do this it reinforces the notion and it becomes easier each and every time. Try it.. it might just change your whole life. 

On top of all the above I was feeling pretty good with it, but I still found something was missing. I still didn’t feel good enough for myself or for anyone else. 

One weekend a few months back when I was sitting at home.. I began to feel sad again. I began to feel unworthy of anything good for some reason, so I really began to brainstorm. I had to figure out what was causing all this hurt. 

I GOT IT! MY DAD... 

Now I am not blaming, nor do I have any resentment toward my father, but we certainly don’t have the “closest” relationship. 

My dad is a drinker. Not your have a beer here and there with some friends, but a sit in your garage by yourself and listen to music nightly kind of drinker. 

He didn’t seem to be always like this... or so I thought. My mom brought it to my attention later in life. 

As a kid everything seemed “normal” but it was far from “normal”

We had some stuff in common like an interest in sports, but since I didn’t play the typical “hockey, football, baseball” combo he didn’t show much interest in coming to the events of the sport I did partake in. 

Again... as a kid I didn’t think much of it.. looking back though it hits hard. Growing up constantly trying to subconsciously impress someone that was so into themselves that I could’ve slapped him in the face with a gold medal and it wouldn’t have mattered. That leaves pain. That leaves a feeling of insecurity that is carried into life. 

It was my job to recognize that how he treated me as a kid and the relationship we had does not define me. He is sick. He is an alcoholic. 

Moral of this story is that I started going to Al-Anon as another form of support to aid in recovery. This group has been incredible and welcoming to say the least. It shows me that everyone has a story. 

One day a young girl (about 12-13) came into the group with her mom. She sat silently the whole session doodling in her notebook. During the session I shared an experience I had with my dad that was relevant to the topic.

After this session wrapped up and we were all getting ready to leave... this girl walked up to me and handed me a drawing. 

She walked right up to me... looked me in the eye and said, “your story about your dad made me think of my dad, and he’s in prison.” 

This absolutely broke my heart and made me whole at the same time. This girl gave me the gift of recognizing that I too have a positive influence I can have on others, and that there is always someone looking up to you even if it doesn’t feel like it. 

I have that picture hung on my fridge to remind me every single day how lucky I am to be here and how incredible this journey has been to get where I am now.

Really I am just confused on where to start to identify if I have a mental health problem or not. I often feel tired, even with good amount of sleep. I don't exactly feel under stress or like anything is wrong. my girlfriend just suggested I look into this because a 21 year old shouldn't feel so tired all the damn time.

A problem I have had with trying to go through the process is my belief that anything relating to medical help is that I am getting robbed of who I am as a person because someone tells me to take these pills to ""better"" myself, and I just think it's to get money from me and to force me in the loophole.",13May2019,2

I will easily destroy relationships in a short period because suddenly I’m an emotional wreck. I start fights with those closest to me or drive wedges and unnecessary drama with new people in my life. Even when on something to suppress my period I still feel the hormonal effects.

Im struggling with severe anxiety and couldnt figure out what was going on until I saw a post of my primary teacher about kinds of anxiety.
One included Separation anxiety disorder and everything clicked on. As I kid I ended up being very scared to leave my mother going to kindergarden to the point id go in circles, cry, attack teachers out of anger and repeat ""my mum told me it was an off day"" repeadly, until I was taken home and went back to a different kindergarden with a friend that helped me through.

I realized Its happening again, but way more severe as Im an adult... and I cant help it.

103,"[Mental Health] Social Anxiety, Delusions, Rejection, and Mental Illness!

Most people suffer from certain social anxieties. Just the idea of speaking in front of a crowd can make otherwise confident people break into a nervous sweat. Fear of rejection is also very common in society… just ask any teenager who’s too afraid to ask out their crush. In this episode, we talk about these common feelings from the perspective of having additional mental illness thrown in, creating a blend that is no one’s favorite.

104,"Hi everyone, 

My mum (age 53) has recently been diagnosed with severe depression. She is currently on prescribed Diazepam 3 times a day as well as Cetaollpram. She is in contact with a private consultant and is seeing a counsellor once a week. She is wrecked with worry and anxiety, cannot let go of “mistakes” she has made in the past and is deeply regretful. She says she feels like she has lost control of her mind and always wants to sleep because that’s when she stops thinking. She also really struggles to get up and out of the house. We are really struggling to know who to talk to or where to go. We are living on Northern Ireland and it seems there are very limited services or help for someone with severe mental health issues. 
If anyone has any suggestions or advice for either someone/organisation to contact or even some suggestions of things we can do at home it would be really appreciated.",13May2019,2

114,"Been  dealing with depression and anxiety  for over 25 years now (it started  when I was 14, I'm now 40).  I go  through periods that can last months  at a time (and in one case over a  year) where I am completely  non-functional.  My personality completely  disappears and I lose all of  my emotions and feelings for everyone and  everything and basically  become a vegetable.  It's hard to describe,  but it's my version of hell  and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

I've   been hospitalized during these states and given every med you can  think  of, even had ECT once (back in 2001) but nothing seemed to help  me.   Except time.  If I waited long enough I always came out of it and   returned to my old self, eventually.

The   last time I was in such a state was last summer.  I was hospitalized   (again) and again nothing they gave me helped.  When I came home I   wasn't better and I had come off all meds (again).  I've gone through   phases where I've thought the meds were actually CAUSING these horrific   states, but in recent years I have been off them for long periods and   still end up going down into the black abyss of nothingness.  I've come   to the realization that my brain is severely imbalanced and it probably   needs meds to functional normally.  But I had never found the right   ones.  Until now.

When I got out of the   hospital last August and wasn't better I decided I could not stand to   be like this anymore and was desperate to find a med I hadn't tried  that  might help me be a human again.  I did a Google search for   treatment-resistant depression and found two meds I hadn't tried:   Remeron (Mirtazapine) and Mirapex (Pramipexole).  The latter is used for   Parkinson's mainly but I'd seen it referenced in treatment-resistant   depression trials.

Since I had no   prescription drug insurance and did not want to see any more doctors, I   decided to buy the drugs online.  There are online pharmacies based   overseas that sell legitimate drugs and you don't need a prescription to   buy them, since they are based in countries where the laws don't   require one.  I know this isn't the best way to get them, but I didn't   have many other options.

I successfully   acquired both drugs, and after two weeks of tapering up to   ""therapeutic"" doses, I began feeling better.  This had never happened   before on ANY meds. A couple of weeks later I was nearly back to my old   self.   I couldn't believe it (and still can't), but I'll take it.

This   has gotten a lot longer than I intended with my history, but here is   the point I'm coming to.  I've been buying the meds online, but I have   just acquired Medicaid and prescription drug coverage.  I made an   appointment to see a psychiatrist to see if I can get prescriptions of   the meds I'm currently taking (getting them for free would be a lot   better than paying over $100/month).

The   thing is, the ONLY thing I want from the doctor are the prescriptions.    In 25+ years I have seen a lot of doctors and therapists, believe me.    None of them helped.  Now that I know what DOES help, I don't want to   have to give a song and a dance and meet with this doc every 2 weeks   talking about my life, I just want the scripts.

I'm   wondering if I should expect difficulty in achieving this goal, and   maybe what the best things I can tell the doctor to get him to write   them for me?  Should I mention that I've been buying them online?    Should I bring meds' packaging for him to see?  I honestly don't know   how I should approach this.  Since these aren't habit forming drugs, I   would think it shouldn't be difficult, but I don't know what to expect.    Any suggestions would be appreciated.

**TL;DR   - After a long 25+ year search, I've finally found a med combination   that works for me (I did this using Google, independent of any doctors):   Remeron and Mirapex.  Since I didn't have drug coverage and was fed up  with doctors I've been buying them online.  Now I have drug coverage.  I   made an appointment with a psychiatrist and my goal is to get   prescriptions for the meds.  Should I expect a hassle or difficulty in   getting the scripts?  What can I tell him that will convince him to   write the scripts?  Thanks.**",13May2019,2

My moods are constantly impacting my interactions with family and friends and I get so angry at myself for letting my emotions take over in social situations.

121,"I'm not gonna bore you with details, but basically for a 3 to 4 years now I've been feeling more anxious and depressed than in the past (I used to be a little anxious when I was little but nothing that stopped me from doing anything).

I am now in 11th grade and it's gotten to the point where all I can think about is dropping out and possibly ending my life. I only do homework occasionally, and skip classes when I have a hard day ahead knowing I'll just make a fool of myself in front of the entire class and get told I am not good enough again. I had an OK life, but the people around me (parents, teachers) weren't exactly great.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, a weeks ago I had a panic attack (not the ones where you get to the ER) but still bad. The last time I had one before this was a few months ago. I decided it was time to get help, I talked to my dad (since my mother was and still is one of the reasons I am like this) and we went to our GP. Told the doc how I felt and all, thinking she might sent me to some therapist or something. I never felt more anger than I did that day, I was told to just ""do some deep breathing and stop being stressed"". I didn't push any further, didn't tell her anything else. I wanted to, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.

It strikes randomly, and I can go from completely fine to horrible in no time flat.

When I'm in these moods, I also sometimes feel extremely guilty about tiny things (for example, accidentally tearing a £5 voucher that wasn't valid after being torn) and it sometimes makes me punch myself in the head. It feels like I don't have a choice. I just ask myself not to. (Though I never go much further than slight pain.) Then I usually have an argument with myself out loud, then think I'm crazy.

There are things I'm dealing with now, that years ago would have crippled me. Now, yeah it still hurts and it sucks and I'm depressed and struggling but I'm fucking surviving because I've grown and gained skills and learned that I can survive things because I am fucking strong.   


I think a big part of feeling hopeless and suicidal isn't necessary the idea that nothing good will ever happen to you ever again, but moreso the the idea of always feeling weak and powerless and not in control of things.

Now I'm not sure if this is related but I personally think it is, but I don't believe in God or any sort of afterlife. I started really thinking about this and trying to find ""concrete evidence"" about what happens to the consciousness after death and after literately almost a year of obsessing and every single fucking night going through an existential crisis I found nothing, that there is no after life, there is no God, not for me at least. It confirmed my worst fear ever. My whole entire world flipped upside down and filled me with this sense of extreme fear and dread I walk around with now (usually these episodes of existential crisis happen at night but also happen with panic attacks). This has become my new reality now.

With everything I just said in mind, is it possible for someone like me to get over the fear of death entirely? And maybe even embrace it so I can move on and live with the possibility that this very well could be the only life we get and once we are dead we will return to the state of nothingness just like before you were born.

I also struggle with depression and have currently went cold turkey off my lexapro because my doctor wouldn’t make an appointment quick enough..&amp; I don’t have money for it at the moment. And I have been off of it for 2-3 weeks now. And I have been okay, but now I am wondering if I truly do have depression.. bc all I want to do is lay in bed, cry, and do nothing.",13May2019,1
132,"I call my mom sometimes to comfort me, I love my mom, and she's great to talk to, unless she brings religion into the conversation...

It triggers me due to some past trauma. My mom doesn't understand that. She says stuff like ""you never were a Christian truly and you weren't helped because you didn't trust god"" or ""the reason why you never were helped was because you didn't fully let god in your heart and you let fear control you"" or ""you wouldn't allow God to intervene because you wouldn't let him take control"" or ""you didn't have faith"" or something like that, these are not verbatim but they're generally the kinds of things she says.

I used to be Christian and I begged and pleaded to god to help me. Didn't work out for me. So my mom says those things to make sense of it. She truly believes that god will fix my problems. She said to me today something along the lines of ""haven't you noticed that ever since you haven't had god in your life you've been miserable?"" I told her ""I was still miserable when I did, mom, I was actually more miserable"" again, these aren't verbatim, I honestly can't remember exactly what was said because we've had this conversation so many times it's all mashed together and the words just don't register anymore.

I wish she would just say something else. Even if it's ""I'm sorry, that's rough"", it'd be better than making it seem like it's my fault because I won't ""let god into my life"" (another thing she says). 

It's not my fault! Almost my whole family is looking at me thinking ""if only he'd let god into his life..."". I am surrounded by this, I hate it. 

Does anybody else deal with this?",13May2019,14
133,"I've suffered from anxiety for four years, depression and PTSD for two. I've seen counselors on occasion, but not for a while now. My college offers some services for free, but they never have open spots. I don't have enough money to pay for counseling, and for some reason every counselor in my area seems to have dropped out of service with tricare. If I want a session I have to drive over an hour away and that's only if I get a referral from Tricare to go to that office. Are there any free options that you guys know of.

Also, sorry English is not my first language, I'm on mobile, all that. Also I tend to ramble but I will try to avoid it. 


I'm a 16 yearl old girl, almost done with my first year of high school (in Europe, if that matters). And the entire year I have had this feeling that I can't really explain, but I'll try: I've been feleing hopeless, as if there is nothing here that's worth living for and constantly being terrified of my future, and I just have absolutely no motivation for anything, even some things I used to enjoy, like baking. I have also felt way more tired almost every day, lost my appetite and having difficulty falling asleep. 

Also, I keep having what I keep calling ""panic attacks or something"", even though, to be 100% honest with you, I'm not really 100% sure of what panic attacks really should feel like. But I just start to feel like I'm going to cry, my stomach hurts (sometimes), my face goes red, I start to shake and I feel like I have something stuck in my throat, for absolutely no reason. Like, one time in class we were having a discussion about abortion (basically to practice how to look at things from different people's perspective and have a civil discussion, you didn't have to share your own opinion but what someone else might think and why), and since I had a few things I wanted to say I raised my hand. And then the teacher called on me and I started to sweat and shake and almost cry and yeah. Not fun.


I have also been just feeling awfull. Hopeless, like nothing is worth it, literally considering suicide. The evenings are the worst, that's when I will literally almost cry for no reason and feel like I can't breath and like there's this huge pressure in my chest.


The reason why I keep dismissing it is because high school is pretty stressfull, pkus during the christmas break I was fine. Also, after the holidays I felt better, so I thought it was just because of school. But now (like, a month or two or so ago?) it started coming back, way worse than before.

So, my question is... Is this something I should seek help for, or is it just stress and I should just relax more or something?

Also, I have tried talking to my parents about the panic attacks - they started making jokes and making fun of me and laughing, and then got upset when I got upset.",13May2019,1
135,"I have a very cluttered mind and have a hard time focusing on one task or even sleeping. It feels as if my mind is always running at full speed and diminished capacity due to exhaustion. Sometimes it seems as though I was simply daydreaming for a long time rather than sleeping, it feels as though I am simply regaining my attention when the daydream ends instead of waking up normally. When that happens I feel exhausted as though I have not slept. I work a desk job and have a hard time focusing on a task for a prolonged period of time.

The true strange experience was not the daydreams though, but a strange mental clarity that I have never experienced before.

Last weekend I was sitting on my couch reading some sci-fi at about 7:00 P.M EST and had an awakening of sorts. My eyes were already opened, but I could feel them slowly opening up as wide as possible and my mind became incredibly alert. I had been drinking only water, eaten some lasagna a couple hours earlier, my pupils were not dilated, and I was not on any medication (or drugs). I felt like I had woken up after being asleep for a long time. This mental clarity lasted from 7:00 PM to until I fell asleep (probably about 1:00 AM). In comparison, I feel as though I am asleep with heavy eyes and an unfocused mind. This temporary transformation was not prompted by any particular emotion like joy or fear, I was simply sitting on the couch, one moment I was awake and the next moment incredibly awake. When compared to such a state of mind, I feel that most of my mental faculties are greatly diminished.

I am curious if anyone has the same problem as me and if they were somehow able to make that clarity permanent.",13May2019,3

139,"I am trying to figure this out so I can explain and resolve the way this relationship ended in some way. She got extremely cold and eventually left me without reason. Now she avoids my presence like the plague but still has me added on social media. I feel completely used but, am desperately ready for closure. Below, I will list the peculiar traits that I found. If you have any experience with narcissists, please chime in.

1. She seemed extremely cognizant of her attachment style. She described herself as a cat in that she thrives on attention but, only on her own terms. Too much attention and she would run away. When the attention was removed, she would feel a great need to have it back. More on this later...

2. I was a slob when we met but, she seemed eager to match my habits. Most of our ""dates"" consisted of me surprising her at her place and then us vegging out on the couch eating junk food and cuddling. This eventually led her to become almost twice the size she was before I met her (no judgment. i like em a lil thicc.) but I work out and that's not something she seemed willing to do.

3. She was a great cook and artist but, my praise of her didn't seem to spark any reaction. It's almost as if she was pretending not to hear me so that I could keep bombarding her with praise.

4. She was a bookworm and a workaholic. She quickly rose to manager at her new job and relished over how much she actually liked bossing people around. It seemed to be a joke at first but, as the complaints from her coworkers piled up, and the looks and slights they gave us whenever I was around may have confirmed, I don't think this was nearly as false as I initially believed it to be. 

5. The most insidious trait: When I was having a bad day, or if she noticed that her actions were negatively affecting my mood, she would just stare and smile at me comfortingly and somehow all of the issues floated out of view. It almost felt trained, like she had done it many times before. I described her smile as a weapon against my demons but, maybe it was really just a weapon to disarm conflict because...

6. I made a point to help her with her problems whether that be by lending an ear or a helping hand. She never actually listened to me or my problems. In fact, she was very forgetful about anything that I told her. Even small details like who initiated the relationship were lost. Three days of unread text messages and ""oops, i didn't see these. sorry."" There's not much more to add to this but it was the most painful part of it all.

7. She would withhold sex like it was a game. One moment she wasn't in the mood (despite putting on her sexiest undies) . When I got visibly upset over this to the point of wanting to walk away completely, she would conveniently coerce me back to bed but, made sure that I did all the work.

8. Her family and friends noted a positive change in her when we got together. It was as if she was a completely new person. They all loved me seemingly more than they loved her simply because of who she had become while with me. Her mother and grandmother even hung pictures of me (and only me) on the fridge.

9. It seemed like she loved drama but, only when it didn't directly involve her. I would feel many times that she was trying to pit me against her brother when they lived together. She complained about him constantly (never disclosing any of this to his face) and it was only hot for her to have sex with me when she knew he was in the other room.

10. I felt that much of her life was perfect as is and had no idea what she was complaining for. Her family was wholesome and together. Much more so than my family. When I tried pointing this out, she berated me stating that I was wrong and don't know anything about them. She would then tell a sob story that somehow always made me feel like she was unnecessarily playing the victim.

11. The last time I saw her physically, she had just moved out of her bedbug-ridden apartment. She was living with her parents again (an hour away from me and her job). I hadn't had a place up until then but didn't mind sharing space for awhile. This seemed to make her uncomfortable and that all was confirmed when she finally came over. I made her dinner and yet she was condescending and rude. She made no attempt to listen to the variety of issues I had been dealing with since we last spoke. It was as if she was so envious that she no longer had a place to stay for herself that she couldn't enjoy the one right in front of her. 


I've described these points in the way that they made me feel. That may provide some bias but I believe it important not to overlook how I felt as some of these actions are so covert in nature that they can be simply shrugged off otherwise. Looking over this now, the answer seems so clear to me but, maybe what I just need a bit of solidarity.",13May2019,1

141,I’ve been stable for years and now it’s all down the drain. Last night I took my ambien and scrolled for an hour or two when I decided to go to bed. As soon as I closed my eyes it started it was like a movie in my head with invisible voices and song on repeat over and over again. Then when I opened my eyes I couldn’t look at anything because because it would appear to be moving. Right now I’m looking at my ceiling and its swirling and bowing the shadows are moving.  I can barely keep my eyes open but I’m scared to close them. I’ve been up since 6am yesterday and I’m just done. I want it to stop but I can’t make it and my mind is turning on me. I can’t stop twitching and I’m going from being eerily calm to bawling my eyes out every 10 minutes. I’m terrified. I’m more scared right now than I ever have been of anything that goes with this shit. This is keeping me focused at least for a bit until my mom comes home and I won’t be alone.,13May2019,1
142,"I keep having really vivid dreams of my family dying. In every one of the dreams I somehow play a part in their death, wether I’m doing it or getting someone to do it. Every time I somehow my myself look like the victim and then I secretly am the one who did it.

I would literally never want the things that happen in these dreams to happen to my family and it’s starting to scare me. Like I’m the one doing it in these dreams, it’s me. But I would never do things like that.

Idk it’s just really confusing and I just don’t know how to make them go away or how to tell someone.",13May2019,2
143,"For a bit of background, we started dating 6 months ago after being friends for a couple years. Things had been going amazingly well and I had never met someone who got me and understood me so completely and vice versa. I knew she had a history of mental health issues caused by previous traumas but it genuinely seemed to be improving in the last year or so. She recently started a fairly demanding job, the hours seemed somewhat erratic and she can end up working exceptionally long days sometimes, not exactly a point of stability or reliability. She also just moved in back home, living with family who I know she has a somewhat strained relationship with. Despite all this, it seemed that things were being managed fairly well.

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago and she revealed to me she had quit taking her prescribed antidepressants cold turkey, saying that she finally felt good enough not to need them. This caused me a good deal of stress as even though she may not feel the need to take them anymore it’s considerably dangerous and unhealthy to go off them in this way. Unsurprisingly one week later when I saw her I could tell something was off, she had spiralled into a terrible depressive state I hadn’t seen her in in a very long time. She told me she felt like she needed to be alone, felt emotionally unavailable and needed a break from seeing me. Obviously I was devastated and worried about her mental state, not knowing exactly what I could do for her considering she asked for space. Anyway this past week she had messaged me asking to hang out and that she missed me but I was not at all in a good headspace about it as she told me she still didn’t know if she could be in a relationship right now. I felt it best not to see her while things were so precarious.

As of last night I called her and, to my relief, found out she had started taking her meds again and was actively looking for a therapist to see on a regular basis. I still didn’t get an answer as to whether she thinks she can be in a relationship right now and I don’t want to push her but I know she still cares for me but just feels like it’s easier to push people away and be alone. I can’t help but feel like this is just temporary hiccup, something to work through and not something that should cause us to throw away our entire relationship or I feel like we would both regret it for a long time.

My head is still spinning a bit and I just wanted some feedback or to know if anyone has been in a similar situation, what course do I take from here?",13May2019,1

145,"Is there a mental disorder name for when people make situations to make you feel guilty so that they get the sympathy? 

Quick example: gf (27) and me (29) live together. We invited her mom over because we hadn't seen her in a month. We live 2 hrs away. First then she says to my gf is that she had to drive so far and there was a toll (1 toll to be exact.)

I don’t see why anyone has to care about suicidal people or people in general. It doesn’t make you a bad person. I feel like angry people will reply to this about how we need to care about human life and feel empathy and I just don’t.",13May2019,1
147,"So recently I was self reflecting and noticed a pattern that many people like to tease me about. I have jumped from major to major. Every time I switched it to something else I always got “are you sure this time” or “yea you’ll switch to something else in a week”. Basically I was looking bad on my life to figure out why I do this and why I seem to give up at the slightest thing I don’t like or feel I won’t do good at. 

Looking back I realized it really started in 9th grade when I felt I wasn’t as good as the other girls on the lacrosse team so I didn’t join. I felt I would let them all down. I regret doing this now as I missed out on playing the sport I loved. Then I laid low and didn’t do anything risky. Then senior year came and I joined the fire department and the EMT class at my high school. I always loved helping people and my dad is a paramedic. I did a few calls just watching and I loved it. The class first semester was hard but I enjoyed learning about the human body and some medications. Second semester came and because my teacher was evaluating us and I though I would do bad and let her down I very quickly left the class and the fire department as I didn’t fee I would be any good and I could hurt someone. I wanted to be a nurse but after that class and testing I decided to give up as I didn’t feel that I could do it or that I would mess up and hurt someone. 

The next career I moved on to was being a mechanic. I love cars and working on them. Perfect fit right? Well after an introductory class I decided that I didn’t think that I’d be good at it and I was too scared to lift a car because I thought that it would fall or that if I did become a mechanic I’d mess someone’s car up and they’d die. 

Then I went to accounting. Yea it’s too boring for me. I have a problem sitting still for too long. I have adhd so to me it felt too slow even though I enjoy math. 

Then I went to social work. I enjoy helping people but it wasn’t medical and I didn’t have to stick people with things. I thought it was a win win. But I didn’t think I could handle listening to how people are having a really tough time everyday because I’d get a little emotionally attached and if something happened I’d blame myself. 

Then it went to computer Science. Found out I can’t sit still long enough to do coding and I actually fell asleep in class. 

So now here I am looking back on all this and seeing a trend of just giving up. I feel like shit honestly. This semester I barely tried because I have no motivation. My parents are going to be pissed when they see my grades. For me working 32-40 hours a week was a mistake and I probably would have put more work into school if I had more time. Every time I fail I shame myself. I really beat on my self esteem and I compare myself to other people who are doing way better than me. 

I’m at a stand still right now because I’ve gone through everything I love and can’t find something I can do with out failing at which would make me fee horrible. Every time I messed up as a kid I used to cry even if it was not handing in homework because I forgot. 

Any advice on how to get over this or deal with it would make me so happy. 

Have a great day!",13May2019,1
148,"So I've been dealing with depression for just a little over a year and something weird is happening. Like I know part of it is related to the people around me and how I was raised. In the past year I've had some of the worst nights ever - and it has led me to sometimes being able to reach out. It's often a long night when I'm studying or something else. But now - every time I stay up later than my parents they keep telling don't stay up too late in case things might happen. Something about that really bothers me. It just keeps feeling like they are implying that I can't be trusted to stay up alone - that I am bound to break down every time. I know they have good intentions - but it feels like I'm losing their trust. It's as if I'm too vulnerable to be left alone. Well, I'll be going off to uni someday soon so I really don't know what happens then. But idk - maybe I'm reading too much into nothing - but it annoys me.

&gt;""The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn’t minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn’t hurt. It doesn’t mean you aren’t legitimately a victim in some circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;It just means that you’re not special.”

Excerpt From: Mark Manson. “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck.”

&amp;#x200B;

When I was diagnosed I really wanted to hide my mental illnesses and problems from people (and myself really) because I didn't want to come off as being entitled to special treatment. I put my medication in an Altoids tin because using the pill bottle felt like I was ""showing off"" my mental illness in a way. I feel like a lot of people do use their mental health issues as a form of entitlement and I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what was making me feel so ashamed of my mental illness as well. It made me feel like I was just ""playing victim."" After reading the quote I realized that I don't need to be a victim to have my problems, they're *normal,* but nonetheless still issues I can and should improve.

Because of my Autism, I'm not very good at verbalising my feelings. I'm better at writing them out, but my mom's said before that I tend to be overly dramatic when I write them and make it look worse than it actually is.

Personally, I just seek diagnosis. I want to just know the name of whatever the hell is wrong with me. I have done a lot of research  on my signs and talked with others about it. I want to maybe share my research with them, but I don't want to look like I'm self diagnosing. (And partly maybe I also fear rejection and being told there's nothing wrong with me, reinforcing the idea that I'm making it up, causing me to use it to beat myself up, and then beat myself up even more for just making this sound like a threat)

In terms of treatment, I'd like to try medication. Therapy has never done much for me, since I don't like verbalising my problems, and writing is too time consuming, and when I took anxiety meds when I was 12 (I'm 17 now), it seemed to help me.

The reason why I feel like I'm being manipulative is because I actually had a, like, introductive session of therapy that was from the hospitalisation(That was February-ish). I have actually given them a paper where I showed points that I might have Munchhausen Syndrome (A mental disorder that makes you fake an illness for emotional support) and told me that it was really not me, and later on telling me ""I'll validate you now. You ARE low.(As in low mood)"". That actually made me....VERY happy, but later on started beating myself up, thinking ""Hey feeling low ain't a good thing why the fuck am I celebrating it? OH THAT'S IT I'm celebrating my success in fooling her into validating me! None of this is real!""

To be fair, I kind of also feel afraid of a diagnosis because I fear I might be lying about it without knowing (Nad going crazy over the ""success""), or exaggerating things, since I HAVE been feeling better, yet still seek diagnosis and meds. Am I being too entitled?

162,"Hello. I'm here to post about a past relationship that has caused many complications and large amounts of anxiety. Any potential comments or advice is appreciated, though I don't expect many people to read this fully. However, if you are interested in reading this whole thing, please be aware that I will be detailing events that deal with rather personal and controversial subjects. I will also be including screenshots though will be censoring both his and my names for privacy reasons.

**TL;DR** - When I was in a bad emotional state I joined a forum and planned a suicide pact with someone who I later got into a relationship with. Things didn't work out and I blocked him due to his attitude. He then threatened to call the cops if I didn't unblock him, and for about a month he emotionally manipulated and tormented me until I had the courage to block him again. However, I'm still heavily anxious about him and he recently joined a server I own before a friend got him to leave. Looking for any advice or support on how to move on.

This all happened last year. At the time I was severely depressed and was a somewhat active contributor to a pro-choice forum (for those unaware, those who are pro-choice respect the right to both live and die). I have a very painful chronic illness that makes daily life very difficult, and during this hopeless period of my life I planned to die eventually. I found the concept of dying in the company of someone else to be comforting, so I asked if anyone would be interested in forming a pact. Shortly after I was messaged by a user and we added each other on Discord, where we soon became close and talked actively about our plan as well as many other topics.

Later on it became rather obvious that he had feelings for me, and my first mistake was getting into a relationship with him. At the time I had a crush on him, but I admittedly jumped the gun and claimed to love him in response to his affections. I have a very difficult time distinguishing my feelings, but my mindset at the time was that being in a relationship with the person I planned on dying with was most likely my best option, when it reality I was just setting myself up for disaster.

It wasn't until after I got into a relationship with him did I start becoming a bit uneasy. He had a very reserved nature, not often talking about his life, and refused to tell me his name for the longest time and preferred to not go into details about his job. Calls were a common thing for us, though 98% of the time he had his mic mute and would only respond through text messages. That itself never bothered me, but eventually the topic of video calls was brought up, and he often insisted that I enable my camera despite rarely showing his own face. With my shyness this made me quite uncomfortable. 

It didn't take long for issues to start occurring in our relationship. At first we lacked time to really do much with each other due to our sleeping schedules not making talking easy, and after that issue was resolved I admittedly started to purposely avoid him for the above reasons. He was giving me uncomfortable vibes but I didn't know how to tackle the situation. However, it wasn't long before he confronted me on the matter himself. We spent the remainder of the night arguing, and after things calmed down he admitted that he had pressured me and had taken things too far. I still felt like nothing had been solved, and I'm pretty sure he felt the same way. However, the night's events had made me both mentally and physically exhausted and I just wanted some time to myself as soon as possible. In an effort to temporarily avoid any additional conflict, I returned his affection despite not being sure if I even felt the same way anymore. 

I spent the rest of the night thinking over what had happened, and came to the conclusion that things just weren't working out between us. Despite sharing the desire to die it felt like we were on completely separate paths and wanted different things with this relationship, and I feared that continuing it would only cause further issues and repeats of the previous argument. As such, the next day I decided to end both the relationship and pact, which he was understandably upset about. We agreed to still be on speaking terms, though we rarely conversed with one another afterwards.

It was around this time that my only parental figure (my grandmother) broke her leg and was sent to a hospital where she would be staying for a while. Due to my anxiety and sadness I don't take being alone for long periods very well, and this was only made worse by a severe storm cutting off the power for about two days. When I regained the ability to use the internet I was basically relying on my friends as my only source of company apart from my cat and dog and the occasional call from my grandmother.

That whole month was unbelievably stressful for me. I lack a drivers licence so I had to rely on cabs and my neighbors to help me get food for both myself and the pets. However, the latter eventually started ignoring me and cabs are rather expensive. On top of that I didn't know how to pay off bills. My grandmother tried to explain to me how to pay them through the phone, but I had difficulties following her instructions and she was clearly becoming frustrated with me. This stress increased the severity of my symptoms from my illness, and with all this anxiety I became quite irritable.

It was then that my ex decided to message me. When we were in a relationship he got into the habit of regularly teasing me for one of my past interests that he found out about, and I tried my best to make it clear that I didn't enjoy what he was doing and didn't see it as funny, though he did and continued regardless. I eventually got him to agree to stop, but during that conversation he resumed and with my lack of patience I had enough. Having giving him multiple opportunities to stop, I blocked him. 

Shortly after he messaged me on the forum we met each other on (the forum lacks a blocking feature), and he threatened to call the cops on me if I didn't unblock him on Discord and talk to him. Out of fear I complied and confronted him on his hypocrisy. He knew that calling the cops would get me sent to the mental hospital which I had a very damaging experience in that I informed him about on numerous occasions when we complained about the mental health system, but it was as if his mentality and beliefs had suddenly changed. [Before he had agreed that psych wards were awful places and yet at that moment he was threatening to get me sent back there] (https://i.imgur.com/Ex59lTk.jpg). His reasoning was that he was ""worried"" about me and that he was doing this for my ""safety"", completely choosing to leave out the fact that he himself was also suicidal. 

[He told me that he wouldn't call the cops if I didn't block him] (https://i.imgur.com/phUFWMA.jpg) or [tell anyone about what he was doing] (https://i.imgur.com/RVMJNNv.jpg), and while I complied with the former I did tell my friends about this, who all agreed that I needed to cut contact. 

What followed after that was him constantly saying very worrying things, [implying that he could find me] (https://i.imgur.com/lxY9dtD.jpg), [pressuring me into calling] (https://i.imgur.com/lAEbuo8.jpg), [giving him another chance] (https://i.imgur.com/L5Cb8Jx.jpg) and [getting back into a relationship] (https://i.imgur.com/17LbGY4.jpg), [refusing to let me cut contact] (https://i.imgur.com/73E1w89.jpg), lulling me into a false sense of security by claiming that he would leave me alone before going right back to messaging me, [claiming that what I did to him was worse and insulting me for believing otherwise] (https://i.imgur.com/itYHe0Z.jpg), and at one point he even [tried to pressure me into showing him my breasts] (https://i.imgur.com/uXncLu1.jpg). He would also sometimes [compliment me out of nowhere] (https://i.imgur.com/vrOl5qT.jpg) or just [spout random nonsense] (https://i.imgur.com/GvncY3k.jpg). [He also stated that I was closer to him than my friends] (https://i.imgur.com/elPmo8I.jpg) and that he [cared about me more than anyone] (https://i.imgur.com/KfMx0jG.jpg), all the while making sure that I knew that he could make me do whatever he wanted me to ([1] (https://i.imgur.com/jy4Wfjd.jpg), [2] (https://i.imgur.com/fk4DnUB.jpg)).

It was all just pure chaos, and for a while I was too scared to do anything against him before I finally gained the courage to block him again, but not without explaining myself and apologizing for my mistakes. He then messaged me on the forum saying he wouldn't bother me again. However, ever since that occurrence my anxiety has skyrocketed. I go through every day fearing that one day he could just suddenly change his mind, find me, and call the cops or whatever else he may want to do. 

I'm also worried that he's not truly done messing with me. At one point I was messaged a few times by a Reddit user, and I had my suspicions that it was him due to the account being new, talking to me out of nowhere, and having a similar personality and interests. However, I haven't received any messages from the account in a while and have no proof of the person's identity. 

Recently however, he somehow found one of the servers I own and joined it. One of my friends managed to get him to leave, but it was a very nerve-wracking experience for the both of us. During their conversation my ex stated that my friend didn't know the whole story. My ex was trying to manipulate my friend into letting him explain his side, and also continued to claim that he threatened to call the cops because I was suicidal, still choosing to leave out his own suicidal ideations. He's clearly not as over our relationship as he claimed to be, and the fact that he's still attempting to force himself back into my life is very concerning. 

I've been trying to be happy. Despite my anxiety I've been trying to have a more optimistic mindset and no longer plan on killing myself. However, this paranoia is taking over everything and making it to where I can't truly enjoy myself without fearing the worst. Nightmares, anxiety attacks, and crying out of fear are all common occurrences for me. I'm too scared to do anything that may provoke him, and despite most of the friends I've explained this to recommending that I go to the police, I feel like it would only make matters worse. If my grandmother were to find out about my previous suicidal thoughts and plans she would get me back into the mental hospital and may also potentially take my internet away since she's threatened the same for less severe reasons. Without my laptop I have little to nothing to distract myself from my daily worries and pain, so getting the authorities involved is not preferable.

I want to be able to forgive myself for what occurred and fully move on from him, but after all this time I'm still unable to do so. I haven't had good experiences with the many therapists I've talked to in the past and I hate relying on medications, so I'm not sure what to do. Sometimes I even question if maybe I deserve this daily emotional torment.

Again, any comments or advice pertaining to how I could potentially move on from all this would be appreciated.",13May2019,2

167,"Sorry for the long post. TLDR: I don't like to interact with people unless they validate me or represent some utility, don't seek out social engagements, never had a close relationship with anyone in my life, don't have a strong attachment even with people who might consider me a friend.

I'm a 21 year old male currently in college, and I have some questions about why I think and act the way I do. I've never been popular by any means, in fact I've never actually had a strong friendship in my life, from elementary through high school I wouldn't even say I ever actually had anyone I would consider a friend, only kids that would talk to me for some reason and I told my parents I was friends with. My patents would make us hang out, always against my will, as I never actually enjoyed being around them, some people I actively hated, but never cared enough to tell them to fuck off. Despite all this, I still had people who would seek put a relationship and talk with me for some reason.

The thing is, I would prefer that nobody actually interact with me, I never sought out any relationship with anyone. I never sought out anyone, never went up to them, never texted first or instigated a conversation, only responded so I wouldn't seem rude. 

Even in college, there are a few people I hang out with, but I would never go so far as to say I enjoy their company. I feel like I spoke more than just responding to things directed towards me, but only if I felt that doing so would ""benefit"" me in some way, like if it was a clever or well informed and would make me look smart or funny. I feel bad that all I care about from people who may even consider me a friend is that they continue to validate me. I feel like I'm using them, and that they don't really mean anything to me beyond their utility, and that doesn't feel right.

Even when one of them texts me, my first instinct is to ignore it completely and never interact with it, but I feel bad and eventually respond because I don't want them to feel like I'm ignoring them or don't want to talk (I don't). I hate having to respond to things because I would rather nobody ever interacted with me in a personal way, and only ever respond out of guilt or courtesy. 

Someone I have known since freshman year and have spent a lot of time with is trying to reach out and try to interact with me more often, even trying to get me interested in a Video game he plays, but I feel like it's too much effort to actually care or do anything with him because I really don't care about him, I feel like I should feel guilty about that, but I don't, I don't want to interact with him, but I feel like ignoring his existence (I would prefer to) is wrong.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I can't really afford to pay someone to actually figure out what's wrong with me because that never helped with anything else that's wrong with me. Are there any mental heal or relationship experts who have anything to say?",13May2019,2

170,"Hi,

So today me and my partner had a little heart to heart after an argument. Long story short theybe said that they dont feel anything most of the time. Almost complete apathy. 

It kills their sex drive and social skills and after probing them they said it made them feel nothing for me when they had these bouts of apathy. No love or anything. It sounded like depression to me. Obviously this is horrible to hear but ive had mental health issues in the past and overcame them so i'm confident they can too.

Only problem is they dont want to go to the doctor. They said they cant be bothered and they dont want to take any pills to get better. Any ideas what to do? I love them deeply and they reassured me they loved me too when not in these apathetic episodes but i cant force them to go the doctor, nor can i indefinitely stay in a relationship with someone refusing help who only loves me 30% of the time. 

Any help appreciated, thanks.",13May2019,2
171,"This is long winded and twisted around, I tend to ramble, especially when I've been putting things off for years.  


I know NORMALLY people would ask their primary care doctor, but I don't even know my primary care doctor, as I've only been to them once. Or I guess either of my primary care doctors, because apparently when my last doctor moved, my insurance assigned me another random doctor despite me putting through to just be moved to another doctor in the same office.  Just some new random name on the insurance card I received a few weeks ago.  I'm not sure what's up with that, and want to work on finding a therapist before I call to find out why that happened.  


My first card with this insurance had a mental healthcare number. My subsequent cards have not.  The number in the health pamphlets keeps changing. That's why I'm not comfortable trying to get one through insurance directly. They're a big clusterfuck.  


As for my primary care, I'm not comfortable asking her for several reasons other than the above ""I've only met her once I don't know her that well,"" and this is because, all my paperwork says that my parents are allowed to know everything I talk about with her. And I don't want to change the paperwork overall. But she's also my father's doctor.  If I ask her I'll have to say why.  If she or a nurse forgets that I requested that be not discussed like everything else could be, it would be bad.  


I'm in my late 20s. I live with my parents, dropped out of college to not waste money when I couldn't decide on a major.  My income is from my dad, I work maintaining our multiple properties, it's an under the table job. I have some paranoia and a severe issue with making eye contact with people, and that has made me too nervous to even go apply to any real jobs for the last 6+ years.  That's some of what I need to talk about, but my stopping factor in just asking the doctor for a referral is that I've been struggling with gender dysphoria for just as long. I'd intended to get my degree and a good job before coming out, but then I realized I was horrible at the initial major I picked, and the second one, and I dropped out. My dad's very conservative. I can't face him with it. I know I have to eventually, but I can't, not before I've got my own, stable life. I'm too afraid. But I'm in no mental state to go job hunting as I am before getting any help either, especially since I was offered a job without asking earlier this year, told they had me specifically in mind for it even, but got ghosted. It put my confidence back in the grinder.  


I need help, but I can't go through the usual channels. I need help, but I'm too nervous to just call around. I need help, but I'm afraid I'll end up with the wrong kind of person who will have me committed or sent to some kind of conversion therapy somewhere, but I'm also afraid of the opposite, someone who won't listen and will just agree with what I have without questioning it, just put me on drugs until I'm happy enough to move out and come out.  Despite not being my only problem or the most immediate since I want to move out, my dysphoria is my biggest issue, the biggest thing that I want to know the therapist's track record on before I attend.  Especially as I know that I would need a therapist of some sort to sign off if and when I seek treatment for that.  I don't know what to do, I don't know where to start.  My local area is progressive and conservative at the same time, you can never be sure who's what, and on both sides of the extremes. I know that's not supposed to affect their professionalism, but I can't help but be terrified either way.  I never even realized how divided things were around here until I had realized my dysphoria. I'm so hyper aware of it, but I was always paranoid about things even before that.  I don't know what to do.  I've got paranoia, some kind of inferiority complex, I'm suffering from the aftershocks of a toxic friendship being ended that I somehow didn't even comprehend was toxic until they cut me off, depression and issues with stress since high school. I have so much that I need counseling for. I have a decent support group of friends but I can only put so much weight on them without making myself feel even worse for doing so. I've even ended up calling myself worse than that toxic friend that cut me off, and lots of time had to be spent convincing me otherwise.  That's not healthy to deal with for them or me.  


I know there's no definite way anyone here can help me, there's not gunna be a ""Oh yeah, my therapist is seeking clients, and I'm in the same areas as you!"" Especially as I'm not even giving my area.  But I had to start somewhere, somewhere I could say everything I need to say.",13May2019,1
172,"***being kind and putting the tldr at the top. 
Have had a few vivid dreams haunting me. I'm having a hard time handling interactions outside of my personal bubble, including entertainment. I worry about my ability to be loved.



I didn't know where else to put this, I have been diagnosed with multiple mental health issues. I am being treated for them as well.
I feel like I cant control my emotions anymore. It's almost to the point to where I don't want to interact with the outside world anymore, including, movies, TV, reading, or interacting with people in person or otherwise.  I'm going to start with this- I have vivid dreams. I have only had about five that have haunted me, two about death, three about pregnancy/children. The first one was about the death of my father. I had the dream around 2004, he passed 2010. When I had the dream it felt so real that I called everyone I knew to get ahold of my dad. His wife at the time told me he was okay, but that wasn't good enough for me. I needed to hear it from him. I finally got ahold of him, all I could do is cry. I could barely catch my breath. I was so relieved that he was okay, but was still trying to recover from the dream. I don't remember if I told him any details of the dream or not. There were some parallels between the dream and what happened in real life. I of course was there in both situations, It was always his heart as the cause. He was right outside the vehicle (dream-car/IRL-suv).   There were some differences as well (which I am thankful for, I don't know If I would have survived if it would have been identical.) He had remarried, so she was there too. The season and time  of day were different (dream-summer mid-day/IRL- Christmas eve early evening). 

I have also have had a death dream about my grandmother, thankfully she is still alive (the dream of her wasn't as detailed as my father's,  I just was aware in the dream she had passed). I know it's coming soon. She has told me herself that she is ready to go. She is my grandmother on my father's side. She has basically been ready since not long after that.

I have had two dreams about me being a mother. One to a baby girl, and one to a little boy. I'll be honest, I've been able to block out the memory of their names. I don't how, but It has made it less traumatic in a way. I have no children in real life. I have never planned on having any- I have always planned to adopt, but I have to find a way to get better first (I was raised by bipolar parents- different variants, I don't want my experiences to be theirs.) In each dream, these were my children, my babies. In my mind I had birthed them and was raising and nurturing them. When I woke up from each of these dreams I thought I was a mother of these children. Once I was fully awake and realized what was going on, both times I mourned my dream child. I felt as If my heart was ripped out of my chest. As I have gotten older, in a weird way I feel like they still exist... well I really hope they do and that they are happy.

This brings us to my most recent dream. I dreamt that a friend of mine was pregnant. I hadn't visited with her in about four months, as she stays busy.I stewed over this dream for a few days. I asked her today because it was driving me crazy. She was...but miscarried.  I felt beyond guilty for asking. I didn't even know she was trying. I only asked because I figured the answer would be different. I just wanted to close that door in my mind. 

One of the other reasons I want to shut the world out is because everywhere I look lately, there is death, violence, physical pain, emotional pain, and believe it or not anything about earth shattering love. The kind of love that keeps you going. The feeling of being safe in each other's arms. As long as you have each other,  nothing else matters. I know that kind of love only exists in a vacuum. It doesn't make me desire that feeling any less. I love my partner, don't get me wrong. Sometimes I think it might be because I don't think I deserve that feeling, or maybe because I'm the only romantic person in his life ever. I don't really know.",13May2019,1

After all things I read I connected a type called **covert narcissist** to myself since I thought it's features matched me . When I went to psychologist again I discussed about it with him but he made it pretty clear to me that I was not really a covert narc  because I did not answer clean ""Yes"" even once when he was  reading qualities from a DSM list or something like that. I can't really understand it because I noticed that :

\- It makes me happy when I see my friend fail/ ''perform'' worse than me ( It's like Im hoping he does fail so I am superior),

\- I need that constant attention- superiority feeling to feel better than usual,

\- I can't stand losing in anything I am concerned about (Mostly In comparision to that ""best"" friend of mine, also to the other colleagues sometimes) because I find it humilating to lose to  ye, a  ""friend"" who's worse than me ( I think he is by information I have about him) and should always be.

\- I find it hard to show ""personal"" emotions, empathy, hugging makes me feel uncomfortable. I am also frustrated when I see people worse than me (uglier, dumber) having more success in their social life, I find it unfair.

 What is more, in the past when I had more good friends (not just 1 like now), I did make others insult/not like such friend just because I felt offended in some way( those targetted friends never saw me as guilty because I was the ""nice and loyal one"") or for some other irrelevant reason just to feel superior/have some drama - this  happened to almost all my ""best"" friends  from the past (around 5times) and it always resulted in such relationship ending. There was even one girl-friend who seemed like falling in love with me but I was too ""frozen"" to do sth about that. Back then I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing but now I am and it makes me think a lot about it. I noticed that my best friend who I compare myself to way too much has really dropped his overall life hapiness since we became friends, wouldnt he be a narcisstic victim then?  If I am not a introvert version of narcisst  then what it might be?",13May2019,1
180,We’re very open with each other about our issues and our feelings but yesterday we did molly together and ended up having sex. I was a virgin before hand and I had always had a bit of a crush on her but she’s older than me. I’m 16 she’s almost 19. I have been clean from heroin for 3 and 1/2 months and I’ve been prescribed lithium as well for 2 months. It has really helped my overall well being but I’m not used to being so not in control of my feelings. I think about her a lot and I don’t know if she feels the same way. It’s embarrassing because she’s so beautiful and I’m just me. I don’t think I’m ugly but I know she could definitely do better. I’m just confused,13May2019,0
181,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I feel this is the only place I really can. Yesterday I (13) was just laying in my bed watching YouTube and I started to think about all the things I’ve taught about with other people and all of them was me trying to tell the person that I’m right and stuff related to that. If I don’t get my way I get really mad, if somebody says they like someone better than me I get highly annoyed and I’ve done a lot of things to manipulate people into thinking my opinion is right or I’m better than someone else. I’ve kinda started to realize this the past few months and I’ve been like this since as long as I can remember. I don’t really know how to explain things the best right now but that’s all I have.",13May2019,3

What happens when you have a  Diagnosis of Substance abuse (\*)?

What does the (\*) mean?

Can i get this diagnosis removed from my records?

Can   i still be prescribed amphetamines for my ADHD or is there a law   against that? The diagnosis was given to me after going to the E.R. for   meth use. I am not an addict i just experimented and have always been  honest with my doctors.

The last year has been strange, my migraines have gotten worse yet at the same time they're no longer the main issue. I started off the new school year pretty normal, didn't skip a single day of the first week because of my migraines, which to me seemed like a great start. I was so wrong. As soon as the next week started I started skipping more and more days, a lot of them were no longer because of migraines but because I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to the hellhole they call school. To me it seemed like I had no motivation, to others I seemed lazy. By December I stopped going to school completely. I couldn't get myself to go, I fought with my mom to the point where she physically and mentally hurt me to try and get me to school and get my life back together. It didn't work, I was crying and yelling at her in the car, having a panic attack at the same time. By the time we got to my school and I got everything yelled out she saw that I was in no condition to go mentally, if I'd go I'd snap at the first person who'd say hi to me.

Christmas break passed, I was ready to go back to school, I felt mentally ready to take it on and get myself together. Turns out a geomagnetic storm also decided to pass by that day and it gave me such a migraine that I was holding onto my head like it was about to explode. Even the most strongest migraine pill we had did absolutely nothing. And so I never got to school after that day. I've been trying for months. Went to a few therapists and still going to see them to this day. On top of my migraines and inability to get myself to school or even to study, I was diagnosed with social anxiety which could even be to the level of social phobia. My brother doesn't understand it and thinks I'm just lazy. Despite the fact that I had a panic attack when he asked me to keep an elderly relative occupied until he got back home. 

I have a few other mental problems but these are the ones affecting my everyday life in ways that it's a nightmare to deal with. I have gone to the point where I have to repeat 8th grade because I just can't take the stress of catching up with everything by August. I'm also quite scared of the future. If I repeat 8th grade I'll have to graduate at the age of 20 (just how things work in my country) and then University on top of that. Everyone always says to live life to the fullest, but how can I do that if I am supposed to spend my teenage years plus 2 first years of my legal adulthood in highschool? Even though school is no longer mandatory after 9th grade, I can't get any good job without graduating from highschool and working in retail or fastfood also isn't possible due to my social anxiety. I already get anxious when a cashier asks me if I want a bag, how am I supposed to work in a job where communication is one of the most important things?

I just want to live a normal life with no depression, no anxiety and no migraines.

Right now life isn't necessarily feeling the best for me, getting out of bed to go to school is a challenge every morning and I never have motivation to do anything, even the things I find fun.

There are no mental health officials near me that will help a random teenager for free without their parent and if I told my parents my step-dad that insults me about everything I do will probably just brush it off and tell me to get over it.

Was wondering if anyone here had some useful info about how to get some anonymous mental health tips whether you can give them to me straight in the comments or link me to some websites or something.",13May2019,1

I was so happy to be moving across the country and now I’m terrified to move because I know they live there and study near to where I’m supposed to go to study.
