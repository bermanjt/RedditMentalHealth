0,"Just quick question like the title says. I've suffered from anxiety, depression, panic attacks and self harm I've had a psychologist once question if maybe I've got bipolar but nothing rather I moved away and changed psychologist, I definitely have hills and valleys when it comes to highs and lows both without any reason I can't explain when someone asks why I'm happy or depressed, with the highs I sometimes feel I could jump out of a plane and survive without a parachute and then when I'm depressed it normally jumps to more of a suicide thinking. 
Any suggestions would help thanks.",15Apr2019,0
1,"I've been having these extremely powerful intrusive thoughts lately. I've been having them since about May of last year, but they've been increasing in intensity over the last few weeks. I usually only used to get them a few times per week, whenever I did something shameful/embarrassing/dumb. But for a few weeks now, they've been playing on a loop in my head almost constantly. It's really scary and I feel exhausted having to fight them off 24/7. 

The thoughts are:

1. Visions of committing suicide via slitting my wrist. I had a self-harm addiction back in 2013, but haven't cut for years and I don't want to start again. The urges to cut are SO strong lately, it's difficult to keep fighting them constantly.
2. ""I want to kill myself."" and ""I want to die."" These play on a loop in my head and it's so disturbing.
3. Visions of me vomiting. I had bulimia for years and I've been mostly recovered for a while now. It makes sense that the urges are back for this because that was what I used to cope with scary feelings.

Basically, I'm scared. I don't want to act on any of these thoughts. They're just SO disturbing and cause a lot of unease. I'm wondering what started this... Part of me thinks it's because I stopped using my eating disorder as a coping mechanism, so now my brain is like SELF-HARM!!! That's what happened when I tried to recover many years ago. Part of me thinks that maybe it's because of stress from getting a second job a few weeks ago. Maybe it's a number of things. All I know is that I'm really freaked out. I don't have friends to talk to and I don't want to worry my family because they have severe anxiety. What can I do? SOS",15Apr2019,2
2,"I deal with a lot of negative thoughts. 
My brain tries to convince me that i'm doing something wrong with nearly everything I do. And it's really starting to become a hindrance on everyday life. I'm unmedicated, but was once medicated. They have gotten a lot worse since I got off them. However I would prefer to deal with them instead of going back on meds.
I literally cannot do anything without my brain saying ""

""oh, so you're feeling this, or you want this, or oh you wish this"".
They're so strong that I feel them everywhere. In my eyes, in my hands.

I know that they're not true. But even typing that my brain tries to tell me that they are. Asking for help. Please drop any advice you think could help, or has helped you.",15Apr2019,1
3,"TW: child abuse

Alt account because my primary account has a poorly-chosen username that resembles my real name lol.  

My girlfriend wasn't at church this morning.  She texted me later and said basically that last night she'd had really bad trauma-related nightmares for the first time in a very long time.  She was sexually abused during her childhood (we're both in our 20s now), and although she's grown so much into a wonderful, fun-loving, bubbly woman, I know trauma like that doesn't just disappear forever.  She continued on to say she needed alone time and apologised that she'd be missing something we were going to do together after church.    

I responded and said that she needn't be sorry in the slightest, it wasn't her fault, and that she'd just had a horrible experience so of course she needed time to herself and I or anyone else would feel the same in her position.  I said to let me know if she wanted me to bring her food or something after I got out of church, and also tried to make clear that if not, that was fine, as I understood that she needed time and privacy.  I also told her that if she ever wanted to talk, I'd be there to listen, and if she needed anything, to not hesitate to ask.  

She hasn't replied yet, but that's fine; like I said, I respect her need to deal with this on her own.  (I probably won't bring her food lol; usually I'll show up with something if she misses church due to feeling under the weather, but I figure this is pretty different from waking up with a headache, and I'm unsure that my spontaneous presence - with food she might not necessarily want to eat - would be helpful in this particular case.  I don't want her to have to cook while she's feeling down already, but I trust she knows what she needs better than I would.)

Thing is, I have no idea what I'm doing.  We've known each other several years and been together several months, and although I knew about her past before we started dating, this is the first time that she's told me about something like this happening.  I'm also not the most emotional or empathetic person lmao (indeed, she often teases me that I should go into the field of psychology, knowing it's one of the last things I could see myself doing) so I'm awkward in these situations and worried about making a faux pas.  I want to support her but I also respect that I need to balance that support with her need for privacy.  But I have no idea how best to achieve that balance, short of just saying 'I'm here for you' and letting her take the lead.  

What are some things I can say, things I should keep in mind, and/or ways I can support her, either in terms of this specific incident or in general?  And on the flip side, what are some things I should definitely avoid saying, both now and in the future?",15Apr2019,1
4,"My girlfriend was taking a call on her parents home phone and needed me to write out details of someone’s address and phone number.

8,"Sorry if this seems wrong, but I wanted to share something I realized.

Back in the early 2000s, during elementary, before internet and social media being a huge thing. I was bullied etc. Emotionally hurt and such that I wanted to take away my life. Suicide and bullying tho was never in the media so I had no idea what i was going through and how to handle it. But because of that, I just kept to myself and stayed calm and cried my emotions away.

If social media was big at my time I would have probably be influenced enough to really off myself at the time. 

So a message to those who are still in the fight: Stay away from social media if you are feeling down. Its enough that you're fighting a battle within yourself. Seek help through friends and family if you can. If not, just stay with yourself and bunker up. Don't let things that might make it worse get to you.

My mental health is being deeply affected by my upcoming wedding (it's not until January.)  I am excited, but this same excitement is triggering my anxiety.  I don't want all this attention on me and coupled with the fact that I feel some of my future in-laws are being extremely over bearing, a pattern I can see developing and persisting into future events, I am finding myself unable to sleep, crying constantly, feeling unworthy and panicking over everything.  I'm not sure how much of the current anxiety/depression symptoms are caused by the wedding or just because it's been a long hard winter or combination of both.

I don't know what else I can do.  Exercise, a balanced diet, and meditation are all part of my current coping strategy.  I have a pretty good support network, and  I don't want to be on medication.  Are there any other suggestions people can make to help manage my current state?",15Apr2019,3

12,"Ok, so I have this compulsive tendency to ""kill"" myself mentally when I get anxious. This only happens whenever I remember something either embarrassing or bad that I did in the past. Mainly, something I deeply regret.

So, as a minor example, one time as a kid when I told on some classmates for doing something wrong. They got detention, found out it was me, and for a while the class (even a girl I had a crushed on) saw me as a traitor to them. 

When these kinds of thoughts occur one of several things happen: 

A) I take my hand, do the gun shape, place it against my head and ""pull"" the trigger. 

B) I, loudly, say to myself ""You should just fucking kill yourself"" repeatedly. 

C) Some combination of the two.

All of these somewhat relieve my anxiety. At least, until the next  intrusive thought.

15,"Hello,

Not sure if this is a welcome post here or not, and as a disclaiming I’m obviously not searching for some sort of diagnosis.

I’m 19M, and I’ve always been an emotional person. I don’t burst out crying at things, but I am more emotional than you’re average dude. I let myself cry, I feel empathy for a lot of people, I care. Maybe As a result of this emotional-ness, I get sad a lot. I let things bother me, and I let them fester. I cannot move on from a lot of things, they just keep coming back.

I don’t know. I’m sad a lot, I feel lost sometimes but I also feel like I’m in control of myself and I feel healthy. I’m active, I workout in the gym and practice Brazilian jiu jitsu 4 times a week each, and I do just about as good a job of the next 19 year old guy on eating and sleeping well.

Depression has a history in my family, and me being sad so much had me thinking for a while that maybe somethings wrong with me. I’m not a super social person, I don’t make connections with people, I can’t trust people and I am sad a lot. I’ve been told my people that are close to me that I should get help, but I don’t feel like I have mental health issues. I just feel like an emotional dude and I don’t see why there’s a problem with that. Obviously I wish I wasn’t sad as often as I am, but I think that’s just who I am. When I’m happy about something, I’m probably gonna show it more than you’re average guy too. It’s just me. 

I don’t know, I guess I’m sick of feeling and being told I’m different/have problems. I was wondering if maybe people with more experience seeing people with real mental health problems can tell me if some of my personality traits are indicative of anything.

18,"I was scrolling through a facebook chat with my friend and felt the urge to print 6x4s of a bunch of the photos I'd taken and sent to her.

After this I went through my tagged photos and my personal albums. Collectively I have 111 photos I wish to print of varying types, mostly group shots, and some artsy pretentious ones I like. I like pretentious art, sue me.

&amp;#x200B;

And a thing I noticed while going through them, was that they brought up a lot of negative emotions. Yet I look happy. In the group shots I'm in. I was the unofficial photographer for a lot of them. So I don't actually appear in many unless it's a group selfie.

&amp;#x200B;

And in going through these, I've been reminded of the sheer aching loneliness I felt and still feel 24/7. And in hindsight, how very very depressed I was. I knew I was depressed at the time but I just didn't realise quite how bad, nor how long ago it stems.

I'm still printing these photos, partly because I've already clicked ''order'', but also I hope that having physical copies will allow me to breathe through the emotions. I can look at them immediately rather than having to scroll back five years on facebook. Each of my photo albums has around 200-300 photos. I've pared down 5 years into 111 -- including some family ones from before that.

&amp;#x200B;

In so many group photos I'm with what could be considered friends, and yet it feels as though everyone was friends with everyone else and simply tolerating me. But then I didn't help the situation. I offered to take the group photos because 'I don't like my photo taken'. Whereas I now realise that was in part a defense mechanism. I didn't want to be part of a group photo and not feel like part of that group. Which alienated them further without my realising.

&amp;#x200B;

It's incredible to look at what I consider my formative years, the ones where I developed my 'personality'. And feel shame, regret, and a longing sadness. Because sadness/numbness/hollowness was safe, I knew where I stood. And now I'm on anti-depressants. Slowly feeling more. Slowly letting myself be happy and enjoy the moments. And it's terrifying. But here's to a more colourful future.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I realised my experiencing depression results in me hiding behind the camera instead of in front of it. And I feel regret.",15Apr2019,1
19," 

I  suffer from depression, suicidal thoughts, extreme social anxiety.  Because of this I self medicate with drugs and alcohol but which keeps  me stable, without it I am I am not a functional person.

What  am I likely to be prescribed by a therapist, if I were to go see one?  The last time I went to one years ago, they gave me a mood boosting pill  or something and told me Id feel different after 3 to 4 weeks of taking  the medicine. I quit after 3 or 4 weeks.

What  I'm really looking for is something to just cut though the edge not  something that will make my brain produce 20% more serotonin then  usually?

It  scares me even back then to imagine using a drug that is dependent on  me using it every day rather then something like adderall or xanax (&lt;  I've never tried it) that will instantly make me feel different where I  can come off it to assess my true emotional state.

21,"I’ve been dealing with a lot these past few years and have been passed around to several different doctors. After getting treated for a variety of mental disorders, this year I finally got my family doctor. I feel afraid to consult her again because I feel like she is going to be discouraged with me. I had stopped a few months prior taking medication (which I had taken for 2 years). I first consulted her for antidepressants which I ended up stopping because I “felt better” after 2 weeks. I was super motivated with school and my life felt like it was back on track. I ended up crashing a few months later after a series of unfortunate events. I consulted again and got a different prescription which I felt again amazing after a couple of weeks and stopped taking. During that time I started engaging in unhealthy drinking, smoking, partying and sex (I was a virgin). However, I felt great. I consulted again because I had decided I needed birth control and told her I wanted to stop my medication (I lied and said I hadn’t stopped it yet but I had). After experiencing more ups and downs in my mood for the past 6 months I’ve determined it might be time to consider a psychiatrist evaluation because my symptoms correlate with bipolar 2. A prior health physician had mentioned I displayed symptoms of BP and BPD but I dismissed it, I wish I hadn’t.
I’m afraid if I consult her again, she is going to judge me because I never take my medication. What if she thinks I’m just being ridiculous and that I’m not actually mentally ill because I’m not taking the pills seriously? I struggle with taking advice from medical practitioners because I was abused by the system and in hospital for a very long time.

I have career goals and I don’t want to stay stuck in a rut forever. I want to make money and form a stable life for myself. The issue here is that I dropped out of school again. Second time. I can’t seem to complete tasks or be productive. Self diagnosis isn’t wise but in the present, my intuition tells me that my lack of skills and incompetence DOES NOT come from depression or anxiety. There’s something more and I suspect it’s ADHD. I’m distracted all the time, heavy procrastination with eating and sleep, out of touch with reality, etc. I have told my therapist twice about being assessed and the topic is brushed off. I finally had the courage to ask him again to be assessed and he tells me he didn’t “want to waste the psychiatrist’s time and your time”. He says I’m normal, I’m progressing with my depression and that my brain needs more time to develop and to head back to school at 25/26 after full development. His beliefs are not aligned with mine. It’s time to search for a new therapist who can help me. I’ve wasted my time telling him all of my symptoms just to get a “wait” response. I cannot wait 5-6 years to start achieving my goals.

I've had a recent medication change that I think has been impacting my mood, so I was having trouble calming down. It's been an issue for me before when I wasn't medicated properly.

I apologized the next morning for being so upset and he apologized for the things he did to upset me, but he doesn't want to see me now. I'm trying to understand him needing space after a fight, but my feelings are hurt.

I always worry about how my mental health will affect my relationships. Even once I get my medication straightened out, this type of thing can still happen occasionally. He shouldn't have to deal with it, and I'm also hurt that he clearly doesn't want to. I suggested a break until I can get my medication sorted, but this is always going to be a part of my life.

About 2 and a half years ago I was struggling immensely mentally and made the decision mid-semester to withdraw from my classes and come home indefinitely. Since I wasn’t doing so well, drugs and alcohol had become my main focus and outlet for escape. One night, I was at my friend’s apartment partying, as I was every night, and some of her friends I had never met came over. My ex, we’ll call Jake, was one of them. The first night of meeting we exchanged numbers and pretty much instantly started “talking.” 

At first, things were fine, or at least what I deemed “fine” at the time. He was 3 years older than me, with no car, in a ton of legal trouble (facing multiple charges for felony offenses), and sold drugs. But hey, easy access to drugs was all that mattered to me then, so this didn’t put me off. If anything, it made it more enticing. 

For the first month or two, our relationship was pretty standard. Texting all the time, going out with our friend groups together, seeing each other almost daily. However, things started changing drastically, and quickly. 

Once the VERY SHORT honeymoon phase ended, I started to see who he really was. All in all, a pretty narcissist asshole. I’ll give some examples to set the stage, but there’s a thousand. 

- Even after months of dating, he refused to leave me alone in his room or apartment with the worry I would steal from him. I’ve never stolen from anyone, and had never given a reason for him to think I would. 
- He would point out my acne, and tell me my make up was doing nothing to help me. My acne had been something I was so self conscious of, and he knew that. Ever since then I have refused to take selfies or appear in group pictures out of fear of my blemishes. 
- When I confided in him the reason I had left my Uni, which was due to a sexual assault, he laughed in my face and told me I could have “grown some balls” and dealt with it. When I told him my plans to return to campus after some hefty mental health help, he stated I had to tell him that day if I was sure I was returning, because then he wouldn’t waste his time dating me. 
- I was a few states away in family vacation when I had learned my grandfather passed. I texted him right away, looking for some comfort, and he read it and didn’t reply. When I inquired as to why he’d ignore me over something so important, he said “if you want better responses from me, send better texts.” I broke up with him after this. 

These are just a few examples of some very shitty things he did or said while we were together. I didn’t realize the abuse or narcissist personality traits we was exhibiting until it was all over, but by then the damage was done. 

Due to the stress of the relationship, piled on with everything else in my life, I lost my appetite. My stomach was always in knots; I was always waiting for the next shoe to drop. If you’ve experienced a narcissist, you know what I mean. 

Long story short, from the beginning of our relationship to the end (which had only been about 7 months even though it had felt like an eternity), I had lost 25 pounds. This may not sound like a lot, but at the start I was 135 pounds and 5 foot 7, and I was now weighing 110. I had always had body image issues, so as much as the weight loss was concerning, and as much as I felt more resentment towards the relationship for letting it affect my health, I found a sick pleasure in it. I felt better in my body and even a little more confident. However, friends, family, and my own therapist started making comments about my weight. I looked unhealthy, and everyone noticed. I didn’t care much, I wanted to stay the weight I was and had a gigantic fear of gaining it back and being 135 pounds again. 

After a few months of getting comments and people trying to shove food down my throat, everyone stopped. My weight loss was no longer the topic of conversation and my mom had actually been convinced (by herself) this was just my “grown up body” and I lost all my “teenager weight.” I now had all the freedom and the control. 

Fast forward to today. I now struggle heavily with anorexia. I only eat 1,000 calories or less a day, I fast from 1 pm everyday until 9 am the next. I’m constantly looking at my body in the mirror and critiquing everything I see. Clothes have to fit me a certain way and show off my “skinny” body or I won’t wear them. I get a “high” from positive comments on my appearance even though at the same time I don’t fully believe them. I always have this urge to look my best and show off my “skinny” body to impress others and seek validation.

It’s been 2 years since my ex and I have broken up. I don’t think about him much and fully realize the person he was/is. Even though I know he didn’t force me to form an ED, I recognize where the abuse and stress led to one. I’ve always struggled with my body so he isn’t fully to blame, but losing the weight I had lost from the stress of him, showed me the body I had always wanted and now will do anything to achieve. 

I’m posting this because I haven’t been doing well lately and just wanted to share this. I’m sluggish, I’m irritable, I’m depressed (nothing new there, though), and I’ve been passing out, or almost passing out, worryingly way too frequently. No one around me knows I have an ED, most just think I “eat like a bird” and “enjoy being healthy.” Naive, I know. I’m sure some suspect it, but not a word is said to me. 

TL;DR: I was in a short, but emotionally abusive relationship that opened the door to an eating disorder. It’s been 2 years since we’ve broken up, and my weight loss from stress in the relationship has blown up into full anorexia-nervosa.",15Apr2019,11
27,"I’m not sure what to say or really do about this but some days feel really surreal and like they’re not actually happening. Today I went to the art museum and I almost forgot about it, I’ve gone out to dinner and don’t really remember even a single conversation that was said at the table. I don’t feel like laughing, I’m not happy but I’m not even really sad either just almost numb. I’ve just kinda felt like it hasn’t actually happened. This happens on a somewhat regular basis, today is just an example. What should I do about this?",15Apr2019,21
28,"The day before a competition, I told myself:

*""Something is going to go wrong... I just know..""*

Normally when I say this, the reassurance of others helps but... this time I didn't just think something was going wrong. I **knew**.

The next day I reviewed my notes, loaded up my calculators, and prepared myself for the competition. I thought to myself: ""Ok. There is no way I can screw this up.""

The test begins. 35 minutes. I flip the pages faster and faster, solving about 5 problems a minute. 19 minutes:
**The Power Shuts Off In the Building**

""Push your tests forward and cease calculator operations. We will begin again shortly."" 

My heart freezes. My mind stops. The whole world went black to me. I look around and insanely laugh to myself. A single tear rolls down my face.

The power kicks back on. We begin the timer again at 19 minutes. I pick up my calculator shakily and look at the test. Everything felt foreign. I looked around and saw everyone else working. I put my hands on my face and place my head on the desk. Single tears slowly stream into my hands.

""Time"". I hand my test in and walk out to the bathroom. I had anoter test to do in which I knew I was going to do bad because of this scenario. In which I did do awful.

My entire day was ruined. I lost everything in a matter of seconds. I meet my academic coach in the vehicle I tell him what happened and started bawling. My eyes burning more and more as if my tears are absolute acid.

He talked to me about how everything is going to be okay, how I got screwed over, and how I'm the most important role on the competition team. I told him if that were true, why so I suck so bad at everything? Why does nobody like me? Why do I get pushed aside? Why am I sent to go find a needle in a needle-less Hatstack?

I cried for an hour. I completely lost it all because of some bullshit that I couldn't control...

---

After all this.. I don't feel like myself. I see my friends as people who didn't care. I can see them, laughing at me. My best friend and love interest didn't care what happened. She didn't even include me or even fucking notice me. Nobody cared.
I was alone.
I was forgotten.
I didn't matter anymore.
I think I am nearing my limit. I think I am going to give up on everything and everyone soon. Not die, but... the mental equivalence of that: Isolation.

I spent everyday sacrificing for the team. For my friends. For **her**. This world has no respect for people like me. We all get fucked from every angle and every corner, and are expected to stand up perfectly upright like nothing ever happened.


I thought they cared.

Quick background: he can’t drive and doesn’t work. He is moody, likes being around people but can’t communicate well to others, real clingy and has a smart mouth. Obsessive seeming. Example he will comment and like every single thing I post of Facebook. Doesn’t spell well. Can’t seem to figure out or understand simple directions. I gave him a password I created for him that was like a six letter word and one number and he didn’t know how to get in with the password. He also seems depressed and runs people off cause he is obsessive and clingy. He has a funny look in his eyes like he isn’t all there. Seems like he is progressively more moody and negative the better I get to know him but then can turn and be real loving.

As soon as I start reading one page my mind starts wandering onto some other things (what should i do about unrelated topics, what will happen if I don't do it, among other things)
This can last up to half an hour without me noticing. 

When I get back to being aware of what i'm doing I end up feeling frustrated about getting distracted again and I try to stop my mind from wandering while I'm trying to understand what i'm reading.

Hi,

so 90% of the time I don't think about my past and just live my life, but recently I have started ruminating about the past. I am not sure what triggers it exactly, part of me thinks that it is because I saw someone from my past on fb, another part of me thinks its because I will be visiting home soon, another part of me thinks that its because I watched 'The Act' and the mother reminded me of my own mum, part of me thinks its because I am not as happy in my relationship as I was, and finally, I think its because I am spending more time alone (and trying to write) as I have my dissertation due in over a week. I had a really depressive spell the summer before last due to me getting too caught up in the past, think: thoughts of suicide, crying, not eating. That was because a boy who I had been dating and who I had been friends with for over a year stopped talking to me. He ghosted me and I became the crazy ex, and it set off a lot of bad memories and a lot of emotional trauma. I had been on my own a lot during this time too and that probably didn't help. While I feel like I have dealt with a few of the issues, I can feel myself thinking about the past and I don't want to end up like I did. I have to get over my triggers, like I will have to face people from my past, go home, deal with my relationships, watch movies starring shitty parents, be on my own for periods of time...like its all apart of life. So, how do I not let the triggers get to me? How do I stop myself going down the depressive rabbit hole? INb4: I tried going to therapy and the woman said 'Maybe you just want to be upset.' Obviously, I didn't go back to her again because it just wasn't helpful and if anything, very rude. So, if anyone has some legitimate tips that would be fab.

36,"My brain has been driving me crazy and I can't take it anymore. I don't know it's from the years of depression but I just want to be left alone. I am constantly remembering times I made a mistake or felt guilty. Constantly punishing myself. Everything is just this constant connection to past memories. 

For example. I went to see a play today with my mother. Had a really nice lunch before hand. The play starts and a character in the play is going to barbecue. So there is some talk about all the different kinds of meat. My mind immediately goes to a time when I fucked up with meat in the story. Was 19, bagger at a jewel. Family comes in and the cart is full of food. Following the rules I am keeping the meat separate from other goods. So there is a separate bag to my right that I add the meat to. They leave and like 5 minutes later I realize I forgot to put the bag of meat in the cart. I felt bad and anxious about it. I can't do anything about it. 11 years later at a play I have this memory replay in my head. 

Just a few minutes ago I saw a post about pretzels. So I get to remember the time that I went to zoo when I was like 10 or 11 with my older brother. I was hungry so I whined till he bought me a pretzel. I didn't even finish it because he made me feel so guilty about that pretzel. I still feel guilty.  I literally just saw the word in the title and I get flooded with this memory.

I can't take it anymore. It's like constant flashbacks to unpleasant moments in my life. Sparked by any random thing.  This can't be normal. What do I do to stop this?",15Apr2019,1
37,"Hey r/mentalhealth,

Hopefully this is the right sub I've tried looking around but anyway here it goes. So I am an 18yr old Male and lost my grandpa about a month ago. Him and I were pretty close and we have a large family that is always together so it is tough on everyone that our chief is no longer with us anymore. He was 87yrs old and left my grandma behind after being married for 63yrs and passing peacefully in his home.

A regular day to day is normal for me, as I am past the heavy grieving stages I think (this is the first death of someone close I've experienced). But when I go to sleep, I am often having dreams that my grandpa appears in. Whether it's just him and I together, or it's a birthday party and he is in it alive and well. 

This doesn't seem too bad but to add onto that I am having a lot of other dreams/nightmares of death. In all different ways, parents dying, me being murdered, me living in eerie world alone with my dog. I am not sure if this is normal or just a phase after someone passes but it is difficult because these dreams occur multiple times a week and are very memorable. 

I would also like to add I am not depressed or sad before bed or during the day, just once I wake up and dwell on the dreams. Do I need to seek help or act to prevent these dreams?",15Apr2019,1
38,"This may be too long and I apologize. 
I’m just wondering which direction I should go. 
8 years ago I was married to someone who just about put me over the edge.  An example would be him all of a sudden deciding he wanted his kids to have the master bedroom (larger) and moved our room to a small room. Then, my kids had to share a room (boy and girl). On top of this, he only had his kids every other weekend. But somehow I was the bitch for even questioning this. 
It didn’t stop there. I remember him looking me straight in the eye with scariest look and would say “I want you out of my house with your kids by next week”. As a single mom, this was so scary to me. He’d say I looked disgusting when I would cry. Or, (this was the final straw) he would say in a taunting almost sarcastic tone, but it wasn’t, “I really can’t stand your son”. And he didn’t. Poor kid. All these years later, I overcompensate for being married to that nightmare. I never knew who I was coming home to. God. It was so bad. 
And all of these years later, depression has kicked in. Not motivated, tired, blah, blah. 
Could it be that I have some sort of PTSD?
And what was he? A narcissist?
I always remember him saying that he always saw himself with a woman in a wheelchair?  I wasn’t in a wheelchair. And why would he feel this? I think to be the “hero”. He always wanted me to feel like he had saved me and I owed him something. He felt entitled to my family’s money. 
I just rambling now. Any suggestions?",15Apr2019,1
39," I really don't know where to start but it's been a hard couple of weeks. Recently my parents found acid tabs in my room and found out I've been smoking pot and sometimes using different drugs like Adderall. That is also the day they found out I cut myself and have been very down and upset. Of course they were raging. They said that I was weak and stupid with no sense of judgment. I agree. Even though it was a really sad experience I appreciate the fact that they put me in therapy because they felt so scared of me.

Today my dad gave me a drug test to do, to make sure I haven't been doing anything. He frequently gives me drug tests now fyi. One of the issues we are trying to fix is the fact that I lie **a lot.** I think I picked up this behavior when I was little, always trying to get away with things. Anyway, I decided to tell them the truth, that I recently used a THC infused lip balm that was from the supermarket. I know, stupid. Even though it didn't include amounts to make you high, I just wanted them to know just in case the test came out positive. I even showed them the lip balm, but it was too late because they were furious at me. My dad called me a 'spoiled brat' for not appreciating their love and support and threatened to stop paying for anything relating to my life, including my schooling. He said he was considering kicking me out, and the thing is I still have two years till college... I took the drug test afterwards and it came back as negative for everything.

Afterwards my whole family had a chat about my behavior. My parents told me that they think that my drug use and mental instability was both because I wanted attention and act cool. I tried telling them that it was a bad coping mechanism I had and I am trying to slowly improve. They told me that crying wasn't going to make them feel bad for me, and told me that they know I never feel bad about anything that happened. They told me I ruined the family. I tried to tell them that a lot of my past drug use had to do with bad stuff that happened to me in the past, and I finally wanted to tell them what my uncle did to me when I was younger . Still, they cut me off because they didn't want to hear a 'sob story' and told me to stop manipulating and twisting things around. Thats when my mom got a plastic bag and started throwing all photos of me away, including baby photos. At this point I was too upset to say anything. All I want is emotional support towards my mental health /drug use and some acceptance that it will take time for me to improve and become healthy and happy again. I am willing to recover, and even though I may have slipped back a little today I am trying. It just hurts when stuff like this happens, and it makes me want to do worse things to myself. This wasn't the last time she's done something like this to tear me emotionally. When she found out I was doing drugs and cutting myself, she threatened to kill me and then kill herself. I want to know how I can talk to them without having them cut me off. I just don't trust them, and they don't trust me. I don't want to hurt them but right now they're hurting me on so many levels. I'm sorry for the long rant, but I just had to get stuff off my chest for once.",15Apr2019,1

51,"I want to share one of the worst days of my life that was brought because of Schitzoaffective disorder. 

I've always been a rational thinker and optimistic type but I've gone through being nihilistic to being depressed to thinking that I was the single savior the earth secretly had because of this disease that was plaguing my mind at the following event I'm about to describe. There was a point in time where I was even diluted enough to think I single-handedly solved the mystery of the existence of God and the existence of soul mates. One of the worst parts was that I was traveling out of state to Portland, Oregon when I was in this existential manic episode and ended up in the psychiatric ward over there because of it.

I remember days prior to flying there vividly. I remember I was talking to one of my best friends about the fact that I thought that I didn't know what was going to happen after going to the concert that we planned to attend because I had rationalized that after seeing this concert that I was going to was going to change my life forever for the better. What I didn't tell my friend was that I had convinced myself that I was going to run off with the singer and live my days in hiding and that I'd secretly get compensation somehow by being some sort of real super ""hero"" behind the scenes. I don't really know how, but I was just convinced it was just going to happen that way. 

I remember the day of heading off to Portland. Taking a shower even felt strange. I didn't do the usual things afterwards like shave or comb my hair properly. I thought I was perfect. I didn't pack any of the clothes I needed for 3 nights of being at Portland. I had relied on what my other best friend has given me to borrow on this trip. 

The plane ride there was another trip as well. I remember being the only one sitting in my row on the right side of the plane. With each moment that passed I  succumbed  to the new delusion that I was proving god's existence in my mind when in reality I was overthinking. I don't quite remember what exactly was bringing me to that conclusion, but it was all too real and the feeling was euphoric. This was the point that I came to the conclusion that god wanted me here to meet my soulmate, the singer that I was going to see. The next delusion was worse than that in my opinion. I convinced myself that I could telepathically communicate with this singer. I remember telling this person what love I felt for them in my mind. I was composed, confident, and thought I was the most invincible one on the plane. 

I just couldn't wait to meet her in person. I didn't do anything crazy like jump out of my seat but I do remember having the direction and the conviction of actually running off with said person.

I remember the day before the concert. I spent almost two hours in the shower trying to convince myself that I wasn't going crazy and that this girl was going to actually meet me inside this restroom in spirit, whatever that meant. My friend was telling me to hurry up and reminded me of the time I was inside of the restroom. For an instant I was snapped into reality and turned off the water. I realized how much water I had spilled out of the tub and only then had I started becoming only slightly concerned for myself. I told myself that I didn't care how much I suffered that night, I was going to see her the next day. At this point, it would have honestly been better to have just taken me to the hospital that night. In bed I remember attempting to fall asleep and not being able to. I popped in headphones and listened to her music and you can only imagine how much euphoria I felt. I began to hallucinate colors on the ceiling with the colors changing to the beat of the music. The lyrics felt as though they were being spoken to only me. After listening to the whole album, I finally fell asleep.

I remember being at the concert so vividly. The concert was held in a church. I was fine at this point. There was nothing in my mind going on other than the fact that I was still convinced that I had some sort of metaphysical connection to this person and that I felt God was literally going to be there attending the concert with me in spirit as well. My friend and I pulled out our tickets and sat down. She finally came out in all of her grandeur after the girl opening for her. She was beautiful. She was everything I had envisioned. One could only imagine the euphoria I was engulfed in when she started singing. One could also only imagine that I'd be jumping out of my seat but I did tell myself that I was going to be the most composed person there. On a side note in the aftermath of this event, my friend told me that I did have trouble sitting still in the event. I don't remember this fact.

After the concert was over, she spoke about being in the back selling her album to fans that wanted to buy. I did want to talk to her and so we got up and I waited in line. For some reason, the security of the establishment was telling me to leave. I didn't know why. It turned out that my friend was telling me to leave because of the fact that I was making others very uncomfortable. Security saw that my friend was struggling so she asked me to leave. After I had refused, she began talking to my friend. I have him to thank for the next moment. In the next moment I was being called by somebody behind me. I turned out the singer from the concert had noticed me and asked me if I had wanted a picture. I'm not sure she took notice of the ordeal or that I was the only one left in the line. I took the picture with the permission of my friend and the guard. As I look at the picture now, I'm not proud of what I see. In the image stands me and her. She's smiling and I'm as rugged and scruffy as I could look. I see the guard and my friend leaving and so I follow. 

As I walk outside, I succumb to another delusion. I thought that I could control time itself and replay the concert. I try to convince my friend that the concert isn't over and that it's barely starting. My friend doesn't know what to do at this point. He tries to get me to get in the car and fails. Security catches this scene unfolding and had called the mental health services. I didn't know it at this point and after a few moments pass, I'm met standing with two medics that tell me that they've received a call. I play ignorant for a moment until another person that tells me that I have a history of mental illness and asks if I could follow him into the ambulance. Surprisingly I do so. I later find myself spending the night at a psychiatric ward. I'm completely oblivious to the situation. There were many things going through my mind, none relating to that singer anymore. 

I was just wondering if I was okay.

In summery of this whole situation. I put my friend through hell because of what I was later diagnosed with. I had made a fool of myself with a person I had admired as a singer. She and other know who I am because of those events. I wish I could take it all back and redo the damage I had done, which was just refusing to leave. Though, even doing that made an impact with what I could do involving supporting her in the future. The people involved with this singer won't even let me support her on patreon because they're afraid of what I might do. I'm harmless. I just needed help at that time. I can't listen to her music anymore without feeling guilt. More importantly I regret putting my friend through that. I wish I had sought help earlier. 

This just goes to show that if you think you're losing it. Talk to somebody. At that moment, there's nothing more important in the world than to do that.",15Apr2019,2

I have this thing where I just want to go back to when I was younger and had that ""spark"" as someone would say. Really I wonder if my emotional state is just a subconscious cry for attention or if I actually have a problem. Is what I'm feeling teenage angst? Should I see a therapist? I just don't know. I have had an easy life so far. I haven't had to try terribly hard in school and not work hard on much. There are so many times where I want to cry but I can't. I just don't know why. I don't have a reason to feel bad. Why do I feel this way? I guess it doesn't help that I hate the way I look. I'm chubby, I'm losing my hair (for whatever reason), and my hairline is complete shit. I'm just glad that my school allows hats so that I can hide my hair. My hair is my biggest point of anxiety. This post is getting too long so I'm just going to wrap it up. Feel free to dm me if anyone has anything to say.",15Apr2019,1

I always have expectations (even though The Bible has taught me to never expect things to happen) my team mates will play good , but it ends up dissapointing me

And believe me, i do other things like, Read, listen to music, even a small workout, maintaining a job , somewhat of a social life , even been playing the MOBA game since 2012 and I'm familiar with almost every factor (Scaling at certain times of the game,Ambushes,Pinging MIA)

And this is why im so stressed out, this game is so addicting i play for the achievement but it only ends up being stress im addicted too, i cant get enough of it, but i made a Pledge, that i would just do things right, and stop living against myself and my stresses

vaped at 12. Smoked weed at 13. Adderall  vyvanse at 14. Alcohol xanax amphetamines benzos at 15. Acid dxm cough syrup at 16 
.
I have been going to therapists since i was like 12, my parents got divorced. Tough shit, no one cares it doesnt matter. When i was 13 i would hold my breath to try and kill myself. I have anti depressants but i would rather just smoke a bowl(of weed). Last year right before my birthday i went to the mental hospital and they said i was crazy, in a psychotic trip i had 5 things in my system.

anyways the whole reason i wrote this is because im planning on killing myself soon. i dont know when but soon, i just need to leave. Sometimes i will just stair at the wall and ask it to kill me. Why cant i just die. Why cant i just be wiped from everyones memory of my existance and let me just not exist.

57,"So I have these friends, who I’ll call J and C, they are dating^-^
C isn’t able to be around much, but I can’t deny they’ve help me tons and I love them dearly.
As for J, they are the one who is practically saving my life.

Recently, as in for the past months, my depression has reached VERY unhealthy levels. I have been taking anxiety/anti-depressant meds, but it feels like I just can’t find a good fit.

A while back, I was in the bathroom with my razor in the tub. I’m not proud of it, and I haven’t told a soul (till now). My support was J and C and my fiancé (My fiancé works a lot and I have a lot of time to myself during days and nights, but she still is very loving and as supportive as she can be). And they were all concerned, especially J, being the only one who truly had an idea what I was going through. 

One day, words were.... bad situation at the time, but I got more stable because of it and we were all able to recuperate...

I started slowly getting more stable. 

But for the past.. two months? Well, I am slipping again.

J is the number one person to basically take care of me... it makes me feel bad that they do... but the truth is... I probably wouldn’t be able to get through this shit without them... 

An example is, they always keeps me as busy as they can... mostly with a video game they love. Basically I don’t have much time to myself... we are trying this new thing where I play with them and voice chat whenever they demand, which is critical because I’m constantly try to torture myself by forcing loneliness and avoiding the world to further hurt myself. 

Recently they have become very good at picking up my signs when I’m slowly flipping the depression switch... I loved that, tonight, they could tell I was about to start going silent... and they forced me to keep talking even if I just made a constant random noise. Which really did help to keep me out of my head!

I don’t think I’m doing a great job here... There are so many examples of J helping me... and I’m not sure how to explain them... but.. J is my best friend. We are very alike. Like siblings. And I don’t think I would be alive without them. 

I wish I could figure out how to show them how much I care for them and appreciate them... I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make it up to them. But I hope I’ll be around to try!
J. I know that you are dealing with a lot of shit in your own life... and I understand if you ever need a break from me... but I just want to say.. from the bottom of my fucking heart... I love you. And I hope we can see this through and be twinsies for life!",15Apr2019,8

So I met this girl online (on Instagram) who is clearly having a bad time.

She lives in an Indian culture (for example her family doesn't believe in the existence of 'anxiety and depression') ,and is very well educated.  
Today I am asking for any therapist that are able to empathize with a girl growing up in such society and are willing to talk to her/ provide her with advice. Like an online helpline of some sorts.  
I am not really verse in online therapy nor suitable to provide actual help to her.  
 I know its kinda a stretch, but I am wondering if it's free, since we have it free in Australia. Sorry for sounding like a choosing beggar. If online services costs money, then please tell me so I can delete this post

61,"Constantly worried about people watching and judging me. I’ve made this a lot better recently, seems more like insecurity than anything else but I don’t know. 

Hearing clicking/cracking sounds in my head when I move it/tense it up. I can seem to make them disappear if I tell myself they aren’t real. Then again I could just be moving a muscle somehow. 

In the past, due to drama, I have worried about friends conspiring against me and trying to “undermine” me. 

Starting to worry about if I’m hallucinating things or if they’re real. But this could be (it honestly probably is) paranoia because of that head cracking stuff and me worrying about going schizophrenic.

No voices in my head or visual hallucinations.

I spend a lot of time on my own watching YouTube and movies, but this isn’t new. I do go out and have a good circle of friends. I have angry outbursts sometimes (especially when I get drunk at parties), have anxiety issues that I’m working on, and can have some minor depression at times. I feel like I’m hiding behind a mask a lot of the time and trying to make myself act normal or acceptable. Then again, most teens act like that. 

When I’m on my own, I can act very strange at times and frequently have tick-like outbursts where ill say random gibberish and spaz out in bizarre ways. It’s satisfying to me, like I’m releasing built up energy. This isn’t new, and I have full conscious control over it. But the desire to do it remains. 

In the past I had delusions that I was special and above others and unique in some form and would change the world in some way. Then again, a lot of people have these beliefs, and it could just stem from how I was raised, believing I was special and not another one of the crowd. These delusions I have since silenced and don’t believe anymore. 

I’m just worried about this maybe being something that could develop into something worse. 

Now that I’ve written this I think I’m just being paranoid, but I’ll still post it.

62,"I’m on my last year of undergraduate school and I’m exhausted. I’m currently a biomedical science major and have always loved (mostly) everything science and medical related but I’m at loss now. 

In high school, I over exhausted myself especially my senior year. I was president of the science national honor society, held positions in two other clubs, took 6 AP/AICE classes and did this MAJOR project for a scholarship where we did a year long research paper and presented it to an audience. Mine was on the effects of psychoactive drugs on adolescents. After graduation, I had a summer off and went straight into college. 

I’ve spent EVERY SINGLE SEMESTER in school, full time, including summer. I’ve always taken summer classes because 1) I needed to for financial aid purposes and 2) I wanted to finish quicker. I’m technically supposed to graduate this semester but due to me taking on a minor in psychology and failing classes, I’m pushed on a year. I’m only doing school work and haven’t gotten involved really at all.

But here’s my problem, I’ve always loved this field and I don’t know what else I could major in. But because of how drained I am, how exhausted I am, I’ve been losing motivation and that dedication for awhile now. I’ve lost the confidence in myself and I feel like I’m trying to accept failure as my option. I don’t believe in myself because at this point, I’ve failed certain classes multiple times and just feel like I’m wasting my time and money now for a biomed degree that will be useless to me because no one will accept me with my academic history for graduate school. Granted my overall GPA is a 3.2, but my science GPA isn’t too hot. But 30k in debt and continuing, and not a real chance or shot at medical school, let alone PA school i feel so discouraged and so helpless that I feel myself shutting down. I have an exam at 10:30 for immunology - a class I’m retaking and need to pass but so far I’m not - and I haven’t studied at all. I’m so overwhelmed that I’ve ultimately shut down and I’m just telling myself “well better luck next time” because at this point, why try when I’ve already failed? Something I was sooooo passionate about, I’ve just lost all interest in. 

Not to mention, I’ve also suffered with depression and anxiety, went through a hard break up about 3 months ago - who was my first love - so I’m even feeling alone. I was thriving when I was in the relationship because I was working on myself to build a future for us but when I’m alone, I just don’t find the motivation because it’s like I don’t care about myself so I’ve given up. And honestly I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should take a break from school for a bit and then come back? Just push through because its my last year and it’s too late to switch?

65,"When I was 16, I got my first job at a movie theater during a summer where I was very depressed. I thought to myself ""If I get a job, I can keep my mind busy, and I can get money and with that gain more freedom to do things that make me feel happy"". I was wrong, because although I knew I had social anxiety before I got that job, working at that theater made me realize how severe it is. It drove me to feeling suicidal for months. Even after I caved and quit, it made me even more depressed because I was guilty. Guilty for letting my coworkers/managers down, guilty of disappointing my parents for getting a job and not even lasting 2 months, and guilty for myself for not having the emotional strength to get through it and tough it out. Flash forward to last year when I was 19 and the same issue occurred. Got a job as a stocker at Walmart.  It was a carbon copy of what had happened at the movie theater. Driven to suicidal thoughts again.

I showed them the intro of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice because I’m like that but not as extreme. I wanted to let them know how I feel, you know? Give them an idea of what’s going on. He blamed the video game - he asked me when I started playing the game and when I first starting hearing these voices. 

I think he’s just worried, because his mother heard voices and got shock treatment for it. Perhaps he thinks I’m going to get the same treatment if I end up going to a psych ward. But I really don’t think that’ll be the case; the voices are still telling me to go to a psych ward. 

The only thing I’m worried about is getting fired for going to a psych ward. I don’t know how long I’d be there for. I guess that’s something I have to talk to my boss about.

When I was 14, I attempted suicide, and my life has been mostly downhill from there until recently, but during that time I was constantly depressed and I eventually self-harmed.

Eventually I came to rely on it just to feel my usual garbage self, I would do it twice or three times a week, I would feel exhausted and irritable if I hadn't done it in a week. Sometimes I would last a whole week and a half managing to force myself not too, but even when things were better, I would still get the urge to and give in to that urge.

81,"

I realised that I’ve never shared the true extent of my mental illness with anybody or my story so I’d really like to at least share it here.

I have an eating disorder which ruined my life. I think it started when I was 4-5 I remember my parents restricting my food intake because I had some health problem, and 6-10 i was a slightly chubby kid which was completely normal for a child, however not so for my parents so they kept restricting me, sometimes “lovingly” calling me chub or something which in return triggered a lifetime of not feeling good enough. 

I was supposed to be so so lucky. I come from a part of Russia which is in the middle of nowhere. It was poor, it was dangerous, people were simple and not very intelligent and no one got anywhere special in life. But one day my father started a business which took off quite nicely nothing huge but it was enough to send me to a boarding school in another country, so when I was 8 I was sent away to a Swiss school. How lucky right? Out of all the people who will never see beyond that sad city I was the one who was given the opportunity to get an amazing education and go places! Only It didn’t go that way. 

I was a poor kid sent to a rich world where “chubbiness” was only a thing accepted in men. Where having no money made you less, and made it more difficult to make friends. Now all the money my parents made pretty much went on my education (bless them) so whilst everyone was bonding over new gucci shoes and macbooks I lived my life in second hand uniform. All other kids saw their parents frequently, we couldn’t afford it so the next 8 years I grew up completely alone in the world only seeing my mother 3 times a year. My dad died when I was 11 so that didn’t help.  My life was pretty much a mix of loneliness, and crying myself to sleep.

My eating disorder of-course got BAD during those years. I would get really fat and then in 2-3 years Im thin again and then in another 2 I’m obese and then I develop bulimia and next year Im thin again and this time I develop depression, and behold it helps me get obese again. It dominated everything. Every. Part. Of. My. Life. 

I am somebody who cannot stand being fat because it is burned into my brain that fat = abomination. When I am I isolate myself from any friends and family completely because I am too embarrassed to exist. If I look in the mirror I feel suicidal so I try not to. I live in self-loathing, and depression. Fat means I am not welcome, fat means I don’t deserve anything.

When I am thin, life is amazing I have nice genes , i feel beautiful and everyone treats me so much better and I feel respected, and straight away my love life blows up and I make great friends, I achieve things, I’m charismatic, I feel powerful like I can do anything. But it never lasts, a day comes when i realise NOTHING makes me feel good enough, and this feeling of dread and longing creeps in, taking it all away from me and thats when thin isn’t thin enough. I begin comparing myself to huge women 3 times my size and truly start believing I am that fat and so I lose all the people I love, and become numb with depression, lose all passion, interest and just dream of dying and eat my life away as punishment for not being thin enough. The real me is there tucked at the back of my head watching me commit irrational self harming behaviour, screaming for it to stop, to regain control of my body. But it’s a prison. I watch myself ruin everything and I cannot stop it.

I managed to beat bulimia but depression and the eating disorder took away everything. I was an aspiring musician, i was really really good, i had good grades, got into the university I wanted etc...then it hit me again and suddenly I am a drop out, just drinking and crying all day. I never had anyone to talk to about this. People who aren’t depressed can’t understand it, those who are depressed are no help because we just end up dragging each other deeper into it and to this day my mother thinks being depressed just means being sad no matter how many times I explain it.

I am 22 now. Its been 5 years of depression so far I have barely gone out of my house in 2 years, gained a shit ton of weight of course, cant play my instruments anymore because I haven’t touched them in so long and lost a big chunk of my intelligence since I haven’t really been stimulating my brain with new knowledge. Everyday I consider death ..only I don’t want to die. What I want the most is to live, free in my skin, life not revolving around comfort food, to be free of the disorders that dehumanised me. But the life I live isn’t a life... 

Who am I? The girl who got handed an opportunity to be anyone, to achieve anything. Who had all the potential, who could have made her father proud. I ate it away. I cried it away. I slept it away. I harmed it away. Now I am nothing, I am worth nothing. Waste of space and by god was I a waste of money.  
Mommy and daddy’s little disappointment.

Now I can feel myself becoming thinner, I have a small spark of motivation, Ive been eating healthy and exercising, my depression giving way to moments of progress, but it doesn’t matter because I’ve been here before over and over enough to know that I am just a shitty biological machine with broken code that will always take everything away from me and nobody can fix me. 

One day I will be 40, and every morning I will wake up in regret, replaying how I let my whole life slip through my fingers over fucking food. I just hope I have the courage to suicide the next time I lose everything so I don’t have to experience such a future. 

I just needed to share this with somebody at least once, thanks so much for reading.",15Apr2019,2

83,"Im 23 i have sever c-ptsd and ocd and had a psychotic break a few years back caused by a year of seratonin syndrome which lead to an ongoing fight with suicidal thoughts. Im fighting with depression / suicide as well as trying to process trauma im not able to talk about with anyone but her (even though the trauma is seriously affecting other parts of my life rn)

I started seeing her 5 months ago. She seemed really worried for my mental state and was very sympathetic/ caring about my past and even teared up when hearing about what i went through.

We wanted to work towards weekly sessions as ive been struggling with my mental illness anf how its affecting not only my own mental health and my romantic relationship but its also impacting prettt much every other aspect of my life as well so my home life has been in tatter and i guess one would call me ""at risk"".

However she went on vacation after our first session (no big, people go on vacations i thought) and was behind with her patients, so she could only see me every 2 weeks. However shed book 3 sessions ahead to gurantee the regularity. She stopped doing that a couple sessions ago as her schedule was ""freeing up"". Great, i thought (sucks that she fell behind from the vacation but it was coming to an end which was nice and it meant id be able to work toward getting the intensity of help we both felt i needed) then i went to book another appt today with her secretary and her next one is a month away because apparantly last week she was on another vacation and is now catching up with her patients... Im in canada using public health care so i cant pick and choose. And i cant really go to a walk in therapist (not a licensed psych but wr have like a therap walk in clinic for emergencies in my province) as my psych and i agree its hard to get anywhere as it takes a few sessions justt to get context on the trauma i went through and draw the distinctions between what issues im facing are ocd vs depression vs ptsd and what trauma is playing a role in whichever part were adresdong.

I think psychologists are definitely entitled to vacations as much as the next person when they havr the availabilty but someone about this just feels unprofessional and i dont feel they have the time for me.

I have a session in an hour. Then likely one next month if i make it to it but i have no idea what to do and really feel hopeless but i cant talk about being suicidal as i have joint custody of my son and if im put in hospital and my ex catches wind (small town) shell make my life a living hell for seeing my son.",15Apr2019,4

\---

In this week’s episode of Hidden Forces, Demetri Kofinas speaks with celebrated author Johann Hari about his book “Lost Connections” and the silent epidemic of depression and anxiety that is pervading our society and burdening the lives of so many people.

Lost Connections begins as a chronicling of Johann’s search for answers to the causes of his own depression, but becomes an investigation into the reasons for its increasing prevalence in the lives of others.

In the introduction to the book, Johann tells us that someone in five U.S. adults is taking at least one drug for a psychiatric problem and that nearly one in four middle-aged women in the United States is taking antidepressants at any given time. Addictions to legal and illegal drugs are now so widespread that the life expectancy of white men is declining for the first time in the entire peacetime history of the United States, and these statistics are not exclusive to Americans. When scientists test the water supply of Western countries, they always find it laced with antidepressants, because so many people are taking and excreting them that they simply can’t be filtered out of the water we drink every day. We are literally, as Johann writes, awash in these drugs and we have come to accept that a huge number of the people all around us are so distressed that they feel they need to take a powerful chemical every day just to keep themselves together.

This is an extremely sensitive issue because so many people suffer under the burden of depression, but unlike other disabilities, this one is particularly difficult to talk about. No one wants to be seen as a downer or weak, even though more people are starting to understand that depression is not a sign of weakness. But what is it a sign of?

Certainly, there are people in this world who are predisposed towards various forms of mental illness, including severe, sometimes debilitating depression. However, it is difficult to comprehend how the epidemic – the rising rates of depression and anxiety – can be explained in biological terms and treated in pharmacological ways. Johann Hari would say that this epidemic is not a malfunction caused by a biological deficiency. He would say that they are the natural response to a deficiency in how we live.

This point, in particular, resonates. The Indian philosopher Krishnamurti, famously said that “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” On the surface, things have never been better. This is literally the best time to be alive in all of human history by almost any metric, and yet, if you look between the cracks you find people struggling. Some of them are depressed, others are just overwhelmed, grieving, or lonely. It isn’t just people in poverty who are struggling. This is a society-wide phenomenon. We see it in our politics, but we also see it in our culture. What do we value in our societies today? Who are the heroes that we idolize? If an alien species were to visit earth, what would be the appeal we would make to save our lives?

It’s not a coincidence that there has been an outpouring of interest in questions of ethics, moral philosophy, and epistemology. What are we to infer from the resurgent public curiosity in psychedelics if not that they may hold the key to revelation – the revelation of some elemental truth about life that we seem to have forgotten in our haste to remake the world and ourselves along with some artificially manufactured, commercially sanitized avatar of a human life.

Joseph Campbell, the great mythological scholar and mystic once said, “I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.” Could this epidemic be a reflection of our struggle to fulfill the demands of a culture whose values are no longer compatible with the needs of a human life? As Johann Hari writes in the final paragraphs of his book, while addressing his younger self, “You aren’t a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met. You are not suffering from a chemical imbalance in your brain. You are suffering from a social and spiritual imbalance in how we live. This pain is not your enemy, however much it hurts, and Jesus, I know how much it hurts. It’s your ally – leading you away from a wasted life and pointing the way towards a more fulfilling one. You can try and muffle that signal or you can let it guide you, away from the things that are hurting and draining you, and towards the things that will meet your true needs.”

Those of you who are regular listeners to this show know that we’ve devoted more time and attention to the subject of life – it’s properties, its merits, and how we come to know and understand it – as we move into a new paradigm of human experience at the frontier of technological futurism. No one knows exactly where this is all going. We are all still figuring it out, but it seems that this is an important piece of that puzzle.

There are limits to human adaptability, and we should be careful not to accept explanations simply because they come wrapped in a story of scientific certainty or commercial authority. People aren’t machines. Your life matters. Your pain matters. Listen to it. It may have something important to teach.",15Apr2019,0
89,"First, sorry about my English, it's not my first language. I just need a place to vent. 

I can't handle all these feelings anymore. I am really afraid of doing something wrong, and sometimes even if I didn't I think I did. Sometimes when I am driving, I am sure I did something wrong, hit some car, etc... even if it didn't happened. It's crazy, sometimes I drive by the same street two or three times just to see if everything is ok. I always check everything multiple times, if the stove is off, if I closed the windows and doors. When I park my car I make videos to be sure that I lock the doors, when I go to the bathroom I make videos to be sure I turn off the faucet. 

But that's not all. I really afraid of dying. And I think everything is going to kill me. Any pain is cancer, any mold is going to fuck up my lungs, any weird taste in food is going to poison me. Yesterday I went for 2 minutes outside and when I got back I found two red dots and a little scratch in my hand, and I was sure a bat had bit me, even that I didn't heard or felt anything. I thought about getting the rabies shot, but If I am alreay sick with something else, and the shots kill me...

I am 30 years old, but I fell like a child. I still live with my parents. I do therapy but hidden from my mom and dad, because they think its silly. I really wish I could take with them about all these stuff, but i am afraid they wont take me seriously.",15Apr2019,1

94,"So I managed to finally book an appointment with my doctor for my mental health this week.   I'm going to give some background info.  I'm a 20 year old woman living in the UK, I am already diagnosed with high-functioning autism (but that was when I was 6 years old), I have never seen anyone about my mental health since I was small and had to get behavioural therapy for my autism.   When I was a teenager my parents didn't really believe there was anything wrong with me and just put it down to teenage hormones/me trying to get attention/any of my problems just being part of having autism.  They aren't like this now and my mum has even offered to take me to my appointment.  I don't want to jump to any conclusions as to what's wrong with me, so I'm not going to go too much into my ""symptoms"", but to make a long story short I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts, self harm and ""episodes"" (which can last up to 2 weeks) where I feel really low and hate myself to the point where I feel completely numb and shut myself off from all my friends. 

First off, I don't know how to tell my doctor any of this.   I am really bad at talking to people in real life unless I've known them for a certain amount of time, or if I feel comfortable around them.   I stumble on my words, I talk to fast (especially if I'm nervous), I miss out certain details, sometimes I just shut down and resort to saying one-word answers because its like my body physically will not let me talk.  If I tell anyone I don't know about that kind of stuff, I uncontrollably break down in tears which a) makes me look very stupid and b) is embarrassing.  And I always feel like my symptoms aren't serious enough or ""real"" enough (if that makes sense).  Its kind of the reason as to why I've been putting off going to a doctor now that I'm a fully grown adult; I just feel like I'd be wasting the doctor's time when there are people in worse conditions than me.   

Second off, I'm worried about what will happen if I do open up about it.   I've heard too many ""horror stories"" about doctors just saying ""oh that's normal, there's nothing wrong with you"", being put on a waiting list for too long, being given the wrong kind of medication/therapy which makes you feel worse, things like that.  I don't want to put anyone off going to a doctor, but I'm just voicing my concerns about it.  I don't know what I should do if any of this happens.  

So, I'm looking for advice about what I should do when I'm at my appointment, or any of your experiences with seeing a doctor.",15Apr2019,1

BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): I just found out my 21 yr old son likely has schizophrenia and I don’t know how to help him.

Sorry, this is going to be long and I’d appreciate helpful responses only. 

I am a 45 yr old father of three boys and my middle son age 21 has recently fallen into psychosis. My first indication was when he was arrested mid December 2018 for smashing the windshield out of a friends car. He had never done anything destructive like that before. When we picked him up from jail the next day he was in a manic, delusional state. Pacing…crazed eyes, talking to God, slipping from catatonic to aggressive, etc etc. Not knowing what to do, I sought a court order to get him into a hospital for treatment.  He spent a week in residence on meds and getting tested for everything under the sun to include an MRI, drug screening (which came back negative), encephalitis, and so on. No root cause could be found and the initial diagnosis was “substance induced psychosis” since he did have a history of drugs and alcohol in college.  Upon discharge he was to take 1mg of Risperidone twice a day but after a week, he was digressing. He was lost and laughing uncontrollably for no reason. I consulted his doctor and explained what I was seeing…even sent a video clip from my phone of his current state and the doctor told me he needed to come back in immediately and not wait until something bad happened again. I did just that and let me tell you…it was gut wrenching to commit him against his will again and see the anger/panic in his face. By the way, 4 months later to this day he is still super pissed at me for that. The shitty part is that he confided in me later , like a few weeks ago, that from his perspective going into the hospital only made things worse for him, not better and that it was a scary experience. So now I have that guilt. 

Okay, going back in time a little. I’ve gotten small details from my son over the past two months about what led up to that psychotic break back in December and in hindsight, I can trace his mental unwellness starting back in about August of 2018. He was at University 45 minutes down the road from me and my wife. I knew he was living the life a frat guy and smoking pot/drinking alcohol excessively . I wasn’t happy about this by any stretch, but he was an adult and getting good grades so I figured there wasn’t much I could do except tell him I didn’t approve and that if he failed any classes, I’d be pulling back what little financial support I was giving him. He told me during this period last Summer that he started to grow increasingly paranoid. That he saw society like N. Korea where the wealthy elite controlled everything. He also started hearing the voice of God. He said this voice was with him 24/7 telling him what he should be doing. He said it felt like he was on autopilot. This voice gave him insight into the stock market and he was making some good investments…he turned $500 into $3500 within a few months and then the voice had him give it all away by purchasing random peoples groceries and what not. I can now reflect back on a few phone conversations I had with him during this period and he was getting hyper religious. He talked about shunning friends who were bad influences…getting off alcohol and pot, going to church, even got baptized again. As a Christian, I was happy about all of this but he also made a few weird statements that gave me pause. “Dad, my Professors are evil and I challenge them in class all the time” or, “There is this older guy frequenting our parties that is seducing and sleeping with all my young female friends…like a harem and I think he might be possessed. He wants to fill a bus with Indians and head south”. I was like, WTH??

Okay, sorry to skip around, but now back to the second hospitalization in January 2019. At this point he is getting discharged after his second stay in the same hospital and on 6 mg of risperidone a day along with Cogentin. The plan was 4-6 weeks of Intensive Outpatient Therapy. He was not compliant…did not want to do therapy and thought the meds were unnecessary. Being his father and wanting him to heal, I begged, pleaded, intimidated, bribed and did everything in my power to get him to stick with the meds and therapy. I was scared shitless that he would digress again and do something stupid that might land him back in jail or that he would hurt himself. Well, he quit therapy and as a grown adult, I couldn’t force him to participate so not I’m just left with meds. 

He didn’t like how the Risperidone made him feel and I could see it sucking the life out of him. He was lethargic, depressed and uncoordinated. I felt bad, but I figured at least it was suppressing the mania that had twice gotten a hold of him. I begged him to stick with and let the meds stabilize. He talked everyday about wanting to stop taking meds and I even got him several appointments to see doctors to convince him that he needed to stay on them. Mind you at this point we still have no clear diagnosis because he won’t stick with any one doctor long enough to get some history. This went from January through mid-march. He said the voice stopped mid February and that it couldn’t come back because he now realizes there is no such thing as God. 

Finally a few weeks ago he made the command decision to stop taking meds cold turkey. Also that same day I caught him smoking pot in the bathroom and found a bunch of empty alcohol bottles under his bed. Within about 3 days my wife and I could see a change in his demeanor. I could see he was slipping away and he was getting a little more hostile towards us. He started aggressively disparaging us calling my wife a bitch, me a fucking f@$ggt, etc etc. He was getting in our personal space, trying to provoke us. His little brother (17) was getting anxious and scared and asking what we were going to do. By day 6 of him being off meds I was worried we were going to have a knock down, drag out and I couldn’t jeopardize the sanity and safety of my wife and two other boys so I told my son he would either have to get back on meds or leave the house. He chose neither and simply laughed that he was not going anywhere, would do whatever he wanted and that he was in charge.

I could see he was not well. I could see it was a tense, unhealthy, dangerous environment so I did the only thing I could think of. I again sought to get him treatment against his will. I called 911 and the cops showed up. He was super pissed but the strange thing was this time, he was able to turn off his crazed mania immediately and was speaking to the cops calm, cool and collected. Stating we simply had a disagreement and that he wanted to get his bags and go. I told the CIT officer on scene (a specially trained police officer that responds to those in a mental crisis) all the background data that I’ve typed up here, but he stated the way my son was presenting himself right there in real time didn’t meet the criteria to take into custody and transport to an ER. My son asked for transport with his back to a neutral location and he was having a friend pick him up.

Okay, I’ve probably left out some data, but here is where I need your help and insight.  HOW DO I HELP MY SON? HOW DO I HELP SOMEONE WHO REFUSES HELP AND DOESN’T THINK THEY HAVE A PROBLEM?

I love him more than anything and only want to support him back to wellness and get his life back in order. I’ve been throwing resources at this for 4 months now…have taken off weeks and weeks from work….traveled from Florida to New York to Oklahoma seeking help from doctors but nothing seems to be working because he refuses to acknowledge he needs help. I’ve done the research and read your stories here on this thread. I know the problem, especially in the beginning and that people affected by this start to get a little stable and then think, “ahhhh…I’m good now, don’t need meds anymore” and then slip back into psychosis and that the cycle keeps repeating itself. I think I might have also burned bridges and lost his trust. I can see it from his broken vantage point…all he sees in me is an authoritarian who keeps badgering him about being sick, needing help and throwing him into looney bins. All of that is the furthest thing from the truth, but I know he thinks this way. This last time, when the cops came and I threw him out, he has texted me over and over how much he hates me and is never coming back or talking to me. Despite all that, I know it’s not my son talking and I am willing to step right back in support him. I am willing to move mountains and spend every dollar I have trying to restore his health. I’ve lined up a 3 month in residence facility where he can go recovery with other addicts/mentally unwell people in a safe (voluntary) ranch type retreat but he won’t accept any of it. I’m scared to death he is going to get caught up in the criminal justice system and do something that can’t be undone or has long reaching consequences. He belongs in the health care system but he refuses that help. The only thing I can think of that I haven’t tried is hiring a probate attorney to seek medical power of attorney over him but I’m not sure if I will go that route. Sadly, I think events will overcome this current situation before I could ever get something like going, and that’s if I could even get such an injunction. 

Is there anything I could be doing different? All I can think is that right now I’m confined to just wait until he falls again and then come in to see if I can pick up the pieces. He is currently staying with his grandfather whom knows everything that has been going on. They have a good relationship and I’m hoping that he can feel safe there and rest, but off his meds, I don’t know if things will get out of control again.",15Apr2019,1

She claims to have multiple personalities, and one of them is a man. One of them talks in a very weird way. She makes up words and uses nouns as verbs. She remembers everything that happens no matter which of her 'alters' she's expressing.

She's jumpy at times too. We'll be outside and she'll get distracted by every bird that flies by for example.

98,"I want to share that its very difficult if not impossible for myself to get a job right now, and it really affects me mentally. I have suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar Disorder most of my life.


I am an intelligent person; I hold an undergraduate and graduate degree. I can talk on about many
topics, and am a quick study. All I really want to do is work and help people. I wanted to become a
psychologist but I can’t afford graduate school and have a lot of trouble focusing these days.
Because of my mental illness I struggle, a lot. If a job posting says ""2 years experience"", I stop, not
because I don't think I can do it, but because my anxiety and black &amp; white thinking make me feel
inept. The difficulty in finding a job is only exacerbated by my inability to feel like I'm good enough.


And with each new application I send out with no response, I only feel more and more alone. I feel
like a failure each time and while I know its unreasonable to expect that I am going to be offered every job I apply for, getting no replies is difficult. A point has been reached where I struggle to find meaning in my job search and apply for anything, hoping to not be a further disappointment to those around myself.


 My greatest asset, my ability to be critical, seems only to be focused on myself and
why I cannot land a job in any sector.
I know a good deal about public health, about infrastructure, about psychology and sociology, about terrorism, about statistics and about research. I love studies, and figuring out why things work or don’t work in certain regards. I love finding out what makes people tick and how I can help with
issues that arise. It seems that—because of my inability to even lock down a job at a grocery
store— I can't live up to my potential and it kills me.


One thing that really hurts is that I have a criminal record for battery when I was in a very bad place
mentally and struck someone trying to help me. I didn't understand what they were doing and I am
very averse to being touched. This only makes looking for jobs worse. I wait for the rejection letters based on a background check and have no way of explaining that I needed help, that I still feel
terrible about it and have made a bunch of changes in order to not make the same mistake. I gave
up drinking; I started working on myself more, and have been in and out of treatment for the past few
years just trying to eek by. But it has been so hard to know you're a failure in the eyes of others, of
family, and most of all yourself.


If I could start over again, I would. Though I know I can't change my anxiety or bipolar but I can
change my outlook and try harder. I just want to be employable, to be recognized as being smart
and capable, to be seen as being useful. I'm so tired of being a failure.

I want her to become a famous neurosurgeon but she's not working hard enough or pushing herself.

I finally snapped. I started sobbing uncontrollably until I was gasping for air. I smashed four glasses on the floor. I took a nap. I drank three espressos in 20 minutes and then crab walked in the nude around my house. I've completely lost it, and I held a knife to my arm.

My husband is a sociopath and narcissist and he left me for another woman. He was trying to poison me to collect life insurance. He is mentally ill and I found out he was french kissing our daughter behind my back to get her ready for boys. He looked at her in the most disgusting way I saw his eyes turn into slits like a snake's. He told his secret other wife that I was going to die in 8 days and she drove around putting up posters of my funeral to celebrate it. These people are sick. My husband programmed the GPS on my phone to send directions to my brain to an open grave that he wants to bury me in. I can't walk three steps without hearing ""turn left. Go straight to hell.""

103,"Hey. 
I deal with negative, overwhelming thoughts nearly all day every day. And my head feels soooo heavy.

I have OCD, depression, anxiety  and very easily become paranoid.

So when my brain comes up with a thought, I can't stop thinking (obsessing) about it, and I feel like they're true. Even though deep down I know myself, and that it's not me (or is it? I'm so terrible at fighting these). However due to the relentless onslaught, I get depressed, and the anxiety is just omnipresent.

My brain tries to make me feel like i'm bad. I really don't think I am, and i don't want to be.

106,"So I’m starting a new job tomorrow and I’m low key freaking out. 

You see, I have just recovered from a benign brain tumour. It was hell, I was at home for almost 6 months, in an out of the hospital. But I did it! I finally beat Timmy the Tumour and got approved to go back to work. 

Before this, I worked full-time from home for the last year or so. While sure it has some awesome perks, for people like me who already live with major depression and social anxiety, it was super isolating. I stopped getting dressed or showering regularly, I would just wear the same pair of pjs for 3 days, because fuck, who’s gonna see me, right? I hated being cooped up at my crappy apartment under insane neighbours 24/7. The complete lack of social interaction or need to make myself presentable did a number on my depression. It was hard. Now, I’m going to have to go back to the real world. I’m scared my social anxiety is going to crush me. To top it off, my Mom called me when she found out about my new position only to tell me I’m crazy to be quitting my work from home job (the pay and the management were SHIT, they treated me like I wasn’t even human. Verbal abuse and harassment from my boss was a daily.) She just went off on how I’m always switching jobs, I’m going to be tired, have no desire to get out of bed, coworkers are generally annoying and how I couldn’t even find something that paid better, I just traded what I had in for a major downgrade. 

Thing is, I was actually somewhat excited about starting this job. Sure, the pay could be better but it’s a huge, rapidly growing company with many open positions and tons of opportunities to grow into bigger, higher paying roles. Plus after working random admin and accounting jobs just to pay bills over the last 2 years, this will finally be something a lot closer to my college education. I was excited to go back to public health. 
But my Mom kind of crushed me, even tho I’m a grown ass woman who should no longer be believing in her trash talk. 
Yet here I am, full blown panic attack. Wondering if I made a terrible mistake or how I’m going to survive working there.

107,"I am bipolar, and my depression has been pretty bad for a few months. My husband keeps telling me it's okay if the house is messy or if sometimes I forget to make him lunches. But today he finally told me he feels jealous that I ""get to"" do nothing all day, while he's at a job he hates. He's angry at me, I heard it in his voice. He's right, that's exactly what's going on. It takes everything to get out of bed, and when I finally get up, I sit at my computer and sit on Reddit or something else all day, trying so hard to muster the energy to do what I promised I'd do when I quit work (house work, cooking, exercising, doing all the shopping, etc). I need to go to the grocery store tomorrow because we're pretty much out of food and I have nothing to cook, but today I'm already stressing about how I'm going to get up and go tomorrow. I try to do work towards the end of the day, when I know he's coming home soon, but he comes home early a lot (his whole workplace does. As long as they're getting their work done, no one really cares), so I'm like ""Oh shit, at least get the dishes done!"" If it weren't for the fact that I have a dog I need to walk, I'd probably never get up all day, so at least that forces me to do something, but because I get up so late, sometimes she goes to the bathroom on the floor and that also makes me feel like a shit person. Basically I feel like I'm completely worthless, even though my husband usually goes out of his way to make me feel like I have intrinsic value. I can tell he's getting frustrated though, and it's not fair to him that he constantly has to take care of me when I offer nothing in return other than companionship and sex, and he doesn't even seem to want to have sex with me anymore and it really hurts. I've gained 20 lbs since I quit, and have ugly stretch marks on the bottom of my belly, but he's always telling me I'm sexy (thank God he likes thicker women, I was already about 10 lbs overweight). I just feel like none of it is fair to him, but I also think I would have lost my job if I'd stayed for basically the same reasons. The fact that our finances are also strained because we made this decision doesn't help either. I've been to therapy, on medications that work somewhat (I was much worse before I had them), but I'm still basically an emotional lump and I don't understand why he still loves me.

It couldnt have been normal to be fluctuating so extremely in weight, sitting in dark closets to calm myself, and self-harming; and that’s when I admitted that I had a problem. I told my mom how I felt, not what I was actually doing, because I still somehow didnt want to expose myself as a freak. And she so badly didn’t want me to be crazy she thought of so many ways to explain it away. I know she didnt mean harm. But because of this it took me 5 years of progressively worsening till I finally had enough and knew it was going to kill me.

It’s been 3 years since I finally insisted to my mom again that I needed help. I had to let her see what I keep inside so much. I have changed since then. Im less angry. Im much more open about my feelings.

i went to my doctor and he made my feel better by saying that since i immediately realised i was hearing voices that i will always know they are hallucinations and wont ever go full talking to myself mass murdering people crazy and that he feels that its just stressed induced and that it will dissipate once my life starts getting better   


  
he referred me to a specialist psychologist specialising in veterans but i never got a response but the audio hallucinations are getting more frequent now and have gone from vague sounds to more vocal murmurs

any way i'm not sure what to do i also have a strict no antipsychotics policy on myself because i actually was at med school before the army i dropped out over a girl dumping me any way i personally don't agree with antipsychotics i feel like they are not to help the patient but make them bearable to the rest of society and not actually treating the root cause of issues kind of like putting a poster over a hole in dry wall

112,"Hello everyone, I felt like there were some things I needed to get off my chest. I don't really know where to start but here we go. I'm just a regular 20 years old dude living in some country. I don't really want to reveal where I'm from and I don't know why. Since I was a kid, always felt like I needed to get the fuck out of here ASAP. So in order to do that, I learned English and started saving up some money. I would like to point out that I was only 12 or 13 at the time I started. Socially, I'm not so acceptable because I have tattoos and clearly I'm an atheist for the society's standards, which is true. This never had an impact on my view and the way I treat others though. Anyways, long story short, I lost my father when I was 16 and had to drop out of school and start working. I'm pretty sure you guys have heard of this story before. When this happened I lost all of my savings for moving to another cheaper city in the country.  

Before we moved out of the city, depression hit me hard and since I was under a lot of stress, my anxiety got worse and eventually developed derealization/depersonalization. It's something rare that occurs when you are under a lot of stress or smoking too much pot may cause it too. Eventually, I was put to mental hospital and started getting treated. I didn't respond much to pills and therapy so thy did ECT on me. It actually worked, after this I was kind of enjoying life more and I started realizing that I was stronger than most considering the things I went through. After I was all fine and set we moved out to the ''cheaper'' city. 

It's still where I live and it's actually my home city, where my mother and father comes from. This city oh my god.. full of dumb bummers that get on my way constantly because I should be more ''manly'' and muslim? I just don't feel like I belong here or any other part of the country. I will try to immigrate some other countries that I can be a part of but I don't know where to start. Maybe you guys can guide me on that. 

After we moved here, my mom found out that I'm no longer muslim and started hating on me so badly. Things got to a point where she called the police on me and wanted me out of the house. At first, police tried to calm her down and convince her to not to do something like this but she was so persistent. After the failed efforts of the police, I got kicked out of my own house because everything was registered under my moms name. I had little to no money and had to sleep in the hospital. I actually made a post about this on exmuslim subreddit back then with a different account at the time that it happened. Long story short, I got my own room and lived away from her for some time but one day she called me and said that she ''forgave'' me and that I could come live with her again. I declined and told her some mean things which I regret to this day for not keeping my cool. Eventually, my uncles contacted me that she was in a bad condition, health-wise and I should go home. So I did, it was heartbreaking at first to see her like that but I got used to it because I don't have much love for her. 

Now I live with her having literally no love in my heart for her. I even sometimes she would be dead but I don't know man. Shit is tougher than I can understand. And now I can't even leave even if I can because I feel like she is a responsibility over my shoulders that I need to take care of. So far, I'm really unhappy and unsatisfied with life but don't really have any suicidal thoughts nor feeling depressed and dark about future. I'm aware of the potential that I have but I just don't know where to start. I hope everything goes well for me and for you guys on whatever you are struggling with. Everybody in here have a special place in my heart. 

Thank you for reading all the stupid things I wrote.

All 3 are super smart but can't seem to understand that when you smoke/drink alone its a bad thing.  Eldest is ending his weed sobriety soon and I can't convince him to extend it.

Okay so i am delusional for like 3 weeks, I don’t know who I really am why I am and if I’m in the right universe, I’m just feeling sad and I’m feeling like I’m about to loose someone very important in my life. I didn’t told anyone that I’m sad because I want no one to worry about me, but I could still use some emotional support, and I thought reddit would be great!

 So everytime i would wake up I would be confused, where am I, who am I and what am I doing here? And this happens everyday, but at somepoint of the day I’m getting back into my normal „universe“ (I feel like I’m switching universes all the time and realities)

I already asked my mom yesterday if we could go to a psychologist but she said it’s a phase and it‘ll stop soon and I hope she is right! 

I really don’t wanna feel like this anymore it’s just too much!

128,"I'm sorry this is so long. I hate talking about my feelings so this was really hard to write.

Three years ago my childhood home burned down. While my family and I were sleeping it was struck by lightning. When the power came back on (was out for a while due to the storm) it was engulfed in flames. I remember standing there in the aftermath in what was my childhood bedroom for over 15 years and everything was just ruined from either fire or the water from the hoses the firefighters used. Then the ceiling and roof collapsed around me but thankfully it only caused minor fractures and bruises since everything was water damaged and soft I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've been consumed with PTSD symptoms and a deep depression that nothing seems to help. I lost so much stuff that I can't replace and I'll remember things I had forgotten about that I loved and no longer have and it makes me instantly start sobbing. The only thing that has helped is Xanax when I'm having a panic attack and even though I take the lowest dosage I still have to take nap and sometimes lose time. I really don't want to be dependent on them and then just waste away my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've had to move across the state to help a sick family member and I'm now in a city far away from my friends and boyfriend so on top of everything I'm feeling extremely alone and I know it's contributing to my poor mental health. My psychiatrist has said the symptoms SHOULD start to go away as time passes but they just are not. I'm completely lost and don't know who I am anymore. While my family went through it with me, they have all handled it so much better and moved past it but I haven't at all. Smoke, storms, loud noises, and sirens all trigger a panic reaction even though I know I'm safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so incredibly alone and out of my body that I do'nt even know where to begin. Since the fire I've lost 87 pounds because food doesn't taste great and I feel sick afterwards.  I try not to say all this to my friends and loved ones because once I start it all comes out and I cry uncontrollably. I also just feel like burden when I do.

It was very painful, but I couldn't stop it. Eventually it was over. I took a deep breath and looked behind me. There was a bunch of brown stuff all over the floor that was apparently just inside me.

(Bipolar type 2, ADHD combined type, and generalized social anxiety) is What my last psychiatrist 2 years ago before I lost insurance had me as .  Recently I've had a lot of health issues crop up related to my esophagus , neck, and stomach. ( I have been previously diagnosed with herd and acid but it's been 5 yeara  Since that time and my symptoms have gotten a lot worse . Like wheezing and regurgitating of the food I eat, I always feel heavy headed and my neck is always stiff..  
   Anyways I tried jobs back when my healt was better and could never hold anything. Between not being able to remember my own name with the anxiety and the bipolar mood swings ( I don't do well under pressure or with a manager behind my back watching me ) So I opened my own business from around 2015-2017 and it faulted. I lost my health insurance so couldn't go to doctors for the physical or.mental health issues anymore.. now I'm 26 and living with my grandparents without havingnth gotten any other jobs over the last couple years since the business closed. 
    I have been doing what I can. As in microwork sites and surveys etc online, forcing myself to workout at the house with weights, managing my deity for my stomach and only drinking water and eating safe foods etc. I help out around the house and run errands and stuff... Although going out in public has been super difficult between the anxiety and physical symptoms I'm dealing with.  Taking lessons online and keeping to a schedule for myself as much as possible... 
   But the bottom line is my health is not.much better , I'm 26, don't have a job. Can't get to the doctors without insurance. So i feel pretty stuck right now. I'm honestly really afraid of going in to apply to places. I know I'm going to be a nervous wreck. And I know I'm going to be self conscious even.more so because of my stomach , throat, and my neck. I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with working everyday . Well convinced of it tbh. But not sure if that's how it really is in reality. Considering other people might not notice my throat gurgling , or my neck stiffness as much as I would imagine they would... I have considered getting aid but I don't really know how. I live in pa USA.. But without ever having a real job for.any length  besides the business idk.  I'm afraid of what's going to happen a.nd regretful.

Little background i'm a 18M, live on an island in a house with my mum and dad and two little brothers, 10 and 4 weeks old. I've been dealing with this thing for a long time, the doctors are saying im high-risk depression low-risk self harm but honestly i don't know whats going on in my head. I've only recently sought help because I was starting to abuse substances and alcohol where i'd be getting blacked out myself and just wanted to feel numb but I can't anymore and nothing is ever helping. I broke up with my girlfriend because i know how much of a toll this would take on her and the fact that i got really insecure after I found she was sending messages to a guy she was really close with about, you get the picture, but now we are sort of still together and im just trying to juggle exams, social life (that is completely non existent as she never liked me seeing my friends so when I try to have a social life now she gets mad at me), her, my family and just making sure im okay because im really not.

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

When I came home my mother was having some really really bad psychotic episodes and was making accusations of the neighbours raping people falsely and that there are cameras everywhere and talking to people. I've never seen this behaviour before.

The reason I think they're related to autism is because the symptoms I mentioned and others I have, match ones I've read online and what other people have told me. 

Thing is, I'm pretty functioning. I work full time okay, I get out of bed and shower and power through the day like any other ""normal"" person but I have quite a few traits, including the ones I mentioned, that make me wonder if I have autism.

I say normal because depression itself isnt exactly normal lol. I'm more curious if this is an actual symptom of depression or something I should probably worry about. Btw I've been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety. 

So basically I'll have moments when I get really overwhelmed by my thoughts and my thoughts just start yelling at me. But it feels like a separate person but they have my voice kinda? The yelling can continue for a decent amount of time and normally it gets bad enough that I cant function and have a little meltdown I guess. I tend to wanna yell too. I just kinda feel like yelling, everything moves really fast yet slow and I kinda anxiously shake my leg. The thing is from the outside I look pretty ok, just zone out I guess, I dont really do anything but inside my head its insanely chaotic. This only happens when I'm having a depressive episode and I haven't noticed a real trend in frequency or triggers.

I actually having one right now. It's kinda calmed down and I can tell I'm being yelled at but I'm not really actually hearing anything if that makes sense. I do want it to stop tho because its extremely distressing. 

Does anyone else experience this? Or could this be a separate issue?

I do horrible with managers and pressure ... I have no confidence and I take everything personally. Like, if there's a customer that feels they can push me around to steal or get a discount or a manager wants so mine to complain at I'm like a magnet for that kind of thing since I have no self esteem.

 Dropped out of college to after a semester . 
 Started a business a couple years ago and it failed 2015-2017. Lost health insurance recently.

 Around the time my business closed and I tartedtheray I started having also of physical hath issues with my stomach , throat, and neck. Stomach pain, regurgitation of food and acid reflux, esophagus feels like I'm choking, throat makes gurgling noises, neck gets super stuff and my head feels heavy ..
 
 According to my last psychiatrist I have bipolar type 2, adhd combined type, and generalized social anxiety.  Tried going to therapy for about 2 years and taking meds before I lost my insurance with not much success.  ( no difference in the panic attacks and losing track of where I was , etc. Before going to the therapist every week for instance )

  I'm living at my grandparents.  I always have been. They support and I help them out around the house and run errands etc.  But they are getting older now. It's not been healthy for me. Always having somone else doing and in control of everything so I have lost my since of self.  I have very little ability to complete tasks without specific direction, get flustered easily.. Can't make decisions .  Very little experience taking care of myself like cooking, laundry etc.

Have no friends or social experience.. don't know how to apply for aid . I live in pa USA. But the application process is to much for me. I don't know all the information or how to file. Going in person is really scary as well.

Spent the last 2 years trying to hold myself together. Staying in a routine, taking programming  lessons online, ( c#, python, plus I've gotten into unity and game development for awhile )' . Doing microwork and surveys online like amazon mechanical turk,  forcing myself to go out to shop and run errands, and working out at home/ weightlifting regularly despite the physical health issues I've been having . All good and I've learned a lot but not enough to have a career from home.

 Basically I need a job for insurance to get the physical health issues fixed. Between my physical symptoms and social anxiety I can't even barely leave the house without being extremely uncomfortable .. could I work successfully while dealing with the stomach, neck, throat, and mental health stuff ? I dont know. 

I want to say no I absolutely could not. But I may be more afraid of being socially made a fool of then may ability to function with Tue issues long enough to get insurance. Like my throat gurgling or walking around with my head tilted or stretching my neck etc.

Basically I'm really scared and feeling sick and trapped.  I'm going to be a wreck if I seriously start trying to job hunt . I already am a wreck. But I have to.  I feel regretful when i look back now. A few years earlier if I had just suffered through the embarrassment and insults I could have maybe stuck around and worked through it but now ?

149,"First off long time reader first time poster. 

I have always tried to be a happy bubbly person on the outside, always talkative wanting to be part of a conversation but that was and still kind of is a façade, having intense anxiety makes this difficult bit I try not to let this get in the way, slot easier said than done. 

I have always preferred being by my self and playing video games, it was a life I could live with no judgement from the outside world, I made loads of friends and dreaded logging off and going back to a life I felt like was a lie, playing the game made you forget about the  bad and gave me something to focus upon be that welding a sword, aiming down the sights of a rifle of having a steering wheel at my control, gaming was my escape. 

Many times thoughts of crossing the threshold and away from this life crossed my mind but I never actioned them, having this never ending pitch black hole your find your self in with no way you feeling there is a way to escape is a terrifying thought and indescribable to experience. 

Fast forward quite a few years and I recently lost a loved one in my family this broke me so much so that I had a severe mental breakdown, I've always dealt poorly with stress and my highly strung job mixed with this didn't help. 

I've never shown this side of me to anyone let alone my significant other as I always thought in my head that something would change, probably for the worse and if something did happen where might I find my self.

This life event hit me like a freight train and broke my walls down, I was lucky (unlike many others suffering MH issues) enough to have some one as a pillar of support, my partner.

She looked after me and made me smile everyday when all I wanted to do was shut the world out, to play video games and live somebody else's life to this day it still is an escape of reality for me, having someone who is willing to stick by me and support me even through the bad days is giving me some hope and I'm starting to see the light, it's been a long journey and I'm far from the end but it gives a ray of hope. 
 
Having a health system that caters for mental health is great, however when the system is under pressure like it is now, people can end up living in false hope, I have now been on the waiting list for therapy for about 8 months with no time frame on when this will happen, people need the support and help of others, if the NHS (in the UK) are unable to help effectively due to being underfunded or lack of awareness, I'm glad that there are area's like this Subreddit where people can ask for help from like minded people. 

I have a list of MH issues that I have been told I have by doctors, surveys and MH Support group questionnaires and what upsets me most is that the higher ups are only starting to realize how rife this is and that this is far worse than it seems, not everyone with MH Issues wants to talk about it very few who I have talked to infact and even people with these issues some times don't relalize they have some form of it, I've been through some dark times, times I would never want to revisit in a million years, times I wouldn't wish my my worst enemy, however I'm sure other people have been through far worse than I.

If you are reading this I value you as a person, I may never meet you or shake your hand or give you a hug but there are people like me and possibly you who been into the darkness and come out the other side, not unharmed but still here, you are worth something to someone, even if you may never have met/meet them face to face you are here.

Disability is not always visible, we all have our scars and no one is better than any other, if you find your self in a place of darkness remember that you are not alone.",15Apr2019,2

Ok, Ive been dealing with depression for a long time. I can say I am no longer depressed. Since summer/fall 2018 or so. Since then, there have been coming memories, feelings, things I locked away, I dont want to think about, are coming back to me. Every so often. But last friday, the most horrible feelings Ive put away came back to me. 

During the depression I still had insecurities, but not that extreme because i was busy getting mentally healthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am crying the whole time. I feel worthless, ugly whatever my minds feel like to poison me with. Everything makes me insecure. People I am trying to date with, who suddenly are ""busy"", like every men ive ever made an effort in to date. And then they ghost me. It mostly goes like this: Matches on dating site, talk on site, talk via text and maybe call, tells me he wants to meet me, hears about my past depression, gets busy, ghosted. 

Probably not the only one, it happens. But Thats not the point

&amp;#x200B;

Ive had a live with abuse from my dad. Mentally and physically. He told me that his favorite kids are my brother and sister. Because he wanted a daughter, so got elder sister (WHO IS MY TWIN, FOR GODSAKE, just a few min older than me), got me, and then got his favorite and only son, my brother. A lot of abuse from his side. Parents divorce when im 12. Instead of blossoming into a normal teen with normal teen problems and attitude. I become this aggressive depressed problem child. Mother doesnt know how to handle, lives with grandparents. Dont know how to handle, get back at 17 into the family setting. Only was allowed back with antidepressants. Same i still take to this day (24 right now). At 19 kinda forced to life on my own. Goes terribly wrong, i could have been living an episode of hoarders. Only without the dead cats, and hoarding. Just living in filth, because not able to live a normal adult life. (My house is clean now btw. Tore my ligaments last year march, because i fell kinda shitty on a plastic bag, which had been laying there since idk weeks)

PUT ON A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT. Like i am 1.50m, or 4ft11 and at my heaviest i weighed almost 90 kg or 200lbs. Pretty bad. Family said something about it. A lot. Random people, people on tinder. Everywhere. And the most painful one has to be: Youre so pretty FOR A FAT GIRL. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to april 2019. Lost 12kg or almost 27lbs. Still fat, according to anyone. Still working on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now the real problem

My feelings of worthlessness, selfhate, extreme low self esteem. 

I think i am a huge red flag. When it comes to dating. Never had a boyfriend, probably psycho, clingy, constantly needs assurance. Breaks down when I dont get enough attention etc. I dont want this anymore. 

I dont want the voice in my head, after the they are busy fase, the voice which says: Told you so, he is done with you. You ruined it, you are a red flag. Nobody wants you, you are ugly, fat. Only chances of getting a kid is with a sperm donor. But who wants a single mother with a donor kid. What is wrong with you, why cant you be normal. 

Its always the told you so. For everything. For simple things. And I am sick of it, I am tired. I dont know what to do. I want to get rid of those inner toxic 'voices' who keep bringing me down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive come to the revelation what my script is, for anyone familiar with  transactional analysis therapy. My script is that I can rather bring myself down, before anyone else does it. I want to change that script, mindsetting. I dont know how. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be happy with myself, and I just want to go on with my life, like people my age do. I want to be happy, get married, have a kid. Have a bigger house, and more animals. But i cant. I am so stuck. 

But im gonna ask my psych to refer me to do  transactional analysis. Hopefully this will help. It helped a few people i know.

151,"I’ve had a lot of issues in my past with growing up in the home I did and have been through my fair share of “traumatic events” which I don’t think is too necessary to get into.

I always thought it was normal to feel how I do but the more I’ve been comfortable around my friends and husband and talk about how I feel apparently it isn’t?

My husband has told me twice that if I “need to go see someone or talk to a professional” that he supports me but I don’t know when you know to go? If that makes sense.

I could be sitting enjoying a tv show with him and randomly just say “Hey, I feel really sad,” and when he asks why I have no reason. I’m not thinking of bad memories or anything. My brain just shuts off and I feel numb and detached from whatever I’m doing. It takes usually at least an hour to go away. This happens at least 3-5 times a week, though sometimes as often as 5 times a day if I’m not keeping myself busy and doing something with my hands.

I also have an issue with anger where it flares up for no reason and I’m just so angry I can’t do anything but feel anger. It takes me a very long time to get over it even if consciously I know 100% I have nothing to be angry about which is frustrating because I just look like a crazy lady and I acknowledge that. This happens less often, maybe 3 times a month at most.

I’m also a very anxious person. I can get very stressed out by minor situations which is frustrating because I acknowledge that they’re minor but they still cause me to change my entire day. Time makes me anxious, new places make me very anxious, new people make me anxious, basically anything that isn’t in my planner a month ahead of time makes me anxious. 

I never realized some of my behaviors were out of the norm until talking about them. But I’m so nervous that if I finally went and made an appointment the Dr would just say I’m overreacting and that I’m fine.

So how do u know when to go see a specialist?",15Apr2019,1
152,"Even though we have made huge advancements and helping people with mental illness, sadly there is still a huge stigma surrounding it. I have depression and PTSD and anxiety. You're basically treated like you're crazy either way because if you need to be on meds and if you are off of them you are considered crazy but if you're on meds for something you need your crazy pills as people like to call them. I can't tell you how many times I've had a panic attack and had people tell me to just get over it and to stay calm and that nothing is really happening. That made me feel invalidated and made me feel crazy. It's like they're telling me that what I'm experiencing isn't real and I should just get over it.

I have had my roommate verbally abused me about this on several occasions or at least that's the way I took it. She seems to have a slight mental disability so I try to let it go but after a while I just couldn't. She is cognizant enough to realize that what she's saying is wrong or at least she should be. She's high functioning but some things she's just really slow at. I think she knows damn well that what she said was fucked up. One day, she said to me, you know you just just find things to be anxious about. 

I was super offended and taken aback. I let her know that that was verbal abuse in that I was not going to take it. She tried to claim that she didn't mean it but she has done it before. I don't know if maybe she just doesn't realize that it's coming off as verbal abuse but I've told her to stop and she didn't. Finally the other night I confronted her and I said look, don't do that to me anymore because of his verbal abuse and you are just further pushing the stigma of mental illness.

She promised not to do it anymore but we will see. Like I either let her know shape up or I'm moving out. I shouldn't have to put up with being talked to like that in my own home. But anyway, I just think it's really sad that there is such a stigma about mental illness especially here in the us where we have one of the best Healthcare Systems in the world. Don't let anyone ever tell you you're crazy for the symptoms that you are experiencing. Until someone has been in your shoes they can never understand what you've been through and can never pretend to understand. Thank you for listening.

153,"I (30f) have started seeing a new therapist for depression &amp; PTSD following an abusive relationship I had a few years ago, that was triggered by another bad relationship I had more recently. I've only had two sessions so far &amp; so have just really covered the basics in terms of the two relationships, major effects of PTSD. affecting me right now, etc.

But today, as I walked in, I immediately noticed that the therapist was wearing the same cologne as my abusive ex, which has always been a big trigger. I always get edgy &amp; anxious if I smell it randomly in department stores etc, &amp; I've only ever been stuck in a place with a man wearing it once before, he was my Uber driver, &amp; I had a major panic attack. The second I walked into my therapist's office, my heart started pounding &amp; I could feel a panic attack coming on. I had just sat down &amp; he was talking for a bit, but I couldn't compute what he was saying. I realised he had asked me a question &amp; I couldn't answer &amp; I basically just mumbled ""I have to go"" &amp; literally RAN out of his office - I literally THREW the money for the session at him as I left &amp; ran out of the building to my car, where I had a panic attack.

He texted me saying he'd be in the office the whole session if I wanted to come back, that he hoped I would &amp; we could talk about whatever I was going through, but I couldn't text back or go back in. He then texted saying he'd keep my appointment open next week &amp; hoped I'd come.

I'm mortified &amp; I hadn't mentioned that as a trigger &amp; don't know how to say ""Hi, please don't wear Armani cologne"" - maybe if I'd been seeing him for a while I'd feel more comfortable, but it was literally only my third session.

I go in two days... and I AM FREAKING OUT. I haven't had the best experience with therapy. I was in therapy as a kid, and quit going when I was about 13. My therapist told me that my life would never get better, I wasn't going to ever change, and that I was just a waste. So she was done seeing me.  They whole time my sister and I went to see her she bullied us. Our mom didn't believe us, because she really like her. I have been dragging my feet about even mentioning me being bipolar to anyone because of this. It's been something I started questioning over a year ago, but just recently had a really bad manic episode that I couldn't hide.",15Apr2019,1
156,"I got diagnosed with depression two weeks ago, and I decided to keep it confidential because I knew my mom would be skeptical/not react well. I was told to come in for a follow up “weight check” as I’m slightly below healthy weight. My mom refused to schedule it because she thought she knew what was best and that simply checking my weight wouldn’t do much. The day my follow up was supposed to occur she informed me that I had limited freedoms of going outside/playing games until I had eaten, so I folded and told her what really happened. Now she has refused to take me in because the doctor lied to her to keep my confidentiality, which I explained to her was my fault. She tried to comfort me by telling me everyone has dark thoughts at some point but instead only reinforced my knowledge that she has no clue what depression actually is. What can I do? I’ve had people offer to listen and talk but from past experiences I have a hard time expressing my feelings and most lose interest or don’t have any good advice. I just want to get medication and never mention it to integrate with normal people, but my mom is making it really tough right now.",15Apr2019,1
157,"I'm 19 m and I'm 99% sure I have adhd or add and have no idea what to do about it and I'm worried / scared. 

Now this might sound from far left field so I thought I'd explain it or how I came to this conclusion. Ever since I was in first grade I've had absolutely atrocious writing, like my dad had to buy me a laptop for college so that the teacher could read my papers. I was the student who in highschool would get handed back assignments with 0s because the teacher couldn't read it. Now I have no idea if that has any relevance but  I've just never been able to slow myself down to take the time to write it clearly. Even if I go slow new issues arise. Like today during my final for a course. During the written section I spent 5 mins figuring out if there was an e in courteous (if I even spelt it write here, what ever means doing good) and where it was. Even forming sentences is rough. I've sat here for a while just trying to make sure this makes sense for you all. 

I've also had the issue where I look at a multiple choice question and blanked. Like looked it and stared off for five minutes then I wake myself back into reality and keep writing. It's been like this for years but it's been happening for so long and I've been getting shit grades (my GPA is 2.2 currently) and I just want something to change. I talked to my friend who talked about her experiences with adhd and she said it made everything better once she was open about it. How her grades came up 30 percent when she got prescribed medicine. I related to her on alot of things and just thought I might have it. My parents have also told me / mentioned for me to take drugs / see a specialist but I just have had a fear of physiologists/having something in my body alter my mind because I'm just worried. I don't even know my own thoughts. It just bugs me that their trying to figure out something in me that isnt there. (My thoughts) for the drugs I just dont know how it will be or feel. I just dont want to be different and things to change rapidly but I can feel myself slipping and I want change. I'm not able to study, write tests, or sit in class and listen to lectures to my full extent that I know I can and I feel like I might just need the help. 

If this makes sense at all let me know your thoughts. If I need to explain further inbox me and I'll try. If you can at all relate inbox me too. I kinda just wanna talk to people who went through the same thing so I can maybe rationalize my thoughts and be less scared of physcolosgists and the drugs I'd be prescribed and such. I'm open to awnsers more questions if you have any. Thank you all for any help. Dont be afraid to say you think it's all placebo because it very well could be. 

Thanks and have a nice day.",15Apr2019,1
158,"I've recently been totally unable to find any motivation to do things that I want to do. Like play the piano. I want very badly to get better at playing the piano, play songs that I love, it really brings me joy. But I just can't bring myself to get up and do it.

Searching the internet for answers, I very very quickly got tired of ""be the best, work the hardest, strive more"" inspirational videos. They do absolutely nothing. The problem is not that I don't need the extra drive to push me farther to be better, I literally feel like I can't get out of bed to do things that I love. 

So I was wondering if there were any mental exercises, habbits, or anything that could help me gain motivation really. Or is it just something you have or you don't?",15Apr2019,2
159,"How do I start? I'm not diagnosed as I'm 17 haven't told anyone in my family yet about my problems as I like to try and fix everything by myself. I have ""self-diagnosed"" that I got Social Anxiety, Low Self-Esteem, Sleep Insomnia, and maybe depression. The reasons why I haven't gotten diagnosed yet? I got a lot of siblings, the recent year my little sister has been the main focus as she's been diagnosed with ADD and gluten allergy. I can't blame it on my sisters. I just always done things by myself as I never felt like my parents cared about what I have done. I loved gaming and computers, I'm the ""tech support"" in the house, my parent's didn't support me much within what I was doing, so I just never felt like they cared about me. I'm going back on track now. I lost all friends and contact with others, I'm isolated except going to school. I struggle with going to the store, I try everything to limit my interactions with others. I don't want to keep this a secret anymore as my life just goes down, but that's another story. How the hell do you tell your mother or anyone else outside of the internet that you struggle every day with anxiety or lost all motivation in life and ask for help? - Male 17",15Apr2019,1

i fucking hate self care posts made by neurotypicals so here's one from someone who Actually Gets It can't shower or take a bath? me either. dry shampoo can make your hair look and feel cleaner, and baby wipes or makeup wipes work great to get the top layer of grime off your skin.  can't wash your sheets and make your bed? i feel you. push your blankets out of the way and shake the crumbs off your sheet. it will at least be a bit more comfortable.  can't even change out of your dirty pajamas? been there. hit yourself with some febreeze and a lint roller. if you can, brush your hair. if you can't, hair ties and bobby pins are fantastic.  can't make anything to eat? same. if you can, there's no shame in ordering food. in fact, it's probably better you eat something rather than go hungry. if you can't, try and find something that comes pre made or takes minimal effort to make. at the very least, drink some water.   can't respond to messages or reach out for help? yeah, i get that. set an alarm for a few hours from now and respond to any messages you need to once you've given yourself time to prepare. if they're Important Messages that need Professional Responses, you can find fill in the blank format rough drafts on google. as far as personal messages go, don't feel bad for sending a mass ""I'm sorry, I'm in a personal emergency right now. I'll get back to you as soon as I can."" response to everyone.  can't even sleep because it's so bad? asmr videos always knock me out, personally, but i also watch a lot of bob ross. just try to find something quiet and soothing to use as background noise and take your mind off it, or at least give you a more peaceful environment to think about it.   can't go for a walk/drive? try opening the blinds or curtains. you're still exposing yourself to the outside world. baby steps. (i also play animal crossing or sims; it may be virtual but fuck it. i went on a walk.)   can't go into work/school? let people know. let your coworkers or classmates know it's an emergency and you can't make it. give yourself up to two days, but then you have to go back. ask to have your work emailed to you so you know what you missed.  can't brush your teeth and wash your face? makeup or baby wipes and gum or mouthwash. don't let yourself physically rot bc you're rotting emotionally.  remember that you've been here before. if you survived then you can survive now. that's what this is about survival. you don't have to be living your Best Life. right now, it's more than enough that you're alive.",15Apr2019,1

162,"Hey guys, so I’ve been thinking about romantic movies way too much recently. I saw “Five Feet Apart” and omg, they love it portrayed was so cute. Honestly, it ended depressingly and I’d never wanna be placed in that position and have my heart broken the ways theirs’ were. But I feel like romantic movies are so amazing and I would kill to be in any of those characters positions. It’s cringey , but I find myself wanting to be in those scenarios and being with those guys. I’ve been single for a couple years now and I’m in my mid-20’s so is there something wrong with me? How do I stop obsessing over these characters and storylines, even when they end depressingly? It seems the movies make me lonelier and more depressed as to what I’m apparently missing.",15Apr2019,1
163,"Hello so I’m looking for some advice or maybe someone who had similar thoughts or actions.

The origin of the story starts in Poland. My mother has been a single mom since 98 she has been separated with my father since I was 3. I also have an older sister by 9 years and she was basically my second mom. My mother would have to get odd jobs cleaning, picking some fruit etc in other countries like Holland Germany etc. (The exchange from euro to PLN was very high so those jobs paid 3-5 times more) To provide for the family she would leave me and my sister in charge for months at a time and come back and go again. 

Now we are in 2008 when her first love connected with her online and came to visit her from Canada. They haven’t seen each other in like 20 years...So basically he became my step dad. 

2009 February my mother tells me 2 weeks before that we are moving to Canada and I have no choice. My sister just had a baby so she and her boyfriend moved into our house and stayed in Poland. I lost all my friends and family in 2 week time. When we arrive in Canada in March I have absolutely no one. My mother and my new step dad didn’t arrange the visa for me to go to school. I was stuck at home. No friends. No family. Don’t know the language. Can’t understand tv. Internet restriction by my new dad so I can’t even talk to my friends in Poland. Meanwhile I get introduced to steps dads family his kids and his sisters kids she has 3 kids that for some reason they all hated me and I could just feel the awkwardness and the feeling that they didn’t want me there. I felt very suicidal at that time. 

2011 two years go by, and I can finally go to school. I felt like an outcast. I didn’t know how to approach people to make friends. Eventually I made a couple polish friends through a folk dancing group and get a girlfriend! We have been together since! She is absolutely amazing. Time goes I get a job before school at 3 am and then go to high school I didn’t have time to keep up with my friends and girlfriend so I chose her. 
 
2013 I graduated high school only one year behind
My mom was very suspicious that my step dad is cheating on her so I installed a spy malware on his phone to locate him etc... the first day I installed it we absolutely knew he was cheating on her. She moved out to her friends house, and I was stuck with him. One day my girlfriends functioning alcoholic father offered me to move in with them so I absolutely took his offer. I was sick and tired of living with the man I never liked or respected. So now I’m living one hour away from my friends eventually basically lost them they stop inviting me to events birthday etc. Me and my girlfriend buy a property to make it into our home. Her father offered that he would help us with anything we needed. I was 19 no idea about renovations the building didn’t have water or electricity so I basically gutted it all and then my girlfriends father has an argument with us about that property that we don’t do anything and kicked me out. So I called my mom moved into her apartment with my girlfriend. Now we had to get rid of the property we were basically broke paying rent and paying 1000 a month for the property. We ended up selling it with profit and buying a house. 

I have always worked at places where I could make the most money at the time my girlfriend was in school so I was basically the only income. Every single job felt like I don’t belong there and didn’t bring me satisfaction. 

I feel like I didn’t have anyone in my life to guide me through I tried going to counselling in my high school but I knew the person from the folk dancing group I didn’t want to tell her everything ( now she’s my neighbor ) because I felt like it would get spread out among the people I knew. When I had an idea to get a trade or whatever my mother would always tell me to go into business and have an “easy” job. Well my English was never good enough or my accent was to thick to get a job like that or even go to school and understand what they are teaching me. 

I’m 24 now lost in life don’t know what to do started a new job in machine shop and I feel useless there I don’t know how to use their machines or anything and they knew at the hiring time because they needed an apprentice so I’m basically everyone’s bitch everyone is talking behind my back, and my girlfriend is mad at me because she’s says I’m always very negative which I don’t think I am. I am just very fucking REALISTIC. I am lost I do not know what to do I felt for couple years just basically empty and I don’t see my future I have no friends now no family just my mom and my girlfriend. I have no one to talk to. I feel very lonely sometimes my mood is changing depending on a day but I think that’s everyone. I am usually very happy person and appreciate everything I have. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m lost.",15Apr2019,1

165,"a few years ago i tried to kill myself (multiple times) and the last time, suicide hotline tracked me down and i was in the emergency psych ward for a few days, revealing this big secret of depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts, and eating disorder that i hid from everyone but the internet. i used to be able to open up to strangers a lot and talk about it and vent but now im terrified that someone will report me and ill have an ambulance at my house again and take me away. and this time, since i'm not a minor anymore, be less lenient and lock me up for good

&amp;#x200B;

my boyfriend knows all about this and i told him that he saved my life and now im all okay because of him but im starting to realize that i'm not because whenever we have a fight i get really dramatic and i get all these dark feelings back again and he doesnt know what it does to me. when we argue (which is quite frequent nowadays) i get really upset at myself and i've self harmed again but he doesnt know but he thinks that he knows everything and i open up to him about everything because i promised i will after he found out i had some ideations and opened up to someone else about it (who ended up telling him). 

i dont know what to do because i need to talk to someone but my parents can't know im sad again and my boyfriend can't know it'll just hurt all of them and they'll all get upset again and my boyfriend will feel useless again and i can't disappoint people, again. i just want to vent but i dont know to who because i dont know who to trust anymore because they will just report me or tell me to get ""therapy"" which is not an option for me and i dont want to have to explain again",15Apr2019,1
