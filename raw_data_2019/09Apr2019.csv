0,"I've never been at a point where I feel as hopeless as I do now. I was always a positive person and nothing ever brought me down but after switching to a new school over a year ago things have really changed for me. I switched schools because I have social anxiety and felt very uncomfortable at my old school. I was always worried something was going to happen and I was incredibly nervous about everything. I was scared to go to school because I feared something would go wrong. Because of this I thought switching to online school would be great. Honestly this is a nightmare. My first school year, they told me nothing. I had no idea what was going on. It made me get really far behind and it was really stressful. Finally summer came, which I didn't get to enjoy because the whole time I was lead to believe that I failed my grade. That's what I was told but this semester I was sent everything for the next grade and they revealed that I passed and everything was great. I was excited and positive that I'd do good this school year and everything would be okay and all of this would be over. It isn't over. They give me so many assignments and I just can't do them all. I have an incredibly hard time focusing on school work, I really can't focus at all. I'm not used to it and I have so much trouble doing the school work. It isn't because I don't care, all I want to do is pass this school year and if I don't then I don't know what's going to happen. I was always so excited about my future but now I'm told I won't be accepted at college and I'm going to fail. Every time I say anything my school is brought up. Last night while trying to sleep I started panicking really bad thinking about everything that's going. Not a panic attack, I don't know what you call it. It was just sudden bursts of crying and shaking and curling up and a couple of times I started feeling like I was about to throw up. I have urges to hit myself in the head. I'm scared, I'm worried, I don't know what to do anymore. I really need someone to talk to and help me right now before this gets even worse. If anyone could tell me some site I can go to to get help or talk to someone that would be great. Thanks for reading this.",09Apr2019,4
1,"*throwaway account but will reply*

[18M] I have had a pretty easy life and didn’t really have any troubles until I got into High School. I’ve always been a quiet person until I get to know people and can let my guard down. I don’t really have an explanation/catalyst for my trust issues except for a relationship with a girl that I invested in and got burned. I don’t have many IRL friends that I consider close enough to talk about personal issues like this. I enjoy gaming and have people I spend time with online but I believe my gaming has changed from a healthy way of coping into a way for me to avoid facing my issues. It’s not rare for me to spend 8+ hours a day playing video games. I rarely hang out with my “friends” in real life even though they try to invite me to hang out. I live about 30 miles from the nearest town that has anything remotely enjoyable stuff to do but only about 10 miles from any of my friends. I’m about to graduate from high school and just feel like such a loser for the amount of time I have wasted on playing stupid games. Recently these three girls have been trying to talk to me more (not interested in being in a dating relationship with them and they all have BFs anyway) but I can’t quite tell if they are just trying to toy with me or actually care and I’m just blinded to it because of my trust issues. I think in the back of my mind I know they actually care but it’s just so hard for me to let my guard down to people. I have skipped all of my high school homecomings and proms due to these issues. Prom is coming up and I missed the deadline for a ticket but could probably still get one. I’m terrified of going but feel like I have to because if I don’t I will have missed my last chance for something “fun” in high school, but it doesn’t feel like it’s for me. At the same time though I want to spice my life up but am afraid. This may seem dramatic but it’s very real in my mind.

I believe another one of those issues that affect me is my self-consciousness. I am a little overweight but have a lot of fat for my weight. I used to be very tall and skinny but I would get teased for it (wouldn’t call it bullying as I really don’t believe it was malicious) and it got to my head and I took up eating and gaming as a coping mechanism. I’ve been reading and seeing that exercise can help with depression/sadness (don’t think I’m depressed as I feel fine occasionally and only occasionally dwell on these issues, but been affecting me more lately) but I’m interested in eating healthier and getting fit as I am not comfortable in my own body. I have a small penis that also contributes to my self-consciousness and lack of motivation (yet another mental barrier) for perusing a girlfriend. I think I may have a puberty issue but am too embarrassed to talk to my doctor.

Anxiety is obviously another issue I deal with (pretty obvious, heh). I am going to be going into college this year and have to idea what I’m going to do with my life. Some people tell me it’s okay to not know what I want to do yet. But others (like my family) insist on me knowing what I want to do and I swear the people telling me that I need to know what I want to do are ten times louder than the ones reassuring me.

I never really understood why people commit suicide and always said, “I would never do that” and I’m not saying I’ve had suicidal thoughts, but I can understand how someone feels when they feel terrible all the time. I’m not only looking for advice, but maybe some people just to talk stuff out with. Thank you for reading this far if you happen to. This kind of went into a rant (didn’t intend for it to be) but I needed to get some of this off my chest as I haven’t told anybody.

Probably some edits incoming...",09Apr2019,1
2,"i have really weird feelings of sadness, grief, etc attached to things that shouldn't mean anything, eg. the song 'symphony' makes me feel sick and lose all emotion for a while.

at the same time, when I listen to it, everything goes away and i can isolate myself for a while, its calming in a freaky way.

5,Okay so I want to volunteer for a non-profit that  is  geared towards mental health. I feel like I'm not ready to  volunteer one on one with other people who also struggle with mental health because I'm still trying to figure mine out and don't want to be a bad influence or a trigger for them. I thought about just working behind the scenes for now. Do you think this is a good idea?,09Apr2019,1
6,"I'll probably never see this again.  I made a burner account to throw this up here, if you couldn't tell from the username.  I have been on autopilot for the last 6 months, and before that I was dealing with my ex's descent into paranoid schizophrenia that wound up destroying all of my friendships, my credit, and all of my interests.  By the way, their mental health decline started about 2 months after I moved 2k miles across the country with them which made everything that much worse.  The ex was simultaneously screaming at me because they believed that I was controlling their cell signals, bugging their vehicle, burying bodies in our garden, etc... while also telling everyone I know that I was sexually assaulting them, drugging them, and all sorts of other horrific shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So the long and short of it is that I now have literally zero friends, a majority of my family will no longer allow me to be in their company unless its a large gathering, I lost basically everything I own except for what I could fit into my car and drag back across the country, and I have completely stopped giving a fuck.  I have no interest in anything anymore.  Nothing makes me happy.  Nothing makes me sad.  Nothing phases me.  More and more I feel like I'm witnessing my life from the back of a long movie theater while lying in a sensory deprivation tank.  I feel physical things as if they are being relayed to me verbally through an unbiased third party.  Time is blurred, I can't tell yesterday from 3 weeks ago, and tomorrow seems as far away as the present.  I pick up my guitar and sit stone still, unable to play.  I downloaded my entire steam library and opened each game for about 5 minutes before losing interest and moving onto the next until I was out of them.  I open photoshop and stare at the blank canvass until I wake up, the skin on my forehead creased from where I fell asleep with it resting on the edge of my desk.  I went to a theme park some months ago and sat on a bench near the entrance for 2 hours and left.  I cant tell if my lack of interest and emotion is caused by grief, or if the onset of this was merely coincidental with the bullshit I went through last year.  My ex used to scream at me that I was becoming ""boring"", but at the time I thought it was due to stress from dealing with their mental decline.  Now I don't know.  Maybe my own dissociation exacerbated their grounding to reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't get help.  I can't afford it.  As I said before, my reputation has been completely destroyed, and unfortunately that extends to most of my professional contacts I've made over the years as my ex saw to it that everyone I knew on facebook was DM'd copy-pasted testimonials of my crimes.  I tried to appeal to people, but I quickly found my friends list shrinking, and those left generally either ignore me or are just ""friends-list 'friends'"" and not anyone I really care about anyways.  So I'm stuck with jobs with shit pay, shit benefits, and zero mental health plans.  I cant even afford the normal doctor, and fortunately the last time I got sick I had leftover antibiotics or I likely would have had to make the choice between a doctors visit and rent.  I finally wrote a cease and desist letter on some fake attorney's letterhead and sent it to my ex's family and since then new slander has stopped, but the damage has been done.  But that's beside the point.  I am   stuck. I am alone.  I am detached.  Nothing helps.  I have had multiple dreams of suicide and when I wake up I feel relief, not fear.  I don'y know how to meet new people, being well out of school and in a job where I come into almost zero contact with other humans.  I keep looking up local events, thinking that I can break the isolation, then I remember that I would almost certainly wind up sitting in a corner, more miserable than ever.  

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be a very social person, now I feel abject terror when the store clerk asks me if I have a rewards card.  I used to draw, animate, and play in a band.  Now anytime I start to attempt to think about doing anything creative I immediately hate myself for having the arrogance to think that I can do anything worthwhile.  I think about going back to school and hate myself for the same reasons.  Then I hate myself for being a coward.  Then I hate myself for hating myself and then usually wake up with the same forehead-desk-marks as listed above.  I hate myself right now for writing this, and was only really able to by creating a fake e-mail, reddit account, and using a VPN to do so, but I guarantee that I will probably delete this post tomorrow when I am overcome with remorse and shame for posting something that is anonymous and untraceable.",09Apr2019,1

8,"First and foremost, this is *not* any kind of gender dysphoria - I have no feelings of discomfort with my body. But when I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t feel any sense of identity or belonging to my face. I recognise that it’s me, I *know* it’s me, but I simply don’t feel like it belongs there. I’m not happy or satisfied. 

And it’s the same with my name. It feels wrong when people refer to me by it - whether it’s a parent, sibling, teacher, even my girlfriend.  The exception is my friends, for some reason that doesn’t bother me. Sometimes I’ll dwell on it, saying my name over and over, and it just feels *wrong*. It makes me uncomfortable to hear it. 

I’ve felt this way my entire life. I have a memory of being around 3-4, and watching myself crying in the mirror for some reason; and I get this feeling that it’s unnatural and isn’t what I feel I look like.

So we both have a room, and at one point in time only her room had wifi so every time I did something for uni i did it in her room. Sometimes I would pace and touch some of her things that were on the dresser or something (I would never open anything or snoop). One day without any warning she had a lock on her room door and a day later she sent me a very angry sms(mind you we live in the same flat). I told her that we had spoken many times about how if she has any issue she needs to talk to me, and that I didnt know that would bother her so much I apoligised to her and we had a talk where I told her that I respect her privacy and will never walk in her room ever again, and asked her for the next time something bothers her she should tell me and not quite litterally lock herself out. Everything seemed fine, but the lock is still on..and I am very hurt by that because we are REALLY GOOD friends. She agreed that she overreacted and we had a chat and I tought this was solved and will never ocur again. I dont know why she mistrustes me so much, i never did anything before to upset her nor did I ever deem her emotions as not relevant i just think mine are relevant too. I cant invite anyone over because they would see the giant lock on the door and ill have to explain that she thinks Im a theif.

10,"Diagnosed Bipolar I and generalized anxiety. With the help of my Psychiatrist, my mood and anxiety have been managed well for a few years now. However, my husband announced last week that he feels it is time to end our marriage, and I'm suddenly back to feeling down, worthless, and panicky as hell.

Due to my issues with my mental health, in addition to a handful of problems with my physical health, I have been unable to work since 2017. My husband took control of the money and our assets, and after the divorce is finalized, I won't have anything- no home, no car, no health insurance.

The rational part of me knows that I'll figure out housing and transportation and that everything will be okay, but I am experiencing episodes of intense suicidal ideation, which is something I had managed to kick a long time ago. But now I can't stop thinking about how I am about to lose the life I have been building for the past seven years, and that my best option is to die rather than struggle on my own.

15,"Hello, 

To start off I have Major Depressive Disorder and I go to college full-time. I'm an honors student and I'll be graduating with a bachelors degree in about a year. I got my associates degree before this and I was usually able to manage my anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder) and depression pretty well. This semester I feel like I've been thrown for a loop. At the beginning of the semester I started to get dental procedures done because of intense pain that couldn't wait until break (when I normally do anything). Four months in and I still have pain all the time. I can't eat on one side of my mouth and the dentists aren't sure exactly what is causing it. It's been a lot of waiting around to do anything. During this I haven't been sleeping well at night. Both my anxiety and depression has grown significantly worse through all the chronic intense pain. The anxiety (more than the pain) has been what keeps me up at night. 

I know the best thing is to figure out how to fix the pain, but in the mean time is there any other tips that can be given for dealing with anxiety and depression that is triggered by pain?",09Apr2019,5

19,"So I’ve never posted about it before and literally have never talked to others about my emotions so I hope this is the right place.

For as long as I can remember I’ve suffered from depression and extreme social anxiety to the point where I start profusely sweating and really just try to exit quick/avoid any and all conversations.  Often times in these situations I close myself out and become I guess like a “clam” with a thick shell. People who don’t know me and those that I haven’t opened up to never believe me and think I am a social butterfly because I do hide it and internalize it very well saving all of the emotions for later to either take out in the gym or on myself.

I feel like these issues stem from being extremely overweight throughout almost all of my child/teenage years, having little to no friends during this time, being picked on/groped by other boys/girls for having large breast’s, molestation and made worse from my military service where I was a Army medic. 

I’ve since then lost the weight, even the weight (twice) I gained leaving the army, which made me 300+ lbs and to other people am fairly attractive I guess even though I have 0 idea of how to take or handle compliments. It’s helped a lot to know I look somewhat decent to others even though I can’t accept it myself and often times shower or go to the bathroom in the dark so I don’t have to look at myself.

I’m 29 now have a wife and a decent federal job I’m. I’ve left my hometown behind and have moved to a new state to start fresh but battle daily/weekly with my constant “ups” and “downs” . Finally this year I’ve started to realize my emotions and the bi weekly swing I go through where I’m “manic” and am a social butterfly and really am trying to control it not only for myself but for my family and wife. 

I just feel like I keep failing especially at work during those periods of low energy/depression where I really just want to go into the mountains and disappear. I’m on my low today and my coworkers (who don’t understand) keep asking me if I’m ok, why am I angry, what’s wrong, and saying things like I shouldn’t be angry, or you don’t have kids what’s your problem, which just perpetuates my current feelings. I know some of it might be out of compassion but also realize some just want to egg me on being the “big guy” in the office I just don’t want to blow a fuse on them so I go for a walk. 

Idk I don’t want this to be a soapbox but I just felt like getting some things off my chest and my mind.

28,"Hi all,
 
I am posting on here looking for suggestions on what I can try next.
 
Nearly 5 years ago I was diagnosed with hsv2 which has since caused me to become very very depressed and anxious. I have tried to kill myself twice, but obviously failed. I have lost any ability to feel anything except shame, guilt, anger, sadness and disgust. I see only the bad in the world now.
Before my diagnosis I was doing well with modelling and acting in ads, I was also starting to get noticed for my stand-up shows, Now I can’t even look a casher in the eyes when thanking them. Not to mention, the stress of this all caused me to suffer from adult acne and now my face is so scarred and haggered I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without feeling sick, let alone be in any pictures. To put a long story short, my life has been completely destroyed by this diagnosis. I do feel I don’t deserve to live anymore due to this. It’s a huge mind fuck because all I think about is killing myself but I also don’t want to die. I just want to stop thinking and hurting all the time. I have tried so many different things to come to peace with my new reality.
 
I can’t remember everything but here’s a few:
 
Anti-depressants (about 10 different ones)
Counselling
Giving up weed
Giving up alcohol
Quitting smoking
Meditation
Exercise
Eating healthy
Losing weight
Reiki
Hypnotherapy
Sleep hypnosis
Hydrotherapy
Breaking up with my boyfriend

-          Not to mention all the little wanky things I’ve been advised to do like “Think positive”  “Smell some flowers” wank wank wank.
 
I gave up seeing a psychiatrist a few weeks ago. Not her fault, she was very lovely and tried hard to make me feel better but I just come back to the same conclusion as always – hsv is incurable. No matter how hard I work to fix my mental health I will always be a walking sexual leaper. And horror and a joke. I I also felt too guilty using my cities mental health system, They are severely understaffed and underfunded and due to lots of tragedies in our city over the past 10 years heaps of people are struggling with mental illness. I just felt so guilty stealing help away from someone who might actually be able to get better.
Sorry to prattle, I used to love writing and I since I can’t talk to anyone about this I get carried away telling my story. I tried really hard to keep it as short as possible.
 
 
 
So does anyone have any suggestions on what I could try now? Electroshock therapy? LSD? DMT? Brainwashing?
If I am honest I don’t believe I will ever be happy or at peace whilst I live with this disease, but maybe I can get my brain fried or damaged or rewired or something .
Anyways, thank you guys for reading this. I am sorry its so full of self-pity. I’m currently going through a massive depressive spell.
 
Any advice on what I should try is greatly appreciated.
 
-          Also I am aware that some people might feel very angry at my for being hsv2 positive and I understand but please don’t mock and/or abuse me for it.

Had very vivid day dreams of all these different problems and solutions when it comes to work,everything. This is where I had a very real and nerve wracking dream. Woke up in my room my whole body feels like it has weights on it. Look at the tv screen the options menu is going crazy moving around, remembering that I’m alone I start to realize I’m having another one of these. I hear high pitched noises and weird tones coming from the darkest parts in my room which are for some reason even darker. That feeling of anxiety that most people feel in the chest is all over my body, it felt like I was made of static. I close my eyes and start violently taking deep breathes. Open them again and look in dark scary corner, this feeling throughout my body amplifies after I hear an even higher pitched almost like a screech now. And swooshing sound to left. These noises get closer and closer to my face and I feel completely shaken, then wake up. Rooms normal,I can move my arms and legs properly, no noises. That whole thing lasted I’d guess maybe 2 -3 minutes. It used to last a lot longer and happen very frequently,even multiple times in the same night.The weird thing when it does happens, which it hasn’t in almost a year before, I’m always in the same position I went to sleep in, my room is completely normal and before this weird head trip happens,I always think I’m awake.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not exactly sure where this belongs, so this is one of a few subreddits I will post this on. So I have been trying and failing to start a peer-led support group in my area for those with an ambiguous psychiatric diagnostic situation ( conflicting professional opinions, lack of access to assessment, potential misdiagnosis ) and am wondering if any of you could offer ideas and suggestions as to what you find helpful, and where you would look, if you were to consider joining such a group. I would like to get a rough idea of what features might be worth striving for as I continue to try and get the group started. As far as my background is concerned, I have very little organizing experience, no psychological training, and am a person who has gotten too many opinions from too many professionals over a period of years, starting as a kid, who would like to see if I can bring people in a similar situation together to help each other. What are your initial thoughts? Thanks.",09Apr2019,2

35,"Ok, so I have been showing signs of psychosis for a long time. When I was 10 It became extremely noticeable. My mother thought I just wanted attention and refused to admit something was seriously wrong, so she left it for 4 years. (I am now 14.) It was finally after a series of extremely bad hallucinations and mental break downs she took me to a doctor. 

  The doctor recommended me to a psychiatrist/phycoligist (can't remeber which one.) and I am going on the 10th of this month. (April) 

  when I was 10 their was a clear line between what was real and what wasn't. Now that line (although not completely gone) has become extremely blurred. I also started experiencing a new type of hallucinations where I feel as though someones touching me.  (Tapping me grabbing me, etc.)

   I can't tell my father nor anyone on his side, luckly they live in a diffrent province. You see my uncle had scitzoprenia, he was put on pills for it and killed himself with those pills. My uncle was my brothers dad so I can't reach out about my psychosis as I don't want to re open old wounds.

The stakes are actually serious, the grind is somehow more boring than physical labor jobs. Between anxiety about real consequences and unease from unrelenting boredom, I think I was actually happier working a shittier job and drinking myself to death.

And above all, I don't feel like I've changed much. I still have no real friends, still am trapped with parents trying to pay down debt, and still feel like I'm stuck in that ""learning to adult"" phase.

37,"Recently I went into a brief stay at an inpatient care center. It was in there that I realized how truly debilitating and destructive my equally abysmal and grotesquely mercurial mental health  has been. I now possess an almost palpable understanding of a need for consistent treatment in my life. 

I haven’t seen a therapist regularly since a very young age and I’ve been informed of its efficacy when done in conjunction with medication. 

However, I’m a college student taking four classes and working part time next quarter and I’m afraid I will simply not be able to manage the required tasks of each duty in addition to working on my mental health. I, very luckily, have the financial privilege of quitting my job in order to focus on school and receiving treatment. 

Nevertheless, I feel incredibly guilty and inadequate for quitting my job (if I do so). I feel as though I’m a failure for not being able to hold the job. It’s a wonderful job working at my college coordinating funding and events for student organizations. I feel like I’ll never be able to achieve my life goals if I can’t even hold a fucking job and deal with school and mental health.

38,"Lately, eating has been either on or off. Mostly off, if I\`m being honest. I\`m a sophmore in college and I guess this issue started with me late Junior year of highschool. I think this started with me using it as a punishment for myself. I\`m bipolar and when I felt like I acted poorly because of my own mental health that it meant I was bad and so I don\`t deserve things. I still think like this sometimes. I won\`t eat for days sometimes though, even when I don\`t think I\`m punishing myself. I just won\`t eat and eventually I won\`t feel hungry but my energy will fall through the floor. I do this and then one night I\`ll eat a pretty good amount of food, then feel guilty and not eat the next day. I don\`t think I have an eating disorder, I like my body but I also think I look nice after I don\`t eat for a day or two. I just feel really ashamed about all of this and I don\`t know what I did to myself to get here.

41,"Some background: 4 years ago (i was 20) i went through a very dark phase in my life. I (thought) i had no friends and people didnt want me around. I had no girlfriend and was constantly fighting with my parents, and I've never been close with my extended family ( haven't spoken to aunt's uncle's or cousins in years, still to this day) so i felt my family mostly hated me or just didnt care. I had no job despite looking (i had just recently lost my job as a farmhand). I was lonely and felt subhuman. Like i didnt deserve the things that make people, well... people.

This led me to a phase of pill/alcohol abuse, but i never really became physically addicted (no withdrawal to speak of at all and had no problems quitting) which led to self harm and an attempted suicide and subsequent hospitalization. I went to a therapist after discharge where i confessed to still feeling the same level of depression where he, on the spot, called the cops and had them escort me to a ""psychological rehabilitation center"" as he said i was still a threat to myself (even though i wasnt self harming nor did i feel like a threat to myself)

Flash forward 4 years later and i have a girlfriend that ive been seeing for 3 years, plenty of friends and a job, but want to see a therapist just for someone to talk to and work through some things that i need help with, but he believes i should see a drug/alcohol counselor because i have a beer or two after work. 

To an extent i guess i understand, because an addict never stops being an addict, but before i was shitfaced drunk all the time to kill a deep pain and i really wasn't an addict (i know actual alchoholics and im not even close), but now im almost never drunk (i probably get slightly/reasonably drunk once every month or two socially with close friends who love me, and i love them) and have little to no pain to kill. I just have a beer or two after work and maybe a few more on a weekend, and even then its not everyday, and i haven't touched any kind of pill or even prescribed medication in 4 years (since the hospitalization), i just smoke a little weed when i party with my friends. 

The problem is that the more i say this, the more it sounds like denial, so the more they push the idea that im an alchoholic/drug addict. Im not depressed like i was, and im handling my anxiety pretty well. My friends and girlfriend have helped a lot, and are very supportive, i just have a few things to work through that i cant do alone/with just my friends and girlfriend, but the more they blow my ""problem"" out of proportion the less i think they can help.

It feels theyre doing more harm than good.",09Apr2019,2
42,"So me and my brother are 20 and 21 respectively and live with our parents (we commute to the same college together). My brother is very explosive and will lose his temper quickly over the smallest things. He often takes his frustrations out on me, his younger brother. Even though I’m 1 year younger than him, we do everything together, and I think he’s jealous to see that I’m doing better than him in a lot of areas, so I think he sees me as a target. Anyways, he usually just screams on the top of his lungs at me and says things that are so nasty and so rude, but tonight he started to get physically violent. He hurled objects at me that would seriously hurt if it had hit me. I locked myself in my room and piled heavy objects in front of the door. I doubt this will happen but part of me is scared he will unlock the door and force his way in and try to hurt me further in my sleep when I’m vulnerable.

43,"I first started hearing voices a couple years ago. About 3 or 4 years. I never made it a deal or told anyone about it because it wasn't more than a minor annoyance. But there was this one voice that stuck out. He was the loudest and the most confident of all of them. I ended up taking a fondness for him in a time of loneliness. I gave him a personality, I gave him a name and made and knew every little quirk that he had. So until recently, I started making friends, and I tried to distance myself from him. But after enjoying my new friends, I realized something. One of my closest friends, was _terrifyingly_ similar to him. Not even similar, more like a dead replica of him. Everything from the physical appearance to every single flaw and imperfection. I don't know why or how this happened, but it mortifies me to the bone.

44,"17f. I'm diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, but there's a whole bunch more that i'm sorting through with my therapist at the moment.
this is gonna sound weird. sometimes I ""fantasise"" about having a panic attack and having someone come help me, or fainting and having people worried about me. I never ever fake anything, but I can't help but imagine scenarios where I get anxious and I think about how people react. My parents were very very shitty growing up, both physically and emotionally, (i don't like to say the actual word) so i know i might just want attention or something like that? I don't know. Someone please explain why my brain is being weird like this. 

second question: I'm well aware of how awful my parents were. sure, i can't remember like most of my childhood, but i know what happened, and i hate them for it. But i can't say what it was. It's obvious, and i'm fine with people knowing, I just can't say or type that word. (It's five letters, starts with a and ends with e) I hate seeing that word. Saying it, hearing it, typing it or reading it just makes me anxious and sick to my stomach. But why? It's not like im in denial about what i went through. I just can't bring myself to say the word.

last question:
I often will get bursts of confidence, typically when I play this sport that I love. I get happy and I absolutely love myself. All is good in the world. But the smallest thing happens and it all comes tumbling down, and i feel like the scum of the earth. Why does that change so quickly? is that normal??

thanks for any and all answers! I don't get to meet with my therapist very often so I'd really love some help.  :)",09Apr2019,1
45,"I'm 23 years old and have been basically alone my whole life. I've been in two long-term toxic relationships that shattered me, I grew up with an abusive father who mentally tormented my family for years, and I have never had close friends or experiences. I'm analytical and reserved by nature. I'm not funny, I have no stories to tell or funny things to say, and nobody ever wants to hang out or be around me unless they're forced to through work, being in projects together, or some other means where being around me is by force.

This year, I'm traveling with a sports team doing analytics work. In September, I was absolutely crushed by a girl I really liked, but flaked on two months without notice. Nothing has gone right for me. I don't fit into this culture. I'm not a jock, I don't like strip clubs, and I'm just not funny. I don't know. Everywhere I go, I stand silent in hatred of myself because I have nothing to say, and even if I did, I hate myself and have no confidence in myself to where even if I thought I had something to say, I'd keep my mouth shut out of fear of judgement or being made fun of. As a result, I'm always close to the vest, I was always shit on in school or told I didn't matter. I don't want to be judged, mocked, hurt, or give people a reason to dislike me - so I shut up and be alone.

I thought this new job would revitalize me. Traveling with a team was never ideal - excessive travel is bad for my head, but the opportunity to grow in an industry I love was tempting. It's a good job, but I feel unqualified. I feel like I don't deserve this job. I feel like the other three guys who have this job are smarter, have their shit more together, and can do more than me. As I'm struggling to just get my requirements sorted out, they are off going above and beyond, always having time to do advanced independent work that will help them be full time. I fight and fight and fight for what I want in life, but no matter what, I feel unqualified. I'm not creative, I need direction and instruction to succeed. I'm personable, but any sense of intelligence people get from me is a facade. People think I know so much more than I do - I probably conned these people into giving me this job. All I do is walk around like a deer in headlights. I feel like a fraud who deserves nothing. I was almost homeless looking for a job in this industry because I love it so much. Yet through all the sacrifice and fight, I have no faith in my intellect. I know nothing. And I keep my mouth shut.

Women don't like me. I'm awkward, I can't talk to women. I have nothing to say. I'm not funny, I can't make one laugh. I'm polite and kind, but I'm dull and serious. I can't lighten up because I can't let loose. I think I'm hideously ugly. I never get matches. And when I do online, I get no replies because my first line is awkward as all fuck because I don't know how to talk to women. In reality, I'm about as average as one gets. 5'9, average body, decent looking, nothing offensive. But, I'm not tall or rich or jacked or funny - no one would want to be around me. Look at all the options out there. Again, back on the common theme of people only being around me if it is by force. All I can attract are people who are morbidly obese. And sorry if that sounds sucky, but I deserve someone who tries as hard as I do. I don't need to be with a supermodel, but I deserve someone kind and caring and who tries. Don't I? Or am I doomed to settle with someone I hate out of fear of loneliness?

So in short, I'm an idiot, an asshole, with no personality or life experiences to make myself appear likable. Nobody is with me by choice. At work, I'm the dumbest of three people despite all I worked for. I can't get a date because I guess I'm ugly as all sin. This new job is just me surrounded by jocks who I cant talk to, so I'm awkward. I can't talk to girls because I'm awkward. I have ZERO life experience. No fun memories, I've always been alone, on the brink of poverty, clawing for the little I have. I'm tired of hating myself. I'm tired of seeing people with pictures of friends all over, while mine are all alone. I'm tired of hating who I am and always keeping my mouth shut because I'll be judged and hated. I don't even deserve what I fought for because I might as well be a used-car salesman. So fucking tired of being alone.",09Apr2019,1

I can hardly keep my attention on one thing, until I do. But, when I do, it’s as if I’m stuck in a trance, unable to break it. I feel the time slowly ticking by, as I try to do my work, but can’t pay attention. It’s a struggle to not glance around the room, hum, talk, move, listen, move, move, listen.

And then, this lack of control causes extreme agitation and anger, a heat and tightness in my chest (could be due to anxiety). It’s a shitty, terrible feed-back loop.

51,"I recently dropped out of college for the third time.

The problem wasn't that I couldn't understand the material, or that I couldn't pass the tests, it was that I just didn't *care*. The only class I really tried at was one where I worked in a consistent group, and the others relied on me. In that class, I did my best and did quite well until the point where I just gave up on everything, due to being massively behind in other classes.

And this has been a consistent thing. The same thing made me drop out each time, the same thing effected me in high school and forced me to be homeschooled. But after homeschooling, I did well enough on the SAT and ACT to get accepted to an Ivy League college, so I'm pretty sure I'm not just dumb as a rock.

I think that part of the problem was my upbringing. When I was 9, my parents began to move about every six months, starting me in one school one place, only to take me out 45 days later and put me into another school for six months, and then out and into another school for the rest of the semester. This continued for the duration of High School.

Ever since then, nothing feels permanent, and nothing feels like it's worth putting effort into, because it will be gone in six months. I've not had a friend since I was 9, I've not had a hobby besides reading and gaming. I just can't seem to care.

Which isn't to say I can't hold down a job. I've worked several jobs, and as long as I don't care about them, I do just fine. My last job, both of my bosses personally told me they'd give me a letter of recommendation before I even asked them about it. But I find it hard to be motivated to work, since I never spend my money on anything. I've currently got 25k in the bank and the most expensive thing I've bought in the last month that wasn't food or gas was a 15 dollar bottle of ink for my fountain pen.

I've tried traveling; I've been to 16 countries and 49 states. But without people to do it with, it all feels pointless. But I feel like I can't possibly build friendships when I always just move away in a few months. 

I don't drink, I don't smoke, I run 4 to 8 miles a day. I eat healthy. But a lack of negatives is not, itself, a positive. And I find myself staying up until 4 or 5 in the morning, until I'm tired enough I don't have to *think* while I'm trying to sleep.

53,"I feel like the term depression doesn't quite cut it. I don't understand the point of those hotlines, or suicide prevention in general, unless someone is psychotic or high maybe. I never felt like I matched the expectations of what psychiatrists and therapists tried to treat. I understand where they're coming from and their ways of thinking, but there's no real substance to the counterpoints against suicide. It's like one of those philosophical discussions where the conclusion purely depends on the initial beliefs, and I dislike such arguments because I'm not a philosopher (my field is data analysis). I know there's the social argument against suicide, and how it harms the social environment, but that line of thinking ultimately puts the greater good above the suffering of the individual. Maybe I've been depressed for too long. I don't know if there's any point to keep pushing myself through the mental health system. Medication is mostly side effects and therapy sessions are mostly leading in circles. i don't feel like anything is really changing. I like to question myself and let someone show me that I'm wrong, but it's not happening. The more years pass the more I feel that my depression was just right all along.

I have had severe anxiety, PTSD, and depression since I was 4 years old when I was locked in a closet 24/7 by my fathers girlfriend who mentally abused me, physically, and molested me with her friends (*If you want to know what happened after let me know*). At the age of 15, ma and I had to leave everything behind to escape from my sister who threatened to hurt us. We went from shelter to shelter and by the time we found an apartment we were mentally fucked. We both suffer from ptsd and having two minds like that clash caused us to be mentally abusive with each other (*at first*). She would constantly threaten to kick me out since the age of 16 (*I am 22 now*) whenever I did something wrong. Ever since that age, I have been always scared every day on whether or not I will be kicked out. Now when I was 17-18 years old she became bed bound. She can walk, but only short distances with assistance depending on how her body is doing because of this I became her caretaker at age 17. Constantly helping her and putting her first instead of my own. This has put a mental toll on me because when I was in high school I always had a 3.5 GPA, in college a 3.2 GPA, but had to drop out because the stress of taking care of my mother was getting too much for me mentally and physically. I would be the only one doing the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, walking the dogs, going with her to her doctor appointments,etc. None of it is appreciated (*by the way I am mentally and physically disabled so it took a toll on my body too so I couldnt get a job*) because she says it is her money why should be appreciate anything I do by spending her money? That is what she says, I am like I use my time to take care of you, I don't have to, but I do it because I care. This mentally took a toll on me by making my conditions worse and causing me to stop caring for my future and the health of the apartment which resulted in us to get roaches. The constant stress has had me get another disorder called Disassociation Disorder where it is hard to connect with myself with reality and others. It has gotten so bad that when I tried to leave she has gotten physical with me to get my phone to prevent any communication with people to help me leave (she has done this too many times to count). One time this happened she got physical with me, slapped me, clawed me, grabbed my hair, got on top of me, then my fight or flight instincts kicked in and ended up hitting her on the head twice because I was so scared. She went limp and I tried to make sure she was okay and helped her back to bed. Shit like this has had me scared ever since. Reminder her and I would curse at each other, but my mother went beyond that...Even though my mom is disabled I have seen her fight off people full strength that hits like a man because of her neuropathy which causes her muscles to be tight all the time which also gives you super strength that makes you hit like a man. She even prevented from bringing my stuff because it was hers even though my expensive stuff I bought with my money was mine, but she said it was hers since it was through her card, so I was stuck.  


**Currently:** She signed the lease online pretending to be me and signed my name herself online. I understand she is bedridden, but recently she told me that I am a sociopath and have no hope for me getting better (*summed up version*). I wanted to take her electric chair (*currently hard to walk because of my problems crippling me*) drive down to the huge canal and drive off of it. I have never really done suicide, but at that moment I just wanted peace. Luckily after a card reading (I was told to follow love for myself or another) and god listening peace has shown up... Right now I am so scared of leaving because of what my mother has done to me in the past. My best friend of 10 years (*boyfriend of 4 years of when we were children, currently dating again as of March 28th*) has offered me to move in with him. I am going to have to leave everything behind except the stuff I bought, not ever all the stuff I bought, just the most important. I am so petrified that she will find me and have me arrested for something I didn't do. I don't care if I have to pay an exit fee, but I doubt I have to since she has housing and I am not on it. I know she has services that can get her an in-home nurse to help her.   


**Questions:** Do you think I am in the wrong? Do you think I could possibly be arrested for just up and leaving? Do you think I can get arrested for infesting an apartment with roaches and leaving?   


**Conclusion?:** I mean I am willing to pay money if they say I owe it, but legally I mean. I just am scared to be in this apartment one more day. Next Monday or Tuesday I am packing my bookbag with my stuff and my boyfriend is going to get me a ticket to where he currently lives. I will let yall know how it goes when I am in the arms of my boyfriend safe again...",09Apr2019,1
55,"Hello! I am still doing the A to Z blogging challenge and I am writing posts around mental illness, mental health and mental health awareness every day. I share some of them here because I thought they'd be helpful to people who might not understand their condition, or want to learn more! This post is about Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. You can find the original post here: [https://deviantdaeva.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/c-is-for-c-ptsd/](https://deviantdaeva.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/c-is-for-c-ptsd/)

&amp;#x200B;

Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is linked to complex trauma. Unlike Post-traumatic stress disorder, that is based upon a single event, CPTSD is often linked to long-term childhood trauma. Complex trauma does not only mean long-term, it also means that the trauma happened in a situation where there was no way out. The person was trapped in the situation, and there was nowhere to turn for help, no way to escape. The reason why some people who have been through childhood trauma, develop C-PTSD and others don’t, is that there was no safe person to turn to. This kind of situation, especially when going on for a long time, creates something called learned helplessness, You get conditioned that you are indeed helpless, and that kind of feeling follows you even later in life, when even the tiniest problems make you feel overwhelmed and frozen, and you are unsure about what to do. Examples of complex trauma are emotional, physical and sexual childhood abuse, domestic violence, trafficking, being a prisoner at war, sprititual abuse. These kinds of things are more common that one might think, because most of them do not get reported. It is first much later in life that someone suddenly feels the effects of the trauma again (often when actually moving away and starting their own lives), and the first stage of feelings is often denial. Childhood abuse, trafficking, domestic violence, ritual abuse and abuse during wartimes do more often than not, go unreported.

Alright, so, you are in a traumatic situation that lasts for a long time, and you can’t get out. So what do you do? The reaction is very closely linked to Stockholm Syndrome: you adapt to the situation and you soothe, obey to and please the abuser. That is all that they can do, really. To make it through, mentally. They believe in what they have been told, they connect to the abusers in a way so that it makes sense to them. Because the abusive situation is all they know, all they need to get through, all they need to adapt to. It is here where conditioning often comes in, the victim believes what they are being told about themselves and the world, they trust the abusers, they often even walk the path of agreeing with that they deserve the pain they are going through. Because how else would you be able to make sense of what is happening? There is nothing else, there is no way out, there is no one to question those beliefs or to tell you otherwise. And all this is going to hit them hard when they are out of the abusive situation because now they still hold on to those beliefs of themselves, hence, they have a warped view of themselves, the world and the people who abused them.

There are many symptoms of C-PTSD, like: depression, anxiety, dissociation, affect dysregulation, unstable relationships, denial, self-harm, suicidal behaviour, nightmares, flashbacks, inability to trust others, loss of system of meaning/belief, learned helplessness, toxic shame, self-blame, hurt inner child, hypervigilance, lack of confidence, avoidance, constant search for a saviour, fawning behaviour, physical symptoms like pain and much more.

I think it is important to add that C-PTSD is not in the DSM-V, the official diagnostic manual for psychiatry in the USA. But, it is a working diagnosis, and has been for many many years, with trauma centers, psychiatrists and therapists offering specific support for those struggling with complex trauma issues. The experts in the field assume that it is only a matter of time until C-PTSD gets its rightful place in the diagnostic manual.

## It defines you

C-PTSD defines you. That is a harsh thing to say, but unfortunately it affects almost every part of one’s life, of one’s thoughts, of one’s behaviour. Peter Walker talks about the four types of trauma response that people who have been through complex trauma have adapted to: fight, flight, freeze and fawn. It is uncommon to be one pure type, most people with C-PTSD are hybrids. Basically, whatever worked best for your survival during the trauma, is a behaviour that you later in life employ to almost all areas of your life, but mostly those that involve human interactions, like friendships, romantic relationships, work. So your choice or lack of friends and partners and your career choices, have very much to do with what you have been through earlier in your life. The fight type often pushes away all responsibilities, is known to be aggressive and dominant. The fawn type is silent, soothing and takes a submissive position. The flight type is often a busy bee that has no time for closer relationships and is instead more career-focused. And the freeze type is avoiding and withdrawing from most human interactions and is known to live in their own minds a lot.

And it is not only that, the learned helplessness that you got conditioned with, keeps you stuck in life. You do not know how to take control, how to make decisions, how to speak up for yourself. All you know is to please and to freeze.

## Denial and Toxic Shame

As if all that I have mentioned isn’ t bad enough, two of the main symptoms of C-PTSD are denial and toxic shame. Denial, you say? How can one deny that they have been through trauma? A lot of times someone does not even know that what they have been through is not considered “normal”. and even if they did, they blame themselves for what has happened. Remember the Stockholm Syndrome? The trauma victim is emotionally attached to the abuser, the might even adore them, so how could they even want to admit that something really bad happened? If you acknowledge and admit that you have been through trauma, then you would have to change your whole view of yourself and your life. You would have to re-narrate your own story. So a lot of times people minimize what has happened in the past, because they just don’t want to deal with the effects that it has on them now and would have on their life if it came out. The thing is, everything we bottle up will eventually push to come out. The trauma needs to be processed, sooner or later, and that involves a grieving process.

Another part of this is toxic shame and self-blame. There has been some discussions on if C-PTSD actually should be classed as a shame disorder and not an anxiety disorder. Unhealthy levels of shame are called toxic shame. The term *toxic* here means that it poisons and corrupts every part of one’s being and has a corrosive effect on the individual’s psychological outlook, emotional states and ability to maintain a positive self-image. It affects every part of one’s behaviour and well-being. Someone who has been through complex trauma in the past, the toxic shame they have experienced during the traumatic situation continues even when they are safe. It is an automatic reaction in interpersonal relationships and when looking at the past. Toxic shame easily leads to self-blame and guilt.

For survivors of complex trauma, the source and trigger for the toxic shame they experience, comes from the original trauma. A lot of times it is about childhood trauma, where the child has been put in a devastating position. As children we are dependent upon caregivers to provide us with a sense of safety and connection to the world. When those caregivers are abusive, we are faced with a dilemma: your biological drive to seek closeness from the very source of the terror you feel a need  to escape from. So that conflict is often solved by blaming oneself: children will develop a fantasy that they are bad kids relying upon good parents to avoid confronting the terrifying reality that they are good kids relying upon bad parents.

## Emotional Flashbacks

Emotional flashbacks are very specific to complex trauma and C-PTSD. While other types of flashbacks are terrible, this is one is terrible and confusing. It takes victims of complex abuse a long time to even recognize this feeling as a flashback because you feel the emotions but you do not understand what they are related to.

Imagine that all the negative emotions you have ever felt, hit you at once. All the despair, all the fear, all the anger, all the sadness, all the hopelessness, all the helplessness, the feeling of no way out, all the self-hatred, all the absolute terror. All these feelings are all at once attacking you. You feel as if you are in the traumatic situation, emotionally, without being in survival mode. All these feelings you had to push down to survive, to soothe the abuser, they suddenly are there. All those feelings you never allowed to come out because you did not know what they would do to you. Your soul is being shredded into pieces. Your brain is screaming. And all you want is for it to stop, because you can’t handle it.

Emotional flashbacks are confusing because they are often not obviously connected to a traumatic situation, and first seem like an overly emotional reaction to something small, or to nothing at all. A lot of times this is where C-PTSD becomes clear to the victims, when emotional flashbacks are being explained to them. They are not being oversensitive, they are actually experiencing flashbacks!",09Apr2019,2

58,"I understand that this issue may not be as severe as some other issues, but I really have to get some external opinion on this.

The background context is a little long but it relates heavily to my overall question so please bear with me.

I've always had problems with friendships, whether that be betrayal or trust issues (I was on the receiving end). A couple of months ago I got out of a toxic relationship but the whole aftermath really turned into a huge mess. Either way, I feel as if after that, my mental health has been completely deteriorating. I've become close friends with people outside of my original group, one of which is a guy (I'm a girl and my friend group primarily consists of girls also). No one has told or hinted to me before but the more I think about it, the more I can see that one of my friends may possibly like this guy in question. However, this guy friend of mine has been one of the most supportive and kind people to me (I daresay the most) who has helped me through the breakup and also all kinds of things.. Is it selfish to say that I don't want to stop talking to him just because of my friend? I still have no certain evidence that she does like him. The reason I've been feeling this way is that she and her closer friends have been seeming to isolate me more with each day. The friends (who are also my friends but more her's, as I have been friends with them for shorter) seem fine to me over messages and even extremely kind but cold in real life. Ever since I have noticed this, I keep overthinking things and keep getting the feeling that every one of my friends hates me to come extent. I've actively tried to ignore this and tell myself that I'm just overthinking this, but I can't shake the feeling that everyone has been distancing themselves from me. Perhaps the reason is that I adore each one of them a lot and I  do not feel as if I had done anything personally to offend them, and they're not people who will hate someone for no reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friendships aside, I had dated someone who was severely suicidal and had abusive parents and siblings. I broke up with him due to the toxicity of our relationship but I have not yet been able to recover properly as we keep having run-ins as we have many mutual friends (at school). To keep it short, he attempted suicide when I broke up with him which affected not only me but my (and his) friends too, which is plays a role in the whole conflict between myself and them.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to myself, I've had a history of self harm and panic attacks but I haven't seen a professional to be diagnosed so I'll avoid making any assumptions. The recent events have been bothering me for almost every second and it's lead to myself obsessing over things I have no control over. Seeing a professional seems to be the best option but there are problems that my family are facing right now and I feel that it is not the right time to introduce such a heavy factor. 

And so my question leads to: is it normal that I feel this way or am I reading too much into things? Is there a possibility of there being a mental illness affecting my actions and how should I go about addressing this problem?

61,"Hey y’all. I’ve been thinking about it recently and I realized I really suppress things I go through mentally. If I open up to a friend or my sig other, I don’t go too deep. It’s like I have this inner feeling that I need to get through it solo and that it’s only my business. Anyone feel that way too? 

Ex. I do not feel pretty in my own skin due to feeling like a walking whale. I play it down to “I don’t like how I look in x outfit.” But the rest of the day or for several days I’ll fixate about how bad I feel about myself and just be sad and alone for a while. But I choose to be alone if that makes sense?

I’m not sure why I do it but I can’t do it any other way. I just feel like I have to wait out the storm.",09Apr2019,3
62,"From elementary school til middle school, I would cry almost everyday, sometimes three times a day due to family issues and stress. I had often thought about suicide but always held onto this hope that I could solve my own problems as I grew up. Back then, I would deny that I had depression and suppressed all my negative emotions until I could find a place where no one could see me crying. 

As the years have went by, my mental health gradually became more stable but I’d still have breakdowns now and then. Although, In my senior year of high school , I couldn’t go one month without becoming extremely stressed and full on crying the whole night.

Now, as I’m in my first year of university, I haven’t been able to cry at all. I’ve realized that the main source of my stress and self deprecation came from my parents and now that I’m living on my own, I am completely okay and it’s an amazing feeling to just be so stable. However it’s so stable, that I can’t even express how unhappy and sad I really am at times. For example, a friend of mine recently committed suicide and although I was deeply sad and hurt by the news, I couldn’t cry even though I really wanted to let it all out.. I just couldn’t. Maybe I have just become numb to it all... idk. When I think back to the worst times in my life, I can’t even feel how miserable it really was. I can remember it and I know how I felt but I can’t emotionally connect/feel it anymore.

TLDR : for the majority of my life, I was a depressed kid who cried ALOT. Now, I am happy with my life and physically cannot cry anymore.

Does anyone relate ? I’m just wondering if this is normal is all.",09Apr2019,3

67,"Heard the saying? Book smart, street dumbs. That’s me, I am trying to keep an upbeat tone but my head keeps rushing with a thousand jumbled thoughts and I wanna try to put them in writing. So where do I begin? I am a 26 year old adult, struggling with Bipolar depression disorder that went undiagnosed for years. Terrible emptiness, and emotional pain were my only friends growing up. And I think it, the pain and emptiness from my condition stunted my emotional development. Four years ago my disorder was finally diagnosed. After almost a decade of emptiness, and negative coping skills to stave off the thought that constant thought of deaths. Debating day in and day out whether that life was worth living, talking myself out of the decision to end it all by hoping that there’s something better than that feeling. Four years ago, after my diagnosis dad took his own life in our home. Shot himself next to their bed while mother was sleeping next to him, and I had to struggle against the fear, and pain and despair of my mother holding on to her dying love, in order to try to provide first aid for what i at first thought was some kind of hemorrhage and or heart attack. Hoping against all hope that the doctors would be able to save him, only to have that hope dashed to pieces when we got to the hospital. This is something that still haunts me to this day. His death made me realize that i didn’t want to die, having of course seen the effect it had on me. But by that point most of the damage from my disorder and ways I found to deal with it had already left a deep scar within me.

I consider being still here a great success,  still fighting to get better. But it’s not enough, you see. I fell into a horrible pattern of, not caring. I was asked, before dad died, to do something and I would say “in a bit” and did it hours later if at all. I had become a compulsive procrastinator. I stopped caring about my personal hygiene, why should I? It’s not like I had any friends to impress. I stopped caring about social activities, and friends. All I really knew were the four walls of my house. And it is all hurting my mother. Who pays for the food i eat, the clothes I wear, the car i use, the phone i have. And paying for all of that, at a point in my life where I should be free and independent is slowly killing my mother with stress. I cannot keep a job because I have no worthwhile skills. I go to school yes, but I’ve been in community college for close to a decade without graduating. Partly because i started going while being undiagnosed and untreated. 
One would Imagine that if I am unable to contribute I would at least do chores around the house to take some stress off her. Errr....no. I do no such a thing. I don’t know why I am like this, just two weeks ago mother had an emotional breakdown and wished my father had killed her as well. And i thought this is my wake up call, mom needs me, and I don’t want her to continue to suffer this way.  But within days I went back to my old ways. Of just not caring. And mom may die or run away thanks to me. My therapist tells me that i need to change yea, but to also recognize what I’ve managed so far and to be proud of it. But that is one voice of support, 50 minutes a week. The other times I keep hearing how much mom wants to die thanks to me. I feel i am a leech, draining the life out of mom. and I don’t know how to be everything
She wants me to be, I am terrified, and furious. Terrified I will loose her in some way, and furious at me. I’ve been making plans about moving to live in the university i am hoping to apply soon, where i hope I will bring my life into focus. And I don’t think mom will last me another year of me being like this... i keep putting too much stock on sac state being that reset moment in our life. But i don’t think this current life can be sustained for much longer. I need to save 21k in 15 months to bring that plan to fruition. But what if nothing happens? And when i return home I am still the same leech. What I need is to find myself right now, and do those things I am hoping to do in sac state right now. But I Don’t have it within me, not without professional help and dedicated time to it. So I’ll close this with this, are there any form of special programs to help young adults develop the skills they should’ve developed in their teens. Develop the self care skills to be ok, and successful adults?",09Apr2019,1

72,"Hi all,

I am a 22 year-old female student, studying abroad for this semester. Ever since I came here, I started to think about my future a lot, probably because I was planning to live abroad after getting undergraduate or graduate degree.

In the past I had 2 very bad panic attacks. I am not exactly sure if they were panic attacks but it was like sudden veeery deep breathes, detachment from the environment like ""my soul"" is shrinking in my body, and extreme anxiety. I was in therapy after these but we didn't quite focus on this issue, I guess because there were more urgent topics. I stopped going to the therapy 10 months ago.

3 days ago I felt very uncomfortable in the dorm, felt like I was about to cry and left the dorm for a walk. This was after my boyfriend told me that his mother is shy about calling/texting me because I am so cold. I started to cry right after I left the dorm and had something like the former ""attacks"" but I somehow managed to stop it in a couple seconds.

I already have a lot problems with relationships. I can basically say that I cannot trust anyone because of my experiences with old friends. I think that me being cold is a defense mechanism.

Also about future, right now I literally have no idea about what to do. I study psychology. I cannot select a field for master's but I should because I should have internships in this field and take classes related to the field also. Next year is my last year in undergraduate. Also I always wanted to live abroad, this was my main goal in life. But after coming here I realized that living abroad doesn't do much difference, I always thought that my quality of life will be so much better than in Turkey.

I cannot sleep for hours thinking about future and my relationship problems in general. I cannot go to therapy right now because I am abroad. I feel like I can have that thing like panic attack in any moment in a day. Do you have any advice to make the anxiety less severe?",09Apr2019,2
73,"Sorry...long. Need to be able to “talk” to someone other than him. 

About 2 months ago my husband got back some health test results that caught us off guard (asymptomatic HSV2 from a previous relationship nearly a decade ago)...nothing dangerous or detrimental, but a lifelong diagnosis that sent him spiraling. 

At this same time we were supposed to begin trying for a baby. We ended up delaying that plan for a month to allow ourselves time to regroup. We had been talking about starting a family for about a year prior to this, and I was deeply hurt to delay even further but fully understood.

Since then, he’s been going to the doctor nearly twice a week (his doing, not their recommendation) because he’s constantly convincing himself he has a new health problem. He’s seen 4-5 doctors in the last 2 months, some of them multiple times each.  Every time they tell him he’s healthy and to relax.

This month we tried to conceive. It was an incredibly stressful and draining experience for both of us. Every day we just wanted to be done. Any excitement I had about this process has been shattered. He doesn’t want to have sex outside of my fertile week, and during that week we treated it like a job that neither of us wanted to do. To be clear, we both WANT a baby.

He’s been sleeping sporadically, and goes through waves of what I think is anxiety / depression. I literally want to take away his phone so he stops staying up all night googling imaginary health issues.

I’ve already encouraged him to see a therapist, and he’s currently waiting for an appointment with one he was referred to by his PCP. Years ago, I sought counseling and treatment for anxiety, so I’m very supportive of this decision.

I feel like our lives are falling apart before my eyes and the life planned with my husband is evaporating into the distance...over something that according to every doctor is no big deal.

This week I got 2 negative pregnancy tests, and aside from my disappointment that I’m not pregnant, I’m dreading having to try again this month with him. I already have concerns about my ability to conceive, but this makes it even harder.

I feel guilty. I feel like a terrible wife for not knowing how to help him other than to keep telling him everything’s ok, he’s healthy, I love him and I’m not going anywhere, he should go to therapy and it will get better with time. I feel like sex is a burden to him. I feel like I have to tiptoe around my husband because I never know if he’s going to come home stressed or happy anymore. I avoid asking him to do anything to help me. I try to show him physical affection and act as carefree as I possibly can around him (even when I’m struggling) to lighten the mood.

I honestly don’t even know what I’m hoping to get from this post, other than the ability to get out my own feelings.  

This pales in comparison to many of the mental health issues others struggle with, but I’m having trouble coping. Now as the one who doesn’t have active anxiety, I see what it’s like to watch someone spiral against all reason, and to lose their ability to focus on what’s real.",09Apr2019,1

75,"I hope you'll forgive if I don't use the correct language for this; I'm not used to talking about mental health.

While my mom furtively talks about a history of depression in my dad's family, as far as I can tell I don't suffer from it. I don't have any condition or symptom that keeps me from going about my daily life in a fairly functional way. However, in the past 6 months or so, and especially in the past month, my thoughts have been preoccupied with taking my own life, and contemplating how I might do it. I haven't taken it seriously and haven't planned anything remotely close to it, but it's not going away, so I worry that if left unchecked, it could eventually lead to something bad.

This isn't out of the blue, though, I've just been incredibly stressed and anxious about work and my professional future, personal relationships, and the conviction that my neuroses and the things that are holding me back are never really going to change -- hence this feeling of ""Well then what's the point of continuing to slide more into these awful feelings if it's not going to get better?"" It's starting to keep me from sleeping, from eating as much as I should, and may soon affect my job performance, which frankly is what I'm most worried about.

It may sound silly, but without any identifiable or diagnosed issue other than ""being kinda neurotic and really stressed out"", I feel like I'm not really suicidal and just doing a bad job of dealing with stress -- like I need to just ""buck up"" and ""sort myself out"". But, if the end result would be the same (an early death) regardless of the cause of these feelings, then I know I need to do something about it -- I just don't know what exactly. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with this? I want to take concrete action (maybe quit work and focus on self-care for a bit), but I worry about over-reacting or over-correcting, even though I know that my life and well-being are pretty darn important.",09Apr2019,1

I've been struggling for years to understand why people don't like me.When I was a kid, based off of the insults I received, a lot of the hate was because I was an ugly, short, poor kid.I'm an adult now, the criticisms have changed but the hate persists.
 
 
I think a lot of the hate defies logic because when I go back and analyze my actions they are objectively innocent.A lot of the times I was clashing with people who had their own issues and unique ways of thinking.
 
 
I'm not saying I'm without fault I am completely aware when I'm in the wrong.People throw around sayings like ""If you think everyone is an asshole you're the asshole."" It's hard to complain about this situation because people automatically assume I'm the problem THEN when I get defensive or lash out they think that my reaction proves the fact even more.WHAT!? 
 
 
I could see if I was this imposing figure who dressed shabbily and had BO but.I'm fucking not.I have a sister who exhibits similar weird quirks and mannerisms as I do but she is seen as adorable I am seen as a villain.
 
 
I think with the tiny bit of youth I have left I should be meeting all of types people and share experiences.When I examine the family members and friends that people really like, I'm not seeing anything valuable.They're just a person.Hi, I'm just a person too yet you resent and ostracize me.Okay.
 
 Since the hate has been going on for so long I'm growing numb to it, it's more of the lack of love/support that's been bothering me.Once upon a time when I was in a relationship, I swear it made me feel 
powerful and less depressed.If I had some talent/skill I could immerse myself in I wouldn’t need people buutt yeahh about that….
 
I know there's nothing any of you can do.I'm just venting.As you can imagine, being in this disposition puts my mind in some really dark places.I rapidly losing sympathy for my fellow human beings and I'm starting to believe people should suffer.But it'd be easier to kill myself.",09Apr2019,1

The life of teenagers is hard. And as children enter the teenage phase, it becomes extremely tough for parents to understand what's going on in their lives and what they are feeling.

78,"&gt;*A house stands across the river, amidst the lush green fields, with a bit of floor beneath and a piece of sky above. The madmen nestle closely lest they should fall apart. Sometimes, they sit by the window with a warm cup of coffee. Most of the times, they have anti-psychotics. The window is the shadow line. The one that glimmers of acceptance. Are they really pleading for acceptance or is it the guilt of pushing them too far that makes us think of this?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The civilization has been brutal and history owes an apology to them, more than ever now. Can words be enough? It’s time to turn the wheels of time. It’s time to acknowledge that they are sitting, right across us, on the other side of the table, under the same roof!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I am not talking about aliens or the animals, with them the adjustment might take a little longer. Designs of nature.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why the ‘other’ when it comes to mentally challenged people? I refuse to use the term ‘mentally-ill’ for them. I accept that the illness has taken strong roots in our minds, when it comes to understanding them and simply acknowledging them as humans.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Anxiety, Autism, Dementia, Depression- you name it and a chill runs through everyone’s spine. This is the medical vernacular. Then there are long visits to the doctor, prescriptions and medicines. Endless sessions of therapy. Some work and some fail. Trust me when I say this, the ones suffering from these challenges do not understand all of this. They only understand the language of love.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Schizophrenia and the myth and mysteries surrounding it has long been on my mind. Who is conspiring against whom? What are these voices? Who are the people appearing every now and then? What kind of split in personality are we talking about? Why the urge to remain aloof, blank and emotionless? What is the sense in the incoherence? What are the pictures drawn all about? Why so happy and why so sad? These questions are exhausting and they never seem to end.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In the words of* [*R.D. Laing*](https://www.britannica.com/biography/R-D-Laing)*,* ***“Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair”****. I couldn’t agree more. The moment you start treating the ones experiencing poor mental health as ‘patients’, you have lost the battle then and there. The journey of healing them will always begin with treating them as equal as anybody else. Make them understand that it’s just a phase they are going through, which might last for a lifetime. They think differently, experience emotions differently and respond accordingly. This does not mean that something is wrong with them. They are not possessed by some evil spirit. They are not ghosts. Just one of us with a different worldview in their mind. Don’t give up on them, by making them feel worse about their situation, if not any better.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Give them hope. Feed them with dreams to develop, in the best of their capacity. Help them come forward. Once strength and confidence makes some room in their mind, they are good to be on their own.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is not what I had originally in mind about the mentally challenged people. Madness was always a never to be talked about subject, with evil myths and stereotypes. It was the urge to understand my own folks, that I went deeper into the subject, reading books and watching movies on schizophrenia. A Beautiful Mind left me unsettled and a serious research followed to comprehend the ‘what’, ‘why’ and the ‘how’.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*During the journey, I met R.D. Laing. I couldn’t have understood schizophrenia better had I not read ‘*[*The Divided Self’*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/496585.The_Divided_Self)*. R.D. Laing arrived as the light in the dark tunnel when he went on to explain madness. With his experiences and conversations with the patients, he allowed me a closer view on this subject. Though criticized for his controversial views, he actually revolutionized the way mental illness is perceived in the modern world. Laing showed how a person’s fragmentation was an intelligible response to an intolerable pressure, often the pressure of the infamous double-bind. He takes his readers to the roots of madness, well within the subject’s family and the larger society. Laing received harsh comments for he blamed schizophrenia on families. However, here he made a strong point. There is no doubt about the fact that any attempt to understand a person’s mental state cannot be made without analyzing his closest relationships. In the contemporary times, it is being acknowledged that its diagnosis and treatment can be better understood with the social context attached with the individual.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Without an iota of doubt, the times are changing. Psychiatry has come a long way, if we look back at the approach and wisdom 30 or 40 years ago. But there are miles to go. Modern times are full of narratives of protests by the suppressed and the marginalized communities, in terms of sexuality, race, gender and so on. They fight till they get it right. Here, we must not forget that these people, categorized as ‘mentally-ill’ cannot even rise for their cause. We are their voice.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Reality check.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*How the mirror makes us uncomfortable in the times of introspection! For our own convenience, we break the mirror on the wall. We trample upon the pieces. But truth sparkles through the smithereens, pierces straight into our eyes. The glare is too fiery to ignore.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*How long would we stand across the river and stare at the madhouse in fear and disgust? Let’s look within and laugh at our ‘better sense’. After we are done mocking the sane side, the madhouse will open its doors for us. Who are we to push them aside? They left our world long ago. And now, they wait for Godot.*

80,"First off, not sure if this is in the right spot. But i could use some advice--even if that's a point in another direction or just to listen.

How do i move forward?

So, i have a genetic disorder gives me shitty fine motor skills, a serious case of social awkwardness, and dental issues. I've had panic attacks for as long as i can remember (it took decades for me to realize they, and i, weren't normal). Basically, people think I'm retarded (more like I'm trapped in my body) and i have a billion triggers from being bullied and other things I'd rather not get into. Once people realize it, at every job I've had, suddenly the rare occurrence of me losing my shit ramps up to constant as the resident button pushers move in turn me into a thing for their entertainment. Or they make shitty comments under their breath tp my face; i know i can't acknowledge them without blowing up so i ignore them. Which only seems to egg people on to see how far they can push me.

This culminated somewhat recently when i was fired and (from what i gather, no one is talking, which is probably for the best) my previous employer sent some form of media to everyone in my social media accounts and god knows where else. I made the mistake of checking my fucked teeth in a mirror that turned out to house a hidden camera. They immediately started treating me like shit, like i was a tweaker. Never have, never would. Friends and family don't look at me the same. Some hide the valuables. Others make it a point to tell me where they are. It's all fucked up. Strangers suddenly look at me like im an alien. In the rare event i get a job interview anymore, they are cancelled shortly thereafter. I stopped eating out because people kept doing god knows what to my food. Ever have cops follow you around on foot, burst into the bathroom while you're using it? These became routine over night. The latest is a rumor that i tried to kill mysef (never have attempted). 

Don't get me wrong, I haven't been the best person but I'd left my previous life behind to get help. I found a place to live, got a job, and just never made enough money to get help--what they said I'd make never jived with reality and the expenses kept increasing (i was on the road for a mixture of [illegally] long days and absurdly short days that always workes out to fewer hours than I'd been promised--unless i intentionally worked slower. Which i never did...)

The great irony of this trash fire is that before i realized what had happened, I'd spent a couple of months focusing on my well-being and suddenly felt the best i have in my life. And i kept feeling that way. It seriously feels like i woke up from a bad dream that is my life.",09Apr2019,1
81,"Hi all,  
  
Last year I decided to try and get help and started seeing a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD. At this point I’m prescribed (all generics) 60mg Prozac in the morning, 25mg Adderall XR in the morning and 20mg IR in the afternoon, and 1mg Klonopin once per day as needed.  
  
A couple random questions if that’s okay:  
  
1. I’m not so sure about the Klonopin. I’ve always got low key anxiety in the back of my mind, like 24 hours a day, but also a lot of times it comes on STRONG and suddenly, though short of an actual panic attack. I take the Klonopin assuming I’ll feel better at some point later but I’ve never actually noticed it. I’m wondering if I should talk to the doctor about Xanax instead as it’s faster acting. Would that be appropriate/make me seem like a drug seeker?  
  
2. There are two things I’ve never really talked to him about and was wondering how to bring it up. I don’t want to seem like I’m internet diagnosing myself, but I’ve had tics and obsessive compulsions since I was a kid and I’m just now starting to read into Tourette’s and OCD and relating to what I’m reading a LOT. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on bringing this up with the doctor.  
  
That’s all I can think of for now, thanks!!",09Apr2019,1
82,"Hi, i'm a 18 y old greek/belgian (sorry in advance for the poor english by the way) guy who always felt kind of different , i'm pretty sure i don't feel things as everyone else do, i'll just say i have some troubles with feelings, empathy in particular, you know where i'm going with that detail.

&amp;#x200B;

However my girlfriend can prove i'm not a bad guy, even tho i don't really feel some feelings like everyone i can keep care of her.

&amp;#x200B;

So, today i discussed with my mom about that rat we kept who's sick,blind and deaf,probably insane since he tries to bite everyone, she gave him valium a week ago  with hope to end his sufferings (she's a nurse) didn't worked.

&amp;#x200B;

I said i would  get it done myself.

&amp;#x200B;

And here we go, today (1 hour ago) i asked her if she was sure about the rat, she said yes but wanted me to do it away, she doesn't want to see that.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my knife (gerber Strongarm) on my side, in case i fail the execution.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i got into that cage, opened the cage slowly and silently, being carefull about the rat, didn't want him to dodge my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

When i oppened the cage, i had a chill, i was nervous, in a good way, exactly the same as when i'm ready to do something really important, i felt the same when i passed my driving test for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Got him  by the neck in less than a sec, i was surprisingly quick and precise, i felt him struggling, i knew what i had to do, so, without a single second of doubt, i got outside and pull him by the tail while keeping his neck trapped, quick death, i was thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

However when i saw him still moving some muscles i doubted, i know, post mortem movements and sh\*t, but just, in case, i took my knife, stabbed him on the chest and then used the back side (didn't wanted to damage my blade) of the knife to give a quick strike on his head.

&amp;#x200B;

The weird  part (for most people) comes now, i took the dead body and i had some satisfaction while feeling the fast heartbeat on his chest, i had a dopamine rush, i felt good, i couldn't contain my pleasure, i smilled, i was happy with what i just did.

&amp;#x200B;

I  gave him decent burial and then came home to wash my knife, it had some blood on it due to the stab.

&amp;#x200B;

Not gonna lie, my mother was kinda shocked,seeing me with my knife with blood on it, asked me how i felt, i tried to avoid saying that i liked it, but my smile cheated me anyway, she could see i liked that, so i just said ""it wasn't so terrible"" of course it wasn't terrible, i wanted to do that and i did it.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that she didn't thought i would've done that, i felt something like fear in the athmosphere, understandable, i surely didn't looked like someone totally clean at this moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand it would creep some people, and i don't want everyone to know, i just shared that with my gf ((asked her to keep silence over it, no one needs to know that), she was affraid but finally understood that i'm not a danger (i mean we are together since 1 y+, she would've known if i was an horrible person).

&amp;#x200B;

Would you consider it normal or slightly anormal ? Since i doubt that it's something that can change ( just who i am) , would you consider it dangerous ? Since i'm anonymous i can say with confidence that it was an agreable experience and i liked every part of it, doesn't mean i want to do it anymore though.

91,"I hope this is the right place to post.

My (now ex) boyfriend had been depressed throughout most of the time we knew each other. I feel bad because I never really noticed. He always smiled and laughed with me. We knew each other for 2 years and dated for 4 months of it (he had feelings for me the whole time though).

A few weeks before the breakup he told he that he didn’t feel right and that he doesn’t want to leave the house. He doesn’t want to get prescription pills or see a doctor.

He pretty much stopped seeing his friends. I was the only person, besides work and family, that he hung out with. He told me he wanted to breakup with me because, while he loves me and cares for me, he doesn’t love me anymore (I assume the spark is gone?). Of course this is a reason to break up with someone, but my parents and I think he may have broke up with me because of his depression. My coworker (who is kinda buddies with him) even agrees he seems to be in a cloudy state of mind right now. He blindsided me with the breakup; he hugged me, told me he loved me, called me babe/baby, was affectionate, etc. throughout our whole relationship and up till that Friday (3/29) we hung out. We had plans for my birthday (4/4), and we were going to see a musical on 4/12 (we’re still going). Why would he breakup with when we had things planned, ya know?

He broke up with me on 3/31 and it put me through a depression all week. I was barley eating, drinking, sleeping, and was throwing up when possible. I’m still getting over it, but I hate to think he’s feeling like this all the time (he ate when we went out though, and I doubt he throws up). I don’t think he’s suicidal (never says he hates himself, wants to die, etc.).

He was my best friend for 2 years and boyfriend for 4 months of it. I want to help him. Part of me hopes that, maybe once he gets better, he’ll want to try us again. When I asked, he did say that maybe we’ll get together again, but he’s not going to date for a while. I can accept that he may never see me as a girlfriend again though and will help him as a friend. Part of me will wait for him and help him through his depression, but I also won’t turn down a guy that asks me out.

I’ve been looking up vitamins he may be able to take instead (my mom does this and she said it helps her), and I’m going to try to get him to go to the free counseling my school offers. I’m going to try and get him to see me once a week to socialize. Is there anything else I can do to help him?",09Apr2019,2

93,"Hello! I guess I should start from the beginning. I am not diagnosed with anxiety or depression as I have not been able to get an appointment to be evaluated. However, I have had some questionable things that cause me to think I have some form of anxiety. In the past five months, I can count maybe five times that I’ve had a nervous breakdown of some kind. These are mostly academic related and how I feel awkward socially. 

The first two were very minor, had thoughts of failing my final exams in the fall quarter of university. I was crying, had an empty feeling, despair and hopelessness surrounded me. I had to go back to community college, and now that I entered into winter quarter, I had two. The first one, someone asked me to say and do things I wasn’t comfortable with that wasn’t truly appropriate for the class but related. I sat at my desk, and I suddenly had the feeling like I needed to leave. I was nervous and jittery, I should mention I have caffeine in the morning on a regular basis.. I walked out, and ran outside into the snow and paced near the entry way of the building. I was crying, nervous, and I felt that the course was just too much for me to handle. I called my significant other, and she said that everything was going to be okay, and she calmed me down and brought me back to earth. 

The second one, the most recent, is the worst one I’ve experienced. My family puts a lot of pressure on my academically and spiritually. They force me to go to church every Sunday, and tell me that I need to submit to god to be successful. I’m atheist, but they don’t know. I’ll get to that more in a bit. I was taking my final exam for the same course of my previous breakdown. I was half way, trying to stay calm, and I was fine until I stumbled on a question I forgot how to do. I skipped it, and things got harder. I noticed there was a format problem with the test, so I stopped, let my instructor know, and they fixed it. It threw off my focus, my self-confidence, and I became very anxious about my answers. I had a feeling that I couldn’t do it, that I was going to fail. I ran out of the testing room, went to the bathroom, and cried. I texted my mother about what was happening, and she said “You can do this, I believe in you... You need to pray (she means submit) to god...” I told her it wasn’t good advice. I ran into the counselors office sobbing like a lunatic. She asked what was wrong and I told her that I have a lot of pressure, and she told me to talk with a specific in-office counselor. I spoke with her for a few moments and I felt better. I decided that even though I was nervous, I was going to finish the test. I did, and I barely passed the course. 

Now, back to the spiritual pressure from my family. I came out to my family as queer last year. They told me i will burn in Hell and that I made the choice to be this way. I can’t reason with them. I came home, and before my family said I could choose to go to church or not, when I got home, it’s the opposite. I have to go to church every Sunday, and hear about how this old ass preacher is offended that gay people can marry and stuff. I do plan to post to Facebook about the Brunei laws soon to raise awareness to my friends. When I go to church, I feel unwelcome, out of place, unwanted, alone, and like an outcast to put it simply. People notice I don’t worship or I fake it, and I fake prayer, and I don’t even want to interact with people there. I have the desire to be alone a lot anyway. Church has made me have self-hatred before I came out to myself and even put me into a “No you can’t be queer” spiral when I clearly am. I have no way out as I am visually impaired, I can’t drive, I don’t have a job, and I have to convince my family that I deserve to go to university because last summer they threatened that if I didn’t do chores properly I wouldn’t get any help from them. 

In other ways I display anxiety or other mental health issues, I have depression on and off, I bite my nails, I have terrible chronic constipation, and I don’t feel like being social sometimes, and can go a Day with barely talking. If I see a therapist or physiologist, I’m sure my family would 100% make sure it was a Christian one.. and that wouldn’t be too good with my current situation. 

TL;DR: I bite my nails, have constipation, have on/off mild depression along with tons of stress and pressure from family to do well. I’ve had somewhere between two and five nervous breakdowns where I either have the desire to run and hide and cry or kinda disassociate? 

Thank you for any help/advice you may have. Anything is helpful.",09Apr2019,1

ok so basically: the last couple of years of my life have been kinda sh*tty. i don’t mean traumatic or anything serious but just generally pretty bad. however the last few months have been going a bit better but everyday stuff will constantly remind me of those bad times, like it’s almost as if my brain is actively looking for a way to tie/connect objects to a certain time from those years. and then i just kinda get zapped back to those times ?? i feel like i’m there again and i can’t get bring myself back to the present. for example earlier today i made popcorn and it reminded me of a time i made popcorn two years ago and since then i’ve just had this feeling....that i associate....with that time...hanging over me ?? idk how to even explain honestly idk if that even made sense but yeah that’s basically what happens 

oh and also this feeling i get makes me feel gross as well for some reason ?? that’s one of the reasons it bothers me so much",09Apr2019,1
96,"  

That’s the first step, right? Admitting I’m struggling? Well. I’ve done it. Personally and now publically. 

If it matters, 26F from NY.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I made phone calls to all of the mental health centers in my area that accept my insurance in search of a therapist. They all have wait-lists, but they said they’ll get back to me. I admitted to my SO that I really do need professional help. I’ve said it before.

I made it through three therapy sessions back in… ’15(?) before I stopped going. I felt ashamed that I struggled with anxiety and depression. “Therapy isn’t something people really *need.* You just need to do things you like and spend more time outside!” – my completely unrealistic mother. 

But the truth is… I lost myself. Somewhere between the ages of 19 and 24 I lost myself. If you’d asked me at nineteen what I wanted to do? I would have said that I wanted to work in business, maybe get into publishing or work for a non-profit. Now? I just want to make it through the week.

I struggle with feelings of inadequacy. I’ve always struggled with my weight, though these days I try to be mindful of what I consider fuel. As a child, food became the comfort that I sought when I didn’t have friends or didn’t get invited to parties. Another aspect of my feelings of inadequacy stems from my Cerebral Palsy. It’s not that I can’t do most all of the things any “normal person” can do, I can. I might just have to do them a little differently. I might also take longer. Most people don’t have patience for my pace. 

I felt that need to be loved at a very young age. I learned like many other young women that my body could get me the attention I wanted. By twenty-one, I found myself stuck in the arms of a controlling and abusive man, “Hank.” I worked 50+ hour weeks only to hand over my paycheck to him. He constantly critiqued and belittled me. I did whatever I could to make him happy, but it never worked. He cut me off from my friends and my family so that he could have me “all to himself.” Looking back, I can see that he didn’t really want me, he just wanted a housekeeper and a personal ATM. But at the time, I was… almost brainwashed. 

I made a female friend online, Emily. Hank approved. We talked whenever we had a spare moment. I confided in her about everything that was happening at home. She promised she would help. As luck would have it, she lived nearby. She started coming over for dinner, or girl’s night. She helped to mediate things between myself and that boyfriend. She had even convinced him to allow me to go home for a weekend and visit my family.

When I got back from my weekend away, all of my belongings were in garbage bags on the front lawn. He was, “done with me.” Just like that, I was free! But, at the same time, I was hurt. Scared. Sad. Confused. Homeless. I reached out to Emily to see if I could crash with her until I got back on my feet. She never responded.

I was lucky enough to be able to move back home. My parents and I never really discussed what happened. They just blamed everything all on him. My only fault in the whole thing? Being, “too nice.” I got back on my feet, paid off debts from Hank, and started over. I truly felt like that chapter was behind me… 

And it was, until I got the invitation in the mail. Emily was engaged to marry Hank. I couldn’t breathe. My mind was racing. What had I missed?! Had they planned this all along?! How could she want to be with him after knowing what he did to me?!I didn’t go to the wedding. I didn’t confront Hank or Emily. I didn’t even respond. But I did end all of my friendships and isolate myself. Was it necessary? On one hand, probably not. On the other hand, no one could be trusted.

It’s getting better now. I’ve been with my SO for a little over two years. He’s remarkable kind and understanding. We bought a house. I’ve made another female friend. I have a dog.

But I’m still haunted by what happened. I can’t help but feeling like there’s something wrong with me for having three failed long-term relationships. For being twenty-six and not yet having gotten married. For not being able to maintain healthy friendships. 

When someone asks what I want to do in life, the answer is simple: I don’t know. Do I want to go back to school? Do I want to travel? I don’t even know how to think about going back to college or traveling without getting anxiety. The cost of either endeavor is expensive, and for what? A piece of paper, or a memory? I feel guilty for entertaining such ideas… For now, I get through one day at a time. Hopefully, I’ll find a therapist soon and figure some stuff out…

Thanks for listening everyone.",09Apr2019,2

102,"Now I Posted on here about less than a month ago and I'd like to update what's been happening.

I've now seen a psychiatrist and have been given a prescription for my depression and anxiety but it tastes horrible because I have to leave it in my mouth. (They asked me what flavour to make it so it wouldn't taste as bad and I chose chocolate. DON'T CHOOSE CHOCOLATE, IT MAKES THE TASTE WORSE) 

Also I have left the friends I have at my school because they don't talk to me anymore and because a few weeks ago they were making jokes about what happened in New Zealand with Christchurch which I didn't want to be associated with.

And on a final note. It's starting to look like that I might not go to TAFE and leave my current school. My depression is getting very sensitive and if I keep going to my current school then I probably won't be here at the end of 2019.

103,"I have one niece in particular I feel is at high risk for developing depression and anxiety, if she does not already present the appropriate signs and symptoms for diagnosis. (I am not a psychiatric professional, but I studied psychology in college and have worked in psychiatry for over a year now, but not as familiar with children.) She has multiple predisposing factors such low socioeconomic status and unstable home life. Her mother (my sister) has a slew of psychiatric problems, and I think is a cause of a lot of anxiety for my niece due to her mom’s style of parenting. My niece’s grandparents (mine and my sister’s parents) and myself try to provide a positive environment for her and my other nieces and nephews, which I feel is a protective factor for my niece.

With that background for you guys, what do you suggest is a positive and hopefully impactful way to approach a conversation about mental health with my niece? She is 11 years old, and is becoming increasingly aware of the reality of her situation. I can see how her behavior has shifted as she’s grown up; she’s become increasingly anxious and scared of the world and her mom. She doesn’t have interest in school or sports, and mostly stays quiet and to the sidelines as her peers interact and participate.

At the very least I want to educate her on the importance of positive mental health. Ultimately, I want her to be mindful of the way she’s feeling and have the tools to cope with what life throws and has thrown at her.

105,"So, I'll explain more if someone actually cares to read this.
I'm 25M, I got diagnosed last year with OCD and a related mood disorder, but I have been dealing with issues related with this since I was a teenager.
My main issue is with cleaningness, but it's not really dirt itself, but mostly it's about how I feel about it.
A stupid example.
I go to the beach and I have fun, I love the beach, and If I walk for a bit without shoes in the house after the beach it's not a big deal; but If I simply touch shoulders with a guy that I don't like, or I sit down in a place where I didn't have a good time or that I consider not nice, I have to change my clothes and shower and clean or wash everything I touched before I was able to shower.
I use a ridiculous amount of wet wipes every day, I clean my phone and laptop multiple times a day, every time I touch something that it's not in my bedroom, like a glass in the kitchen, I need to wash my hands before going back in the bedroom.
I was taking medication but it didn't help much, there's not much mental health awareness in the country I live at the moment.
To tackle the most recent problem, I moved in a new place by myself last week, and it's going great mood wise, but not great for this issue, I wash my hands 30-40 times a day whenever I touch something not related to my bedroom or that has been outside the house.
I manage to have a normal life beyond this, I have girlfriend (long distance, she's not here now and when she's around this issues are way less problematic, and she knows all about it).
I have friends in this town (I recently moved back to my hometown just for the summer) and they have no idea about my mental health situation and coming clean about this seems really hard for me at the moment, since during the years I lived away our relationship has grown less intimate and just more about hanging out.
They're coming to have pizza and hang out tonight at my place and I'm extremely nervous about having them over.
Nobody has been in my house since I moved in and everything is ""pure"" and I'm so afraid that after they come everything will lose its purity.
I'm afraid I'll lose the good feeling I have about this house.
I'm also afraid I won't be able to be chill and have fun and that I'll be paranoid all night.

108,"This isn’t something I would relate to with mental health directly? But it’s obviously in my head/ mental related.

So lately I have been under some stress/ new changes (new job/ trying to get new jobs, trying to change my course of action etc as I’ve been unemployed for a long time). 

Whenever I eat, which is not that much. I can often do 1 small meal in 2 days if I’m busy, other wise maybe 2-3 meals in 2 days etc - and I’m comparing this to what I normally eat / ate. 

But whenever I eat I think of something that just ruins my appetite... I don’t do it on purpose but it creeps up on me and before I know it I’ve lost my appetite that wasn’t even large to begin with so whatever little food I did eat, I can no longer continue to eat. 

The things I think of vary drastically anything from: a sad film, thinking about finding booger’s or hairs in my food, how they make the food and imagining it being dirty, thinking about my pets dying, people starving and dying.. etc etc it’s totally random. But usually to the point where I lose my appetite. 

But I’m not able to finish a full meal and usually just get several bites in before I think about it and/ or lose my appetite. If I eat quickly I’m able to eat more since I eat it before I think of stuff.

Anyone relate or know if this is common and due to acute stress? I know it’ll pass but still wondering about it",09Apr2019,1
109,"I think somewhere along the line, I knocked out a few screws in my brain. As a child people often referred to me as a perfect kid. I could sit quietly in a movie, I was kind and loved sharing, I wasn’t really the most masculine kid though. I picked flowers during a soccer game as a child, always complained about walking too far, I was extremely sensitive and always got my feelings hurt.

But how did I go from that to someone with perverse thoughts flowing through my mind all the time? I hate life and always think of killing myself, I find no enjoyment in anything I do, I’m mean to people for no reason, I have extreme mood swings when something bothers me even a little, really bad social anxiety, a lot of self hate, trust issues, urges to do sick things like look at disturbing porn; cut my throat with a razor; suffocate a family member, I am sometimes verbally and emotionally abusive to people I care about, feel little to no empathy when being cruel to loved ones, selfish, I “act narcissistic” (which I have looked up and do have a lot of those issues but I do have a sense of empathy which bunks that idea), I have “dopamine rushes” where I’ll eat a bunch, get high, watch porn or have my girlfriend send me nudes and pass out with a pulsing headache. 

There’s lots more I’m forgetting to list, but I just want to know why I’m having so many disturbing thoughts, or maybe not always disturbing but always intrusive. Why do I enjoy being cruel to people? I get a weird sense of gratification when I push people into being upset or hurt. It’s confusing because I don’t really want to be like this, I’m not necessarily happy doing wrong to people and myself, but it doesn’t feel like a bad thing always. It’s just very confusing, even wording this is confusing. 

I would like to say it’s my past that built me this way, but it’s not even bad as I see it. I don’t think my mom has ever had it all together, and there was always alcohol abuse in my home, addiction in of itself is a big issue in my family, homelessness, exposure. But I read all the stories here and there’s much worse.

My mom caused trouble for me when she drank. She’d hit me, or accidentally cause a fire on the stove, she’d yell at imaginary figures, rip her clothes off and fall on the ground naked, trying not to puke. The worst memory funny enough, was just being locked in a room while it was dark while the movie “Hills have eyes” started up. Still scared the shit out of me lol. I happened to walk on her having sex quite a few times in my life as well, having her have sex with a boyfriend of hers on the bed beside me as I laid on the floor. Idk if that has any potential to have ruined my pure brain but just mentioning it in case. 

My uncle struggles with meth, my mom struggled with alcohol eventually beat it and moved to marijuana, my other uncle and my aunt both heavily rely on marijuana to function. My grandma was probably the worst to me. She isn’t an old withering lady either, she’s around fifty since she had my mom around 15 years old. She was always the worst to deal with. She’d yell obscenities at me when drunk saying I’m probably fucking my mom, that I’m an ugly loser, a faggot, a freak, that everyone wishes I was never born. I mean literally she’s said every single thing you can imagine. 

My family was also homeless quite a bit. I slept in a garage, a car, a trailer, a motel, on the streets, in a tent. Oddly enough I’d say my worst experience was sleeping in a car. Probably due to my emotional state at the time. Second worst would be staying at my grandmas. Between her drunken rage episodes and my schizophrenic meth addicted uncle standing naked in the entrance to the apartment rocking back and forth and yelling to himself, I just wasn’t able to cope and battle with my depression. 

I was exposed to a lot growing up as well. I remember having a friend who would show me porn on her mom’s computer when no one was home. She was a couple years older than me, and I don’t know if that lessened the impact on her or not but it definitely confused me. She would sometimes tell me to kiss her and touch her and for a kid who ranted about Pokémon games and cried when someone said I was weird at school, this was probably too much for me. Bullying was also a big part of my life. I was bullied throughout elementary school, middle school, and I battled severe self esteem issues and anxiety in high school. It didn’t help that I moved almost every grade. 

I guess the biggest issues I face now are: depression, anxiety, perverse thoughts, people yelling makes me nauseous and anxious, I constantly call myself names in the mirror or when I feel nervous (in my head), I’m verbally abusive to people at times, I have suicide fantasies, lack of motivation (which is really severe. I’d actually be happy if my life consisted of nothing but sleep and tv. I felt better when I was hospitalized because of the stress relief I felt), obsession with feeling “good”, impatience, lack of interest in people, media, or activities, mood swings..


I’m not on any medications and I tried meds for anxiety, depression and bipolar once upon a time. They ended up doing more harm than good and I gave up trying. I guess what I want from this post is a new solution or maybe I didn’t give meds a good enough chance. I was in therapy for around 8 Years (I’m 19 now) and it never helped any. I’m also just venting kind of an r/offmychest kind of thing.

111,"Hello everyone, 

I have an issue with constant, nagging, destructive self-doubts. My ''inner critic'' of not being good enough, of being bad, unsuited for what I do, useless, unskilled etc. never quite leaves me in peace. 

I've come to realize that there's no use in repressing the bad feelings tied to my self-doubts, I now know simply shoving them aside won't make them go away in the long run since they'll always bubble back to the surface.

My question is: how do I make myself see myself more realistically? The constant chatter of the inner critic drags me down, isolates me from the people around me and makes me anxious and wary of things. 

''Everything I do is bad, worse than what anyone else does. Everyone else is better, luck is never on my side etc.''

113,"I think my nephew is mentally ill in some way.

He's a smart kid and reads a lot of books. He was taken out of school and home schooled by my sister.

When he was at the library, he read a book about people apparently being possessed by the devil for real. It's giving him nightmares. When he stays at my house, he wants to sleep on the floor next to my bed and tell me loves me several times a night. He told me he's afraid that the devil is going to possess him and make him kill people. I told him religion is BS, and most books he reads are false. He was like, ""Ok that makes sense. People have different opinions."" But then he asked people at my sister's church how the devil possesses people, and instead of telling him that doesn't actually happen, they basically said it happens to evil people who let him in.

So now my nephew says the same prayer over and over again when he's afraid he sinned, and he keeps checking his forehead to see if he's sprouting horns because his face feels funny. 

My sister's really dumb and also really neglectful and mean to him, and neither her or her husband are going to do anything about this, I guarantee it. My nephew is home schooled and 90% of what he learns is Christian material. He's obsessed with learning about how to cast out the devil and can't find any books about to basically perform an exorcism because that obviously doesn't actually happen IRL. It's a disorder called epilepsy, but he's so far brainwashed that he's like, ""Are you sure Satan doesn't cause that?"" He doesn't believe anything I say because I'm an atheist.

Is this schizophrenia?",09Apr2019,2
114,"Lately, eating has been either on or off. Mostly off, if I`m being honest. I`m a sophmore in college and I guess this issue started with me late Junior year of highschool. I think this started with me using it as a punishment for myself. I`m bipolar and when I felt like I acted poorly because of my own mental health that it meant I was bad and so I don`t deserve things. I still think like this sometimes. I won`t eat for days sometimes though, even when I don`t think I`m punishing myself. I just won`t eat and eventually I won`t feel hungry but my energy will fall through the floor. I do this and then one night I`ll eat a pretty good amount of food, then feel guilty and not eat the next day. I don`t think I have an eating disorder, I like my body but I also think I look nice after I don`t eat for a day or two. I just feel really ashamed about all of this and I don`t know what I did to myself to get here but thinking about eating more food is kind of off putting . I started off 142lbs at the beginning of this current school year and now I weigh in at 122.5 lbs standing 5'5"" tall. I don`t really know what I can do about this. I`ve honestly been really great mood-wise as of late, I`m just barely eating and it`s embarrassing to even think about bringing this up to my counselor because it`s just another thing that`s wrong with me.

RIP MY BROTHER 2017
https://www.theherald.com.au/story/5588116/man-who-left-scene-after-fatal-to-face-trial/

People must wonder what someone who's been through some tough times thinks about.

Well I don't talk about my emotions or what's inside. On the outside I try to smile and look normal. But here's a glimpse of what is inside.

My apologies to anyone who gets upset by what I've written. I just want to let some of it out.


I miss you. I'm sorry. 

If you could feel what I do everyday you wouldn't blame me for trying to faff the day away.

So you don't think about the 2 people that aren't here anymore.

Yet somehow they seem to follow you around all day, constantly reminding you of the 2 biggest problems you can't fix.

So you try and you succeed to fix other stupid things. In reality tho your just wasting your life away. 

It's cold, it's dark and it's painfully lonely in my thoughts and dreams. 

My dreams? Let's see.

Dan sitting there, all alone, unknowingly dying, gut wrenching crying, in vain he's trying, to call out to his son. 

He can't make a sound tho, cause his mouths all caved in, there's so much blood everywhere.

Dazed and confused, the shocks kicked in. 

He doesn't know what happened but Dan knows it's bad. 

He's alone, still sitting there, dying all alone. 

I try to reach over, trying to help.

But no matter how hard I try I can't seem to change anything.


That's right I'm dreaming.


Boom


Everything’s black.

Mum Mum Mum. 
Is that Braxy calling?

Why won't this seatbelt undo? 
Why is it so slippery? 

This bloods making it impossible.
What!? Who's blood? 

Shit, I think that's mine. 

Why can't I fucking move.

Hang on, that's right, Kenadee's in the van too. 

I'll call out.

I'm scared Mum, she says in reply. 

I think I'm dead Mum, it's black and I can't move, I hear Braxy calling.

Sounds like he needs help.

Gotta send kenadee to get help for braxy boy, he's gotta play soccer soon. 

I will mum I'm ok I'll climb out the window and get someone. 

She's a tough cookie my daughter, I'll have to buy her a present when we get home. 

Now what the hell is pinning me to this chair? The pain, it's everywhere, why does it hurts so much?

That's weird, why can't I feel my legs? I need to get help to braxy, better tell him to stay awake.

Don't you go to sleep braxy……… everything fades away.

The vans purring well this morning. I find myself sitting in the passenger seat. I look across and think Heidi's looking a little tired. 

You awake baby. 

Hmmmm

She didn't seem to hear me. 

That's weird. 

Shit, why's she got her eyes closed.

HEIDI WAKE UP. 

Why can't she hear me? 

She's vearing off the road! 

Why won't my hands grip the wheel? I need to turn. 

There's a guard rail. NO! 

Slowmotion can be excruciating. Especially when your watching your best friend, your lover, your world, getting ripped in half and pinned to her seat.

Yet somehow, almost happy. You watch the guardrail twist and bend in directions that defy physical law. 

It's as if 2 hands were bending it, bending with ease almost like it's Play-Doh. 

As it bends and contorts you watch as somehow the impossible happens.

The railing misses the kids in the back taking the one safe path out threw the back.

But why? 

What did she do? 

What did she not do? 

Why cause so much pain? 

I thought You loved her? 

I thought You would have woken her up. 

She forgot to say goodbye that morning. Why didn't You at least remind her to say goodbye?

Heidi always said goodbye. 
Always.

I met her once in my dreams I've seen Dan once too. 
I know I'll see them again one day.

This is just a small corner of my innermost thoughts and dreams.

I hope you never visit for none have the strength to climb there way out from here.

Lucky for me, I'm getting a helping hand.

He's been down even lower, to the very depths of this lonely place.

He stole the keys and left a lantern in there space. 



Hopefully this helps someone who thinks dark and gloomy thoughts. It's okay. There are probably other people that smile at you and look happy as Larry but have just mastered the art of emotional camoflauge.

Just about a month ago me and my girlfriend talked about exploring more relationship -wise and we agreed that we could send and receive nudes from people. I thought whatever it’s just photos and when she told me she found someone I didn’t really care and said yeah that’s fine. But then she started getting distant and we fought and I found it she was falling in love with him, they had been sexting and talked about having sex without my knowledge. She promised she would stop because she didn’t really want to and she has attachment issues so when she meets someone she gets strong emotional connections fast. Well a couple days ago we fought again and I confronted her because I thought nothing had changed and I was right. They were still doing all the same stuff as before. Again she promised she would stop and I want to believe her so bad because I love her. Without going into detail she is really the only reason I get out of bed in the mornings and I know that’s not healthy but I don’t know how to fix it. I want her to fix it so bad and I want to believe her but I already had issues with trust and I’ve been lied to for a month so now even when she says she loves me I can’t believe her.

126,"Hey whoever reads this,

For quite a long time now I've always had thoughts about just ending it all because it would be easier. But lately even when something even becomes a little bit hard, my brain just thinks ""why don't you just kill yourself?"". Sometimes it just comes out of no where, for instance I was watching Netflix with my SO, and suddenly in my head pops in, ""you could just kill yourself"" 

Recently, I've noticed a lot of memes about this kind of thing though, so it must be normal for everyone to experience this, right? Memes such as ""when you wake up not dead so you have to go to work"" etc. 

While I don't feel the urge to kill myself, I keep hearing it more and more everyday. 

For full disclosure and context, I have seen a doctor, psychologist and psychiatrist about this sort of thing before. I was taking Wellbutrin 300mg  because I did have these thoughts before, and I'm not sure it helped. I was using it for 2 years but they have come back after about 5 months of not taking it. I was also sleeping for 18+ hours a day, but it has been attributed to narcolepsy so I continue to take dexedrine 15mg  and modfinil 100mg. 

I just feel like nothing in my life is actually stressful, and things seem to be going pretty good, yet if I don't take the dexedrine/modafinil combo, I'll sleep a lot, and I still have these intrusive thoughts.

So, I am currently climbing out of the pit of a depressive episode. It conveniently led to my decision to leave my job which was supporting me however, and so I'm now on the hunt for a new job. I've been through three in the past year, the most recent lasting eight months. I'm hoping the medication I was just prescribed will help a bit with maintaining a life in general, but as for right now, my main concern is keeping up with my income.

I know for sure I'm depressed, I can't possibly doubt that given the state of my room and my level of motivation, but I'm bipolar (type II) and since I'm on meds I rarely get hypomania, and honestly not getting mania makes me feel so invalid.

When my psychiatrist asks me ""have you had any racing thoughts, impulsive behavior, high energy?"" and I say no, I always feel like that makes me less mentally ill. Like one of these days she's going to say ""ope you aren't bipolar at all you exaggerated everything this whole time.""

I have to remind myself that there was a time when I was -$90 in my bank account because I would spend and spend. And hypomania was always hard to spot because I just felt.. better. But the depression has always ruled over the mania.

Maybe it's because my dad used to fake illnesses for meds. My mom was anti medicine because of this, when I told her I thought I was depressed in high school she said ""well what do you want, just medicine?""

141,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

This is going to be a pretty personalized question, but hopefully it can help others in similar situations.

My thing is anxiety linked to minor self-harm. Undiagnosed, which is kinda why I'm writing this post.

Thing is, it's not really a conscious thing. I just kinda start doing it, and I'm aware of the pain and all, but it'll take about an hour or two of doing it before a moment of clarity hits - either when the pain gets really bad or I start bleeding - and I'm like ""What the hell am I doing to myself?"" (Exhibit A: the past hour. Don't worry, I'm not in any danger.) It happens in public, private, wherever. Lately it's been happening a lot at work (like Exhibit A).  I don't consciously feel worried or anxious most of the time when I do it, though it does happen when I feel those things too. It gets a lot worse with stress. 

I've done this as long as I can remember. I saw a psychologist about it once when I was younger, and after 30 minutes he wanted to put me on Xanax, after I specifically told him I didn't want medication (hence why I saw a psychOLOGist). I've tried covering up the ""hot zones"" with bandages or clothing, but nothing helps, the behavior always comes back after I heal. Plus I hate lying when people ask about it, because I just can't tell them the truth, and that just makes me feel worse. My family and SO try to help, but mostly they're just trying to stop the behavior, which hasn't helped for ~20 years. I want to address the cause, and if that doesn't help, then think about methods other than a temporary physical barrier from hurting myself or asking people I love to slap me or throw something at my head when they see me doing it.

I want to find a new doctor now that I'm out of my parents' house and on my own with a stable job, income, and my own health insurance. My stance on medication has changed too - if I need it, I need it. Now here's the dilemma: New hires in my job start out in a two-rotation program. My first rotation is up in a few months, and then it's about 99% certain I'm going to be moved to another city for a year, then come back to my current city for full-time. I know it's going to take time seeing a doctor before seeing improvement. You have a build a bit of a relationship, I'm told. I don't want to start seeing one doctor, then move in a few months and start all over again, then move back a year after that and have to pick up where I left off. But then there's also that 1% chance I stay in my current city for my next rotation, but if I wait until I hear the decision on that, I'll have already wasted some time that I could have been getting help. 

I guess what I'm asking is this: In your opinion, is it better to wait and deal with my issue on my own for now, then re-evaluate when I move back and start seeing a doctor then, or start seeing a doctor now and go through the hassle of switching doctors twice when I have to move there and back? Just trying to get some other perspectives or experiences, maybe with switching doctors or moving or anything like that. 

TL;DR: I'm going to be moving between cities twice in the next 18 months. Should I start seeing a doctor now or wait until my life settles down?",09Apr2019,3

She is extremely against anything like this (note: I am on an anti-depressant for my anxiety, but my Rx needs to be changed which is one of the few reasons I need to see a psychiatrist), and she has no idea that I’m seeing my school counselor.

The only reason I even need to tell her is because we are on the same insurance plan, and she’d see on the billing plan I’m sure that I’m visiting a psychiatrist.

146,"Hi I’m f 18. I’ve been taking zoloft for about 6-7 years. I’m one of those people that have a hard time staying on a schedule of taking them so I take them on and off. Sometimes I’ll go months without them. Well I feel like this medicine has made me worse. I’m a completely different person when I’m not taking them. I’m toxic, I’m mean, and just really bad.  My mental health plummets while not taking them. It’s never been this bad before though. I started these for depression but now I have a huge amount of other mental illnesses. There’s other factors to why I have more mental issues now but I feel like these have made it worse. Anyone have anything similar to this? Or any problems with Zoloft at all?

147,"I really don't know how to start this, I really need some help (what this might be, tips, etc).

It started about 1.5 years ago, the symptoms. Every time I felt uncomfortable in an environment (i.e talking to a girl I don't think likes me, embarrassing myself etc) I clenched my jaw up against my upper teeth and closed my eyes, as hard as I could, for a second or two. This would happen pretty often, and I still do this from time to time when anxiety kicks in. However, over these aprox 1.5 years I have been noticing more and more stuff going on and I'm not sure what's going on. Maybe **2-3 times a day**, anxiety/stress randomly hits me. It's a dull feeling, my throat hurts and my body feels empty. **I start clenching/flexing my muscles** (calves and thighs mostly), walking extremely focused and **repeating the same word over and over again in my head**. Usually it's something random, fitting the situation, but those random words gets easily switched with ""I hate myself"". **I might hit myself in the head** too, impulsively. This may sound silly or unserious, but trust me, this is worse than it sounds. It makes me embarrass myself in front of my class mates, makes my parents look at me strangely and overall just fucking sucks. I googled symptoms for ocd and some of them fit, but I don't want to self diagnose. Please, please feel free to ask for additional information. Any tip or information will help me so much. I don't want to live like this. Thank you so much.

148,"Two years ago i was on holidays during summer, with my friends. Every night we were out or at our apartment making fun and joking around, and sleeping was the last thing to think about. One time, i didn't sleep for about 4 days, it was horrible but i did not sleep for real, not even for a single minute. So the afternoon of the fourth day, i went out to buy something to eat, and while i was waiting for my food, i kept watching the city i was in (which i knew very well) and while watching i was thinking ""where am i?"" And then i thought ""who am i??"" .... it was horrible, but fortunately lasted not more than like 5 minutes..

152,"If this is the wrong sub for this type of post, please let me know. Also I’m on mobile so please bear with me.

I believe that my mother is codependent in an abusive friendship. My mom has been friends with her college roommate (I’ll call her S) for about 30 years. My mom is married to my dad and she has a job of her own, however she spends the bulk of her spare time (often hours per day) helping S run her work and personal life (for nothing in return as far as I know). S has 3 kids and takes on much more work than she can possibly handle, knowing that my mom will always be able to help out. Her main job is a high level position in the local school district.

S is also emotionally abusive to her children and my mom. From as early as I can remember, even when I was a toddler, S has never hesitated to call my mom a b*tch or an a**hole in front of me. That is just a small sampling, but S calls my mom a variety of names in her fits of rage.

My issue is that I’ve never really felt comfortable expressing these concerns to anyone. S is a highly respected member of the community, and I have always been forced to hide the role my mom has in her work. On the few occasions that I have said something felt wrong to my mom, she has been extremely defensive and angry.

There are many other strange behaviors going on here but I honestly don’t know what’s the most relevant to share.

Could someone help me figure out what this could mean, or how I can distance myself or come to peace with it? I have begun to doubt my own assessment of things since it has been this way for my entire life and everyone around me acts like it’s normal. The best I’ve gotten was a subtle admission from my dad that he doesn’t like the situation but doesn’t see anything to be done about it.

153,"So I’m in high school, recently diagnosed with a whole  list of various things, I was looking into treatment methods with my team of doctors and stumbled across PSDs.

Anyone here have a PSD? How hard was it to get them? School/work access of the dog? (USA for if legality is a thing.)

I mostly have issues regarding groups of people and auditory/occasionally visual hallucinations, some of the auditory hallucinations can be things like scratching, knocking, heavy breathing, etc. So I was thinking a dog trained for “room search” and to help with episodes or in crowds would be beneficial.

154,"Hi, Ive never posted anything like this before and honestly I dont know what I can even get from it if anyone cares enough to even respond but I feel like I should vent here.

Im a student from Portugal and I decided to move to Sweden about 3 years ago to finish my studies. I wanted to experience a different culture and learn as much as I could from it, so I could improve as a person. Its definitely a fantastic country in many ways. However to put it shortly, I feel miserable here.

Over the years here I managed to make a lot of friends, although most have been only temporary as they were international students on an exchange - but in the end I managed to form a group and I dont have problems arranging things with people, which is great. Regarding studies, Im almost done with just my ongoing thesis left, which is also great. Sweden has plenty of opportunities and its a very developed country to live in, great once again. 

The problem is that at the end of the day I just cannot shake the crippling loneliness I feel. It has gotten worse and worse as time goes on, I used to think it was the scandinavian darkness and cold that was responsible for it (and in fact it does contribute) but I dont think its the main cause. Basically I feel like I dont have friends I really connect to strongly, I miss my family and some of my very good friends from back home, dating has gone horribly wrong - Ive had my worst experiences here, and basically my self-esteem is at my all time lowest.

For some reason all the experiences I had with girls here, whether international or swedish, were unpleasant in one way or another. Ideally Id be going for swedes as they are plenty but 90% of the time I cannot relate to them and just cannot connect to, they are really physically attractive but somehow its like there is a mutual disinterest in our personalities. Its also uncommon that I even get to know one on my day to day life and when I do there is always this politeness distance barrier they put up that feels super tiresome to break through. A lot of people use tinder here but I havent had the chance to get good photos to even build a profile for that and honestly it seems like such a forced way of meeting someone (although I am up for trying) 

I cant complain about international girls per se, the only problem is that as most are exchange students then there is always the stress of the person leaving at some point, also for the same reason most girls are just up for random hookups and are on constant party-mode so its hard to even build anything more calm and real. Understandable since Ive been in the same position before and wanted the same. 

People here are generally very fit and well dressed and tend to be quite good looking. Ive heard quite a few compliments about my appearance before so I would say I look ok and I started going to the gym to work on myself a bit more lately - but its crazy how superficial this country feels. Honestly I feel all the time that Im comparatively less attractive to some people I know and I feel like my looks are judged much more, I did not care about my looks in the past so much but now it feels like they matter a lot, lot more than back home. I was quite happy about my appearance before coming here as I wouldnt think about it too much and focused on building self confidence, but after some bad experiences here insecurities have grown that I did not have before. Buying good clothes suddenly became an issue, height became an issue, fitness became an issue, etc. 

The worst of it all is that I started texting a Swedish girl last summer that was quite into me at the start, she was pretty awkward and relied on texting too much but I decided to keep trying to get closer to her. In fact she was the one who started texting and she would text me multiple times with long messages daily. All of our common friends told me she was interested. I tried making a move several times but she just avoided them. Ended up now with me having a strong crush for her and being used for attention basically, so now I have to cut her off after months of pouring my heart into trying to get her, more than Ive ever done before with anyone including my ex. 

As for friends, the ones I have are not exactly the best influences. Basically all of them are into drinking and some into smoking, which slowly began being part of my life. I often find myself going to parties and not even enjoying them anymore and its a constant struggle to avoid overdoing alcohol and avoiding smoking.

You might be thinking that so far Ive only mentioned dating and other minor things which is nothing compared to big problems some people have and youre right. Youre absolutely right. But I just cannot stop feeling miserable though, I can barely find gratitude at this point. My life now is basically me going to work on my thesis, sleep deprived because I cant sleep properly out of stress of thinking about the girl I mentioned or just out of feeling alone in this country, then binge drinking coffee to stay awake (which helps but makes me anxious and irritable) so I find myself on edge for the rest of the day, then I have minor fights with my thesis partner orhave major mood swings and talk about messed up topics because I dont feel comfortable. Finally when Im alone I have random moments where I start feeling like crying, sometimes think about killing myself even though Id never do it, and just walk like a zombie to the next place I need to go to all while overcaffeinated. I genuinely feel like Im at my limit sometimes and I dont know what to do, Im trying to come up with a plan to improve the situation but sometimes I just break down. Fun things are just not fun anymore, all I think about is stress and problems that seem unsolvable. 

My idea is to go to the gym regularly, cut down on coffee, avoid smoking and cut down on drinking, try to sleep better somehow, avoid the girl I mentioned and if necessary just tell her how I feel now so she can stay away, maybe start a tinder somehow. Id love to go to a psychologist but sadly I cant afford one. Anyway I mostly wanted to vent but if anyone would like to give me their thoughts Id greatly appreciate it, any suggestions or comments would be great, thank you for reading in any case",09Apr2019,2

158,"For a long time I have had a poor mental health, just generally. I was the slightly edgy, slightly nerdy and very quiet kid in high school. After I was done with high school, a very constant, regular and safe place was removed from my life pretty forcefully and I suddenly had this huge abyss in front of me that had to be filled with ""future life choices.""

I went to university after the summer but it didn't feel like the right choice. I've always been outdoorsy and I adore traveling, and the long summer vacation after high school reaffirmed that strongly. As the winter came I was suddenly greeted with massive stress over exams and deadlines, so add to that short, dark days and a massive disconnect between what you're doing and what you like to do and you've got an existential crisis. Which in turn led to some days or even weeks of feelings of my mind going totally crazy and I didn't want to do anything anymore and honestly I think I was just plainly depressed.

I quit university after the first year and went to do ""what I loved."" I went traveling and I went on a quest to find a study program that fit me. But winter came again and things were moving to slow for what I had in mind and... The existential crisis and depression were back. This time I was better prepared and I was able to not let it influence my life choices as much this time. I still went traveling, found a study program to start after the summer and had a good time during that summer.

This year was the same story with a different setting once over. Except this year one crucial thing was different: over the summer I gathered enough motivation to seek out therapy out of fear that whatever I was going through would influence this new study I chose once again. This year I still felt super down (and still continue to feel the aftershocks, like right now) during the dark period but at least I felt more okay with it.

Now the thing is that my therapist and I are looking for what really motivates me to change. And that's been going on for a few months by now and I still feel we've made absolutely zero progress.

For a large part of 21 years I've lived, I've dealt with feelings of loneliness. I've never felt like I fit in, anywhere. The single event that pushed me over the edge to go to my doctor was the first introduction day at my current school. I was so deathly afraid I wasn't going to fit in after that day I almost broke down in the train on my way home. This was what prompted me to look into anxiety and that's what I went to the doctor with. By now I've got an official diagnosis for social anxiety and I feel like I need to talk about seasonal depression being added to that list as well. 

But there's a big flip side to this whole. I can live fine if any of this is not a problem, which is the case for over 75% of the days. I've learned to cope with it, which has admittedly led me to live a life I'm not happy with, but which I can feel absolutely fine with for just one more year each year. Sure it gets bad and sure I'd rather do a lot of things differently but every time it gets bad it's followed by feeling a lot better and just content afterwards. So it's hard to find motivation to make myself feel like shit for days by intentionally seeking out scary situations, if it makes me feel a lot worse on the good days I have now. 

Today in therapy I talked a lot about this stuff. She explained ambivalence to me, feeling like you need to change and at the same time not wanting it. That's something I can relate to. She also dropped a few times that it might just be okay to call it a wrap and grow old with how I'm living my life, because in truth I'm living fine. And 75% of the days I would be okay with that. The thing with my anxiety is that I feel good about avoiding things. I don't care if I do that. I'll always find a solid argument outside anxiety to not do the thing I avoid because of anxiety to put myself at ease and stop worrying about it. This is a good thing if you're learning to rationalize anxiety but not if it actually blocks you from doing what you'd like to. 

In short, my therapist proposed the idea of not solving my problems because the majority of the time they don't actively bother me. But I can't tell if they don't bother me for the right reason. If I just distract my problems away, that is not good. I'm avoidant, I feel lonely, I feel like I'm going crazy more often than I'd like, I feel like I need to cross-check my big decisions with my parents whose opinion I don't value, I feel locked up in my way of life and I can't get out no matter how hard I try, and I just want change. Sure I can go grocery shopping (without buying sweets or alcohol out of fear of the cashier judging me) and sure I can finish my college with good grades (while getting stressed out over if I'm doing the right thing with my life) and sure I can hang out with my friends (who I can't really connect with because I feel apart from the world and I don't fit in) but those feelings between the brackets have, and I say this in full seriousness, the potential of killing myself one day in the far future. I just want to stop dealing with this so badly at times (Christmas breaks have become kind of a nightmare because of this) that I can see my future self actually finally taking control to make it end. Not my current self though, which means I still have time. But I feel like I still haven't made any progress since I first decided to get therapy and fix it. I know I have, but the bad days are still as bad as they used to be and the good days are still as good as they used to be. My mind just has a million more ways to over-analyze my life without making anything better. So no, I don't want to live my life like this for the rest of my time. The good days don't make up for the bad. But I need to find a bit of motivation to actually make the effort to fix things and that feels just as impossible as going to the moon myself.

As I type this out I feel like it's all so exaggerated. Like I'm just crying for attention, in order to finally find a place I fit in. Because after all, my whole life and everything I do is an effort to fit in somewhere. It's so sad that I make myself feel this way because I know my condition deserves care, but I just refuse to accept that. And talking about this in therapy feels like condemning myself to a life of horrors because she will agree that I'm all making it up and send me away to make place for someone who actually isn't faking it. Maybe it's because when I say it out loud or write it down, it makes me realize how ridiculous my fears are. And I feel like that can't be what I'm really thinking because it's so ridiculous, I must have made it up because I read it somewhere. God this shit is so infuriating.

162,"Hey guys

So I've had issues in my childhood with abusive parents and bullying and that caused a lot of self esteem issues. I had worked through a lot of these issues, moved to another country and I'm studying and working at the same time. I became very independent and really liked how well I was doing. I had a lot of hobbies, friends and everything.

I recently got into my first relationship and we've been dating for 7 months. However, ever since I fell in love with my amazing girlfriend, I have lost all sense of self. I feel like I'm nothing without her. Initially, losing my virginity and knowing that this girl liked me made me feel even better and accomplished. I was doing great but now I am a complete mess. I have no idea what to do with myself anymore. My girlfriend has a very busy schedule with med school and that means I now only get to see her 3-4 times a week and even then most of the time she's studying. 

Now I don't know if it's the fact that I'm not getting enough attention in this relationship but my self esteem has gone down the drain. I can't get stuff done, I'm neglecting my health (I started smoking cigarettes) and I have no interests in my hobbies (cycling, music, etc) anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some moments of clarity and peace but that's all they are, moments. A few nights ago I went out on a drive late at night and that just gave me a lot of peace and clarity. However, in the morning, I was a mess again. Every morning I wake up feeling extremely lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend used to want me all the time, loved sleeping with me and loved getting attention. Now her med school has taken over her life and she's fine on her own without my attention or time. I just feel Ive been put on the back end of things.

163,"Hey, I've never posted on here, but I've had a really rough past few months and just need to get some advice from other people who may have anxiety or depression to help me navigate this situation. I'll try not to let it go on too long, but since this whole thing has been going on for three months it's a bit lengthy. Sorry.

So, I became friends with this girl I'll call Emily in the eighth grade. We've been pretty much inseparable up to this point in our lives. I've shared all of my favorite things with her and helped her through so many hard times. She's done the same for me. We're both in our third year of college now, and she called me last night to tell me she never wants to talk to me again.

I've known our friendship was getting toxic for the better part of a year now. She talked about me behind my back to people we are both friends with as well as with my family. She's called me on several occasions telling me that she was about to do something terrible to herself, but when I'd call her having a panic attack she would get annoyed and snap at me for waking her up from naps.

I've had other friendships get ruined by things like this before, so I started getting desperate and started calling her a crazy amount of times a week. We'd make plans and she'd always cancel them, and it got to the point that whenever we talked I'd get stressed and she started feeling depressed. Even though I knew we weren't happy neither of us wanted to talk about our problems because we didn't want to hurt each other's feelings.

So...three months ago, I called her while I was having a bad day and she tiredly asked if I was still on my meds and going to counseling sessions. The answer to these questions is always yes. I got so mad we both decided we needed to cut the conversation off. I felt so lonely and isolated because she was too tired to help me that I reached out to my ex to talk to instead.

The next day she called to check up on me and I was still feeling angry. It finally broke down. Emily told me she didn't know what to say to me, and I called her out for always being a fair weathered friend. I don't remember most of the stuff we said that day, but as soon as we hung up I felt terrible. I tried to call her back, terrified she would do something stupid. She said she just needed space so I respected that.

Two days later, she called and told me that I couldn't call as often, which I already had concluded needed to be done. Then she said she didn't want to help me with my writing anymore. I'd often ask for her opinions, and with her courseload, it was just too much for her. I understood this. Then, she told me she didn't think she could share anything positive in her life with me and that the only reason I was angry was that I was jealous she had friends at school.

That hurt so bad it drove a wedge in our friendship for two months until a few weeks ago when I called her saying I didn't want to stop being friends. I just wanted to talk things through. After canceling on me at least once, she did eventually sit down and have the conversation with me.

I thought it was a step in the right direction. We both laid out our new boundaries and put everything on the table for each other. We were honest and vulnerable, and it was actually really good. Or so I thought.

Cut forward to last night. It's about 10:30 p.m. and she calls to apologize for ignoring the one text I'd sent her asking if she was okay. A mutual friend told me she was having a hard time but I didn't push for details, just asked if she was feeling okay. Then, she said it.

""I don't think we can talk anymore.""

I've never felt so hurt in my entire life. I thought of all the things we'd shared and all the times we'd helped one another, but I wanted to stay calm because I knew she had been going through stuff.

She told me that ever since we had our discussion her depression's become exponentially worse and that she's started cutting herself. A habit that she had kicked about half a year ago. I asked if I had said something which triggered her, to which she replied no. It was just that she felt happier when we weren't talking.

I feel like she is blaming me for all of this, and maybe I took it too far, but I ended up blocking her on everything. I worry about her mental health, but this whole situation has emotionally drained me and she clearly doesn't want to talk to me. What do I do? How do I proceed? Am I a bad friend? Did I do something wrong? Is this all my fault? My anxiety and depression are spinning out of control and I don't know what to do. I feel so desperate and alone. Like I'm the worst person on the face of the earth. I knew our friendship was toxic, but I didn't know I was such a negative person.

164,"I'll try to keep this novel short.

Basically, I was an anxious child and anxiety runs in my family. When my parents divorced at 14, it went into full blown OCD. I was late to things and going sleepless because I was performing rituals for hours. Finally at 16 I got some therapy and paxil and things got better throughout the years. Unfortunately, there have been plenty of times where I am not consistent in taking my paxil and sometimes decide to go without for months at a time. Sort of the whole, ""I've been doing good so I'll take a break"" thing.

The last four years have been some of the happiest in my life. I am in a great relationship, more confident and social, and my career is going well. Nothing in particular to be stressed about, and aside from a few small OCD episodes, I have considered my anxiety under control for years.

But also in the last 4 years, I have had many health issues. I think it was all triggered by the fact that I was getting frequent UTI's which later caused reactive arthritis. In two years I had an ulcer, shingles, hives, and random parts of my body ache. All sounds like side effects of bad anxiety, right? But I was never feeling stressed or anxious when any of this occurred. Unfortunately it sort of turned me into a hypochondriac, so AFTER my health is bad, THEN I start freaking out.

Recently, my chest has felt tight and pressured. Another symptom of anxiety that I don't FEEL LIKE I have?

I've had CAT cans, MRIs, blood tests, x-rays, ekg tests, everything you can think of to make sure I'm healthy and don't have an autoimmune disorder. All the doctors I've been to shrug at me and say it must be my anxiety.
