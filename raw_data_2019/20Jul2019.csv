0,"Or: whats the difference between suicidal thoughts / being suicidal 

Sorry if this isn't a proper post",20Jul2019,3
1,"It's actually pretty weird and I don't know what to think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty often when others cry or suffer - no matter whether they are close relatives or complete stranges - I feel like I really should start laughing. Even though I don't feel any kind of pleasure from their sadness. I hate inflicting pain and I've beaten probably only one person in my entire life (old times, elementary school, minor quarrel). I'm not interested in plotting against others to make them miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

But still, when someone is in front of me and is hurt - I focus all of my strong will to not laugh or smile. I know it will make them feel worse and it's social suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

It is true that that I'm an emotional idiot (in the past I've participated in emotional IQ screening and had one of the lowest results in the group) but I wouldn't say that I'm indifferent to what other people feel.

&amp;#x200B;

But still - it's been a while and I'm wondering if it may be a symptom of some deeper problem? It really affects e.g. my marriage when my wife thinks I don't care about bad stuff. It's not true. I'm simply doing what I can to not burst laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand - despite what I think of myself and what I would like to think - there are moments when I really want someone suffer. Yeah, everybody does it; like ""I hate my coworker, I'm going to kill this son of a \*\*\*\*\*"". But when I do it, I don't restrain myself from action because of moral standpoint. Every time the most important factor that comes to my mind is ""what will be the consequences"", not ""it is simply wrong"". The consequences being ""I'm not skilled enough to avoid legal punishment"" or ""The person may turn out powerful enough to retaliate"".

&amp;#x200B;

I've always considered myself a good person (or at least tried to be one) but it's one of the most important reasons why I doubt is it actually true. And maybe I'm fooling myself and the people around me?",20Jul2019,6
2,"I'm 22 have only had two other jobs besides working with my father, have learned a lot from him business wise but hard to think for myself as I can only thing for him. - My backstory is posted below.

I have never been praised or acknowledged by my father like he praises my older siblings and compares me to them, I only am given gratitude when i am making money. Business, work and constant endless favors or tasks is the relationship I have with my father, we do not talk about me, my interests, girls, friends anything of my personal life he hasn't ever known and hasn't ever asked. I have never felt a true emotional connection with my father that I have always longed for and even pouring my heart to him about how our relationship is and how I want to make it better, I want to see him cry, I want to see some emotion out of him besides anger, but he's cold and holds its against me playing the victim as it is my fault. He talks to my sisters in ways we dont talk and being around him gives me constant all day anxiety as if i'm about to be scolded for doing something wrong since he only praises me when im making money. I don't do anything for myself that im growing in besides working out, that is what I do in my free time besides playing video games at night from 9-11 or watching podcasts if I have time or short moments with friends, the rest is all working for my dad. 

I feel like i could never be a normal kid, taking naps in the day, wanting to watch a movie and just relax at home and do nothing for a day, these are all the things i couldn't do as the moment he walks in the door i get bad anxiety jump up and do something different, if i'm not doing something productive he starts the abuse and it has made me become shameful of myself, i have very low-self esteem and always asking for permission on everything i do feeling constantly guilty because instead of having fun i should be "" making money"" This has taken a toll on my relationships with friends as they always ask me to go places and even though my dad would say yes to me going, he guilt trips me when i come back of how i have all this work to do and it never ends which has made me in turn become introverted by staying in instead of going out. I'm surrounded by all day anxiety towards him and have social anxiety because i restrict myself going out and already have anxiety as it is. Friends invited me places but i make excuses sadly ( a part of me tells me not to do it. ) 

Ever since finding out he was a narcissist a year ago it has made things a lot worse on my relationship with him and my mental health as im aware of how this routine and loophole i've been in has affected me mentally by reading and becoming aware of how it has affected me, I give more effort and have a better work ethic than anyone he could ever hire. I'm smart, but I feel like im becoming a wasted talent. I make little money from my father but save what I can I have a little over $30,000 saved and want to use this money to get to a better mindset but leaving him is just as hard, and im scared, im lost, i'm scared of failing. I know he will always hold it against me. Money is not my ultimate fascination like my father, i don't know what it is but right now I want to feel free, I want to know myself, I want to be happy.

6,"Many people don't realize that living in poverty can lead directly to mental health problems. Poverty is not just a physical struggle; to a certain extent, in can be argued that it's more of a mental struggle. Guyana, a country where about two-thirds of the population is impoverished, ranks among one of the highest suicide rates in the world (only surpassed by Lithuania and Russia). The fact that 29% of the population lives in poverty is not a coincidence. There are many factors leading to this alarming number including the negative stigma about mental health, lack of professionals, lack of facilities and many others.

9,"Just a little background information, but I'll try to keep it short and not elaborate on every issue: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 28/f, and grew up in the US. Without taking a deep dive on childhood abuse, I would say that there were definitely parts of it that tended toward abusiveness. My parents were never together and I had 3 older sister, who sometimes lived with me and sometimes didn't. Some things that stand out are: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- CPS was called to our house many times when I lived with my mom. Eventually my eldest sister effectively ""ran away"" to my grandma's house and never came back, and another sister was taken by CPS to live in a group home.   
My sisters and I all have our own recollections of specific instances of abuse, but we were always told to lie to the social workers, and I always did. We also had various periods of homelessness, living in abandoned buildings, my mom's job - which was a gym, and in hotels. This happened at least 5-7 different times. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I can personally recall my mom having very alarming mood swings, tellings us she loved us one day, and other times being cruel for apparently no reason. 

To cite some specific examples of this, I remember several occasions wherein we were riding in a car (my mom, my sisters, and I), and my mom would be upset about something and she would tell us that if she could only be sure that we would all end up dead and no one would make it out alive, she would crash her car and kill everyone in it. 

Another time, my sister (maybe 7 years old) peed on the floor in her sleep and my mom got up to clean it. I was sleeping in the same bed as my mom, and in a sudden burst of anger, my punched me right in the stomach, which left me in shock and pain to the point that I was doubled over for several minutes (I was about 5 yrs old). 

&amp;#x200B;

\- My mom was getting child support but would not feed us. She had food for herself that we weren't allowed to eat, but I can't recall her cooking any meals for us. We must've been given enough food to survive, but I honestly can't remember, and we would frequently be so hungry that my sister and I would make ""mud pies"", and eat those, or eat bugs we found outside. 

\- My mom would call my sisters (half sisters, who are mixed), ""niggers"", tell me that my dad was a drug addict, wanted me to be aborted, etc, anything to try to hurt our feelings, without any provocation. 

\- She insisted that I was deathly allergic to dairy, nuts, etc and at one point convinced the doctors that I was having such terrible reactions that I was life-flighted to a childrens hospital and had major surgery, with half of my intestines taken out. 

&amp;#x200B;

There were other things that I won't bother to expand on, but my mother has always totally denied all of this, and tells a different story of our childhood. If we ever say that we remember otherwise, she insists that we have been brainwashed. 

&amp;#x200B;

As adults, my sisters and I all seemed very different from our mom, definitely not as cruel. I had one sister, however, who was very depressed and ultimately committed suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for myself, which was the point of this post, I thought that my understanding of the childhood abuse rendered me unaffected by it, and I had pretty normal romantic relationships and a relatively normal life (no angry outbursts or suicidal tendencies) until the last couple years. 

After my sister died, my pet whom I loved dearly died also, and I felt responsible for both. My boyfriend at the time and I broke up (it was an amicable breakup), and I was still grieving over those losses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I met my most recent boyfriend. I think at this point (age 26), I was still pretty heartbroken over everything that had transpired in the last couple years, and when this person - his name was Dan- first told me he loved me and we got into a serious relationship is when things started to unravel for me. I didn't want to have another failed 4 year relationship and I was set on making this one work. I became controlling and tried to push a relationship and a life with me on him very quickly. He was on the avoidant side and wholeheartedly rejected that, and I became someone I didn't even recognize anymore. He never paid compliments, so I was nosy and tried to figure out what it was he liked in women, and as a result I came to resent his past flings and girlfriends or anyone he was interested in because I didn't know what they had that I didn't. I used to be someone who was confident and got along really well with women, but I became insecure and jaded, and controlling and uptight. 

Ultimately, he left me very suddenly one night and in way I never anticipated, and I was completely devastated. He refused to speak to me or have any contact with me at all. I had a cerebral growth during that time that left me with a constant headache, I couldn't sleep almost at all (on a consistent basis, I slept no more than one hour), couldn't eat without throwing up, lost about 20 lbs. I went to a doctor and was prescribed Ambien for sleep and Zoloft for depression. Both made things for me much worse. I still couldn't sleep more than an hour every night, except this time I was having nightmares about my ex dying), and the Zoloft was making me more depressed. I started to lose track of things, I would show up for work on the wrong days, couldnt remember stretches of time, and did things to try to contact him that seemed like a good idea at the time, but in retrospect were very dumb. I literally could not handle the abandonment, I had no idea what to do, but felt compelled to do \*something\*, which resulted in a lot of terrible mistakes that I can never undo, such as going to his house without his permission, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all culminated in him getting a restraining order, which I consented to. After 8 months, I finally realized what a selfish asshole I'd been and how much happier he could be without me. All I cared about was making amends with him, and even though I knew he didn't want that (he never spoke to me again, but told my sister that he doesn't want me in his life in any capacity whatsoever, and she informed him of a  2nd cerebral hemmorhage I had- the first was while we were dating- , but he told her he doesn't care if I died, doesnt want to be informed), I couldn't accept the fate of never speaking to him again until after it was all said and done. It took me until then to realize that he had tried to be fair to me by not pursuing a restraining order earlier, but I just kept pushing him and refused to move on.   


Looking back on it, that breakup was one of the most painful experiences of my life, and to be honest I'm not sure why. He was pretty much unaffected, found someone else within a few months, never doubted his decision, never missed me, but for months I was more lost than I'd ever been. 

So I guess what I'm wondering is, my lack of being able to handle this breakup and the repetitive bad decisions and regrettable behavior is something I can't explain. I literally can't recall doing some of the things I've done, and others I knew were not just wrong at the time, but bad decisions for me personally, and I did them anyway. I don't know why someone who sabotage their life knowingly and I don't know why I can't recall making those decisions. That person brought a lot of happiness to my life that I never had before, and taught me things that were wrong with my worldview, and I don't know why I ruined that.   
I've looked into borderline personality disorder and wonder if this is something that describes me and how to fix it. 

Also, I struggle with making decisions, knowing what to do, and knowing when I'm doing the right thing. Seems like a silly question, but how do make the right decision, and how do you know when it's the right one?",20Jul2019,1

11,"I’ve been properly fully diagnosed with high functioning autism and social anxiety disorder. That’s it. Whenever I’m “depressed”, I know in my heart it’s just how being a teenager is. (I’m 16.) but sometimes it gets so bad. And it sounds stupid but I have an almost constant desire to cut myself. I’m not suicidal. Let me say that again . I am NOT suicidal. I cut my legs. At first I cut my arms, because I didn’t feel much and it was easy to cut deep but it was too visible there even though I hate my arms and cover them up often. Now I cut my thighs, it hurts more but it’s okay. I don’t know what it is. 


And when I get really “upset”(I don’t wanna say depressed because I don’t have depression) the urge just increases. And when I feel like crying or get that spike of upsetness it skyrockets to the point of if I’m not around anybody I’ll run to try and find my razor. About a year and a half ago I asked my doctor about depression. She gave me a little test and said nothing out of the ordinary for teenagers. Obviously, she’s right, she’s a doctor, and kids my age are notorious for taking themselves too seriously. 


And I only get “depressed” for like two weeks at a time. The worst bout of it so far was like a month, Max. And it was cuz things weren’t going great for me there wasn’t no reason. I feel like faking everything and being totally ridiculous. I feel like im one of those kids whose attention craving and just wants people to say boohoo or whatever. Anyways.

People with PDD experience depression all the time and don’t remember — or know — what it feels like not to be depressed."" 

I do not have a normal mood, my default mood is neither here nor there. I really wouldn't care if I'm dead or alive.

I'm totally going to delete this post and don't care who sees it but typing it out is helping. Five years ago I was misdiagnosed as bi polar 2 and placed on Seroquel and Lithium. Started sleeping \`12 hours a day and couldn't get it up, but at least I had fewer side effects from my ADD meds. TL;DR not bi polar, just depressed and a non responder to SSRIs. I made it a month but the anger and depression was unbearable so I agreed to take Zyprexa and Anafanil . Whoops. A subsequent attempt at tapering off the Zyprexa saw the addition of yet another anti-psychotic-vryalr. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have: high blood pressure (reeeeallly high), high heart rate, high LDL, am pre diabetic, have an EPS related tremor, no energy, no motivation, severe memory issues, and sometimes when I  stand up I get head rushes so bad I fall over. I am super duper in shape so my doctor thinks its the meds. Along with all the usual sexual side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on a 6 month taper from the Zyprexa with plenty of adjunctives and honestly it's just as bad as going cold turkey. I don't consider myself an angry person which is why this rage is so troubling. Maddest I have ever been, for absolutely no reason. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I've been reaching out to rehabs, but everyone seems to be underestimating the withdrawals. Sorry, ""discontinuation syndrome"". Fuck, I just want someone to treat me like an alcoholic and throw me on a Librium IV while I CT.

19,"I have been very confused the last few months, maybe even for a year now concerning „myself“. This confusion unfortunately makes it very hard for me to structure this post so I'm just gonna divide it into a few sections.

Background:

I'm the youngest one in my family (just turned 18 years old), I have an older brother and sister. My father is an alcoholic and basically a ticking time bomb exploding every other month. My mother is fairly normal just like my brother and sister. Out of all my family members, my father's the only one I don't really love for obvious reasons. Our family also had and always had its fair share of financial problems.

I was the outsider most of my school time (skipped school fairly which only made it worse), which changed a bit after I left my old school after 9th grade. I made a few school friends, none of them were like best friends though.
I got in trouble for skipping school in 10th and 11th grade and quit mid-11th grade to work as part of a social voluntary year.
I quit said voluntary year after my coworkers decided to give me all of the shitty work because I was „only a voluntary worker“.
I'm technically jobless right now doing nothing.

I play video games a lot, a habit that started in my early grammar school days. They give me the escapism from real life that I need, the escapism only two other things on my life can provide right now, music and my pets (a cat and a dog).

Mental situation:

As I said, I don't really know what's going on inside my head.

It's hard for me to socially interact with other people, it has even gotten to a point where I find difficult to talk to my family.
Simply talking to someone can make me sweat and feel „uneasy“.
I often fake laughing and smiling in front of others. 

It can also be very difficult for me to truly emphasize with other people, it even is easier for me to show emotions if it comes to animals instead of humans.

My emotions and moods can be very strong, there's some days where I feel super good and energetic, I feel like dancing on the spot, I'd even say euphoric (like when you're listen to really „good mood“ music).
Then there's other days where I can barely motivate myself to stand up and do anything, I feel tired, physically and mentally, not able to lighten up my myself.
I also start to cry or become aggresive very quickly.
I can barely control my emotions, if I'm aggressive I basically lose all rationality

I'm really scared of having to work, I don't want to work almost 50 years in an environment I hate working on something I hate surrounded by people I don't care about.
I want to do something I enjoy and feel free.

I don't have anyone I wanna share these things with personally so I decided to post it with this „throwaway“ account on Reddit.

There's potentially a lot of information missing from this whole thing, feel free to ask any questions.

24,"i watched the movie ""the lost prince"" again today. its a movie about an english child who has epilepsy, i connect to this movie because i have epilepsy also, but the movie can be taken mentally as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

the ""lost prince"" is a child  who the king and queen see as embarassing because of his condition, so hes forced to live out on the countryside alone with his own team of caretakers. throughout the movie, the child tends to enjoy life despite his condition. his country is going through a war at the time and his entire family keeps repeating ""i dont have time"" whenever he wants to spend time with them or show them something. depsite everything going on politically and day to day, the child just keeps on being a child. he has a cousin who lives the opposite life, forced to prepare for war, forced to take things serious, suffering day to day. when his cousin comes to visit the child, they spend time, have fun, and unfortunately ""the lost prince"" has a bad seizure that ends up taking his life.

&amp;#x200B;

when the child passes away... his cousin attends his funeral and says ""he was the only one of us who was able to be himself""... this quote strikes me very deep as i start to look at my own life

&amp;#x200B;

no matter what we go through or how much we go through... we really ARE special, especially mentally. even when our conditions are at its worst... we seem to be ourselves while the rest of the world gets wrapped up in their political and personal affairs.

&amp;#x200B;

i am not happy to have my conditions, which are many physical and mental disabilities, but i am proud that i am able to be myself. i realize that things can be tough sometimes, financially im not rich, but on the bright side... i can be myself, and many of us can!

&amp;#x200B;

i hope this encourages you all to feel good, take the time you have to focus on yourself and who you want to be, and i hope you all will realize that life is short so we must enjoy it to the best of our ability.

Sorry for the length of the post in advance, and I appreciate people reading through it.

So I was born with a condition that basically had a bunch of doctors getting into my downstairs stuff. All professional, of course, but a child doesn't know that. I had bladder issues, and the tubing was broken down there. Procedures happened from since I was born to about 10 or so. I've had surgeries, but also some procedures that weren't so nice. I only remember a few, but the main one was painful and had me lying on my back exposed to everyone in the room.

When I was around 8, another girl my age used to do things. She would get us naked and it was just skin touches, and that's it. I don't remember ever asking for it, but I don't remember pushing her away, either.

However, now that 10 years have passed, I've moved on for the most part. I don't get nightmares about what happened, and I don't have flashbacks or panic attacks about it.

It just makes me...uncomfortable. 

I don't like talking about sex, or anything to do with sex. It's just...awkward. I like sex, and I don't have an issue masturbating or anything, but talking about it just makes me feel gross and weird.

And, I've found that I'm really uncomfortable with missionary sex, or being on my back and exposed. I'd assume it's because of that one procedure I talked about up above, but I'm not sure. And again, no flashbacks or nightmares, just...extreme discomfort. I can ignore it and go on, but it makes me feel too exposed and awkward most of the time, so I avoid it if possible.

However, the thing that really gets me is that whenever the topic of rape is brought up, whether in person or in a movie, I just...can't deal with it. It makes me feel dirty and disgusting and I can't think when I hear that word.

I wasn't raped. The doctors were doing their job, and I never pushed that girl away when we were kids. But I just feel such a strong aversion to that topic and that thought. Sometimes, very rarely, I think about that...gross feeling when having sex and then I can't enjoy it anymore. But it's rare and I just get bummed out, not triggered by anxiety or anything.

I don't know if I have PTSD. When I hear PTSD, I think of panic around that situation or thing, and I think of triggers, and nightmares.

I can walk into a hospital perfectly fine. In fact, I like hospitals because I'm a hypochondriac, so it's nice to hear I'm not dying. And I can have sex fine, it's just on my back that makes me squeamish but still all right, and those few instances where it is just ruined for me because I remember that gross feeling. And even on the topics of sex or rape, I can sit through it, I just kind of tune out instead of really listening. 

I'm just not sure. I feel like an ass for being bothered by the idea of rape when there are people out there who have *actually been raped* and I haven't.

...What are your thoughts?",20Jul2019,3
28,"**Quick Summary:**  
I am 21, It is believed by doctors I've seen that I have Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety.  
I have tried many medicines, but I swear I end up getting more depressed on them.  
I have tried:

* Zoloft
* Celexa
* Effexor XR
* Lithium

Should I seek therapy?  Try different medicine, maybe try to find more doctors?

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Explanation (possibly venting?)**

Each time I've been on medicine it's for a few months and getting off the medicine is generally really tough on me.

I'm not sure If I've been to weird doctors, or if I'm just a weird case, It seems like they generally don't understand why it's not working and put me on something else, but I don't like that.

I think it's because I'm atypical in that I achieve much more than someone who is typically depressed and at 21 I am already relatively successful on my own merits.

My performance in day to day life seems to decrease moderately when I'm on medicine, which is why my parents don't think I should be on them.  I think this might be because (it's weird) but I feel like I have less anxiety on medicine and I fall into more of a depressive state with no push to do things.

I don't or maybe cannot see anything wrong with the current way I'm living, when I look at my life I see no reason to be depressed, but I just am.

I don't have any problems interacting with other people, but it generally feels like acting, many people have called me charismatic in my life.  I generally don't form bonds with other people that well though, I think its because I'm picky with who I want in my life.

Generally, my life follows the pattern of having a huge obsession with something and learning all I can about that one thing for a couple of months, and then getting bored and dropping my interest, making me think maybe I could be bipolar/ADD.

I never had problems focusing in school though because I am highly interested in learning about new things (in general) and find myself going on long binges of over 8 hours without eating food, not realizing how much time has past looking through information on my latest obsession on the internet.

I don't know, I'm highly confused with what may be the problem.  I want to be better but I feel confused and misdirected right now.  If you could please recommend what you think I should do, I came to Reddit because people seem nice here, and I get really anxious seeking help.  Thank you",20Jul2019,2
29,"Hello stranger, I hope you are well. I'm going to tell you my story. 
I'm a 23 years old girl. I have had generalized anxiety and depression since I was 16. I lived with both my parents until I was 18, when I moved cities with my mom.
My dad didn't want to split but she couldn't take it anymore because he had been unemployed for years, because every time he got a job he would either just stop going or get fired because of his personality. He is a narcissistic. He thinks he does everything better than everyone else, so no one is good enough to be his boss basically. Because of this, he didn't contribute for anything in the house. That was just my mom. She worked her ass off to pay for absolutely everything. And he didn't even value that. He didn't even help at home, cleaning or cooking.
He gets mad out of nowhere, and it's like he likes to fight. He was nice sometimes tho. I know he loves us in a really weird way. I loved talking about art with him. When he's in a good mood he's really funny and nice.
Since he was unemployed for so long, I spent a lot of time at home with him.
Unfortunately when I was young he started chatting with dozens of women online. He did that in my room at night, because the internet and the computer was there, and he thought I was asleep.
He'd whisper sexual things when he was talking to them.
There were lots of explicit pictures of women in the computer, since he didn't fully understand how it works, and he thought I couldn't see them.
It was really disturbing to hear him and to see all that so young. Plus, I couldn't bring myself to tell my mom because I thought she would be sad. I lived in constant agony, dreading the night because I knew he was going to be at my bedroom talking to other women. I'd lie awake until 5/6 am, when he would go to bed. I think that's why I started missing so many classes.
Eventually I worked up the courage to tell him I knew what he was doing and it was making me really anxious, but he said he only did those things because my mom wasn't caring with him and he had to get that somewhere else. He said one day I'd understand. But of course he didn't want me to tell my mom. I didn't.
However, she got tired of the fact that he didn't help her at all. 
It was a relief moving away from him, but the week before that was awful. He cried everyday begging my mom to stay and begging me to convince her, otherwise he'd kill himself. I was conflicted because I love both my parents, even though he did all those things. I truly pitied him, it made my heart hurt for him.
The year we moved was the year I got into university. 
Although I was relieved to be away from him, I moved away from my dad's side of the family and all my friends, which was a horrible thing for me. I felt alone. I didn't feel comfortable with my mom's side of the family. I isolated myself.
There was a time I'd go to the city I lived every weekend, just to feel like I was still part of my friend group. But I burned out.
For months, I could barely leave the house. I failed my second year in university. 
I felt like a loser, like everyone was ahead of me. It just got worse and worse. 
Then my grandpa from my mom's side of the family died and me and my mom went to live with my grandma, which was a good thing because my mom was having serious difficulty in paying the rent. I've been living in my grandma's house for 2 years now, and I absolutely hate it. My grandma doesn't understand me, she thinks I'm weird. I know she loves me but she wishes I was different. 
Plus, lots of family members are always coming in and out of the house, because they're all really close here, and I feel like I have no space or privacy. I'm never comfortable at home. 
Meanwhile, I changed to a better university and I was happier for a while. 
Until I relapsed and stopped going to classes again. I failed again. All my friends have graduated, and I'm still here. Its been 5 years. I should have graduated in 3. And even if I didn't fail from now on, there would still be 1 hear and a half before I graduated. I feel deeply ashamed by that.
Back to my dad. He's had multiple jobs and apartments since we moved out, because he always ends up missing payments and he gets kicked out. Fortunately, he has a place to stay for now. 
Our relationship has been even worse since I moved, because he expects me to call him every day and help him, but I just can't because I feel awfully anxious when I talk to him. 
So I don't call him for long periods of time, and when I do he's always mad and says I don't give a shit about him. I feel pretty crappy and guilty, even though I know he's to blame for a part of that. 
I have always tried hiding my anxiety and depression from him, since he always says depression is for the weak. 
But he knows I struggle a lot. He thinks it's ridiculous because I'm young and have no real problems, according to him. He's very disappointed in me, and I don't know why that hurts so much. My mom is incredibly supportive and she's not embarrassed of me, but somehow it's like what he thinks is more important. 
Recently he said he knows I'm going nowhere. He said I'm never going to graduate because if I haven't until now, I just won't. He also said he's embarrassed when talking to his friends because all their children have graduated and he has to make up excuses for me. I couldn't help but cry, which made me feel even worse since he got mad about it and I hate being vulnerable around him. 
That was 2 months ago. I haven't talked to him since then, even though we ended on ""good terms"". It's just, I can't work up the courage to call him because it makes me so damn anxious. 
He wants me to do everything for him, like send his resume to lots of companies, finding him a house every now and then, and he acts like that's the minimum I could do. I do it because when I was younger he would take me to the hospital when I needed, and he really worried about my physical health. 
Recently, he even stopped talking to his brother, because my uncle couldn't be around him anymore. My dad has since put me in charge of knowing everything that is going on in the family and tell him. It's a really big pressure. 
Even not having spoken to him in 2 months, I struggle with self confidence daily, and I'm always so scared that he'll call and just make me even more anxious and depressed than I usually am.
It's like I'm dependent on his actions.
I hate that what he does and says to me affects me so deeply.
By now, I should have made peace with the fact he's just not going to change and not let him affect me.
I'm desperate to live my life free from worrying about his judgments. This is like a prison.
What can I do? Please, any help is very appreciated.
I am deeply grateful that you took the time to read my story, that's incredibly kind.
I wish you well.",20Jul2019,1

33,"I’m feeling extremely stressed out, and perhaps anxious. I’m not sure if it’s anxiety, because I went to see a doctor a couple months ago when I was taking antidepressants, and she told me I didn’t have anxiety or depression, that I’m just overwhelmed, but whenever I feel like I’m anxious it’s because I feel so bad and it gets very hard for me to control it and calm down. Also, it seems like I have a few good days in a row and then a few really bad days.

Right now I have a lot of pressure and stress on me, and I naturally tend to overthink regardless, but this has been causing a lot of problems in my relationship because it comes off as I don’t trust my partner. I feel like I trust my partner sometimes... but I also think a lot about who’s he talking to, is he hiding something from me, is he saying the truth... and these thoughts get worse when I’m going through a stressful period. When I’m having good days, the usual thought is “who’s he talking to?” but it’s not really very often and it only takes me a minute to realize that I’m being silly by asking myself that question, because it doesn’t matter who he talks to! 

I’m absolutely aware that it becomes controlling and toxic, and that my partner deserves privacy, and that’s why I’m so confused about my thought process in days like these...

My partner has privacy, because even though I get concerned about who he talks to, I don’t ask him, I only bring up the fact that I have a concern but I clarify that I know that I’m just overthinking, and that he’s not doing anything wrong.

My partner doesn’t show any signs of unfaithfulness, in fact he is a great partner, and I know it’s me who needs to make changes, I simply don’t know what to do, because I don’t know what the problem is.

I have a lot of mental health conflicts besides my insecurities with my relationship, but this is something that is bothering me a lot.

***I would also like to add that... I got hired today for a great position in my industry, and I was very happy until my boyfriend and I had an argument over the phone because I said something that came off as me not trusting him, and since then I’ve been very sad and nervous and crying... I don’t know what to do with myself anymore.",20Jul2019,3
34,"I haven't had a serious depressive or anxious episode in a week or two. I dont really feel happy either though, and most of the time I'm either really pissed off at everything or somewhat content I guess. I feel like I might be getting better, but for whatever reason, I feel like I want to be depressed again. I constantly want all this bad shit to happen to me and I fantasize about things like suicide and self harm (I've never intentionally harmed myself) I get genuinely happy when I feel sick, and I read about different mental illnesses and wish I had them. For example, I watched that one YouTube video that's supposed to simulate schizophrenia, and was actually disappointed that I couldn't relate to it. Schuzophrenia is sn absolutley terrible thing to have, and I feel ashamed for wanting it. Sometimes I wish that I had actual suicide attempts, despite me not being that suicidal anymore, and in general I want to be back to crying myself to sleep every night and feeling totally hopeless. I dont know why the fuck I have these desires. Maybe it's so that I show off my deficiencies to get attention, and I find that mindset to be fucking disgusting. Maybe I'm making up for some lack of sympathy for myself. Some of my best memories from the last few months are when I was in the middle of my depression, and had the chance to be with a friend who had similar problems, and we could just talk about it together. I always felt safe in these situations so maybe I just want something like that. I feel like this is keeping me from feeling any happiness. I've had problems with this my whole life, along with some pretty terrible self esteem, to the point where I feel unable to think positively about myself. I also meet a lot of the symptoms of quiet bpd so maybe it's got something to do with that. although I haven't had a diagnosis and am not qualified to decide whether or not I have it.

Just a warning, this post is probably going to be all over the place. I'm basically just gonna talk about being paranoid about everything.

So first off, I'm extremely paranoid of like, hidden cameras, or that someone hiding in my room, watching me. The first thing that I do when I walk into my room, is check behind doors, furniture, and under my bed, and that my door is locked. I have no reason to be scared, but I am. Whenever I'm home alone, I close literally all of the blinds, make sure all of the doors and windows are locked, come up with a plan in my head just in case something happens, and then be as quiet as possible until someone comes home. Sometimes I also get scared of people like, reading my thoughts or something??? Not as often, though.

Ive tried another medication before these (sertraline) and it did absolutely nothing for me after months.

49,"Hey there, everyone. Thanks for continuing to be on this earth with me. You are loved and appreciated. 😊

I'm currently in the middle of a journey towards self-awareness. This has been going pretty rough so far but, it is improving nonetheless as I have eliminated some of my key unhealthy coping tools (namely unhealthy eating and marijuana). There is still quite a bit of work to do but, the progress so far is encouraging.

The stage that I am looking forward to now is reestablishing connection to my feelings. For a very long time, I believed that I had some sort of mental disorder that was inhibiting this process. I'm not ruling that possibility out but, believe the issue may be a bit more complicated than just a brain defect.

I have realized that in childhood, my emotions were constantly dismissed or neglected. Due to this, it has become extremely hard to decipher the nuances in emotions. For example: instead of labeling an emotion as frustration, agitation, or indignation, I may simply take the feeling as anger and act accordingly (usually by external numbing tactics). This makes it difficult to learn from my feelings, which I think is ultimately the point of having them in the first place -- I see emotions as a compass that point us towards our own well-being.

My question for you all is how does one go about correcting this limited bank of emotion? What are some tools (outside of therapy because I can't afford it right now) that will help me continue to decipher what I'm TRULY feeling at any given moment?",20Jul2019,1

•This kurse brings along a companion: Loneliness has been a constant companion for me for many years. It causes me to ache inside sometimes.

Gratitude is an incredibly simple way of introducing some joy into your life. It allows you to notice what matters to you, and hold it close while the world tries to eat away at you.

He's on multiple occasions bullied me about my playing, verbally abused me, crossed my personal boundaries, threatened to beat me. When I told him he was being a jerk he threatened to rape me in front of my band. He has a very condescending attitude. He always thinks he's right, doesn't matter if you prove it that he's not. 

The worst part is that I still have to work with him. Somedays I'm okay, however somedays I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've given him so much power over me. Little comments from him irk me to my core. I can't express myself freely with my band because I just don't want to deal with his obnoxious behaviour.

I just don't know what to do. Because of a conversation on the band group(rationally thinking it was nothing, however one part of my brain just doesn't care about that) he's yet again on my mind now today and no matter what I do, what I think about, I keep thinking about this stuff.

My mental health was so bad that I desperately wanted someone to talk with, someone to hold me but I everyone was hating on me. I was experiencing emotional numbness, memory problems, time was going faster, sense of self was gone, no empathy, anhedonia etc Many times, I thought I was going insane.

64,"In the last few days I began to develop a few unusual habits/technics of interacting with myself that I think might have something to do with schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder and I could really need some help deciding whether this is the case or not.

A few words to my background. I have been to therapy for nearly 2 years. Noone could really find a diagnose that fits me but it definitely has depressive tendencies and involves anxiety. One of my core problems is not feeling my own emotions, I tend to unknowingly suppress them. Also I am very bad at realizing what I want and noticing when I feel bad/uncomfortable. It is only afterwards that I realize what happened. 

Now for my current problem. The last few days have been really exhausting for me and made me feel quite helpless, hopeless, frustrated and overall bad. That's when I began talking to myself in third person, or rather talking to my inner self in the third person. ""What is happening with me"" became to ""What is wrong with you that you are tormenting me so much"". I began asking not me directly what I could do to get better but this third person. It is not that this person is foreign to me or that I have the feeling it doesn't belong to me, no, it is rather that it feels like something really disconnected that probably shouldn't be. Now my question i guess is this: Does this sound like possible signs of schizophrenia/DID or more like an acknowledgement of the disconnect between me and my feelings, emotions etc.

Even when I was seeing a psychologist at university, I had to postpone my appointments as I just couldn't deal with seeing her and knowing she knew my vulnerability and seen me at my weakest.

He was always very much sexually oppressive, so he had that going for him lol). She defended him relentlessly and kept saying I was lazy for not wanting to work retail anymore because of my mental health. Then started telling me that I couldn't blame all my problems on him (when that's what he did unto me his whole fucking life while I blamed myself) and that my personality was at fault. I have gone NC with that woman and I'm still low-key debating whether I should report her ass or not. She sided with him very literally and when I said that 'okay, then it's my fault, like I've always thought it was' she backtracked and said that it wasn't a competition. Literally get fucked, bitch.

70,"So, to clarify, this is not my bill, this is for my significant other. They have extreme anxiety and can't handle making appointments/dealing with the insurance. So I do it for them.   


I called around different practices and asked if they accepted X insurance. The insurance pays for all office visits (mental health included) and all we could have to pay is a $15 copay. I found a clinic that said they took our insurance. So I give the intake person the insurance information over the phone. After a bit an appointment is scheduled. A week later we go into the appointment. It ran one hour, goes well, my SO is prescribed some meds and given a treatment plan to follow up with a therapist and make future appointments with the psychiatrist. Afterwards, the clinic forgot to charge the copay, so we remind them about it. We immediately are told that the insurance does not cover the service. I call the insurance company and they confirm it is not covered. They explained that while on the card it says X, the actual insurance is called Y. So there ends the insurance company's involvement. The follow up appointments with that clinic are cancelled and the insurance gives us a list of in-network clinic.   


So fast forward a few days and we are looking at a total bill of $290. I call the clinic's billing department to see if they have a sliding scale or offer some sort of discount since we really can't afford this bill. The billing lady says that they are a privately owned business and don't offer things like that. She says that it's our fault for not confirming with our insurance beforehand and the bill is now our responsibility.   


I can't believe that a 1-hour consult is $290. I wish I knew beforehand to call the insurance company for a list, but what's done is done. My question here is if there's anything I can do to fight this bill or to lower it. The clinic told us they accepted the insurance even after they received the insurance information prior to the appointment.",20Jul2019,1

74,"When you see how broken the world really is, and the problems with most of the people on Earth who are kind to friends and family but give in to the not-so-great things about society, it’s hard to unsee it. Being compassionate and seeing the world’s struggles, not just yours, your family’s, and your friends’, can intensify the guilt over mistakes, and, for those of us struggling, guilt over compulsive behaviors that seemed like no big deal when you used to see the world through an “average” lens.

If you’re struggling, it’s okay to take a break from your “compassion mindset” you’ve worked so hard to get to and see the world the way most people do until you’re better. Taking care of yourself first is how you got here. It’s not selfish, because you can’t pour from an empty cup. You’ll still be kind and good, out of habit. Then, when you see the light, you can keep striving to change the world and make life changes outside of the mainstream to improve your impact on those who don’t know you.

It shifts from the question of ""what is wrong with you?"" to ""what has happened to you?""

He said that he is very tall, has black hair, is white, and has varying clothes like hoodies, jackets, and red socks baseball caps. We live in Georgia and he doesn't even like baseball.

77,"After much deliberation and initial resistance, I started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago. I told my family doctor that I had been struggling really hard with anxiety and depression, that I had been on various medications over the years and didn’t want to go that route again without first trying to talk to someone, so she set me up with a social worker at a local mental health counseling facility. I’ve had less than stellar experiences with therapists in the past, so I was hesitant to try it again, but my mental health got so bad that I felt like I had no option. 
 
Fast forward to now, and I’m not sure how I feel about the experience so far. The woman is very nice and a good listener, and has helped me with some of the surface-level anxiety symptoms. But I don’t feel a hundred percent comfortable delving into the darker side of my depression with her. She is a very bright, upbeat and bubbly person, which certainly isn’t a bad thing; but I am the polar opposite in every way, so I don’t feel like I can relate to her on that level. Maybe that’s dumb, maybe you don’t have to “relate” to your therapist, but whatever. I worked as an elementary school teacher for some time, and going into her office makes me feel like a little kid going into the guidance counselor’s office at school. There are children’s drawings hung everywhere, everything is decorated in a bright primary-color scheme, and her tone of voice when she talks to me is eerily similar to the tone of voice I would use to try to calm down my kindergarten students when they were upset. She’s not condescending or rude, I just get the vibe that she works much better with young children than grown adults.
 
Not to mention that I guess I was misinformed on how the appointments would be set up; I assumed I would be seeing her once a week, but it’s been very sporadic. Each time I visit, we only set up one more appointment at a time, and it’s usually closer to two weeks in between appointments. Maybe that’s normal and I was just expecting too much, I don’t know. All I know is that my depression has been spiraling out of control for a long time now, and taking this huge step to see a therapist hasn’t really done anything for it so far. 
 
My family doctor told me to let her know if at any time I felt like the therapist wasn’t a good fit, and she would find me someone else, but I don’t want to hurt my therapist’s feelings. Logically, I understand that it’s part of her job and I’m probably not the first or last person to request someone new. But part of me can’t shake the guilt of feeling like I’m basically telling this person that they suck at their job. She has been very kind and helpful, just not a good fit for me personality-wise.

81,"So you may be familiar with this scenario - you've been doing things right for a reasonable period of time. Maybe you've been eating healthy, exercising, expanding your horizons, seeing glimmers of hope and finally started to feel like you got this, like you're going to win.

Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the demons and bad wolves of your mind strike with extreme, discombobulating and overwhelming force. They seem more powerful than ever, like this formidable and intrepid foe, who makes you cower in fear and want to admit and accept defeat. It seems to you, you never had a chance. Sound familiar?

What you have to realize is, is that these are indeed the desperate cries of a dying demon. The old quote about ""there are two wolves inside you, and the one which wins will be the one you feed"" holds true as a metaphor here - what has been happening is that the good wolf (or angel, if you like that metaphor) inside you has the upper hand, and is on the verge of defeating the bad wolf. You're scaring it, you've got it on it's last legs. It's terrified, it's looking around in fear, it's contemplating it's final gambit.

So of course, this is when that wolf/demon pulls out all the stops. It's gonna hit you hard. It uses it's harshest, cruelest and most vile move, to try and scare the good wolf back into it's place. It will do anything - it'll feed you all your insecurities and regrets, it'll turn your closest loved ones into villains, it'll use shock and scare tactics. It's almost like the final boss emerges, because I know from first hand experience, a bad entity's power in this moment is a terrible thing to behold, and often, it can be enough to shock us into retreat.

So what's the solution? It's fairly simple - be aware that your demons are on their last legs and being absolute bastards because they *know it*. This is a moment where many of us slip up and get forced into retreat and bargaining. For those of you who aren't sure how to deal with this yet, all I'd suggest it just being aware of what's happening. Think about this, and logically assess it. Maybe right now you're not as strong as you could be, and might be forced to take a knee. That's okay; it's okay to not quite have the potency within to finsh off your demons - as long as you are willing to continue the battle, that's all you need.

If you feel more confident and like you know this system already, then you'll be more equipped to know what to do - you can understand that this is a hurdle, and it'll hurt, and it's not. at all. easy to emerge as the victor over a demon, but it's well within your capability to do so. You're almost like Neo in the Matrix - you are the most powerful one, the absolute hero of your story and the one who wins in the end. So from there and with that awareness, just stick it out to the end.

I myself can't pretend I have won yet, but I feel like I've been trying this long enough to provide whatever insight I have. If it resonates, that's great, but if not, I'm welcoming to anything you have to comment. All I'm saying is, it's easy to take a knee and assume that was the limit of your power, when the actual facts with this type of thing are, not really. Don't fear victory.",20Jul2019,350

83,"First, a background.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from an era where communication and social interaction were all you really had, besides toys and video games.  but even video games were a social gathering of sorts.  Today, what you largely see even in communal places like sporting events and public transportation (even private transportation) is a bunch of people glued to their cellphone screens, seemingly incapable of appreciating the world around them. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are apps out there that can tell you how much time you've used specific apps, your ""screen time"" and how many times you unlocked your phone.  We know that battery life should limit how long you can stare at the phone.  But how often are you going back to that phone, and why?

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the challenge, obviously perfectly optional.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypothesis**

If you cut your cellphone usage, **not including important calls like business**, down by 50% every day, you will feel more energized to do things that you would normally have procrastinated on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiment**

1. Find an app that gives you data about usage: screen time, # of unlocks, which apps are being used for how long, etc.  I use **Microsoft Launcher** (for other reasons, but it has a widget with this information clearly described), though it doesn't matter what the app is, whatever works for you and your OS.
2. Let the app run (it's probably a widget for Android folks) and start tracking data.
3. Pick a start day.  This is important, because the ""day"" is 12:00AM - 11:59PM, so for a clean start you want to pick a future day to evaluate.
4. Create a baseline by **doing what you would normally do** that whole day.  Don't change, don't deviate, don't even check the app.  Don't touch it.  Just pretend like it's not there.
5. Before you go to bed, check the app and document the following.  This is your **baseline** and what you need to focus on next:
   1. How much screen time did you have?  Take a 24-hour day, subtract the remaining time of the day (so if you're going to bed at 10pm, you would subtract 2 hours because they haven't happened yet).
   2. How many different apps consumed the use time?
   3. What are the Top 3 apps that consumed the use time?
   4. How many times did you unlock your phone during the day?
6. Create a goal to slice those numbers by rough half the next day.  Repeat steps 1, 2 and 5.  Then start asking questions.
   1. If the unlock count didn't go down much (or at all), why are you unlocking the phone so frequently and can't seem to do it less?
   2. If the app count didn't go down much (or at all), why are you running App A, App B and App C so much and why can't you do without them or use them less?  Why are you running so many apps?
   3. If you do cut the numbers in half, what did you did **instead of** using the phone, and why were you able to do it when you couldn't/didn't do it before?  What changed?  Was it just ignoring the phone or something else?  Can you keep doing that?  Subjectively, do you 'feel' any better as a result of focusing on other things?

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions**

* You do, or want to, sleep 6-8 hours a day, during which time you don't touch your phone (because you're sleeping).
* You do, or want to, go to work 6-8 hours a day OR you go to school for 4 hours a day, during which time you don't touch your phone (because you're working.  Or learning.)
* You eat three meals, during which time you don't touch your phone (because you're eating).
* At some point you're doing something not having to do with a device screen: running, spend time with friends/family, spend time with pets, work the garden, wash/detail the car, clean the garage, clean the house, etc., during which time you don't touch your phone (because you're running, spending time with friends/family, spending time with pets, working the garden, washing/detailing the car, cleaning the garage, cleaning the house, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

If these assumptions pan true, that means that a ""reasonable"" screen time shouldn't really exceed 4-5 hours.  Chances are, at least one of the assumptions are wrong.  That's the test - to find out where specifically you're spending more time on the phone than even basic life activities OR, extracurricular activities.  But if it turns out that you're on Instagram for 4 hours with a total screen time of 10 hours where the remainder is browsing the web and games, is that mentally healthy?  I don't know. But it's a question to ask and answer.  Especially since you only have 24 hours in a day.",20Jul2019,5
84,"**Tics**

I have some tics, I use them to release some ""unease"" energy when I'm alone. It's showing the middle finger everywhere and telling to ""f*ck off"", it's shouting shortly some bs which comes up in my mind. Some strange and ""twisty"" behavior, but I (still) can control it and do it only if I'm alone. 

**Shouting and talking to myself loudly**

Combine those twisty behaviors and put some shouting (= talking out loudly my unorganized and spontaneous thoughts) and you got it. It's also a ""coping mechanism"" like those tics, I feel more relieved after that simply

**No motivation for the future, but extremely short motivation for some strange tasks**

Instead of studying or building my future, the only things I got motivation for are short-term topics, and literally within 15 minutes I got no motivation anymore and proceed with some other things. Like ""Oh I will start programming"", but 15 minutes later, ""Meh, don't want it anymore, BUT I WILL START READING""

I literally don't care about my future, it's like I'm blocking myself of visualizing the consequences of not studying etc. But I simply don't care

**Depressive episodes**

Because my thoughts are so unorganized and I only got those ""short bursts of motivation"", so I fall into a depressive short episode in which I am overwhelmed because you gotta put much effort in life after all.

**OCD**

Intrusive thoughts, self-destructing and self-criticizing thoughts, self-guilt although there's no need to worry rationally speaking, etc. Hurts much sometimes

88,"So I've only been to therapy twice now. The first time I told him what I could remember of my childhood trauma. I was 6 and there was this teenage boy that my aunt fostered. He would come over to my parents house to hang out with my older brothers. I can remember him taking me to private areas ( convinced me with gum). But anything after that I can't remember. I have trouble with intercourse, anytime I go to have sex I get this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and I can't speak or move. I usually just stare off until he is finished. I told me therapist about this and he said is sounds like dissociation. The second time I went to see the therapist at the end of the session he started talking about this statue that he had of a little girl and a woman standing over her kissing her head. I remember he started to talk to me in a baby voice and making some childish actions like crossing his arms. Then the next thing I remember is he asked what he did to me in the pool? I don't remember responding. Then the next thing I remember I was at his door, he was saying goodbye and said that I made good progress in this session. It's so weird because I can only remember fragments of the conversation we had after he started talking about the statue. I've always had really bad memory like misplacing things, forgetting appointments I made little stuff like that but it happens alot. I'm just scared because I don't know what's wrong with me. I write poetry and there's some poems that i remember writing but don't remember why or what its about. I also get really weird vision sometimes like things will get blurry or sometimes things will get really sharp and the colors seem to pop witch is weird because I have really bad I sight ( I wear heavy prescription glasses) I will catch myself just staring off into nothing alot of the times and it's even happened when I'm driving! But I never wreck or anything close to that it's just one minute I will be driving then the next I'm like wow I've come this far already I don't remember passing blah, blah, blah.

I thought my friend had drugged me, I tried running away and couldn't unlock my own door, so I thought he locked me in. I couldn't find my phone, so I thought he stole it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was fully convinced my friend drugged me, everything he tried to do to calm me down I believed was him trying to hurt me. I thought he was chasing me with a weapon, I punched him multiple times. I punched out the screen on my window and started screaming outside for help and someone called the police. I explained to the police it was a misunderstanding.

I'm so traumatized from this experience. I barely remember what even happened, I don't know how I woke up and just went crazy.

92,"Life is very boring. I have nothing to look forward to as nothing excites me. I am enrolled in a reputable university away from home where I have nice friends. I have very nice friends at home too. I hangout at least once a week with them, mostly twice or thrice. My family scene is okay, not the best but Im not complaining. Im single, broke up with my significant other about a year ago. I travel abroad once a year, mostly during summer vacations. 
Even after all this, after having a life that people would consider ‘great’, I feel bored. I feel like Im on auto-pilot, doing this just because Im going with the flow. I appreciate what I have but it doesn’t make me ‘happy’ or ‘excited’ about life. I don’t look forward to anything as nothing makes me happy. The only thing I do get is distraction from these feelings of sadness or boredom when Im traveling or with friends and so I try to do these two things as much as possible. 
Im quite good at arts and playing musical instruments, but I don’t have the interest or patience or attention span anymore. I’ll have a sudden urge to do these activities and I will and then the urge goes away and Ill leave this for months until I feel the sudden urge again. This has been the case for almost all things in life, studies and other activities included. 
I think life is meaningless, even when you try to find meaning to life, even when you try to come out of your comfort zone, even when you ‘do stuff’, its never really enough when you get in bed at the end of the day. Its so boring and pointless and I wish It could be other wise because I hate living like this and I really don’t want to. 
Just a pointer, I have self diagnosed myself with depression and I do have trouble with anxiety. I haven’t ever been to a therapist though and frankly I don’t plan on it either.

94,"After much deliberation and initial resistance, I started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago. I told my family doctor that I had been struggling really hard with anxiety and depression, that I had been on various medications over the years and didn’t want to go that route again without first trying to talk to someone, so she set me up with a social worker at a local mental health counseling facility. I’ve had less than stellar experiences with therapists in the past, so I was hesitant to try it again, but my mental health got so bad that I felt like I had no option. 
 
Fast forward to now, and I’m not sure how I feel about the experience so far. The woman is very nice and a good listener, and has helped me with some of the surface-level anxiety symptoms. But I don’t feel a hundred percent comfortable delving into the darker side of my depression with her. She is a very bright, upbeat, bubbly person, which certainly isn’t a bad thing; but I am the polar opposite in every way, so I don’t feel like I can relate to her on that level. Maybe that’s dumb, maybe you don’t have to “relate” to your therapist, but whatever. I worked as an elementary school teacher for some time, and going into her office makes me feel like a little kid going into the guidance counselor’s office at school. There are children’s drawings hung everywhere, everything is decorated in a bright primary-color scheme, and her tone of voice when she talks to me is eerily similar to the tone of voice I would use to try to calm down my kindergarten students when they were upset. She’s not condescending or rude, I just get the vibe that she works much better with young children than grown adults.
 
Not to mention that I guess I was misinformed on how the appointments would be set up; I assumed I would be seeing her once a week, but it’s been very sporadic. Each time I visit, we only set up one more appointment at a time, and it’s usually closer to two weeks in between appointments. Maybe that’s normal and I was just expecting too much, I don’t know. All I know is that my depression has been spiraling out of control for a long time now, and taking this huge step to see a therapist hasn’t really done anything for it so far. 
 
My family doctor told me to let her know if at any time I felt like the therapist wasn’t a good fit, and she would find me someone else, but I don’t want to hurt my therapist’s feelings. Logically, I understand that it’s part of her job and I’m probably not the first or last person to request someone new. But part of me can’t shake the guilt of feeling like I’m basically telling this person that they suck at their job. She has been very kind and helpful, just not a good fit for me personality-wise. Am I being too critical, should I stick it out with her? Or should I try to find someone else?",20Jul2019,4
95,"I have always thought that I am making up my “depression” and “social anxiety”.  Yes, I have been diagnosed but I have probably fooled all the psychiatrists I have spoken to. I truly believe that I am a malingerer. I’m 20F and for the past 5 years I have avoided going anywhere merely because I haven’t wanted to or haven’t “felt up to it”. This isn’t depression, this is laziness. This is avoidance of things that everyone else has to do. My special snowflake mentality is strong. I have never had a job, can’t drive, have cheated on exams taken through online college, and am a disgustingly entitled shit person. It really is true. I am not pessimistic, I am realistic. I have no friends and no emotionally supportive family members. I don't even want to have friends. I have been acting all this time, all my life really. In the past, I have convulsed, hit myself, thrown myself into walls, cut myself, all expecting someone in my household to give me attention and help me as I am so frustrated and upset, but no one ever cared, or they have done adverse things instead like threatened me or mentally beat me up. I have fake cried because it often feels like I have to force myself to feel things. I’m fragile, overly sensitive, have obsessed about things and people for years. I am obsessed with a guy I liked in high school (5 years ago) and everything I do and think about revolves around what he would think of me and imaginary scenarios surrounding him. He is far superior to me. I am preoccupied by mental escapes mostly through watching the same tv shows over and over. I am bitter, judgmental, and mean. I am a talentless ugly bitch.

I don’t think I can change this. I don’t think I can ever not be what I have been for as long as I can remember. I don’t understand why I act this way. My household has been turbulent and stressful for as long as I have memories. My parents brought me into their fighting and the entire vibe in my house is awkward and uncomfortable. I stay in my room all day. I can't bear being around any people because of my disgustingness. I hate my family, but they financially support me (I don't do things that cost a lot of money though). Even as a child I screamed bloody murder and had horrendous tantrums. I am such a jealous and obsessive person. I subconsciously think I am talented and better than everyone else when I am not. I feel like it is impossible to adopt a different mindset. I feel like the only thing is for me to be eliminated. I want people to see me as amazing, intelligent, talented, beautiful. I want to be an actor (I know I am good at it), a singer, a performer, a model. I am not those things, I hate EVERYTHING about myself. Everyone is better than me and more deserving than me. If I tried to get a job, I know I would just shut down and give up. What am I supposed to do?

99,"Alright so I've been wondering about this and whether it's something to be worried about or if I was just a really weird kid.

I have memories from my childhood of having an oddly violent streak towards animals. For example I used to have this stuffed unicorn that I got a lot of pleasure out of ""torturing"" and I had a favorite movie where there was a scene of a cat drowning but getting saved. I always wanted the cat to drown.

When I was about 11-12 I developed this weird obsession with hurting animals, kittens in particular. I'd find videos on the internet and have extensive fantasies and urges to torture them, some of them I wrote down. I dared to read it again recently and man it's fucked up, especially for a 12 year old. Anyway, this all culminated in me killing a stray kitten. I was never caught. This whole phase died down soon after that. It can't have lasted more than a few months.

I'm a few years older now and I haven't had any such urges since. I love animals, I'm getting a pet snake soon and I would never want to hurt them. I do have a bit of a thing for fire that probably isn't exactly normal but I have always stayed out of trouble and otherwise nothing like this has ever come up. I've never been violent or agressive in other situations and I have no idea how to explain what I did. 

These incidents have been few and far between so I'm wondering if there is actually something wrong with me or if this is under the category of ""fucked up things kids do for no real reason"". I don't want this to come bite me in the ass later on. What do you guys think?",20Jul2019,2
100,"A lot of be things I hate about myself comes from my parents behaviors and attitudes. My parents divorced when I was 3 and they both live in separate countries. My mom can’t keep relationships and always runs away from things that are too hard to deal with. Unfortunately I’ve taken this trait myself, I’m 21 and I haven’t kept any friends and any problem too hard I just give up. My dad has really bad anger issues, not so much anymore but I’ve adopted this from him. 

It’s weird to see how we take bits and pieces from our parents even if we haven’t been subject to their behaviors. I have spoken to my mom about this and she says that I have to take responsibility for myself and that her raising me isn’t the problem. I haven’t spoken to my dad about it because I know what he’ll say and he would just debate me about it which I don’t really want to hear. 

I hate that I can’t talk to them about this and the fact I hate the way I am because of their behaviors. I want to change but it’s easier said than done. My dad and mom always tell me I can change and it really pisses me off. It takes so much to change but I don’t think I have it in me to do so.",20Jul2019,1
101,"I recently met someone that I really like. We only really talked for a week maybe before meeting up, but we got really close and talked a lot about depression and our eating disorders and stuff like that, and he became really important to me very quickly. Last weekend we spent every night together just hanging out until the third night when he finally made a move and it was great. We were both happy. But we tried to have sex and (at risk of embarrassment) he couldnt. He was really beating himself up about it but i kept trying to just kiss him and hold him and tell him it was okay. He ended up going home and snapped me saying he was mad at himself, to which i replied that even getting to touch and hold him was enough. 

The next day I asked if he could come over again, but he said he had dinner w his family. Around like 7:30 I snapped him saying I wish he was w me and he snapped back, but then i sent another reply and he never opened it. I’ve basically been snapping him everyday since and he still hasn’t opened or replied at all since Monday. I know this may be stupid but I’ve been giving myself anxiety and panic attacks for the past 3 days because I have no way to contact him and make sure he’s okay. 

I totally get that maybe he just is embarrassed and doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, but I really find it unlikely given all that we shared. Also we have the yellow best friends heart on snap and ive continued to snap him everyday to keep it.. i know if he was on snap and ignoring me but talking to other people, the heart would go away. 

So here are all my theories:
1) he’s ghosting me
2) he’s taking a social media break
3) his parents took his phone
4) his phone got lost/stolen
5) something bad happened 

Obviously, given my tendency to overthink and worry, number 5 has been the one on my mind 24/7. I dont want to be a stalker.. but im really just worried he did something to hurt himself or idk i just really need to know he’s okay and i feel like im freaking out over nothing.

108,"Hi, so I'm 19F and I have been dealing with terrible Head Stuff for over 6 years. I've never had therapy and I've been to two counselling sessions in which nothing useful was discussed and, because I'm functioning, I was dismissed as ""alright without support"".

I'm currently on holiday in a Northern European Country with a group of friends. My history with them is interesting, and I'll relay it here.

There are 7 of us, 4 girls and 3 boys. I met the 3 girls when I was 12 and we bonded over shared interests. Because I was ""dating"" one of the boys, and 2 of the 3 girls were already mates with another, we became a friendship group.

In the group of girls, 2 of the girls are Best Friends, and the other knew one of them from primary. They've always been a pretty fixed trio - Girl 1 doesn't come without Girl 2 (and vice versa), and the two of them rarely come without Girl 3.

The boy I was ""dating"" and I ended it when I was 13 or 14, and I started falling into my depression more and more (unrelated to the breakup). I felt isolated by my friends, lacking shared knowledge or interests, and so I stepped away. I didn't want to bother them and being around them felt shitty and bad so I stopped hanging out with them so much.

When I was 16, the 3 girls moved to a different college to me. It was fine, but I then spent 2 years in a friendship group where I felt worthless and unhappy, even moreso than with the group before. When I realised isolating myself from the first group of people had been because of my intrusive thoughts, I started engaging again, and at first, everything was fine. They treated me the same, as if nothing had happened, and I was happy.

We went on holiday together when we all finished college, and planned this year for after our first year of uni. The problem is, I constantly feel like an afterthought for them. I'm always being left behind (examples being: when walking, I'm always the last person; I'm always a third wheel in a conversation; just today they went on a walk and didn't ask if I was coming (I was) they just left without me) and I don't get their ""in-jokes"" because I don't always hang out with them, and I went through a good 2-3 year period of just isolating myself. I try to bring up good points, or engage, but it never feels like enough. I feel like they don't want me here, that they wouldn't care if I didn't come, and they don't want me as a friend.

Anyway, since being diagnosed nearly 8 years ago I have been fired from 4 jobs due to my mental illness.  They would say otherwise, but when each one happens after I came back from FMLA or personal days due to mental health, the picture paints itself.  As a result, I'm at a complete loss.  I have been out of work for months and living off my 401k which is running out.  Oh, my last job was kind enough to fight my unemployment claim, and since my anxiety had me in panic attacks about contesting, they got away with it.

I question whether I can even hold a job considering no one wants to hire someone who isn't sure they can leave the house.  Even at my best I struggled to make it into the office 3 days a week. Luckily my last job let me work from home part-time, but that obviously ended badly, and I had to get doctor's notes and HR approval for that.  I can't imagine starting a new job where I'd have to be there every single day with no wiggle room.

Without a job, I no longer have insurance, thus no doctor to consult.  I am divorced, went through bankruptcy last summer, and have no relatives who could take me in while I figure this out.

112,"Hi, I’m an 18 year old female and my story is that when I was little I used to be very manipulative, impulsive, go angry at everything, take everything personally I thought everyone was attacking me, I used to cried a lot, had suicidal thoughts, unstable relationship, everyone in school hated me and bullied me, I used to be a very complicated person, I thought people was talking about me or planning to do something bad towards me.
 Now that I’m older I’m a very chill person most of the time, I don’t get mad easily as how I used to in the past and I’ve never engaged in self harm, however sometimes I experience feelings of emptiness, I get easily offended sometimes with some things and react impulsively or hesitated. One friend spoke to me and told me that she distance herself from me because she was afraid of saying something to me that might hurt me or offend me (this is not always but sometimes and then I feel guilty and deeply embarrassed) When I feel offended I get very intense trying to state my point and not moving on with the subject, I feel terrible when I raise my voice or fight with someone because I don’t want them to feel bad or thing bad about me or stop being my friend or loving me.

I have very stable friends, they always come to me for advice and say that I’m overall a good friend and a strong person, but deep down I’m afraid of blowing up the way I do (If I get really mad which is unusual, I start throwing or breaking things in my room) 

As I stated before, I’m a very chill person but when someone triggers me or does something repeatedly I get angry however not to the point of being abusive or insulting or screaming like crazy (but I’m very sensitive to criticism) Whenever I’m talking to people I’m afraid of them about saying something embarrassing about me or even start criticizing me.

Then she suddenly turned on me wanting me to leave for my own good. She sees no worth in herself and she thinks I will leave/betray her ""just like everyone else"". I dont know what to do please give me advice.",20Jul2019,1

118,"My main struggle is my social skills and lack thereof. I've been working on my awkwardness my entire life, and I'm ""passable"" as normal now in my early 20's. In HS I was a mess, I didn't really speak, make eye contact, or anything, but I always got exceptionally good grades, so I was kinda ignored, which was fine by me. I'm Facebook friends with a lot of people from hs. I mostly just post far left memes and such. 1 individual from hs also posts similar memes, we often like and share each others posts and such. I messaged them and asked if they'd wanna meet for drinks and hang out, and they seemed excited and even gave me dates and stuff that works for them. I think I started a friendship for the first time ever!",20Jul2019,3
119,"Recently I've been in a depressive episode. Like, a I-sat-in-my-shower-and-cried-for-thirty-minutes and I-physically-can't-force-food-down type of depressive episode. A breakdown of my last three months includes:

* A breakup, because the person I loved more than anyone stopped loving me
* Losing most of my friends, including one of my best friends, because they chose my ex over me, even though they expressly said that would never happen and they would be friends with both of us
* I messed up real bad and messed up my relationship with a different friend who I still absolutely adore
* My best friend of 11 years moved away
* I don't know how I'm going to pay rent come August
* I've seriously considered dropping out of college
* I don't think I can make it in my major's field of work
* I don't want to come back to my hometown
* Living with an emotionally manipulative mother and a father who I speak to maybe twice a week

&amp;#x200B;

My world already came crashing down around me in April when things kept mounting and I just broke. Now everything feels like a different type of impossible, and it's all just shoving itself down my throat until I can't breathe. And all I want is someone to ask if I'm okay, but I think I lost all the people who would've asked me that. I just feel so alone and beat up by life that I don't know what my next step is. Not being okay is a burden I have to carry on my own and it's crushing me.

&amp;#x200B;

If you also need someone to ask if you're okay, I'll be that person. Are you okay? I'll listen to whatever you need to unpack or vent about. I'll give advice if you want, I've always been better at helping others than helping myself, or I'll just acknowledge what you're going through.",20Jul2019,9
120,"My fiance has been in a psychiatric ward for over a week and I don't think he'll be released soon.
He is very paranoid, forgetful and suspicious of me. He is very sick (obviously). 

He often says things to me when I visit that don't make sense due to his paranoid delusions, and I react by gently and clearly reassuring him that it isn't true, that it's his paranoia. Is that right to do? He usually forgets and says the same thing to me again the next day, and so I reassure him again. I tell him I'm there for him no matter what and love him. 

I'm just so worried about doing something wrong and making him worse. He already suspects me of something. I'm not sure what exactly, if there even is anything at all (don't think there is tbh). Does anyone with any experience with severe paranoia or anything have any advice for me? Am I doing the right thing?",20Jul2019,2

123,"My sister had an epileptic fit in front of me. The ambulance was called and got to the place we were staying because we were visiting family luckily. However, I'm still petrified. How do I know if she is alright?? She was rushed to the hospital. It seemed as if she couldn't see me and my dad trying to comfort her. My mom tried to block my sight of view at times. Her whole body was shaking violently. We were at a party when it started to happen. I think the strobe and laser lights + loud music made her have a fit. My dad stayed with me at the place we're staying. I tried my hardest to help her. I wont be able to see her till estimated the next morning",20Jul2019,2
124,"Recently I've noticed that whenever I am asked to elaborate on a subject, it is very difficult for me to do so. Last week I was with a group of friends and I was talking about how I stopped seeing someone because they were discriminatory to the woman on the phone when ordering sushi, and when they asked me what they did that was discriminatory, I could not invoke any examples of what they said even though I had memories of the encounter. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like them asking about it immediately makes the memory inaccessible. Like I can still feel the memory there, but it's cloudy and it's very hard to extract information from it. I am very comfortable with that group of friends, so I don't think it was an issue with social anxiety, but this has been happening a lot when I am asked to elaborate on a memory.",20Jul2019,28
125,"This is the first birthday in the last few years that I am planning to celebrate. I turn 19 on August 1st. I have had depression and anxiety that are on there last legs (i hope). I spent my 18 birthday crying in bed and taught I wouldn’t live to be 19. Lost all my friends a long time ago so I will be going in either solo or with my mom but still. 

I don’t know why I am posting this I just feel better and wanted too share it with somebody. Its just so nice to finally feel some relief. 

To whoever is reading this: I genuinely hope whatever you are dealing with passes and you get better. Everyone deserves to live their best life. 

I wish you all well! Sorry if I wasted your time with this",20Jul2019,20
126,Hi! Is anyone on this mix? I have general anxiety disorder and depression. I was prescribed 5mg of lexapro but when I went up to 10mg I started to really lose focus. My doctor then prescribed Wellbutrin. I've felt a lot better in terms of focusing but I also feel like I've been losing track of time in a weird way...,20Jul2019,1
127,"So I’ve been having these thoughts popping up about my friends or family having a hidden motive to embarass and humiliate me, or to take advantage of me in any way. I try really hard not to act on them and be rational but it still shows in me being grumpy etc..  I might be getting really angry at them for what my head is telling me but I also know that the chances are its just a delusion so i never say anything.",20Jul2019,1
128,"I don't want to bore you with a life story so I'll cut to the chase.

I'm 21 years old and I live in England. I've been on Employment Support since I was 18 due to my mental health and now I'm looking to finally start work.

Nowhere has ever got back to me about anything and I'm feeling as though I'm never going to be able to get even a crappy dead end job.

I'm looking for part time work which there's plenty of as it's summer season, yet I'm still not getting anything back. The CV I'm using is one my sister has used to get multiple jobs and it's been tailored to my needs.

Im just losing all hope that I'll even amount to anything. I just want to be successful. I know deep down that if it wasn't for my mental health getting in the way of my a level exams and costing me to drop out, I'd be finished with uni this summer and looking forward to a brilliant start to a career. Instead I'm sat alone in my room 24/7 with 0 support and no hope.

Sorry to bore anybody reading, I just need advice on what I can do because this is my last hope",20Jul2019,3
