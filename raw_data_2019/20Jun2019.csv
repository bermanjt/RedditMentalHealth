0,"So I suffer from depression n anxiety. I have been diagnosed with GAD. I’ve been on medication but feel it doesn’t really do that much. Weed on the other hand works great. Helps me sleep, helps my mood. Today I’m out of weed and it’s back to not wanting to get out of bed, feeling sad, depressed, and borderline suicidal. Please pray for me having a rough day.",20Jun2019,6
1,"Hello everyone.

I have no idea if this goes back since forever or is it only a recent thing, but anyway here's how I'm feeling now and how I think I've felt for as long as I can remember. Excuse me if I'm all over the place, hopefully y'all can piece the story together.

I never felt a lot of emotion toward anyone. I think I love my dog, and my dad a little. I don't really know if I love my mother, mainly because for the most of my adolescent and the whole of my adult life she's been a nuisance and the vector of bad energy, culminating in my parents' divorce a few years ago, when I was 22 or so. The divorce didn't faze me one bit, I carried along, just seeing my parents separately, obviously. 

My six-year-younger brother I think I don't give two shits about, as harsh as that sounds. I mostly feel like he's one of the guys from the hood whom I see a little more frequently. The worst part is that he looks up to me and that he wants a relationship to exist between us. I, on the other hand, want to show him how alone he is in this world and I think I have succeeded, if only a tiny bit. We were talking the other day and he said something along the lines ""we are one blood, and that is something you don't understand, and I know I can't count on you"". Funnily, that was the moment I felt a little bit of pride, as if he finally caught on to what I've been trying to get across for years.

My dad's an okay guy, I think I love him because I don't give up on him despite his shortcomings, lack of foresight, and repeated mistakes. The repeated mistakes of my mother have me seething with rage.

Among the dozens of friends I've had I think I care/d about only two of them, even though there are two more who I regularly interact with, one of which has been my best friend since childhood, but now I feel a lump going down my throat when I call him my best friend. And the other friend is a fun and outgoing person but freaking plain with her interests and just stuff to say outside everyday activities like school and work. I'd like to leave the former two out of this story because they're outstanding men.

I've had one long relationship after which I completely lost interest in another. I mainly entertain women for sex and sporadic companionship, breaking up with them or purposely becoming obnoxious for them to break up with me, after a month or two. I have no desire for marriage, children, or any long term companionship.

Most of the time, when talking to someone, I ask myself if I am gaining anything from this interaction, most of the time the answer is absolutely nothing; which is why I cut your most of my extended family. They just end up asking for favors and I have no intention of humoring them because ""they're family"".

I feel like if most of the people mentioned in this story, like all my close and extended family (except my dog and dad) and most of my friends and acquaintances just disappeared, I wouldn't bat an eye. AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT which kinda bugs me.

I completely understand that networking is important and I would really like to separate the professional seeing from the private. I know how I should act at work even though I'd betray all my coworkers for a dime.

The dime brings me to another point. I have no connection or empathy for my compatriots, and if there comes a time where I'd be able to profit off of them I wouldn't hesitate in the slightest (think along the lines of what corrupt politicians do, I have no shame admitting it)

I feel like I am alone in this world, and that we all are, and that we shouldn't rely on each other. They say that no man is an island but I am a peninsula connected to the continent by a footwide neck.",20Jun2019,1
2,"I was selected to do Jury Service a few months back and my start date for it was a few weeks ago now, the trial i was assigned to sit on has ended but i'm struggling to come to terms with everything that happened over the past couple of weeks. I'm legally not allowed to go into detail about what happened but the whole experience was very distressing for me and i'm starting to feel depressed and anxious as a result of how horrible things were. I'm sorry this is vague but i feel i need help from somewhere.",20Jun2019,1
3," I have been feeling this a lot for about the last year that’s why I came to this sub. Sometimes I feel absolutely nothing, that nothing matters, and that nothing is real/has any consequences. Just a static or a blank canvas. I usually am creative and compassionate but now I just feel indifferent. Good or bad things can happen around me and I don’t feel anything about it. I have to put on a facade when I’m around people so I don’t accidentally hurt their feelings.

 Then I get an over-flood of emotions that I cannot understand but it usually ends with me crying to sleep (which is what it has been for the past week). I have been having some really bad anxiety at random moments about everything. I haven’t really felt any joy in what I’m doing for the past several months. Sometimes I feel short bursts of happiness but it quickly fades and I’m back to square one. When I’m surrounded by people I still feel lonely and like I don’t belong. I have been trying to convince my self that people want to be around me and enjoy my company but I just don’t believe it. I put possibly depressed in the title because I’m not sure if what I am feeling qualifies as depression and I don’t want to hurt anyone who has gone through depression.

I wanted to see if anyone here could help me because ,though I don’t feel anything sometimes, I realize this might be an issue. Also, because I don’t have anyone close to me that I feel safe to talk to yet so I figure talking to people who might be familiar with these issues might help. 

Is something actually wrong or am I just making how I’m  feeling more than it actually is?
If anyone has gone through this how did you stop  it or just simply make through with it day to day?

Sorry if this seems all over the place I just have no idea what to do and I wanted to jot down what I feel before it fades away.",20Jun2019,4

So I am trying to get a job and I find it so hard to even make a phone call or schedule an interview. My anxiety is killing me and my depression is so so heavy.

My friend says I should focus on my mental health instead of getting a job, but I don't care about myself to fix my mental health and the world isn't going to wait for things to get better.

6,"Tw- suicidal ideation, self harm

I think I mostly need to vent. Sorry in advance for typos I'm still really upset.

I'm 22 years old. I've been on month and a half stretch of working doubles, with no days off. I'm talking like 60 hours a week. I'm adjusting to my new life without my boyfriend (i relied heavily on him, mistake #1. Mistake #2 was moving to his city without knowing anyone else there to be with him after he said he'd break up with me if I didn't get a job in his city.) It has been difficult. I don't have my license or vehicle which is something he said he'd help me with. My parents are over an hour away. This guy is very manipulative and emotionally abusive. But he says it's better because hes not physically abusive. His parents actually helped me get my own apartment to leave rhe relationship because they saw the toll it was taking on me. This is the first time I've ever been this independent. 

Well, the past 3 days I've had no one to help me get around town for errands, he always said he'd be my best friend and help me when he can and he continues to choose not to. Monday I had a mental breakdown on the side of the road because I didn't have enough quarters for the laundromat and no way to get any. I was over a mile from home and no money for a cab.

 Yesterday I cut myself and he began the abuse, calling me dumbass, stupid, etc. Then ignored me when I told him how terrible he was making me feel for not being stable. I was hysterical for hours until I passed out on the floor and woke up 15 mins before my shift started. I gave up, went to bed and decided to be a no call, no show. Slept until 1pm. Today he said he'd take me to Walgreens to get my antidepressants refilled and when I reminded him he said he wasn't. Cue another breakdown. I cut myself again. He called me stupid and threatened to put me in a mental ward because I said i had the suicidal thoughts come back. Then he showed up and texted ""here"" and I said ""not coming out"" because I thought he was taking me to the hospital. So he said fine dumbass and left. Then told me I'm a lazy POS who doesn't even try. 

That was an hour ago and I'm still shaking and crying. I think work is the reason I can't handle anything. I am scheduled to work tomorrow but I just don't think I can do it. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. I haven't seen my dad in over a month and he's my best friend and I know that's taking its toll. I don't have any call outs left but I do have sick time saved up. I'm not sure what to do. If you read all this, thank you. I don't really know what else to say other than if anyone has advice they feel might help then feel free to share. I'm notngoing to do anything stupid tonight. Just going to watch Netflix and snuggle with my cat.",20Jun2019,2

He has been slowly increasing the dose, and the more he increases it the worse I feel. The more I feel like I'm falling into a greater depression and get random anxiety attacks all the time Now. No matter what I'm doing or who I am with. I have told my parents again and again to schedule an appointment with my doctor and to get me more help but all they do is say okay and then nothing.

11,"So this is like my life story on why my mental health is shattered. So it started when I was about 3. My alcoholic father left me, my mom, and my sister, 5 days before Christmas. My mom did her best to try and take care of me and my sister. My mom worked 3 jobs making ends meet to take care of us. (she finished college but she had nobody to baby sit us so she could get a real job). Me and my sister stayed at home while our grandmother watched us. Eve. Though we were seven years apart, well played with each because that's all we had at the time. When I turned 6 we moved to a different part of South Carolina. We settled down here and we've been here ever since. When I turned seven my grandfather ""inappropriately touched"" me. (I didn't tell anyone at the time but I told someone recently and that's what it was classified as). After that, I developed a fear of physical contact and eye contact. I had been going to school here for about a year and that's when my life really turned to hell. I was small for my age and all the other children picked on me and made fun of me. And this one kid would always be sexually harassing me just for the fun of it. I kept telling people but literally nobody listened. I finally made it out of elementary school and into middle school. And I'm just gonna say, I would have rather stayed in elementary school. I had always been the best at everything in elementary school but once I got into middle school, I stopped getting awards and praises for things that I did right. (I have adjustment disorder so I'm not good with sudden changes) it was quite obvious that my mom was disappointed in me because she always told me she was proud of me and once I hit sixth grade, she just stopped. I was so bad at everything and it stressed me out to the point that I didn't know what to do. So I cut. It was the first time I did. It was just once and it was a small cut, not even noticable. I didn't do it again after that. Then I went into seventh grade. It was even worse. People were again making fun of me and bullying me. They were hitting me and calling me names. So I cut again. And again. And again. And it became a habit. At home was no better. I would always come home and here my mom talk about money issues and it would scare me because I didn't know what that meant. She also had anger issues and she would yell a lot. And she'd say things that I'm never gonna repeat. It was so stressful that I cut myself in the middle of history class one day. The teacher caught me and I almost had an anxiety attack because I knew my mother would be angry with me. Finally I went into eighth grade. It was by far the worst. Everything was so difficult. I didn't understand any of the material and I'd ask my mom for help and she'd blame everything on me. So again I cut. And I continued to cut. It got so bad I couldn't even walk around without a jacket or I'd be sent to the guidance counselor's office. Someone, somehow saw my arms and reported me to the principal. The principal did a suicide risk assessment on me and said that I was at ""mild risk"". My mom had to take me to a therapist before I could even return to school. And I had to continue to see that therapist in order to remain at school. Then everyone was let out for spring break. I wasn't too excited about that because I don't like being home. Easter (of course) is over spring break. So a couple days before Easter, I go and visit the man that ""inappropriately touched"" me. He did it again. And I was terrified because I was old enough to understand what was going on. So I tried to stay away from him as much as possible. He lived with my aunt at the time and I liked my aunt so I went to visit her but that also meant that I had to see him. So the day before Easter, I went to spend the night at my aunt's house. I have insomnia but that night I feel asleep at a decent time. But I woke up at 3 am. He was there kinda watching me while I had slept. I greeted him and he offered to let me watch television in his bedroom since I had woken up. He scared me. So I agreed. And then it happened again. I then ran home and woke my mother up and told her what happened. She simply told me not to go back over there. Then I had to act like everything was fine not even 12 hours after this happened again. Eventually I returned to school. It was ""fine"" for a little while. And then one day I got a math project. I forgot about it and realized that I hadn't done it the night before it was due. I asked my mother for helped and she screamed at me and told me to guess. I was stressed and I didn't wanna deal with anything anymore. So I confided in a friend that I wanted to kill myself. The next day, he showed the guidance counselor. And I was sent to a mental institution for a week. I finally convinced them that I wasn't crazy and they let me leave. And now I'm here. A ninth grader. Not much has changed. I'm still quite fucked up and my mood determines how suicidal I can be at times.",20Jun2019,2

14,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway). I am able to make eye contact, I hardly fidget, I'm more than okay with leadership, and speeches are no problem whatsoever! BUT when I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and old-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is positive. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

22,"Hey there. I'm a 20 year old female who's struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. I often get debilitating panic attacks where suddenly, everything feels like a trigger and everything is stressful. It's kind of hard to explain, but it feels like everything I do, feel, think of, etc. is dangerous and threatens my well-being and that of others. When I have these attacks, even deep breathing suddenly feels stressful. 

For a little background, I've been having these attacks since I was a kid, though their frequency ebbs and flows. I've been on Prozac for about two and a half years now (currently on 10 mg every other day, as I am coming off and hopefully will not be on it anymore by next year; I really don't like feeling dependent on medication, and don't want to be on it anymore), and underwent CBT from ages 15 to 19, but I never really got any helpful advice for dealing with anxiety out of it.

Right now I have someone in my life and he makes me feel so much better, time with him is so good for my mental health and makes me want to be a better person...but some people would begrudge me that, some people would tell me to leave him to focus on finding work instead.

They liked it so much they decided to do it this year, and gave me a little over a week to make it happen. I made it happen, and it was pretty good. All 500-600 people liked it.

27,"Up until this year i had been hesitant to seek out a therapist, mostly because I wasn’t ready to admit that I had a problem and needed to get help. I finally got over that fear and have been seeing a therapist since March. I picked one based on what was covered by my insurance and off of google reviews for my area, and I instantly had a great bond with him. We have open and honest discussions and have made an instant connection. At the beginning during the get to know you part he identified as a cis gay male and I a cis straight male. 

Over the last few weeks we’ve been discussing my self image issues and how i hate my body. I hate how large I am and several of my features. Part of this conversation stemmed from a prior discussion regarding self isolation and how alone I feel. I think that because of my size people don’t like me. In our conversation it has come up that people are attracted to others of all shapes and sizes and that he himself is attracted to larger men. Today during are session it got to the point where i couldn’t say anything positive about myself so I asked him to, in which he said one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. He made me feel genuinely loved. In the brief moment I felt happy for the first time in years because someone expressed a genuine positive comment.

But then he then continued and was talking about one of my flaws that i had been harping on all session and said “I’m not trying to come on to you, but i think _____ are sexy.” We’ve had a great relationship from the beginning and I instantly bonded with him. I’ve also thought he’s questioned my sexuality since the beginning as well and today kinda confirmed those suspicions. I don’t think he meant any harm or anything like that, and i do think he was being sincere. But my anxiety is causing my thoughts to race tonight and I’m not sure what to do because of how long it took me to finally start therapy. I was finally mending and now this.

28,"Before I go on I would like to state that in no way shape or form do I claim to have depression or any mental illness/condition. I am here because I want to seek help from a community that truly seems to care about one another before I really go insane or something. 

So here goes nothing. I’m tired of being a coward but I can’t help but to spill my heart out to people. I keep talking about how I feel and I know that’s supposed to make me feel better but it doesn’t, it actually makes me feel worse. Saying that, yes, I am aware that it is ironic that I’m making this post. I just legitimately feel lost and empty. 

I’m young and I am completely aware that this will pass as I’m only 18 years old and I know life will get better but I just can’t stand it when I find myself in these situations. I feel that there is a void inside me and I try to assess it and think of what I can do. All I can do is be patient and hope it is filled but it’s just eating away at me day by day. There’s a lot more to this, a whole lot more but if I explained it, it would be a novel so I’m not going to do that. I’m willing to talk about it with someone.

29,"I started on Ativan and Paxil when I was 14 for panic and anxiety, and I'm now 36.

 Back when  I started the meds, my dad would yank me on and off of them. I was only on 10 mg Paxil at first even though the psychiatrist wanted me to be on 20 mg but my dad didn't want me to. When I went off to a summer camp being on my own for the first time in my life, I was so anxious the first night I took 20 mg Paxil and did for the rest of the three weeks I was there. I did the best I had in my life. When I left, my dad took me off the Paxil abruptly all at once. This was probably in 1999 I think and before I or I think anyone else knew about the discontinuation syndrome. I had the most awful symptoms, particularly the brain zaps and my vision shifting. My anxiety was so bad with my family. Right after that  summer camp we flew across the country and traveled up and down the west coast visiting different relatives, and I was in hell--having what I now know was Paxil withdrawal and also severe anxiety.

When I started 12th grade that summer, my anxiety was so out of control compared to 11th grade that I went back on the Paxil eventually back up to 20 mg. But it never worked the same to control my anxiety again. That was the fall of 2000.

I barely made it through the end of high school. At the end of that year, my dad again took me off the Paxil. He had the idea that I should only be taking the meds when I was in school.

I went off to college the next fall, and the Student Health Center couldn't believe that my dad was the one deciding which psych meds I was on. They wouldn't see me until I agreed to see the school psychiatrist who was not great. He put me on Celexa, Klonopin, and Ativan.

I deteriorated badly.

I had to drop out of college by Fall 2002, at which point I was put on 30 mg of Paxil (as well as the Ativan).

For a long time on the Paxil I had the typical symptoms of anorgasmia. But something changed taking it for so many years (up until now) where I actually had the opposite reaction: very premature orgasm (near immediate) in spite of continuing to be on the Paxil.

My psychiatrist didn't like Paxil and lowered the dose from 30 to 20 mg.  


What I found very strange was that I had no brain zaps at all in making that decrease. In fact, I got very sleepy and relaxed going from 30 to 20 mg of Paxil.

That was several years ago, and my OCD since that got much worse. I stopped seeing that psychiatrist recently (long story) and am seeing a new one who wants to increase the Paxil dose for my out of control OCD.

She wanted to start slowly and increase only to 25 mg.

I have only been up to 25 mg for 5 days, but I feel like I've had way more energy, and tonight in particular have had way too much energy (like a pressure in the head expanding and trouble focusing because energy feels too high plus a headache), and I've found myself having increase libido (I normally have none at all), and if anything my OCD symptoms have been worse.

I feel like the only time Paxil truly worked for me was when I first went on it at 10 mg and I could feel it sort of ""blocking"" anxious thoughts, and then when I went up on it to 20 mg at the summer camp.

But I wonder if my brain is sort of ""fried"" from having gone off it abruptly twice in the past. I've always wondered if those discontinuations caused some sort of damage that makes me respond strangely to Paxil nw.

I always found it very suspicious that I had no withdrawal symptoms going from 30 to 20 mg and instead felt so sleepy and relaxed (and my blood pressure decreased greatly). And now going up just 5 mg really seems to be revving me up.

I know the dose for adequately treating OCD is at least 40 mg, and before I had been on 30 mg without feeling revved up like this, but I just wonder if my responses will be abnormal due to how I was yanked on and off the drug so abruptly before. It doesn't seem like my responses are normal to it.",20Jun2019,2

34,"Honestly I think I just need to vent for a sec and I don’t have anyone else to talk to.

I graduated from grad school 6 months ago and as of 2 weeks ago I am unemployed for the foreseeable future. My student loan payments start in a month and I have absolutely no income. I’m living with my parents in a small town where all of my friends have moved hundreds of miles away from. I am growing exceedingly more unhappy in my long distance relationship of 5 years but he is the only person outside of my parents that I see regularly so I can’t leave him or I will probably go crazy just from loneliness alone. I’ve been dealing with anxiety for years but recently that anxiety has turned into a very deep depression.

So to recap. I am unemployed, living with my parents, don’t have any friends nearby, am in SO much debt from grad school, and I’m no longer happy in my relationship.

35,"I need to talk to someone, but I'm not comfortable talking to the people closest to me so I'm hoping that someone on here understands what I feel.

I'm a guy, 17 years old, I recently started medication and also started getting counseling for my problems with focus and anxiety, counselor says that I have ADHD and generalized anxiety. I'm not on medication for my anxiousness but I am on medication for my trouble focusing.

I am near constantly pacing around I can't stop it, the worst part is that I've just wasted away so much of my life walking back and forth for hours on end. I HAVE to walk a specific route in a specific way as well, I don't know what compels me to do it, it's more like a subconscious thing rather than obsessive thoughts that are making me do it that way. I don't like it at all but I need to move or else my thoughts will completely overwhelm me, in fact I'm pacing right now as I type this.

I feel as though I'm trapped in my own mind and unable to escape, causing me to have severe mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion. Often times I find that I have wasted the day away having done absolutely nothing productive. I know that I have skills and I know that I can achieve great things but I just can't break this stupid cycle, I actually want to do so many things but I just don't have enough time to do them especially when I do this to myself.

Physically, my heart starts beating faster than normal and I begin to sweat especially at my palms, of course I can't stop moving my legs and It's like a can't get enough oxygen or fresh air.

Socially, I've locked myself away from people, I do still talk to other people but for the most part it's just petty small talk, casual conversation, cracking some jokes, or sometimes just showing them a meme that I thought was funny. People that I used to have good relations with, have either drifted away from me or I pushed them away. I swear to God I had more close friends in elementary school than I do now, now It's mostly just acquaintances and both of my best friends are family members (my brother and cousin in law). Outside of family there isn't anyone I would consider ""family"".

Emotionally, It's the hardest for me, I'm so overwhelmed with conflicting thoughts and emotions that it's difficult for me to even be honest with how I feel to myself. When my mom asks about how I feel I get irritated because honestly I DON'T KNOW how I feel or I just feel like I don't feel anything, as if I'm an apathetic ghost.

Exactly like flipping a coin, without any sort of trigger, totally at random, I will feel either A: ""back to the same routine"", emotionally cold, stuck in my head, and I will have no interest or pleasure in things that normally make me feel good. Or B, I feel the exact opposite: ""today's gonna be different"", much more sensitive to others, freed from my thoughts/able to focus, and most of all I have so much confidence I feel as though I'm completely unstoppable.

Worst of all though, the guilt that I have is really tearing away at me. I try to move past the mistakes I've made in the past to forgive myself but I continually get reminded of them. Mostly, I'm reminded of the people I pushed away and how I may have hurt them, how I may have impacted them.

My personality definitely doesn't help, I would say that I come off as incredibly boring to others, my emotional coldness and insensitivity does not help at all when trying to communicate with them.",20Jun2019,2

Two summers ago, I watched as a good friend of mine in North Carolina was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Though he posed zero risk to himself or others, he was handcuffed, forcibly drugged, and locked in a psychiatric hospital for weeks against his will. I had experienced four involuntary commitments in my life, but witnessing him go through this traumatic experience led to me researching resources that could help him in his situation. By the end of the summer, I’d traveled out to the west coast and met with members of MindFreedom International, and I began getting involved in what I came to learn was the consumer / survivor / ex-patient movement.

There was almost a decade between my first involuntary psychiatric commitment and my learning that this movement existed. Years were spent unnecessarily stumbling along on my own, seeking alternatives, trying to find allies, but always be alone in this journey and being hindered by constant self-doubt. Much like when I started getting involved in alternative education and it took a couple years before I discovered the already-existing world of self-directed learning and unschooling, I saw there was a need for a focused effort to connect those in need to the existing movements and resources that were available to them.

It was this need in mind that the Voices for Choices video series was conceived. 

This video series, which consists of 13 videos, was a collaboration between many individuals including psychiatric survivors, alternative practitioners, artists, journalists, writers, and activists. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a part of this project. I want to specifically thank a few people for their work. 

I want to thank the team at MindFreedom International, especially Sarah Smith, who was the champion of the grant which included the Voices for Choices series. While I was a part of the brainstorming session to plan the video, it was Sarah who took the lead in organizing all the documentation and drafting the grant proposal, securing the funding, and accommodating the regularly shifting deadlines that arose from my poor planning and execution. I’m incredibly thankful for her making this project possible and being understanding in all the delays and requests for time extensions that I begged for. The Steering Committee including Cindy Olejar, Mary Maddock, Jim Maddock, Celia Brown, Ron Bassman, David Oaks, and Sarah Smith was also invaluable in navigating this long process of creating these videos and I am thankful to have had their experience and guidance.

I also want to extend a sincere thanks to the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health, whose financial support made this project possible. While I am often skeptical that receiving funding for creative projects can potentially limit their freedom to free speech, the Foundation was incredibly supportive of our work and I’m grateful that I never felt constrained or fearful in the creative process. Thank you for believing in this project.

I want to thank all of the interviewees involved in the project: Kumail Akbari, Frank Blankenship, Erik Bray, Celia Brown, Oryx Cohen, Emily McMurphy, Sera Davidow, Janet Foner, Al Galves, Chris Gordon, Jim Gottstein, Peter Gótzsche, Chris Hansen, Jill Kesti, Mary Maddock, Hilary Melton, Grace Nichols, David Oaks, Opeyemi Parham, Ron Unger, Robert Whitaker. I want to thank them not just for their time, but specifically for their trust. It is not easy to have someone point a camera at you and ask you questions about such challenging subject-matter, knowing that they will be cutting and splicing your words into a larger story. I’m not sure I have that courage and am inspired by all those who did.

I want to thank my long-time friend Mark Sturgess and his partner Adam Carver for providing the music accompaniment. I’ve wanted to collaborate on a project with Mark for years and finally found the perfect opportunity. The music in this videos really captures the emotional tone in a way that I never could have imagined. Thank you for lending your talents to this project.

Lastly, I want to thank Sean Blackwell. I first discovered Sean’s YouTube series “Bipolar or Waking Up” in 2010, just a couple years after my involuntary commitment. It was the first glimpse I ever received into their being an alternative path to interpreting my experiences. I would say that his work directly inspired the strategy behind creating Voices for Choices series nearly a decade later. 

Without further ado… please enjoy Voices for Choices and share them with everyone you know! We’ll be releasing one video every week for the next 13 weeks. I can’t wait to hear what you think!",20Jun2019,1

Im writing this now because i am currently hearing things and i would like to get a grasp and some insight on whats going on and gauge how logical I'm being later. Maybe this is something i should brush off.. maybe not.

My girlfriend and I broke up a month ago. Following my father's death and her massive manic episode she said my personality ""seems to be shifting."" She accused me of acting off weeks prior to the break up. Most notably ""to her"" is when I couldnt leave the kitchen. I had touched the wall trying to leave and it just didnt feel right. It took maybe 30 minuites before i was satisfied with my exiting wall touch. ""Back and forth like 1000 times""  she said i was acting crazy.. i barely remember this incident but she brings it up constantly. 

We broke up. I moved out. I quit therapy. My soccer friends said i was acting odd as well and were really getting into my space too. So I decided to take a break from the team.

The stress from the break up is kind of fucking me up. My boss has put me on temporary paid leave from work which has never happened to me in my life before.

It sounds like people underwater are having a stern conversation right above my head. I can hear them talking most of the night or when I'm trying to read.. or relax. I hear the T.V on when its off.  

I know its not real. My roommate does not hear it. My ex does not hear it.

My roommate is constantly complaning that im scaring her and keeping her up at night. I try to be quiet. I try to avoid her. I dont think what I'm doing is weird. I'm just excercising and distracting myself from the noises. I find the busier i am with the most background sounds (music, metronomes) the more sane i feel. 

Im not going to lie though.  I dont know what is really going on. I feel very disoriented lately and its hard to describe. My entire life feels like walking into a room and forgetting what i came in for.

48,"I’m a 16 F, and ever since I was 12 I’ve been dealing with this off and on... Dysphoria? Not dysphoria like gender dysphoria. It’s this weird physical urge for pregnancy. I feel empty and incomplete almost. I recently had a pregnancy scare with my boyfriend, 18 M, and my feelings started to resurface. Backstory, when I was 12 my mom announced to us that she was pregnant with my half sister. I was beyond angry, but I don’t know why. I have an older step sister, younger step brother, and brother. There were four of us children already, why did she need another? I thought it was selfish, yet I was also being selfish myself for feeling like it was my turn to have a child. She had her chance. She was 35 at the time, what I think personally is too old to be having kids, but that’s my opinion. Ever since then, I’ve carried this burden. I crave the ability to carry a child. I’ve embarrassedly told my mom about these feelings. How I hated her for having another. I was 14-15 where it gets worse. When I was with my abusive ex girlfriend, she would tell me, “I’d rather die then let you have a child.” It traumatizes me even further. I began to be so hateful. So jealous. I hated pregnant women, I hated the word. It made me feel as if I’d never have a chance to achieve what I’ve been longing for so long. When my ex’s aunt got pregnant, she decided to tell me. I suppose just to break me even more. I sobbed for an hour and a half, I couldn’t take it. Through my writings, I vented my feelings, it didn’t help for long. Then, ex’s aunt had a miscarriage, which in my mind gave me this sigh of relief, as messed up as it sounds. I didn’t want to cut off relationships because of my inability to function without being fuming and jealous. What’s worse, I’m constantly haunted by the fact that every woman in my family has had a miscarriage. My mom lost 3, my grandma lost twins, etc. and I feel like it’s my impending doom to suffer the same fate. I’ve had nightmares of forced abortions and ectopic pregnancies, it seemed like my pain would follow me forever. My now boyfriend, who has helped me tremendously, reassured me constantly that we’d be able to conceive. If we miscarry, we’ll try again, he truly wanted the same thing as me. It was so comforting, and it helped me heal. Every now and then I’ll have small thoughts like I used to, but it’s nothing like it was back then. Only recently these feelings resurfaced, like I said in the beginning, when I had a pregnancy scare. After our first time, I started to feel weird and different. I had my period the day after or so and it was much lighter than usual and it kind of freaked him out. I was just deeply confused, (spoiler: it was just my gastritis) so I got my friend to get me some tests. I tried to wait it out, but I was so desperate for an answer. When they were all negative, everytime I’d sob. I know we aren’t ready, but it’s all I’ve ever wanted. My body felt so empty those days. I feel as if I don’t conceive super soon, I won’t be able to at all. My family is half Christian half rednecks and none of them would take it well if I was. And my bf is going into the Navy in a few months, so he wouldn’t be able to be here to support us directly. It just cut me so deep to see, I had a chance, but it didn’t happen. 

TLDR: I just want an answer as to what it is I’m feeling. I don’t know what to call it. This bodily craving and emptiness of not carrying a child of my own.

49,"I will probably delete this. 

I’m not sure where to start but I need to vent or talk about this in someway. 

Two years ago my parents got a divorce. Before the divorce I only really saw my dad on the weekends due to his work. Now I had to live with him every other week. The beginning was stressful but I always thought it would get better not worse. (There are some details I will leave out in this because I’m still not comfortable to talk about them. Sorry if some things don’t make sense because of that.)

Living with my dad every other week was ok at first. (Never have issues at when at moms house.) Eventually though I began to dread going back to his house. It never felt like home. Eventually I began to be very stressed out while there I realized I didn’t want to live there. (I didn’t tell anyone this until recently though.) Mid school year I began skipping days because I didn’t want to see anyone and wasn’t motivated to leave my room. I make it through the school with good grades despite this. 

Around November of my eighth grade year I tell my mom I want to live with here full time. We talk to an attorney and learn it would probably take 10 months for the process. This worsens things. I knew that if I went through with the process I would still have to live with my dad everyone other week during the ten months. I never told my dad I didn’t want to live with him either. I just never could bring it up. 

(I forget to mention this but after the divorce my parents had a terrible relationship. My dad refused to work with my mom and whenever they conversed it never ended well.)

I eventually decided to hold off on speaking further with an attorney. Then things got even worse. One day I went over to my friends. I was supposed to be dropped off back home at 10 but we weren’t watching the time and I got home at 11. My dad blamed me and  said I planned it and I was lying to him. The next morning he barged in my room and woke me up screaming. He made me do all my chores right away. After that I packed my bags and planned to run away. I called my mom and asked her to pick me up at the end of the street. She was on her way when my dad texted her that he would report her for kidnapping if she came and got me. I don’t remember much after that but I know that he let my mom take me to lunch for two hours. 

After this I felt scared to go back to his house. I still had school at the time and I used it as a distraction. The next week I was with him was my birthday but it was also my aunts funeral. Thankfully he allowed me to go to it with my mom. I haven’t felt comfortable at his house again and I get worried whenever I visit that friend on his week now. 

This was my eighth grade year so I was graduating the school I was at since pre-K. There were two main events at the end of the year. Parents night- the graduates award night and talents show, and the graduation ceremony. For each of my classmates they had two adults with them. My dad never showed up. He never told me he wasn’t coming. The first half of the night I was trying to hold in tears so my eyes weren’t red on stage. It ruined a night that everyone looked forward to the day they entered the school. He texted me the next day and said it wasn’t because of me he didn’t show up. I knew why he didn’t show up though. It was because he didn’t want to sit next to my mom. Jokes on him. That night I received the highest award. The principles award. That made up for it. He still doesn’t know. 

I’m sorry this is so long but this is the last part. I went into my yearly exam at the doctors and had to take a depression screening. The doctor said the results weren’t what he would have liked them to be and he began questioning me. I panicked and said I was worried about final. (I lied. I didn’t even study for finals.) After he began to ask if I was happy in the current living situation etc. My mom was in the room and began to tell him. He asked me if wanted to see a therapist and if that would help. I again panicked and said no. 

That’s all really. Sorry if it’s a mess and all over the place. It’s currently 1 am. I feel a bit better after writing this though. I really regret lying at the doctors but I don’t think I have the courage to bring it up. Sorry it was so long.",20Jun2019,1

52,"So over my life time I've had very so often some intrusive thoughts, which is dismiss immediately but create a huge bother to me. 

Making me questions my mental normality, I would never act on these thoughts, and never delved deep into them.

Examples: 

I would be driving on a 2 way street and for a split second an intrusive thought of what would happen if I switched lanes onto incoming traffic and crashed head on... I quickly dismiss it as stupid and would never consider doing it 

Or 

I would be talking to a person and a thought of punching them in the face for absolutely no reason, intrudes into my mind which I also quickly dismiss 


But the bigger and more bothersome aspect, are the sexual thoughts that arise and create a great deal of discomfort...I would never ever act on these thoughts but overtime they make me feel like a freak of some sorts for having them 

Examples, usually it tends to be that I'm walking down the street and for a split second a thought of groping or touching a stranger inappropriately arises, it disgusts me and I quickly dismiss it...

Is this normal? Or should I see a therapist? 
For many years I put it off saying everyone thinks this way, it's just no one shows it because of social taboos....but to what extent do these thoughts become harmful",20Jun2019,2

I’ve never been in a relationship. Ive never took initiative in my life and now that I’m trying it seems like every time something wrong happens I feel like it’s my fault. I’m paranoid of everything because my hearing is so good, but I end up interpreting it all on a personal level. I get angry and depressed all the time. It’s hard for me to try to be my own person, because I feel like when I am I’m just an asshole. I’m not trying to be an asshole. I’m trying not to be a drug addict like my parents. It’s difficult believing in God. I feel like everyone is messing with me but I know they’re trying to help.

 This stigma makes me dont trust even the profesionals here (i know its not fair, but it is what it is). I heard from people that i could try search for professional help online, internationally, but i dont know where to start? Im looking for one that is quite affordable and trustworthy.

55,"Ok so here’s my story, since I was young, I’ve had shadow-like hallucinations, especially when I’m dazed or in the dark. I never thought much of it but it has always bothered me. I get extremely paranoid about even minor things or extremely unlikely things to the point where I’ll have full-blown panic attacks. Something that has started happening over the past few years is that I feel like when I see a painting or picture of a person, or sometimes an animal, I feel like they’re watching my every move just staring at me, the feeling is even stronger if they are someone that has passed away, Sometimes I will hear incoherent voices in my head when I can’t sleep. I’m feeling extremely paranoid writing this right now to be completely honest. I’m a freshman in high school and this is ruining my life. My parents don’t believe in mental illness, therefore I cannot get medically diagnosed with anything. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Someone tell me as soon as possible.",20Jun2019,9

I’ve always played outside by myself, played video games by myself, and very rarely do I meet people who I think of as friends. I have a girlfriend who also suffers from the same problem. So we’re basically just in our own little lonely bubble together. I feel so insignificant. These past couple of months have been hell for me. I felt true scary suicidal thoughts until this year.  My girlfriend who I love more than anything else literally has no one she can call a true friend. How do I meet people and think optimistically so people will want to be around me?

62,"I feel like my brain is countering its own personality. So far he is:
- male (i am female)
- he likes girls A LOT (meanwhile I am not interested in love)
- he is alpha
- he is sometimes a dramaqueen
- he is confident
- he is a derp
At first, random, stupid, thoughts started popping in my mind (""throw the phone"", ""kick the kid"", etc). Then I felt the need to refer to my brain with the pronoun ""he"". It just felt right.
A daily thought that pops in my mind at least 2 times a day is: ""I want to die"" - but this doesn't affect me at all, though. This thought actually amuses me and I always call him dramaqueen when he starts talking about not wanting to live anymore. Also, sometimes he says this while being all happy, other times he is neutral or gloomy. He also says things like ""I am dying in here!"", ""let's...DIEEEE"", ""I want to die in hopes"", etc. 
There was a moment when my grandmother made me taste the soup. I did that, but it was too hot and I got my tongue burnt. My Brain started screaming in my head that my grandma wanted to kill us, just because our tongue was burnt. 
I would include other thoughts but I can't remember all of them. They are random and so stupid that sometimes I joke around and say that my Brain is on drugs.
Recently he also found a name for himself, but I prefer not to give in to that. I feel like, somehow, I'd lose control if I gave him a proper name.
The problem is there are moments when I can't sort my thoughts. I don't know which thought is mine and which is Brain's.
Overall, this problem doesn't really bother me. I am curious, though, if this is something bad, something that should worry me or not.",20Jun2019,1
63,"Hi. I’m anna. I’m a compulsive liar. 
First time I’ve ever admitted to being one. 
Some background: I’ve had major depression since I was 19. That was the first time I tried to kill myself. 
Since then my asian family thought the best way to deal with their crazy daughter was to ship her off to another continent for a degree in something I never wanted. 
So here I am. Eight years later back in Canada. Jobless. Loveless. No outlook at all, unhappy with my career choices and letting toxic men taking advantage of me. 
I was good throughout the years. To keep on pushing. To keep going forward. To keep trying. 
Until recently. I met a man last year. Treated me like shit. Used me for sex during which I was not aroused and it hurt like a bitch. He wanted to stay friends and I said yes. Because I’m that desperate. A year later, I know he doesn’t give a shit but I can’t stop hoping. 
Tonight I was talking to him, not studying, not motivated to further my life but talking to him like I was some bomb chick girl that had her shit together. I lie all the time when my life is in reality a mess. Today while talking to him I realized what the fuck am I doing. How’s this going to end. We’ll lose touch and I’ll be a bum who’ll think suicide is the easiest solution rather than facing the music. So I guess I had the switch flipped in my head today, it’s time to face the music.

There are also repeats/continuations of a sound/song/voice that i had heard seconds before; they continues in my head for less than 2 seconds, although they aren’t continuing out loud. They freak me out and this makes my anxiety worse. I get freaked out that I might be schizophrenic or suffering from psychosis but I know they're not voices, nor do i think i suffer from delusions. I've noticed this happens more when I dont get enough sleep or am extremely stressed. Is this caused by anxiety? Please help. Thank You.",20Jun2019,3
65,"After two sessions I asked a therapist what diagnosis she‘d give me. From what she‘d heard, she said it would be depression. Nights of additional research on my side would confirm. 

So, I don’t really want to act out my hobby (singing in two choirs) anymore. I read that loosing interest in once fun things is common and I think I‘m selfaware enough to notice that in myself. 

However, the reason I don‘t want to go anymore is because I feel like bringing down the people around me. I‘m always tired from not sleeping enough which also makes me slow when talking to people. I sometimes don‘t know what mood I‘m in or how I will respond when talked to. Sometimes, I don‘t have any strength to sing so I spend the hours lipsyncing. 
I don‘t want to feel like a burden for the others, but (I guess the healthy part of my mind) wants to keep me going there at any cost.

Any tips or advice whether I should still be going there even if I feel bad or staying home when I don‘t have the strength would be greatly appreciatedd.",20Jun2019,1
66,"I’m new to reddit. I really just made an account because I wanted something to laugh at but I saw that there is a mental health community and thought I would write something. Apologies if there is a separate tag for this. 

I’m a 19F and well the title says it all. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for years, specifically since around middle school. I’m also severely OCD but that has only recently gotten worse. I’m not talking about your stereotypical “I want everything to be nice and even and symmetrical” OCD (although that is part of it) I’m talking full on daily rituals that I HAVE to follow, if I don’t I feel like something bad will happen. I have extremely disturbing intrusive thoughts and when I get them I will start pulling my hair, hitting myself, and sometimes crying. I’ve become extremely paranoid as well. I don’t drive yet, but when I’m in a car I feel extremely uncomfortable and afraid of crashing even if the person is driving safely. I’ll start picturing a speeding driver or a drunk or reckless driver crashing into us out of nowhere and killing us. If someone doesn’t text me back for hours I will assume the absolute worst has happened and panic (although I don’t tell them this and I don’t double text). When I’m in public I try not to dress too nice or wear anything that will bring me attention and I’m always looking over my shoulder to make sure no one is following me. I don’t think I need to mention that everything needs to be even and symmetrical for me. 

The anxiety has also worsened. I have frequent stomach aches that come from constantly being nervous and paranoid and there’s really nothing I can do about them. I’ve lost some weight because of this but I’m still not at an unhealthy weight, I think (I’m 5’6 and about 105 lbs). This has been happening for almost 3 years. I’ve changed my diet to see if maybe it was being caused by something I was eating but nope, it seems it’s because of anxiety. I’ve been to doctors and they also had no explanation and just sent me home with medicines that did nothing.

The depression is kind of just there, I don’t even pay attention to it anymore. I have really really low self esteem as I don’t have many friends and I’ve never been in a relationship. I have had suicidal thoughts before and have self harmed but I don’t do it often anymore and the thoughts are just kind of there. 

I get a good amount of sleep but I’ve noticed that I frequently hear things that I know are not real when I’m trying to sleep. Sometimes it’s voices sometimes it’s just random things. I always have conversations with myself and with “the little people” as I call them that live in my head. Last night during one of these conversations, the other voice was responding something like “it’s happening” and I didn’t just hear it in my head, I heard it out loud. I knew it wasn’t a real voice and I knew it was just me hearing it but it sounded very real and loud (even though it was whispering) and it woke me back up. There have been times where I hear random screaming, a baby crying, alarms, sirens, chainsaws, and once as I was falling asleep I heard “please wake up” very loudly in my ear. These are not real noises that I hear outside, these are noises I hear directly in my ear that I know I’m making up but they drive me crazy. I also sometimes have delusions; I think I can predict things, control things, that I know things other people don’t. I’m aware no one can do these things but I feel like I can. 

I’m sorry this got so long and I appreciate anyone who read this far. My sister only knows about my depression because I make many dark comments and jokes and she has offered to take me to a therapist but absolutely no one knows about everything I suffer from. I’m not officially diagnosed with any of the illnesses I listed but when you know, you know. I’m afraid of going to therapy or a psychiatrist because I’m afraid of medicine or getting hospitalized. I also don’t know how to bring this up with anyone in my family because although they are supportive and loving, I’m not sure how they would take it. I don’t believe I’m in danger of harming myself because I have a dog and several nieces and nephews that I love very much and I can’t bring myself to abandon them. I’m just not sure when I’ll stop caring about them and decide that enough is enough. 

Again, sorry this basically became an essay and I appreciate anyone who reads through all this.

TLDR: suffering from really really bad OCD, depression, anxiety, and some delusions. Too afraid to go to therapy or a psychiatrist and I’m only getting worse by the day.",20Jun2019,2

68,"Here's the deal. I think about everything. I overthink everything. I'm almost never ""in the moment.""

It's getting harder and harder for me to fall asleep, I can't have conversations with others without overthinking every word I say, and it's severely inhibiting my ability to form relationships with others in general. 

Working out helps a little bit. If I'm doing something intense at the gym, my mind will ease slightly. Only slightly though.

I've tried meditation. Sitting in silence for long periods of time only makes it worse. 

The only thing that comes close to working, embarassingly enough, is masturbation. But I'd that not be my go-to strategy. 

Also, doing anything that involves adrenaline does a pretty good job of shutting my head up too. But I don't always have the time to go skydiving.

I've heard weed helps, but I'm not much of a smoker.

I need something that I can do every day that will agressively thrust my brain back into reality. Like a punch in the face.

72,"Hi guys, 
I've been struggling with anxiety for most of my life. Although when I was younger I didn't know it was termed anxiety, I just assumed i was very nervous and everyone felt like this.

My panics would usually result in me unable to sleep, due to a racing, extremely pessimistic mind, loss of appetite and eventually throwing up mostly bile. Eventually whatever was causing the anxiety would pass and I'd slowly start to feel better.

Recently work has been extremely stressful, I'm in management, and my wife and I have just given birth to our 1st child. My anxiety levels have shot through the roof and I've been struggling to function. After not eating anything for more than a day and still not feeling hungry, I thought I'd better book an appointment with my GP.

The doc prescribed Zoloft 50mg daily and explained that this would make me able to function properly again.

I take my tablets in the morning with my coffee. I've been on it for 2 weeks now and have felt the following side effects:
Upon waking up (Before tablets) dry mouth and extreme nausea.
I also feel like I'm having less panic ""Attacks"" although I do still have my bouts of worry.
My emotions feel like their volume has been turned down (Best way i can describe it) with much more subtle highs and lows.
I can fall asleep much easier, and have extremely vivid dreams.

Most of this is bearable, except for the nausea.

My question is whether the side effects will wear off, and if 2 weeks is enough to feel the full benefits? How would I know that the tablets are working?

75,"I live with my parents, am teenager. My dad is an amazing person, the best type of friend you can ask for, but sadly he wasn't the best dad. He put most of his responsibilities on my mom. Let's say if I had to go to a doctor, he would put that on my mom, make her go with me. My mom means so much for me. She's the most precious thing to me, she has been my mom and dad for the most time. I love her to death. But sadly she suffers because of me.. She sees that I'm not in the right state of mind, she gets sad because of me and that hurts me so much. Big part in this plays our financial status. My dad had pretty big salary, but as the time went, his salary got smaller and he took debts for repairing our house...
This affected our family big time. When I went/go to a place with my homies, maybe even with relatives or friends somewhere, I always feel bad because I don't have enough money in my pocket. I don't want others to know that I need help or something. It makes me feel bad that I can't spend my money on them, or even as much as them. As his debts size grew, our family's fights also got more and more.. He drinks with his friends, coworkers, etc. He isn't alcoholic btw. It's just that here, in my country, they like to eat, drink, ect. And he spends money on that, not to say he doesn't do anything for me and my sister, he pays my gym bill, but most of the time he can spend his money on something that isn't necessary like for that friend ""drink partying"". Me and my sister feel bad when he comes home, he gets very annoying, he can act pretty embarrassing when we're outside. I talked to him about it multiple times, he just doesn't except any of his mistakes or wrong doings.. 
Finally, my today's point, why I broke down..
My father's brother, let's call him A, I talked to him today. There's this thing called ""munat"" in Armenia, it's a way of talking, a bad way, I can't describe it. My uncle is in US, I texted him. It was 1am there, he texted with ""munat"", asked me how I was. I felt very bad about it. My dad asked him to get a snapback for me (like I wanted it, but I didn't eant anything from him). He asked if I looked for anything, I said I didn't want anything from him, it's my dad that from my name wanted it for me. He laughed at it, then asked if everything is ok, I simply sent 👌 and ended the conversation. After few mins I called my dad, told what I did, and asked to him to never ever EVER again want something from him from my name, and that I felt very bad how he talked with ""munat"" with me. He just laughed and said that he talked like that because he was very tired from work, and I probably texted him and waked him up from sleep. Then I started to breath differently but prevented crying, but my dad noticed my voice change a d said ""my boy, you felt bad because of this? Don't cry darling, everything is okay, you're a big boy, this doesn't look good for you"". Then we ended our conversation and I broke down.. I was crying uncontrollably, punched the ground, I was thinking ""I'm fucking tired of this, I don't want to feel like this never, ever again. I'm tired of this bullshit. I hate being broke, I hate how people talk to me with ""munat"", I'm  tired already"". Then my sister came in, asked what happened. I said nothing. She called mom, and mom called me and asked what happened and why did I get in my feels. I tried to curve her questions but she knows me too well. So I said I'll talk about it later..",20Jun2019,1

77,"Hello all 

I seem to have hit a road block. To give you some background about me. I’m a second year apprentice living in Australia. I get $400 a week (I’m not sure how that goes in America, but here that’s enough to put fuel in my car and maybe have dinner three times a week, I.e not much.) 

For hobbies. Normally improving my car. My car is a Mitsubishi Triton I paid $9000 for. It cops a lot of shit because it’s a 2x4 and isn’t exactly the most expensive Ute out there. Anyway I’m welding a steel tray for it right now. 

But I’ve hit a roadblock. Somebody that I had.. think of friends with benefits but more innocent. It was just somebody to talk to, somebody to sleep next to, someone to hug. Anyway she doesn’t want to do that anymore, which fair enough it’s her choice but it’s left me feeling shit. 

In addition to this the steel tray I’m welding isn’t working out but I’m already $700 deep in it, it’d likely cost an extra $1500 to finish, and since all the money that’s in it is for raw materials, I can’t just sell them. 

I’m not enjoying work, I’ve got a presentation tomorrow for TAFE (like college) that I’m shitting bricks about and haven’t finished. The thought of suicide drifts past my mind multiple times a day but I tend to dismiss it, however it always comes back. 

I’m just not sure what to do anymore... everyday is longer and more boring than the last, minor problems just keep getting more and more extreme (at least to my head they do) and the thought of trying to conquer something in this life is just so big that I try not to even think about it. 

I was brought up not to be a quitter though. Life is just a game to win. But I was also brought up being treated like shit. So when I snap out of it and realise I need to man the fuck up I end up feeling worse, because I’ve realised that I’m being a little bitch even considering things like suicide. I know that’s not true, but it’s stuck in my head that’s how it works. 

I dunno what to do. At the very least, if somebody feels like it. 

1. Opinion on the steel tray project. Abandon all hope? Or blow more money on it. 

2. Should I quit my job? I don’t really like it but it’s money, and it’s a trade. I do alright at TAFE (routinely score 70%+) but it doesn’t pay enough, at least for the next two years, and everybody else who works there considers me the laughing stock which doesn’t do well for my... I suppose anxiety? I have issues with not being liked or excluded. 

3. I own firearms. In Australia we have pretty strict laws about this and if you go and see a psych, your guns will be confiscated and your license shredded up. I’m hesitant to go and see somebody because I do like my firearms, and it’s quite a big thing in our family to go for a shoot on long weekends. We have a great time going having a shoot, running around on the dirt bikes. It’s not something I want to give up.

Any ideas",20Jun2019,1

Unfortunately, a large part of the populations believes that some types of people shouldn't exist. So if that's their desire, then why should it be considered crazy to comply with it by removing oneself from the gene pool? It's not really harming anyone else then. I just don't understand. I respect that therapists are trying to help, but I feel that whatever they're saying is drowned by the noise of society. People write stories that involve friendship, love, tolerance, empathy, but none of this is real, in reality someone would feel annoyed if you walk too slowly and push you in front of a train if it wasn't illegal.

My classmates always state that grades do not matter and that what matters is that I pass the boards. While that’s assuring, I still can’t help but to get so freaking upset at myself for scoring a C or basically anything that isn’t an A.

I’m trying really hard not to give a fuck anymore by telling myself that grades don’t necessarily dictate how I will perform as a PT.

82,"Throw-away account for obvious reasons, so right to the point with as much needed info I can relate. I'll try not to ramble and drift towards story mode and state some facts in the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for just over a year now (I'm nearly 21 and she's nearly 20). It's a long distance relationship, but we make it work. I guess I can sum it up with this: that connection you have never felt before, and you could never really amass the necessary vernacular to describe. In the year that we have been together, she and I have grown, but especially her. She has gotten way better at dealing with life in general and we have both been through rough patches, highs and lows. A certain phenomenon has persisted that has troubled me for the entire duration, something that has finally led me to seek advice on here in order to give my thoughts some structures or legitimacy/illegitimacy. Before I go in-depth, let me give you a synopsis. She has been going in and out of severely depressive, mood altering, extremely intense bouts. Those bouts always revolve around significant aspects of her life that she thinks about  (me, uni, parents), doubting, examining, analysing, you know, thinking. That process of thinking things over and over and having negative thoughts evaluated and reevaluated again and again is something more or less a lot of us go through, including myself, and when she's being herself, she seems to handle it like everyone else like us too. But when she enters those ""bouts"" that I mentioned, she seems to be unable to cope at all, with any invasive thought that questions feelings or creates frustration. Those periods of time that I refer to as ""bouts"" take effect somewhat randomly, usually every couple to a FEW months (probably around when things are intense and questionable, increasing her susceptibility to them), and last for a couple to several days. No more than a week contentiously, but sporadically throughout a two week period is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I love her so much, and as I've told her, it's not even love anymore. The experiences I've had, what we've shared and what has connected us, it's not much like the ""relationships"" I see around me or online, but like a few out there. We are not petty, or together because it's comfortable. We have connected in ways I only wished were possible, and we have shared and gone through a lot. I love her, but it's beyond love at this point, she's a part of me forever no matter what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help her, and I don't quite know how. Those ""bouts"" started from day 1, to pretty much today, with their frequency limiting from the half-year point onward to around once every two months. Of course in the beginning, I could not understand what was happening, but it felt like I was talking to an entirely different person for a brief period of time, returning to normal shortly. I went with it, and I slowly started making sense of it (with her help too). It used to be that when in those bouts, telling her that she's being different or entirely opposite in character and personality, would make her upset and she would deny it. But as time went by, she acknowledges what is happening somewhat, and comes to me worried and confused. She tells me what's bothering her, thoughts she can't dig out or deal with, and then quietly listens to me help her deal with them, as she relaxes. Today, after coming to me with those thoughts, and she listened to me discussing them, she looked at me confused and teary eyed, and told me ""I should see a psychologist"". And before I explore that, and why I need advice on how to help her, let me inform you on those bouts a little bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

When those bouts ""kick in"", she changes completely. Withdrawn, won't talk to me, annoyed at the slightest, rude, emotionally abusive to a certain extent, on and off sad and happy (mood swings), always resulting in a relative break-down and talk about her thoughts, thoughts that used to be absolutely soul-ripping to me, things that hurt me a lot, but things that were always reversed after those bouts. My girl is not rude, mean to me, ungrateful, easily irritated to the point of retaliation and abuse, holds grudges for accidents, flips a smile on like a broken switch. Yet when she's in those bouts she is all of that, something she is able to understand after she exits them, saying that she understands they happen, but she wants us to forget them. Every-time in those bouts hurtful things are said in talked about on her part, and it used to be that she said them to me in anger, spitefully, as if out of revenge, but she know states them confused, lost. Thoughts that seemingly she could handle existing and deal with a few days ago, rationalising them or reasoning with them, reflecting on them and moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

I read up on every symptom I've talked about online, and of course I don't want to nor will I be THAT guy, looking to diagnose something online, but helping me understand this and what it might be or might not be will be seriously helpful.

In addition: 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I shouldn't be her psychologist to such an extent, or any for that matter, but there's nothing else I or we can do right now. It has in fact, been very hard on me. But every-time I go through one of those bouts, were she changes completely, dealing with a whole different person and facing all of those ""troubling thoughts"" she has at the end, I come out wishing to forget it, because being with the real her, the normal her, means everything to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help her, but how? Where to go? I'm moving to the same city as her in 2 or 3 months, so the long distance aspect will be dealt with. Not doing it for her only, as it's a good decision over-all. Moving on from that, what do I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing a therapist might not be an option, as her parents cant know/wont approve, hence wont fund. I can help her pay for it, but dont know how much i can help. Where do we turn to?

84,"Hi everyone, i'm asking for advice for a situation that's getting too much.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, my gfs brother always blames his parents divorce and saying nobody loves him when it's quite the contrary. Everyone loves him and has always supported anything he's wanted to do. However, he's the type of guy who will start doing something and quit after a short time for no apparent reason. He hasn't gone to university nor has he been working and he's currently 29. Growing up, he was always seen as the star of the family and everyone showed him overwhelming love and support.

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a fact that he's a huge believer in mysticism and spends all of his time reading in his room. He has also done a lot of LSD, DMT and Iowaska. Personally, he's gotten worse over the time that i've known him, the more he's done these drugs. When I first met him, he was still willing to try out work but will quit after a week and still be relatively stable. He uses every excuse possible not to get a job, and instead continues to take money from his mother (who's incapable to work due to her arthritis) only to spend it on beer or drugs. He will order take out instead of eating in, and have the air conditioner blasting 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

He's had spurts where he claims he's addicted to weed or alcohol and resorts to stealing household objects and selling them for cheap just to get some drugs. When his parents cut him off as he lives at home, he eventually throws a tantrum and has threatened suicide many times, and at times getting physically aggressive by smashing up the house, but never touched his family members, although, he has claimed many times in the past year, that his only desire is to see every single person and every single thing killed and destroyed violently. One time last year he got so angry because they took away his allowance that he pretended to try to jump out of the window, and asked for his mum and my gf to call the police as he's crazy. When the police shows up, he acted completely normal and the police were convinced that it was a false call. They even assigned a social worker to him, who he manipulated into believing that he's a great person and that everyone else is out to get him.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent episode, he went overseas for a few months and randomly got into an argument with his mother as he was asking for more money and she refused as she needs that for her own living. He proceeded to wish that she dies in pain and of cancer, then started a lie and saying the police are arresting him if he doesn't pay the money and spun a story that he got taken to jail and got stabbed in the neck and raped. He then pretended to be a police officer overseas, reporting to his mother that their son is unconscious and bleeding from the neck, that it's too late for him, ultimately concluding that he was now confirmed dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mother and father who are divorced, individually had to contact that country and the embassy to check if it was true or not, and go through the whole mind frame of considering their son actually got murdered and killed. 3 hours later, he's completely normal again and his excuse is that he was 'testing his mother' to see if she cared about him.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what we can do to help him, because people in his family have said they feel he has some sort of depression, bi polar or even schizophrenia. He refuses to take any medication and makes excuses not to see any professional unless it's someone who lives by Karl Jung's teachings. Everyone in the family has been so hurt by him for nearly a decade now doing this and we don't know what else to do. He's very smart and seems to be able to manipulate most professionals to think he's completely normal. Does anyone have any advice or an opinion on what may be the issue with him?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",20Jun2019,1
85,"Hey 😅

&amp;#x200B;

So before i start telling you about my problem, let me give you some background info: I am 18, male, am an IT guy, do little to no exercise, have an ok diet and little social life (but im fine with that, i like working on my projects better anyways).

&amp;#x200B;

Now for about a year, my mind has been very clouded. This means that most of the time i stand next to myself and my mind seems ""afk"". That itself sucks, but is kinda bearable. But what really bothers me, especially because it has gotten worse, is my memory. I keep forgetting things. For example I'll talk to a friend and the next day I'll tell him sth, that he just told  me the other day. Or for example when I close the doors in our home, I'll forget to close some of them. Etc etc. There are countless examples from my day to day life. But what really bothers me is the fact, that i cant remember what i did let's say a couple days ago. Or last year. Or last summer. Only mere details or big events like: Oh i went on vacation. And if i try to remember things from 3 years ago... theres nothing... nothing. I cant remember shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am thinking to go to my doctor and ask him about it, but I am not quite sure if I am just overreacting.

88,"Hello, guys! I am a 18 years old boy from Nepal. I never go outside of the home and always stay in the same room by locking the door. In an entire day, I speak around 1-2 minutes only with the family members. I have never talked with any of the neighbors for my entire life, and when a relative comes to my home, I don't even go to the room where the relative is staying. When my parents ask me to come to the room, then I go and when parents tell to greet, I greet like this: 🙏 (Nepali way of greeting) without uttering any word and then I return back to my room and lock the door again.

At this age, all of my friends go out of the home, and travel to places alone. But, I have never traveled alone for my entire life. Also, the last time I visited a place far from my home was in 2016 with my father and we stayed in a relative's home there.

I never go anywhere alone, except riding bicycle to my school/college. While going to college, I go by riding a bicycle. On the other hand, my friends go in public vehicles. The reason why I don't go in public vehicles is that if I go, then I wouldn't be able to tell the driver where I want to go and I wouldn't be able to request the conductor or driver to stop the bus when I reach my destination. In college, I never speak with friends, teachers or any one else. The only time I speak is when my friends or teachers ask me some questions, and I speak in an afraid voice.

While going to college and while returning home from college, I go alone, with no friends near me and I directly return back to home without going anywhere else like other people do. For the rest of the day, I just stay in my room by locking the door and using tablet or laptop for the entire time or doing my homeworks. I never engage in any social activities or activities inside my home. The only thing I do is using tablet or laptop.

For purchasing stationery products like books, copies, pens, etc., I go with my parents instead of going myself. To visit bank or buy necessary things for me, I go with parents or tell parents to go themselves without taking me. I never attend any marriage ceremony, or any other events except those where I am forced to attend by my parents.

I don't even eat the food that other people eat. I don't eat any veeable or met products, and I don't even like telling their name, which is why I am placing * for some characters. I don't even like touching those food items. If I mistakenly touch, I run very fast towards the bathroom and wash my hands with soap. The last time I touched a vgtable mistakenly was around 5 years ago. The only food I eat are few fruits (apple, mango, papaya, grape, orange, litchi/lychee, pomegranate and banana), rice, pulse, milk, biscuits, dry fruits, chocolates and bread products, and nothing more. I guess the only things powering me throughout my entire life are milk and fruits. Also, I have never faced any health issues in the past related to vitamins, even though I don't eat veeable and mat products.

So, I would like to know what kind of person I am.

Am I asocial? Am I anti-social? Am I autistic? Do I have any disorders? Please let me know what kind of person I am! I can't even visit a doctor and tell about my issues.",20Jun2019,1
89,"I'm not sure if this is the best place for this post, but here it goes:

I know this is going to sound nuts.  But, I've just recently recalled a memory of my childhood that I suppose was repressed or maybe something has never triggered it.  It was close to 30 years ago.  I was in first grade.  My family owns a large farming operation and would frequently have migrant working families assisting us with the operation.  We had one family live on the land with us and their young son was only a year older than me.    


We would spend hours upon hours digging in the dirt and having a grand old time as is natural for a first and second grade kid.  However one afternoon, he sexually assaulted me.  He told me that we were going to play a game called ""sex"".   He proceeded to pull down my shorts and dry hump me.    


This is the first time I've ever told anyone about this.  I never told my parents, I haven't told my wife.  I'm not sure even how I feel about the whole thing.  Part of me wants to be angry with the guy over it.  But, I know a second grader doing that to me had to be learned from somewhere.  He was probably sexually assaulted himself.    


I've been thinking about talking to my wife about it.  It's very hard for me to tell her for some reason.  I'm not sure why, but it probably has to do with me growing up in a culture of toxic masculinity.  I'm not sure what to do with this now that I've uncovered it.  How much of my life and my personality have been defined by the fact that I have some unresolved sexual assault. 

I have this memory, and I don't know where to go from here.  Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.",20Jun2019,0

91," 

Throwaway account as I don't want my brother to find this, in case he knows about my main profile. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd need some advice on what I could do about my younger brother, he hasn't been doing too well since he started his job 3 years ago.  


Some background info: He was the youngest of all of us(6 children), and he didn't get much attention. He was always kind of reserved, never really had friends, and in hindsight we didn't really have much patience for him, neither did our parents. He was always the black sheep of the family. Not long after he started school he had to be taken out in the middle of the first year after he was mercilessly bullied and developed asthma. He got transferred to a special ed school where he was doing well, but he was taken out in year 3 because he was above the others intellectually and the school moved very far, and he was put back i to a normal school.   


I've been correlating what I remember and what he told me(however he really barely talks about himself). Looking back our parents ignored obvious signs of separation anxiety that started for him a year before being moved back to normal school. He was having serious problems with separation issues and confrontations with some of the class. He developed colitis at 11, but kept it secret for months because he said he was afraid of going to the hospital. He eventually had to go, and he just... something just broke inside him after that. He just wasn't the same after he came back from that place, and it only got worse from then on.   


His separation issues went away, but in their place came this really nasty hatred and utter hostility. He pushed everyone away and isolated completely, he fought until he could move into our ugly basement away from everyone. He spent 4 years down there without even any internet. He also ended up getting home schooled due to his bullying issues. He seemed to have just hated everyone and wanted to be left alone. After a few years he improved, but you could tell he was not exactly 100%. He was always distant and very timid, almost child-like despite being a late teen. He never showed any interest in real flesh and blood girls and he still doesn't(he is 28 now). He preferred to be with his video games and to work on his hobbies almost exclusively.  


At 16 my parents thought he was doing well enough and tried to put him back in as high school started, and it was a disaster. He didn't last a month, and even before that his colitis returned half a year prior. He fought with my mom to be allowed back into homeschooling, and eventually he won. We were all pissed and disappointed, and this time a lot of my siblings turned on him, even I did, which I regret now. In hindsight he was mercilessly bullied and he just wasn't ready for high school. He also had to go a second time to the hospital around then, and he already refused to go for a check up earlier as he said the procedure left him with nightmares.   


After this he ended up being more and more awkward. He started flunking his studies and barely got through high school. It didn't help that my mother got cancer at the time and she also deep down blamed my brother for failing to stay in school, and she would even bully him when he was obviously not well emotionally.   


I think if he didnt have his hobbies he would have gone insane in that room, alone all those years. He still managed to graduate and by God's miracle he landed a job as a programmer. He however still doesn't have any real friends in the vicinity, owing to his paranoid fear that everyone is just going to hurt and humiliate him. I even tried to encourage him, but to no avail.   


Now he managed to keep the job, but he's been becoming more erratic. I recently found out he owns a huge plush that is designed after his favorite video game character(one of those cartoon animal mascot characters) and he's  been kind of obsessed with the series overall like a little kid, even though it is way out of his age. He's never had a girlfriend, he's a total virgin, and from the few times he's spoken to me, he said some really weird things in regards to those things.   


He said that after the hospital stay at 11, he's been possessed by demons multiple times and forced to watch as they did things to him. I won't go into details. He also believes that some girls who do so much as look at him are ""agents"", as he calls them, and want to turn him into someone else. He seems totally obsessed with the fear of being raped anally, and he has muscle jerks sometimes on his arms and face, he sometimes just dazes for seconds out in the middle of talking, especially if he's talking about a topic that upsets him. He is really not well at these times. One of the most disturbing things he's told me is that he sometimes dreams with mom, and in these nightmares she is almost always a negative, harassing figure. My brother also believes that my mother grew to hate him not long before she died, all because at one point she didn't want him to check up on her anymore after she got sicker and bed-stricken.   


Other times he just suddenly snaps back to his old distant but stable self, and he seems to be doing a lot better at those times, but it's also then that he doesn't really speak about himself with anyone, so I am not sure.  


He visits a therapist every two weeks, but he admits that he finds even that uncomfortable, and we recently got him to agree to  visit a psychiatrist. However I have my doubts about whether he will cooperate. He said he was afraid the drugs would kill his creativity, or turn him into a zombie. It doesn't help at all that he's had some bad luck with the therapists my mom took him to as a kid. He told me of some kinesiologist who he claimed once suggested he was sexually interested in children, which I know is bull, but because of this my brother has been avoiding our nephews like the plague, and he has this expression of disgust on his face if they do so much as touch his hand. I think deep down he is still haunted by this fear that that woman planted in his head.  


In the end, I am just hoping that someone could give some advice, anyone who's seen something similar to this. My brother's condition is really starting to worry me, and I am hoping someone could give some advice. I really regret ignoring this for so long.   


Thanks.",20Jun2019,0

95,"I'll try to keep this short, can't guarantee it though. 

So I'm a 19F. I have had weight problems since I was, I guess 7-8ish. Pair that with my nature to be different from a whole crowd of people automatically making me self conscious as fuck. I have lost weight and looked really good. But I have gained it all back and more sometimes too. I've also been under my BMI. (Currently overweight due to college stress, narcissistic mother problems, non existent relationship with my father who works far away from where I live and my on and off depressed mood)

I have the tendency to make a lot of friends (try to be the jokester and am known for having very interesting conversations)  at any particular stage of my life. But as soon as I move from school to school or school to college, even home to home (we rent), I completely stop talking to them. It's like I want to forget them on purpose and move on. I have zero friends at the moment who have known me at an earlier stage. Everyone is an acquaintance in my current situation. 

There's this one girl who was my friend throughout 6th grade to 9th grade. This girl was so close to me that she referred to me as her sister even. We'd share everything with each other. She was really pretty, popular with everyone and was known through the school. We clicked and she had me by her side for the majority of our time there. But I was kinda ugly, fat, no neck at all and zero dressing sense. Deterred by most, I still had some amazing friends who saw me for my personality. But those days were kinda rough on me and I still feel self conscious thinking about how people treated me (even my family). 
  
She stayed in contact with me for a long time up until 12th grade. Constantly asking to meet up at the mall or at her house, even asking me for my address so she could just come over. But I kept the relationship only on the phone deliberately telling her I was busy studying and stuff. I guess she had enough and has stopped calling or texting for more than a year. I haven't spoken to her in a long time and I kinda feel guilty for shutting her off. 

I just remember all those awkward days in that school, getting picked on, not being recognized for the things I'm actually good at and feeling worthless every other day. 

*Long story short* : I can't be friends with anyone from earlier years of my life, not even people from a year ago, consistently because they remind me of my insecurities and all the horrible, awkward moments at that particular stage of my life. I probably will not talk to any of my ""friends"" now because they will remind me of all the times I've fucked up this year and how self conscious I've been about my weight when I have been with them. Or how depressed I was because I used to think they have a better life than me.

But today I realized depression is worse than sleepy. I just want to cry and slip into non-existence. My heart hurts, my chest hurts, everything hurts. However, my husband is very depressed because of some work issues (and he's struggled with depression for a long time). He is angry and feels helpless and is very very depressed.

It's like I'm falling off a cliff, but I turn around to catch a glimpse of the ground and nothing is there, the cliff keeps going down forever. First I wondered, ""how did I get here? What went wrong?"" Eventually, I realised; ""it's my fault I'm falling, I should never have stood so close to the edge in the first place. But how would I know this was going to happen? I couldn't."" Branches and roots of trees on the edge of the cliff stick out at random intervals, and I try to grab them stop my fall, but I give up eventually. What would I do once I stopped falling anyway? It's so far up to the cliff, and nobody was there with me to see me fall. Even if they were, I'm falling faster every second, it would kill me to catch one at this point. After weeks of falling, I realise. I realise that I no longer wish to get back up to thw top of the cliff where I stood once, because then I could still fall again. It's been so long that I just want to hit the ground. But the ground never arrives, does it? The cliff stretches down, forever. I just want the fall to end. They never told me that the fall would be worse than the landing.

Every day I fear myself and what I am going to do wrong, what that bastard inside me is going to do to ruin me today. I haven't seeked professional help because I dont even know if my personality problem is real. I don't know if they'll just laugh and tell me I'm fine, or tell me I'm crazy, I don't know which would be worse at this point.

I can't live like this forever; leeching off of other people's care and affection. Those people, that love won't last forever, and I know that. I need to know what's wrong with me. I can't not know any more, it's been that way for too long now. Every day I wait I lose more of my grasp of what I am as a person, my traits, pieces of my personality fading with every passing second, minute, and hour.

99,"Hi, everyone. I'm 26 and currently in the process of getting an extensive psych eval because recently I've experienced things in my life that may not be normal. I've been in therapy for years but only for OCD. I haven't been evaluated for anything else.

I just want to know if it is normal for me to look back at things I did, loved, and said a week ago and feel completely disconnected from it? This happens to me almost every week or few days. Right now I'm thinking about my personality from a few days thinking ""I can't believe that was me"". I was completely invested in certain hobbies and activities last week but now I'm just confused looking back thinking ""I don't understand the appeal of those things now"". It's never a gradual shift, it just seems to happen suddenly out of nowhere. 

I'm not depressed. I've been depressed before so I'm aware that this is not depression. I don't lose joy in the things I love, I just change to different interests. I usually switch back to those interests eventually, but for a while I go ""I literally can't believe I enjoyed this last week"". I draw constantly and sometimes I will see something I drew a few days ago and be like ""why would I draw that subject matter? It's not something I like anymore"". I was very interested in socializing last week and I was very good at it (I'm not normally a social person) but now I find it tedious to respond to messages and hold conversations. I valued friendships last week and now I don't see the appeal to having friends. I have pictures of people on my phone wallpaper who I love but some days I'll look at my phone and be kind of confused like ""why are these people on my phone?""

I know interests/personalities change over time but I go back and forth between many interests/moods I have. If it was gradual I wouldn't be so scared but it happens like turning a light switch on and it's so jarring it scares me. I've been crying the past few days because I'm feeling disoriented. I am drawing new subject matter, my favorite movies and shows are different, and I'm finding it hard to be interested in my social life. All of these things were different last week and knowing me it will change back (or to something else) next week. But I'm not sure. I dissociate all the time but right now I feel very ""present"" and it's emotionally overwhelming which is also why I'm upset. I don't know if this is normal. I don't know what's going on.

102,"Hello everyone, I will try to be as brief as possible.

I am diagnosed GAD and Schizoid Personality Disorder (not schizophrenia!).

I have doctor's papers proving my diagnostics and such, and can easily get papers to appeal for governmental aid, but I've always struggled to get into the system and maintain being into it because it always felt it makes me sicker than it actually helps. When I'm embroiled into it, I can't focus on anything else, I'm always seeing the next appointment and nothing gets done. I've noticed this recently, and I've noticed that if I strip myself of all of these pressures, suddenly I sleep my full nights, feel a lot more confident in myself, I've taken on childhood dreams like programming and succeeded, while I still feel I will never be able to fit in a 9-5 job in a shop on the street, I feel that I could find my ""niche"" if I could stop having that pressure.

The problem is, facing the system for me to get actual help like financial and such is too much of an ordeal for me, it takes me back to my lowest everytime, and it's not something I can afford to happen again, suicidal thoughts and plans are getting real. I also cannot get rid of this pressure unless I get in the process. Is there an alternate way the process could be handled for me to get the help I need ? I've been running almost 10 years without any stability or income and managing the best I can, but it's just not working anymore, and I feel this struggle is 95% of what makes me sick today, as I've progressed enormously on many other levels and I've found reasons to think I have worth.

I compare my situation much like with someone who would be physically unable, it's the same kind of ""unable"", it does not work at all. Surely there is solutions for them, do I have a recourse if my ""unable"" is mental ?

Thank you all for your time. ♥",20Jun2019,0

When she’s really upset I’ll try to go over and comfort her and hug her but she pushes me away and says “don’t touch me”. I feel like that’s a bit excessive being that I’m only trying to help but I feel like I just don’t know what the right thing to do or say is and it’s eating away at me. She’s always been a person who clings onto her secrets and bottles everything up without letting a soul in. She’s so good at keeping secrets that it honestly scares me.

105,"Hey everyone, the purpose of this post is for me to vent (thank you for allowing me to do so) but also stress the importance of reviewing your medical records and  being vigilant in correcting any errors, especially since you will likely receive similiar push back as I have.

All this from asking, there is an error in my records how do I fix this? It felt that this process showed that having a mental illness was proof enough that I would have another. 

I had a physical done at a new primary doctor who put as a diagnosis history of schizophrenia. I do not have this, nor was it discussed. This was the ressoning it was put there from the doctor ""its because the dose of the medicine you are on is for that disorder."" He wasnt even the prescriber. When I asked how I can fix this error, I was told ""if its in our records, it must be true. We will not change it"". We are legally allowed to request ammendments to our records, do not let them tell you no. If they say no, they have to provide a written reason.

This information was passed on to a life insurance application and I asked how do I fix errors in my records. Here were responses I got

Insurance company CEO ""the doctors didnt think it was incorrect in their records"". No indication that I coild have my doctor send in a letter explaining the error. There are no records elsewhere since I dont have this disorder. 

DOI: ""that diagnosis was correct at the time of application because your doctor said so"" . No indication of how to go about fixing the error nor how to ammend records now held at DOI. ""Your information is nownpublic record. We do not have your medical history here, just a list of medical diagnosis and doctors. That is not a medical record and is open for public review. We cannot make an ammendment"" An invalid diagnosis now at the hands of anyone.

He also bashed me to the CEO in an email, degarding my question and concerns. He also said he would follow up on an outstanding question but he closed the case as soon as I hung up (public record shows this) and I never heard from him again 

Insurance company chief underwriting officer ""the records we received were very similiar to that of another doctor"". There are no other records and the doctor named has confirmed as well. No indication that I could write a letter to request ammendment. No indication that they would update their MIB report.

MIB "" we dont provide that information"" 

From NAMI ""we dont offer support for people with disorders just their families, try disability center for your state"" or ""speak to a lawyer"" no response from the state help line after a few voicemails.

From disability institute ""federal grant prohibits us from working on questions regarding this""

From lawyers "" no response"" tried through EAP four different firms to see what my rights were.

From a doctor I saw 5 years ago one time who wrote things taken out of context and invalid not related to the diagnosis issie "" i dont even remeember who you are and its been so long. I cant just change it"" but clearly her record is solid and is more truthful than what actually happened.

From Crisis Text Line "" it is easy for people going through what you are to be suicidal,  are you?"" Wtf?? Apparantly being angry and frustrated means I am a danger. 

I requested medical records in February and was only given some records. I asked for the remaining and they told me I had to wait up to 30 days longer despite it bei ng more than 30 days beyond when I started. Apparently it was my fault and i was being unreasonable and not accomadating to they were so busy. My bad.


I am made out to be such a bad guy in all of this despite fixing a legitimate error. Many phone calls, letters, unresponded voicemails, and time spent. It really proved to me how broken the system is, how alone I am to have to go through this, the doctors word is the bible, how little these people cared, and how dangerous it is to have medical records . I wonder if someone who had an incorrect physical illness would have to go through this gauntlet as well...

Please review your records and do not let people dismiss the issue.",20Jun2019,1

I was prescribed with an Anxiety disorder and depression in 3rd grade it has been a daily struggle since I may talk about some of them on here. One struggle was going to so many councilors nobody has ever really understood me one of the scariest moments that no one knows about because I hide and lie about it is when I went through a dark faze when I was constantly depressed and thought about suicide but then I remembered my family and fought through. At that time I was taking a anti depressant called Prozac/ fluoxetine which I highly do not recommend for anyone based on studies it has caused more suicides then prevented. I used to put on a fake smile and say everything was okay I joked about it with all my friends but secretly thought of it seriously that was until I got Zoloft it's the best thing that has ever happened it has helped me so much especially since I also suffer from ADD (attention deficit disorder) which Zoloft also helps with along side other things now I don't have to fake my happiness I am truly happy now but still want to bring light to a very over looked mental disorder.

109,"[I would like to apologize for any grammatically incorrect word usage. English is not my first language.]

A little backstory: I grew up in a small town, which means everyone knows everyone. This can be really wholesome in some cases, but in mine, not really. I went to Kindergarten with the same children whom then later became my classmates/schoolmates in middle school. I think you know where I'm getting at.

I was suverly bullied throughout my entire 3-14 years. I was always picked on for... everything. For being too fat, for speaking to the wrong person, for simply existing even. Let me tell you it really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. With suvere phisical and verbal abuse I was on my own for many many years. And when I was finally able to go to Highschool, leaving every bully behing, things got much better, but at the same time, much worse.

I had depression, and anxiety. I was suicidal, and the enviroment change did not help. Hell, I even started to have panic attacks from time to time, which was quite new for me at the time. I was still scared of people, I wouldn't talk to anybody, and nobody would talk to me. I was going through therapy, was hospitalized for suicidal intentions, and got antidepressants. 

When I got to 10th grade, everything started to change. I started to speak with other classmates, they started opening to me, and so did I to them. It was going quite fine.

However, I was 2 years late. Everyone got their best friends and friend groups already, and I wasn't the part of that. For non.

When I would be only with one person, it would always go fine. But in bigger groups, I was always, always ignored, and when I would say something they wouldn't even notice, not to speak of the times when I would announce (i. e. going home and stuff) something and no one would hear it.

It hurts. It hurts almost just as much as being myself, all alone. I feel alone in these situations as well, even though I'm with other people. I can't not feel how unimportant I am, and thus the reason why I'm afraid to build real relationships to one another. Because even if they mean a lot to me, I wouldn't mean that much to them. Not even close.

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm 18, and we celebrated our graduation. We were having a party, and I spoke with most of my classmates. I felt really great, and it was really important, because I was able to engage such conversations with them and with my teachers. The night hasn't even started yet (it was 9:30) when everyone started to go away. Kinda strange considering how much of a party animals they are. I was with 4 others waiting for our home ride. Then while at the car I saw my fb feed where my 19 other classmates were having a party. Without me.

Even the people who weren't there, the 4 I was waiting with- they knew it. They just declined it, since they didn't drink.

But me? I wanted to go there so bad. I wanted to have fun, to drink, to just be with them. To be a part of them. But nobody told me. Not even once. And that hurts. 

I was doing really fine, I did my exams, wich caused me an extreme amount of anxiety; my depression is almost non-existent at this point thanks to the anti-depressants (which I've been clean for almost a year now) and my boyfriend.

And yet, this one little thing, which no one even thought about, only me, is hurting so much I feel almost just as bad as when I was dealing with my depression. I don't want to talk to any of them, and I didn't even want to do anything else but cry. It's so pathetic, because it really isn't a big deal, it's just one party nothing all, but still... It just proves my point how unimportant I am,and to know my place when it comes to friends.",20Jun2019,7

112,"&gt;Howdy everyone! I have a bit of an issue personally, that I think a lot of people may have: I am *incredibly squeamish at the sight of blood.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
This is probably not new a circumstance, but for me personally, it feels pretty bad. Years ago, I wanted to be an EMT because I wanted to help people. I also wanted to be a cop as well; protect and serve, help people as well. The problem with these two career paths was that I would have, at some point, deal with the sight of blood and the mere sight of it makes me incredibly lightheaded, and that is a no-no in these fields. Currently I'm in college for 3D Modeling &amp; Animation, so all hope is not lost for me career-wise. Still, I wanted to just... overcome this squeamishness.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd been recommended by a friend that watching lots of videos with blood in them would desensitize me into overcoming it, but whenever I watch them, I start giggling out of my control and start feeling lightheaded. I don't feel this way when I see my own blood though, only the blood of other people, animals. I've watched a few medical videos and those kind of helped, but it didn't completely help me.  
  
&gt;

With help from friends I pulled myself back together a bit and got a job and an apartment and was trying to save up for filing bankruptcy. Now I don't have a job anymore, the little bit of savings is about gone, and I'll probably be homeless again next month.

121,"I've seen a number of therapists in my life, my husband had never. We started going for couples' counseling a few months ago. At first, it was super helpful. In hindsight, I think that was just because we had a moderator in the room, which forced us to be civil and stopped us from going off on tangents and focusing on the task at hand. She definitely was somewhat helpful, though, in the beginning. There were some red flags though. She made raunchy sexual jokes that made me really uncomfortable (sometimes involving us), and made me not want to talk about our sex life with her at all, which is a big part of our issue.  She would also just let us argue for almost the whole hour with very little input or effort to keep the conversation civil, which seemed to only exacerbate things. Sometimes I got the feeling she was just enjoying hearing about us and our lives, more than she cared about helping us.  


However, counseling seemed to kind of open a dam for us, and things got much better between us. After seeing the counselor for a couple months, we stopped going. Last week, we had our first major fight since. My husband wanted to see the therapist so I agreed. The appointment was a week after the fight, after we had already resolved it and moved on. Once we got there, the rehashing of it seemed more detrimental than helpful to me and I did not want to be there. She made another raunchy comment, and never had much of anything helpful to add. I think it was obvious I was not happy with her. When the appointment was over, she refused to allow us to pay our copay. She's often done this. Obviously, it's like, sweet! But with everything else it's just another red flag. After the appointment, I told my husband I didn't want to see her anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she texted me a kind of summation of the appointment and some advice. I think it was very good advice, but a text? To a patient? I have a lot of questions that I don't want to approach her with through text. I also want to deal with her in her office, during the allotted time, not during my day.

122,"I'm 25 from Europe. During my teens I developed an eating disorder (anorexia and then bulimia) and vomiting really damaged my teeth. I have several fillings and 1 root canal. The problem is, I have a filling in one of my front incisors (it's not too big, but after a while the filling gets a little discolored especially compared to my white pearl-colored teeth). I see it, but other say it's invisible unless I point it out. I'm extremely afraid of getting cavities. 

Overall I think my teeth are ugly and I'm constantly anxious about them. I go to the dentist at least 3-4 times a year and I have an x-ray at least once a year. Anytime I see a darker (like light brown or not as white as my teeth) spot I immediately feel the urge to call my dentist and get it checked (usually it turnes out to be some discoloration). Sometimes I can't even sleep because of how ugly I feel and I spend the night crying. I brush 2-3 times, floss, use a special mouthwash for my gum, another for my teeth and I rinse my mouth with water after every meal. I don't drink soda and I try to avoid sugar.

I'm thinking about getting veneers or crowns but once you get these you can't go back. And I'm also really scared about damaging my good teeth with these cosmetic procedures. I just want to feel pretty. Everyone around me has gorgeous teeth.

So, how do you do it? Do you type it out on your laptop/tablet in a document? Or an online blog? Do you have a diary or secret notebook only for this purpose? 

Are you writing it as if you're telling it someone? Or are you ""talking to yourself"" in the text? Do you try to analyze situations from a ""more neutral, maybe almost objective"" point of view?   
How often are you writing it down? Regularly or just after special incidents?

126,"Firstly I'm sorry if this isn't what this sub is for(new to this sub). This is on mobile and this account is a throw away since some people know my actual account but no one knows I'm like this and if there's a sub for this type of question please tell me. 

I've developed horrible trust issues over the course of three years due to a bad relationship with my first girlfriend, she was very manipulative and emotionally abusive towards me knowing that my anxiety would just simply have me avoid all confrontation with her if problems arose between us and ended with her breaking up with me because I wasn't attentive enough whole I was trying to find a job during the summer. She proceeded to constantly tell me how she was my best friend and would convince me to tell her everything I felt as she knew I had no one else to talk to about my problems because I was afraid of being looked at as crazy by my other friends. She made me distant from other female friends and even stopped me from getting into relationships with people that I felt cared about me. As all of this continued she convinced me to give her another chance as she missed me and always told me I was ""The one who got away"", it played at my heart and within 2 weeks she cheated on me with my best friend, I don't blame him because he never even knew we were going out again, all he knew was that I was hurt because I called him crying while I was having a mental breakdown because my ex wouldn't admit she cheated and he was the one that told me. I thought I could trust her and for a long time I did, I thought she would be my best friend through everything and could help me with my anxiety. It was later that I realized she had probably cheated on me the entire time we dated. Past this I got depression, my anxiety worsened and I developed trust issues. I haven't been able to trust anyone for a long time and I feel heart broken because even the people that I know I should trust I can't. I always feel as if they hate me and simply don't care even though I know they do. I start telling myself that they dont, that they'd rather be with someone else or that they couldn't give less of a shit about me because all I'll ever be is some spineless dumbass who gets too emotional the minute someone starts getting close to me. I want this to stop but I don't know how, I want to cry but my family would get worried and I don't want to upset them. I just was to be able to trust someone again and not think about how much it would hurt if they ended up hating me and stop caring. I haven't been able to be happy with anyone because I constantly feel like they might be lying to me even though I know I 100 percent know they're telling me the truth and I can see it hurts them whenever I just can't take their word for it. I just get this horrible but feeling that makes me want to throw up and it won't go away till I check.

Please, if anyone know how to help. Please tell me, I want to be happy again, I want to be able to trust someone again without having to tell myself that I'm a piece of shit for just not believing them. Can I even be helped? Is this something that I can improve without anyone knowing? I'm sorry again if this isn't what this sub is meant for but I want help so badly,I just want to be happy again",20Jun2019,1

She told me to not go to the doctors because ""it would be on my record permanently"" (I have been myself, she doesn't know I've been in therapy and on antidepressants) though I think this is due to her own insecurities about her reputation in our hometown (of course she doesn't want a crazy daughter).

I made her suffer for my entire pleasure ( not even lying, i take pleasure when she cried when i dumped her).

During that ""psychopathic stade"" i killed rats by stabing them for my pleasure.

pretty fucked up, and ngl, if i didn't tried to get out of that phase i'm sure i would've hurted somebody physically.

145,"

I'm 19 and female. I was diagnosed anorexic by 2 psychiatrists and a psychologist. I have seen multiple therapists in the last 2 years.

I have very minimally supportive parents on this issue. Two eating disorder centers that I went to get evaluated at said I should be in an intensive program, and allowed me to register as soon as I wanted.

However my mother doesn't believe this is that bad. She spends most of her time using my illness against me by guilting, victimizing herself, and screaming for hours on end daily at me. I'm home for the summer from college so I have nowhere else to go. I'm miserable and my ED is getting worse daily. She said she knows I need help but says i'm choosing to be this way and I have made myself sick. Once I was diagnosed with AN, she said I used that label and locked myself in a corner. She basically doesn't believe i'm anorexic despite my diagnosis, and is verbally abusive, very, and it's destroying my mental health. All I feel is guilt, shame, and isolation. My ED and poor self image has kept me from leaving my own house since May 2nd to see any friends.

How can I get her support? She'll support me getting treatment one day then wake me up at 6 AM to scream and yell about how I am doing this to myself and i'm not really anorexic. She will let me register with outpatient centers or therapists, then suddenly say she doesn’t trust them and cancels the appointments. (For example, I was supposed to start a 6 week program.) 

She said everyone is self-conscious and refuses to believe professionals. When I say “abusive” I truly mean it, calling me a cock sucking whore, for example, because I didn’t want to eat something she made once after waking me up at 3 AM. She’s been physically abusive on a few occasions, not too often. 

I have no money of my own to pay for help. Maybe you can give advice because I can no longer take this daily verbal abuse. My eating is worse than ever. Sorry for the lengthy first message! Sorry if this doesn’t make sense.",20Jun2019,3
146,"I have been in a long term relationshoip (7 years) of which 4 of these years have been long distance. My girlfriend and I have always been close since we met when i was studying abroad in her country. I had planned on several occasions to fly to see her, but time and again some event happens in where i am not financially able to return. as is understandable, she si growing tired and suggested that if i were not able to come back for my masters, which i had planned to do, than we had tried everything we could, but it wasn't meant to be. That being said i have applied and been accepted to her University, and have recieved scholarship to do so. The problem lies within the fact that, through these years of wanting to go back, being unable to do so i have grown deeply depressed. The extent of which it has grasped me only came ot light upon being accepted to her school. I was expecting to finally feel that ""release"", that wave of happiness that i had waited four years to feel. My girlfriend upon telling her was estatic,  told her family very cheerfully that i had been accepted and will be with her again. I, however,  felt no such thing besides just the mental awarness that ""yes this is a good thing a thign you wanted you should be happy"". which leads me wondering day in and day out about the decision i reference in the title, which is should i go to be with her finally, or should i stay and address my depression.  


if i were to go there are no real health  services avaliable for students, especially that for foreign students such as myself as any diagonsis of health related issues can bar one from obtaining a visa/residence permit (i have not been clinically diagnosed as i wishing to avoid this possible problem, and i had also felt that my situation was no deemable as depression). to go would also mean that i am in daily contact with my girlfriend who i love to my core. However, it also means that i would deal with this depression entirely unto myself, and if this moment i have been waiting to arrive for years (being accepted with scholarship) cant bring me happiness, than what severity am i even at? i also fear my situation would worsen while i am there, which part of me tells i could handle, but honestly i dont know if i can even trust myself about this.   


If i were to stay i feel i lose everything, the love of my life, and the chance for scholarship. I fear in the future i would grow to regret my decision to not go and take advantage of the gift i have been given. Thr thought of losing my girlfriend alone is enough to make fall into a mental pit for the entire day usually, if the thought were to become tangible i truly do not know what my state would be.  


so there it is, do i go and just hope that it fades away and allows me to feel happy, live the life i have been dreaming of for these years of long distance while in my home country, or do i stay for the sake of my mental health and lose everything closest to me? the more i think about it, the more dark everything becomes, and just this deep rage at myself for feeling the way i do, and im just tired.

148,"Hi there, first question I'm asking on reddit but I've seen decent responses to other reditors so I thought I make a post as well to maybe have an outside opinion on what's wrong.

I've struggled with a lot of mental issues over the last couple years. I've moved across states by myself about 3 years ago and that was the last time I seen my ""parents"". At the moment I'm living with my girlfriend who always takes care of me even after 2 years of crazy shit that I've done, not to her just to myself. Alright, so a tiny back story, I'm probably going to wrap this up quickly when I want to because I can already feel anxious from putting this out on the internet.

I used to struggle with self harm issues as a kid, not from being picked on or any issues at school, I had a great school life and it was the one escape from home. I love my ""mum"" (I say mum like this because of backstory I would rather not go too deep into right now) but I constantly felt under scrutiny and honestly just bullied and pushed around constantly, she wasn't the smartest so when we got into fights I would say witty and small remarks that I feel she would be frustrated with because her responses were shithouse and narcissistic. It would then escalate into a screaming match lasting anywhere from 30-45 mins leaving me grounded for an over the top time amount because I couldn't just drop it and be the ""bigger person"". I would get frustrated with this and lock myself in my room either cutting or drawing and thinking about how to end my life. Age 12-16. I tried multiple times that were full attempts, the worst being the huge amounts of pills I took before work for some stupid reason and nothing happened until I passed out serving a customer and the manager helped me into the office and sent me home, I got picked up by my mum 20 minutes later out the back and went from there. 
None of this is really important and really I'm just rambling because this is the first time opening up about this sort of thing, what is important is the panic attacks I used to have, I would get so frustrated with a situation (something as simple as not finding a shirt, girlfriend's dad had to help me through that one) that Its like my brain no longer wants to work and I go into meltdown mode. I'd throw stuff, hit stuff, scream until my voicebox was f*cked and sob for the next 20-30 mins. 
But now it's at the point where I'm hitting myself instead, I'm not too sure why but I'm scared because I used to have slight control over what I was doing, now it feels as if I'm just on a joyride in someone's else body which makes it worse. For example yesterday me and the misso were having an argument (a small one about petty shit, we were both in sh*t moods.) but for some reason it got to the point where I couldn't start calming down and I kept getting angrier with myself to the point that I punched my self 4 time in the top of the skull, after that I thought it wasn't enough for some stupid f*cking reason  so I got the closest chair and rammed my head into multiple times. My heads now bloody, bruised and sore (cracked open) and I'm scared of what will happen if I can't learn to control it. I've used many different methods for calming down that I found along the way but none of these are working anymore and it's scaring me. 
I'm going to go see someone about it but I'm worried I'm going to be a melon for getting on tablets to help me ""function"" surely there's other things that help? 

Sorry it's so much of a rant and has no clear direction but to sum it up into 1 question I guess- 
• what is your best way to cope with anxiety/depression (whatever I have) and is there any of you who have done this and stopped, how?

I have a mental illness, my mental illness is a part of me. But I am not my mental illness. There are times I've wanted to end it all, but now I'm flourishing.

152,"I'm 21(F) and have always had problems with depression, anxiety, and frequent mood shifts. I have been taking Zoloft since I was 15, and it helped for a while since I was going through a lot at that time, but my ex and I had recently noticed that it made me feel somewhat numb. I couldn't get excited about things. I couldn't cry about things when I felt the need to. And I eventually resorted to ""taking breaks"" from it when I felt like I needed to feel something. And, of course, it had a severe impact on my mental health--being off and on an antidepressant that is not meant to be taken as needed. So, I eventually stopped taking it.

I honestly feel as though not being on medication  for a while has helped me figure out what I needed to do for my own well-being, seeing as I could actually feel the emotions I felt, and I knew that they weren't based off of me being off and on my medication.

But seeing as I have struggled with depression and anxiety all my life, getting up and doing the things that need done has proven difficult. A lot of the people that I know have said great things about Wellbutrin, and have stated that it is non habit forming.

I’m afraid one day I’m just going to jump in front of a train because I can’t take how much I hate myself. Like I deserve to be thrown off a cliff because trannies are evil.",20Jun2019,3
155,"In the past few days or so, it has just hit me. I feel like I have been “asleep” and like my life has been a blur. I have been fairly sad for the past 2 years or so. I now feel grounded and like I want to take charge of my life. I have been living in chaos. However, this week, I finally cleared out some stuff in my car and took it for a car wash for the first time in over a year. Yesterday, I cleaned out my desk at work. This morning, I woke up early to clean my bathroom. I’m not sure what’s going on here. But I feel grounded and excited for life. Also, I took drugs (acid) over the weekend and didn’t have a great experience. I was super anxious and just praying for it to be over. I am wondering if this had an effect... I am afraid for this to go away though, I don’t want to fall back into the “blur”. Thoughts or advice?",20Jun2019,1
156,"Hope this is the right subreddit. This post may be a little bit all over the place, it’s just coming out of my head as I type.

My mom has always been a perfectionist, hard worker (last to leave office first to arrive, work weekends etc..), I would say she is very much a people pleaser even if it left her at a disadvantage. She had always said work was stressing her out, my dad and I believed her, but I think we just took it as the usual thing he or I would say after a tough week. Just over a month ago, she came to us and said she had messed up at work due to having so much on her plate, that things had fallen behind. From my understanding and from what only she told me, it was enough of a mess up that lots of people wouldn’t be getting payouts and the company would go under. We tried to calm her down and reassure her that there must be some sort of solution, but she was adamant that there was nothing that could be done and in fact she didn’t even have the first idea on how to unravel it.

This eventually led to a breaking point a couple of days later when she tried to overdose on sleeping pills, from here we had to book her into a clinic for around 20 days. From the day she took the pills to now, I feel as though her mind has left her. I will talk to her, but it is as if all that is left is a shell of a person I once knew. She will sometimes have traces of her old self come out, if you ask certain questions. 

The problem is she has this one train of thought, work and money. She believes the company she works for isn’t coping without her because she is the only person who knows passwords etc… and that the company will collapse, even though it has been 5 weeks since she has been at work and they are still going strong. Money has now become an issue because we found out she was giving it to people to help them (at least one third of her salary), but this has caused her to be in debt, and of course with her mental well-being I have my doubts she will return to her work, especially anytime soon. My dad and myself have told her not to worry, that we will do as much as we can financially, and that she needs to focus on positive thoughts and resting as much as possible. We have sometimes spoken with her for 1-2 hours, she will stare straight at us, but I am pretty sure all she is hearing is white noise, because as soon as we finish talking she goes back into how only she knows her job and then how will the family live with no income etc.... My dad and I have referred to this as the thought wheel as it is repetitive and just keeps rearing its head, no matter what is said to her.

Through all this we have spoken with her boss, who has assured us the business is fine and the problems are sorted. We have told her this, but she is in denial about it. There are of course more delusional things she has done since coming home, where all my dad and I can do is shake our head at the ridiculous of what she is saying.

I suppose through all this rambling, I just want to know is there some end in sight, will she ever get back to her older self. What are other peoples experience with having a mental breakdown, should we as a family be approaching her in a different way?",20Jun2019,2
157,"When does it get better? I feel like I've been drowning and overwhelmed by stresses in my life for as long as I can remember, that I actually don't recall when I felt happy and free last. A lot of the issues within my life are out of my control: 

* I have a visible tumour on my forehead which makes me feel incredibly insecure, and the specialists have essentially told me I will be trading a lump for a big scar at some point. 
* My financial assistance for my PhD went from manageable to non-existent. I am already working and studying. 
* My neighbour is trying to sue me over a fence that we were wanting to put on our property (this is a long story- he is a retired lawyer who I essentially feel is doing this for sport), but I've had to get a property lawyer which is obviously not cheap. It seems we are legally in the right, but still, this has been thousands of dollars for nothing. 
* My dog has been chronically ill (urinary infections) for a year and a half- so bad my vet had specialists from a research university involved in her case. Again not cheap. She is only 7 years old. 
* Many many issues with my home- leaking plumbing from the upstairs washroom into the basement, causing damage for 3 stories, destroying the tile in my bathroom, and then my front door jammed. This was just the past 3 days. 
* Obviously from the points above, I am now as a result of this shit-storm, very financially stressed. 
* I commute 2.5 hrs each way to work (total of 25 hrs a week commuting) to a job where I am overworked (incredibly burnt out at this point) and am underpaid (aren't we all?). 
* My partner, despite their best efforts, is not an emotionally supportive person, and also doesn't handle anything. Meaning, things just sit there and they don't action them for weeks, which is why it always ends up my responsibility. I'm tired of not having any support, and I'm tired of nagging them, or knowing that when a problem comes up, it will be me dealing with entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this is just a whining-post, but I honestly have never felt more suicidal in my life. I dream about OD'ing (I don't do drugs recreationally, I just feel that may be the most accessible way to go). I tend to picture myself stepping out in front of a car, or getting shot. I see a therapist who essentially says that it would be almost impossible for someone with this amount of constant shit to not feel overwhelmed. But, I don't see this getting better, and these things I can't control. I really don't see any value of living, and I am very tired of it all. I also have a lot of historical-PTSD from severe abuse in my childhood/early adulthood.

It's been years of chronic bullshit from other people, and I'm tired of it all. It's too much for one person.",20Jun2019,2
158,"First let me say that I don't think I am depressed. I don't seem to have most of the symptoms that are common with clinical depression. From what I've read I understand that depression is mostly a lack of emotions, feeling nothing. I don't have that, in fact I feel emotions quite intensely. I don't have a lack of motivation, no anhedonia, no insomnia and I've never had suicidal thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet I feel this sadness in me. I worry a lot, mostly about the world, and about the human condition. I think about how messed up the world is and I cry a lot. For example, lately I have been feeling sad about climate change, about the rising number of teenage suicides, about child labor in the clothing industry and about how my boyfriend isn't living up to his full potential. I think about how disconnected we are nowadays because everyone is on their phones all the time. I feel sad because I feel the same urge to be on my phone more than is good for me. And then I think about how no one can really understand each other, not fully anyway, and that makes me sad. I feel sad about the fact that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. I feel sad about the opioid crisis. I feel sad about the refugees that drown while trying to escape a war zone. I feel sad that so many people are living without a purpuse in their lives. I feel sad about people who are oppressed by religion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I generally enjoy life but I just feel so sad and helpless about all these things at the same time. I don't think this is technically clinical depresssion, but then what could it be? I do have (social) anxiety, is this just a symptom of that anxiety?",20Jun2019,1
159,"Reddit, I could use some advice. Me and my partner are really struggling. I'm in too deep and lost perspective. This will probably be long as this issue is large, I will attempt to be concise.

She is 21, been on her own since 13. At that age she also moved in with a prostitute who used her for money and got her addicted to coke. She had a miscarriage that year due to the drug use. She has been raped multiple times and many more as a child. Her father was an abusive drunk, her mother addicted to gambling. Her exs partners have all been verbally, emotionally or physically abusive. She didnt go to school aince grade 9. She is suffering from BP2 (bipolar) and only since she met me a year ago did she begin treatment for it. That is in a nutshell her past and it hurts me to even think about. Which I do. Every single day. Although today she graduated highschool finally! And is at college for nursing and I couldn't be more proud of her!

I am 29, been on my own since 20. Parents support me, pretty well adjusted and emotionally stable. Well educated, currently working as a supply teacher. I have adult ADHD, memory loss and a learning disability. But I'm proud of what I have accomplished. 

I met her a year ago and fell in love with her and her struggle. She stopped prostituting herself, she quit cigarettes and started school again. I gave her support and basically removed the shitty abusive people in her life. Things are better and I know that. But here is the thing...

She has anger. A lot of it is because her father and everyone in her life taught her that screaming at the problem is how you fix it. As well there is deep seeded anger towards those that caused her past trauma. This coupled with her bipolar disorder means communication is often impossible if she doesnt like where its going. 

I feel tired. It doesnt matter what the issue is she defaults to anger and becomes manic. That's game over, then I just have to sit there listen to her scream until her mania slows down, sometimes my ADHD kicks in and I get super sleepy. I can't be upset, because if I confront her about something I get yelled at simply because her anger and mental illness will not allow her to accept serious criticism. I need to be allowed to be upset every once and a while.

I need to say that usually after she is calm she is usually very upset at what she did. Also she used to explode over almost anything. Now its just bigger stuff, she has come a long way. She is going on medication soon, but fired her last therapist. 

It's so hard to deal with this. We can't talk about anything serious, it just piles up because in the end her immediate mental health is more important. I'm feel like im trapped in her past, I have never cried so much over one thing, it's torture. And for her anger I don't know where to start, is it her bipolar? Ptsd? Genuine anger? I really need some advice. Sorry for the essay.",20Jun2019,2
160,"So I've got the feeling I've been depressed for a very long time . Probably felt like this since I was 8-9 years old ( I'm 21 now). I've had what most people would consider a pretty hard childhood, I was bullied ever since 2nd grade and once all my male classmates have ganged up on me during recess while I was in 3rd grade. Afterwards my sister got bullied because of my inability to fight for myself and because people thought I was weak. My parents made me do Karate but I always hated it because I was a small scrawny kid in the middle of either people 5+ years old or twice my age altogether and always got beat by everyone even so my parents forced me to go there. I've always hid my emotions since my 10th year of living. Ever since I saw a man die at a party I haven't cried,nor really felt angry or sad except for extreme situations. When I was 13 I had an anger outburst and let it out against my parents because they were the only one there and were really annoying me at the time since my grades went down that year and had to repeat it. they sent me to a mental hospital where I encountered other people who were about the same age as me all a few years older than me, all tried to kill themselves and that was basically the reason why they were there. at the time I wasn't really aware of how my mental health was actually a lot different than other people (because I always thought that everyone felt the same as I did and that everyone didn't feel any sadness or anger though it did feel strange whenever I would see my brother become angry because of a game and I was just there in the same game as him and felt like always) I saw there that people cried a lot and because of that , suicidal thoughts began to pop into my mind a lot . 3 months later when I got released I got back to school where I didn't know anyone because I had to change schools (I don't remember exactly why) and people began trying to talk to me, at first I was really scared because before the change, every time people talked to me at school or whenever I had any social interactions outside of my home was pretty negative ( at the old school even the teachers made fun of me ). But now that I'm out of there in university with the same group of friends I keep telling myself everything should be fine right? Why am I not happy? Everyday I have just been feeling an enourmous amount of anxiety everyday fearing what people might think of me or how I look or other days where I didnt care whatsoever. For some reason sometimes I just feel like I need to scratch myself and do it so hard and long that I end up literally scratching my skin off and bleeding which doesnt even hurt anymore. Since a week or so, I also have been feeling incredibly numb, like number than usual. I haven't been able to enjoy talking to my ""friends"", I have lost the joy I used to feel while playing video games and finally my last passion which was drawing at the time just dissapeared and it just feels frustrating and not rewarding .

161,"Never really thought I love had issues with MH. Certainly no diagnosis of mental health issues, but the last couple of weeks and particularly the last couple of days I feel like I could just , mentally, implode. 

I work in a high stress job. A new job, no less, with a reduction in pay. High monthly outgoings, colleagues who are complete shite. A manager who is wet behind the ears. A car which needs replacing, or a vast majority of its parts at the very least. Lack of personal time- because working. A lack of intimate time with the OH. Drinking more. Sleeping 5 hours a night at most.

For a while now I've felt like can't make real connections with people anymore, it's driving me mental, I can't continue like this.

 It's like when I talk nothing I want to say I can get out, or I think about talking to someone so much I get too scared to do it or I fuck it up.

Even more scary, recently I've been hearing things, far more than just occasionally. I feel like im constantly turning around because I think someone has called my name or because I hear a familiar voice of a person who just isn't there.

This sounds bizzare and mad, but sometimes I just feel like my thoughts are being listened to, or that im always being watched. I get so worried about what I'm thinking I have to shout ""stop stop stop"" to myself in my head.

164," 

(18m) About 5 months ago I was the happiest and healthiest I had ever been in my life enjoying new hobbies in a very good relationship with the love of my life eating really well while also going to the gym regularly. But 5 months ago my whole life crumbled I found out that my girlfriend had cheated on me with my best friend and had all of her friends lie to me for months just to cover there relationship up but everything just went downhill from there. I got diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia after i reached out for help at my nearest hospital they have put me on an ssri and a medication called risperidone but it hasnt done much for me at all. I attempted to commit suicide with those pills but woke up the next super ill and it really just made everything worse. I have panic attacks almost daily and have started smoking cigs to cope with it. My parents arent supportive and ive done almost everything on my own since i was 16. My biggest concern right now is i go days without eating and just drink water and i lost 10 pounds which doesnt sound like much but when your 145 pounds and 6ft tall then drop to 135 you can really see the difference (ribs) I have never done good in school and im not getting any credits this semester because i very rarely left my room for the past 4 months so im in a very bad spot with school. The only thing that has kept me from attempting again is my music i listen to (ruby and scrim)

Please if there is anyone here who has been through the same situation as me and has any advice please let me know i have no other ideas or outlets.

165,"I posted on Reddit mainly to talk about my issues. I knew shit was bad since I was young, I was so self-aware for a child and I remebumy teachers saying that I was like an old man. I have anxiety but in the recent years, I have been looking with my counsellors at BPD, I first  came across it on a forum and I felt like it instantly clicked with me. However, when I told my counsellor, he said that 'if you had it, you wouldn't believe it'. This hitbmy ego because I thought I was being like this for a reason. So it seems like something I truly believed in was a lie.  It sounds bad but I crave to self-harm. I've only done it too see the blood (I know it's weird but it's not for attention), I love drinking (if I could I would be an alcoholic). I don't feel anything at times, yet I still barely manage to be 'functional' in life. At work, I can done very well, better than others, but I am so disorganized (it can be seriously threatening to my credibility as it comes across as if I'm lazy), Soledays, I don't have the energy to wash (I'm not dirty just tired) and my emotions feel fake. After having a 'nice' convo with anyone, I get pissed off and think to myself about how I hate that person. I feel like I don't have friends. I have mood swings, enough for it to make me go for a Bipolar assesment, where they said I didn't. It feel like I'm being one giant bitchy little whiny teenager. It pisses me off sooo much. I wish I could self-harm or have the courage to kill myself. But now it seems like I'm doing it for attention.

I have a normal personality, I'm sociable, smart, but can't figure out what's wrong with me.
I fall in love deeply and I'm also very emotional. When something happens whether big or small. I can go from so angry that I'm ready to hurt someone, to crying my eyes out cause im so confused, then normally after that im extremely numb. No facial expressions, monotone, just emotionless. But this cycle can happen multiple times and normally I go through all those emotions within a 5-10 min period. Until I'm just so numb that I physically or mentally can't care about anything.

170,"Hey there...  Not sure where to begin... So I guess I just wil.

Recently found out I am suffering from CPTSD, after seeing a psychologist for the first time since I was 18. For reference, I am 30 now. At 16 I was diagnosed with major depression, or what is now called unipolar disorder.

Things have been quite a struggle, though I try my best to manage the day to day. I am a married mother of twin sons, who stays at home, and I do not drive, do to anxiety issues.

This leaves me fairly in the dark, as I have only two real friends, and both live in states quite far away. Besides that, they both are not the sort of friends who you can talk freely to...

It's just very lonely. I have little opportunity to make new friends, and even when I try, I feel like it's too late for me, or people just find me... Strange. It's quite pathetic, really. 

Also, quite difficult to want to invest in friendships , as I just don't want to beat myself up for saying an off comment, or sounding stupid.
