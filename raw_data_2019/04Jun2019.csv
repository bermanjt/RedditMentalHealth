1,"I will keep this short and simple since I'm not the greatest at writing/explaining. It is my hope that someone might have a similar experience or have seen it, so that they can offer me some advice how to help them. What could it be if someone is having outbursts of anger over the smallest things, then about 10-30 minutes later they are apologizing and remorseful, constantly worried about someone staring at them, sadness off and on throughout the day that even though it is on and off goes for weeks or months, and lastly admits to thinking about wanting to die/suicide chronically?

2,"I'm not an alcoholic myself but my dad was a drug addict, and my mom and oldest brother were alcoholics. I had a pretty rocky childhood and while I dont think about it often or how it affected me, I know we are products of our environment.

I feel on edge all the time, I'm suicidal and terrified of dying alone. I hate my life and myself. I dont know how to get better.

3,"I'm a law student. Maybe this post should be in there, but honestly I need support from people who are not in law school. Someone from the outside who can be subjective and unbiased to this environment.

The best way I know how to explain law school is that I don't feel good enough. I will never be satisfied with my accomplishments. I am constantly piled with work that I can never say ""done."" You know that feeling when you're in elementary school and you have homework, then you go home and play when you're finished? That's not how this feels. 

This profession, from what I observe, is so cut-throat. I am surrounded by people who are the top **15%** of my class and I'm a loser chillin in the top 40%. I just made two bad grades this semester while my other friends did great. What can I say? I am a **loser. I do not deserve to be where I am**. 

I drank a lot last semester, hung out with my boyfriend, and skimmed my assignments. I got so fed up of law school during the day that once classes were over I'd come home and do something else. Read, smoke, run, anything. So, four months of not prioritizing school and now my ranking is way lower.  I still have four semesters to bring it up but you get what I mean? MY piece of shit self let this happen to me. Nobody feels bad for me. I had every reason to do well. Health, financial stability, the natural intelligence, but whoops. I fucked that up. 

Now I feel like I'm worthless. Mainly cause this semester  I wasted my potential, and that as I go forward nobody will want to hire me. You know what I mean? Like I am going to have to put in monumental effort to do a job that still requires monumental effort. I see no good right now in my future. Only failures. I see my parents' disappointment, I see others passing me by, and I see me, with a J.D. degree with no jobs. I don't want this career for the money, I really do want to help people. But it seems like I can't even help my damn self. 

My boyfriend is way smarter than me. He is way more focused, determined. But he's not crazy about me, he just likes me a lot. Likes having me around. So my emotional needs are not met there.

I moved to this city last year and still have few friends. They are all gone for the summer anyhow. So I am alone, in a city where I don't know a lot of people, and I am a loser who made two bad grades and has every reason she could not have.

I noticed how I talked to myself in that message. pretty ugly right? Yeah sadly I am not kind to myself. Just can't think of a reason why I should be :/",04Jun2019,1
4,"My mind feels clustered. Semester ended today. Didn’t pass a class(Anatomy 1) that is considered to be the hardest of 2nd Semester. I watch my friends(3)  pasa Anatomy 1 and i feel like i was left behind.

Like if my effort wasn’t enough.

Today, I checked on a class I was totally expecting to pass(Organic Chemistry) and I didn’t pass it. 

I feel absent.

Now I have to repeat anatomy 1 which I really don’t mind but having the thought of having to repeat organic chemistry really is making me feel sad .

What’s the best way to deal with the feeling of being left behind? The feeling of being lesser? The feeling of not being enough?

5,"I (21 F) have had PNES (seizures caused by stress) since I was 15. Depression and anxiety since I was 10. When I started having seizures in highschool, I spent 4 days in the local hospital. (In which, doctors don't care that much) They monitored me and I had a seizure while in the hospital, which of course showed nothing abnormal on an EEG, and nothing came up on the MRI or CT scans. At that time I was diagnosed with PNES. As soon as my parents heard the word ""Pseudo"" they started telling me I was faking it all. Made things even worse. But, they took me out of school because I was a liability to the school, and they received SSI for me.

So, anyway, now I'm 21. I still have seizures. My PC Doctor prescribed me seizure medication (Topiramate), I take it with my depression and anxiety medications daily, but sometimes it seems my seizures break through when I'm in an extremely stressful situation, following an anxiety or panic attack. My doctor also referred me to a neurologist but that appointment is a year from now. And I'm now on my 3rd concussion within a year due to this. 

Guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had any luck getting SSI for PNES/Anxiety/Depression/PTSD and what tips you have in getting approved (other than gathering as much evidence as possible)?

TL;DR: Had seizures since 15, depression and anxiety way longer. All seems to be getting worse, now 21 and have PTSD on top of everything else. 3 concussions within a year due to seizures. Wondering about getting SSI for all of this, while I work towards improving and stabilizing my mental health.",04Jun2019,2
6,"Okay, this is sort of going to be a long post,,,
I live in a pretty well off household with my mom, my dad, and my older sister. Sometimes, I really don't want to go home. 

My mother constantly is making comments about my appearance, my room, and even interrupts me in the middle of talking just to comment about my appearance like my hair or my face. She would yell and scold about me for seemingly weird things (at a Girl Scout meeting, I put my head down on the table and she yelled at me in front of my troop leader on how that was apparently very rude and even when I began to cry she continued to yell at me. Keep in mind, the meeting didn't even start yet and no one was there except for me and my troop leader). No matter what I did I always seemed to disappoint her in some way or another, even to the point where I got yelled at for having a B in Math in the first quarter of a new school year. 

Another thing about my mom, she nitpicks through everything I say and latches onto that one thing and ignore everything else I'm trying to say and won't let me defend myself at all, even when she is in the wrong. I was venting to her about a math teacher and I just happened to use ""fricking"" in my rant (I was really frustrated). Her response was to completely ignore everything else I was trying to say and instead yell at me for saying fricking because ""it was close to a curse word"" and the situation was all my fault and I should try taking accountability for it. 

She sometimes slaps me or hits me when I try voicing my opinion. When I tried expressing myself and commenting on certain things (like how I didn't like this year's school yearbook design), she would always tell me ""stop being so negative/pessimistic"" even though I was giving valid information and providing evidence as to why I feel a certain way about something. She expects me to be positive and alright all the time and makes me feel like my emotions aren't even valid.

Okay, let me just say, I don't have the best eating habits, but I can't help it. I eat when I'm hungry like everyone else and sometimes I don't eat a lot and only end up having two meals a day with one or two snacks. My mom is just obsessed with me eating and would even threatened to choke me or shove food down my throat if I wouldn't eat when she wanted to. I don't have an eating disorder or anything like that and I do work out and am just a little bit underweight for someone my age. 

But the thing is, she acts like a complete and total angel in front of her friends and other people. 

My mother is well respected in the community, always involved in school activities, church, etc. She would always brag and compliment me in front of other people and just act like the mom of the year, understanding, postive, and willing to listen to everyone else's problems. She would always try to paint herself in a positive light as well in every single situation. When she gave her trampoline to her friends, she turned around and claimed to help them as ""an act of kindness for a needy family"" and uses the fact that their son has autism to gain people's respect. 

One time, my extra curricular group went to Atlanta, Georgia for a school trip for a couple of days. My mom volunteered to chaperone. My whole trip was just a living nightmare with her constantly trying to take over the group, dragging me around place to place, and even causing me to mentally break down I the middle of CNN Studios for threatening to punch me in the throat and force feed me when I only wanted fries for lunch that day. I cried every single day of the trip and I would've honestly rather been in school then to be there. She made all the kids and people around her annoyed on the trip and some even comforted me when they saw I was upset.

My Dad's not around that much, always working and sometimes I would only see him once or twice a week. My sister doesn't really talk to me that much, but she supports me a lot when my mom's not home.

Speaking of my sister, my mom is always bashing my sister as much as she does to me, sometimes even worst. According to my mom, she's mentally ill and takes ADHD meds, but my mom still is everyday insulting her, yelling at her, degrading her. But she uses my sister's illness around her friends as a way to gain sympathy and claims she's a mental health advocate.

This year, I went to a school counselor about my depressive thoughts and how I wanted to die and she talked to me before calling my mom. That day when I went home, my mom started to yell at me over the phone, saying when she gets home she's going to give me a peace of her mind. When she arrived, she yelled at me for going to the consuler and said the following:

""Everything you tell the counselor goes on public record and when universities and colleges look at it, they're going to think you're crazy and try to put you away somewhere.""

Needless to say, I'm still a bit paranoid around counselors and other adults I talk to about my mental health problems. 


Is it just me and my teenage hormones or is my situation a bit out of control.",04Jun2019,1
7,"Ever since I was a little girl I’ve had an aversion to certain types of carpets/rugs. or This included anything that had carpet-like features, such as blankets, towels, furniture, toys and clothing. Not all of them, only the really really ruggy types. You know, the ones that are fluffy, wormy, stringy, clustered, or have a nasty color (orange/green). I’m not sure why this repulsed me, but for some odd reason I could never make direct contact with it. The thought is nauseating.
For years my family taunted and shamed me for this, but they could never make me touch it. Summers spent at my grandmother’s house was the worse because her carpet gave me nightmares. It was streaked orange and black and looked like tangled ocean waves. During those long hot months, my feet were imprisoned by hard sole shoes that I never removed, not even to bathe or sleep. You can imagine how bad my feet smelled at the end of summer, and this lasted for years.
Visiting people at their homes was also a challenge for me, especially when the owner required you to remove your shoes at the door. My first thought was always about the type of carpet they had. As a child, I couldn’t question this, but I could stand awkwardly by the door or wait in the kitchen until our visit was over. Fortunately for me, I grew up in a home with hardwood floors or extremely flat and un-textured carpet. For that I am truly grateful. 
Years went by and everyone thought it was a phase I would grow out of, but it wasn’t. It followed me to adulthood. In fact, my carpet aversion grew into an affliction that I suffer from everyday. Every environmental decision that I make is based off this one thing. Whenever possible, I avoid working,dining, vacationing, or living in an environment that houses my aversion. Avoiding this was never as easy as it sounded. 
My affliction turned into an obsession and not even the soles of my shoes could protect me from it. I could always feel every textured fiber as if I were walking on the carpet barefoot. I would never rent a home, stay in a hotel, or visit friends/family without asking about the carpet first. Fortunately my husband and kids have gotten better at recognizing my carpet preferences, but not always.
For years I have avoided living under such circumstances, but one year it was unavoidable. Despite my constant plea to stay in the home I had grown attached to, my husband chose to move our family into a home with “that carpet.” It’s tan and unruly fibers didn’t make a good first impression. To make matters worse, it was new, a virgin in my eyes, which meant it was extra fluffy because it had barely seen any foot traffic. I thought to myself “How could I possibly live here?” 
We moved in and I cried for weeks. I never took off my shoes and I slept downstairs in the living room because that was the only area in the house that didn’t have carpet. When I had to take the brave walk upstairs, I stood on books and used them to slide across the high parts of the carpet. My husband didn’t understand my pain, but he consoled me anyway. This lasted for a few months, and after the carpet was broken in (flatten down) I discarded the books, but NEVER my shoes. 
Fast forward to today and we are still living here, but hopefully not for much longer. Just recently my husband rearranged the room and it feels like move-in day all over again. Areas of the carpet that have been living underneath our furniture for months are now exposed and the virgin fibers have returned. It’s worse than before because now the entire carpet in my room is uneven. 
My nightmares have returned and all I see are flat parts, high parts, dark parts, and light parts. It’s not just the sight of it, but I can literally feel the carpet’s presence. My husband has the flat side and I have the high side, so if I have to pee at night, I have to crawl over him, locate my shoes in the dark, and slide them on before running across the room. It’s a painful process and I can’t afford to make any mistakes. Night after night, I lie in bed and try to close my eyes but I can sense it and it makes my skin crawl. My carpet won’t let me sleep.",04Jun2019,1
8,"If I do not do everything right, I begin to feel a since of worthlessness and at times I have short bouts of depression. I make detailed plans each day on what my schedule will be the next day in order to make sure I do everything right and avoid this feeling. This makes me very socially awkward and at times causes me to embarrass myself. 

On the other hand, I do not expect others to be capable of menial tasks. I do a lot of things myself. I’m just worried they’ll do it completely wrong. No matter who they are.

12,"Tw: sex, anxiety 

On April 11 I lost my virginity. I had been on the pill for two years, used a condom, and took the morning after pill the next day just to be sure. 5 days later I started bleeding, then I got my period two weeks later. My last period was May 28 even though it only lasted 3 days. Back in April I took five pregnancy tests that were all negative and this past weekend I took 3 more that were also negative. I went to the gynecologist and she examined me. I told her about this paranoia. When she examined me all she saw was that it looked like I’d get my period soon and a week later I got it. I’m super anxious because the other day my mom asked me if I was still a virgin and I lied and said no. The remote possibility of being pregnant is would completely ruin my life right now because I’m too young and still need to graduate college.

13,"for a while a few months ago i started having, what i could only describe as ‘flashbacks’. using that term loosely because these ‘flashbacks’ never showed me a memory that has actually happened. most of the time it would just be nonsense, after a week of that i started writing down the time, where i was/what i was doing, and what the content of the flashback was as best i could describe. I had been talking about it with my therapist and she said it was most likely just a  dissociative state. that didn’t sound right to me but she IS the therapist so i assumes that was right. they grew to happening multiple times a day (although these ‘flashbacks’ never lasted more than 1 minute) and then sort of faded off into nothing. they stopped happening. until this week, and they are worse than ever. when i feel it coming on it throws me into what i think? is a panic attack? i feel so sick that i have to vomit but i never do. the flashbacks are now accompanied by smells, but they still make as little sense as they did before. they are keeping me awake as they are pretty often through out the day. it’s so bad that when it’s happening i think about doing bad things to myself just to get it to stop. can anyone help me identify what this could be !! i will be bringing it up with my therapist but that’s quite a while a way and i’m afraid of what will happen between then . thank you all in advance !!",04Jun2019,2

15,"Hello everyone!

I was wondering how all you guys started off with anti-depressant? How long did it take to experience side effects? And how did you felt after starting taking them?

I’m barely on my second day and I feel great. It feel like a dark cloud has been lifted from my shoulder!",04Jun2019,5
16,"This is really um like dark so if you cant handle that I recommend not reading. And I'm sorry in advanced and sorry if I'm in the wrong sub.

This is just a throw away account but this has been eating away at me and I just need something to calm my thoughts even just alittle. This is going to be a long vent/me trying to find any clue whats wrong or if im acting normal about everything? In a sense.

To just start into what I know is that I have a impulsivity disorder, ADHD, and apparently a form of autism. My therapist has told me he thinks I might have a some depression and anxiety, albeit I see him only about every 3 months and I truefuly don't tell him everything or most things and im not really sure why I do it.
My mom is one of the things causing me stress with things such as blaming me for everything, yelling at me for ""antagonizing her,"" and not telling me anything important let alone talking to me. It was three years after I was diagnosed and never told did she casually say to my face that I have a form of autism. She ""didnt care to tell me"" and thought i would ""just figure it out."" And things such as us nearly about to be homeless and never telling me.
In a sense its like im getting a werid deja vu or like historys reapting or that it will. Albeit I have alot of blank patches in my memory but its things like this. Losing a house again and being homeless. My parents divorce and no my mom with her very we'll say gross boyfriend. My aunt passing away and my grandma getting very close (two of the four people I ever really fully like trusted. Missing memorys with my aunt are things like visting her in the hospital before she passed away, or that she became obese at somepoint.) And its werid. Its scary I'm scared. Its like a growing fear that its going to happen again or something?

A another thing happening is that my ex who in the past had been toxic and I get that. When we where dating she I could tell that she wanted to soon after break up. She slowly stopped talking to me or ending conversations short. Only coming to me for very bad news or to vent. It later came to her talking to me that ""she likes me still but also like someone else"" Is said more or less maybe we could work something out untill she said ""theyre dating someone else."" It had gotten so toxic that I had started to cut. I was so scared that she hates me or that im doing something wrong that im in the wrong. After we broke up I felt numb in a sense which is normal and I stopped cutting. But she started talking me again. Alot but only about negative stuff like before. This than bleed into her eventually dating the aforementioned person and telling me about either them or very negative stuff. And than I started to cut again. But soon she moved schools and with help of a friend I manged to get her to stop talking to me which I felt horrible about. I knew she had bad depression and anxiety but I could handle anymore I broke down and I cut ties. 
But just today I got a text from her. It scared me so bad in a way I cant describe other than I feel sick. I locked myself in a room out of fear and of what I don't really know. I refuse to get out of bed because I know something like... This could set off my impulsivity and I dont want to do anything dumb (during out dating I did have a impulse attempt at suicide.)

And all of that leads me to this. Fear. I've had so much in so many ways and I don't understand it. Fear of history reapting. Fear of something horrible and illogical to happen. Like if im walking outside for a car to swurve into me or something like that. And I need answers or something to start with. Its eating at me and I just need something to grip onto.

Im sorry if this is like alot or if I'm in the the wrong sub but I just couldn't stand it anymore. I need something.",04Jun2019,1

Sometimes I'll think ""wouldn't it be nice to..."" and I get really mad at myself. I'll catch myself thinking that I like or care for something and then get mad at myself for it.

Example being, if I mess up I’ll think “god damn it why the fuck did I do that I’m so fucking dumb” or something along the lines.  And then another part of my brain is like “no shut up it’s not that bad chill out” and it really feels like I’m fighting against myself in recovery",04Jun2019,3

They are basically things I have to do or bad things are going to happen.

I'm not looking for a diagnoses obviously lol, but I'm poor as hell and can't really afford to see anyone about this atm, so im basically asking if this is a common-ish thing or is it something I should have checked out?

I've done some research and these thoughts seem to be common with people with OCD, but i don't really wanna get ahead of myself.

30,"I kinda want to know if this happens to anyone else. I’m literally subconsciously being a dick to other people and I want to make it stop. 

Throughout my life I’ve suspected that I have been doing something to make people react to me negatively for seemingly no reason. I thought it was because I am generally introverted and aloof. I literally can’t be bothered and don’t want to be bothered by most people, so I’m usually quiet and (way too) lost in my own thoughts.

A few years ago, a guy who I hated (but never consciously did anything to express it), said that he felt that I am always silently judging him. And I was. He’s was a loud, brown-nosing asshole who thought he knew everything, and who took ever opportunity to bring up the fact that he went to an Ivy League school. And whenever he spoke, I would just look at him and think what a cunt. 

Today I realized what the problem is: I stare at people and critique them mentally in a way that makes them anxious to know what I’m thinking about them.

I was on the train today, completely lost in thought about a personal problem that I have. While my brain was preoccupied with that, my eyes were like: “yes! Time to examine the lady across from you and stare at everything you find unacceptable about her.” 

I didn’t realize what I had been doing until as I was getting off the train she said to me: “you really need to put some lotion on your feet.” 

I just smiled and nodded, but I thought: what the fuck? Bitch mind your own business. I already know that and chose not to lotion because I was in a rush.

I then realized that she probably said that because she wanted to “take me down a peg.” And she wanted to do that because of all the fucking judgmental staring I had been doing for half an hour. 

I’m now thinking I need to wear sunglasses in public at all times.  

[I also do this when it’s something I really like about the person’s appearance — this probably creates more of a creepy effect as opposed to judgmental. Either way, I need control over my eyes.]

Does this happen to anyone else? Theories on why I have no control over my eyes when I’m lost in thought?

Im stuck on what to do, how to break the cycle. Im now thinking of going to the doctors to and try and get anti depressants or anti anxiety pills or something but not sure if I should or not. I dont want to become dependant on medication but would it be a good short term solution?

32,"I am a 45 year-old man and I have struggled to regulate my moods/emotions and anxiety for most of my life. An inability to control my anger/mood swings has been a big issue for many years. I’ve never physically assaulted another person, but I sometimes get angry enough to say inappropriate things at work, or threaten to quit my job. At home, I’ll find myself yelling at no one (out of anger) and will occasionally get angry enough that I’ll destroy an item (such as a computer mouse) or punch a hole in the wall. 

Drugs have played a big role these past 15 years or so. After a back injury in 2004, I began taking hydrocodone 10-325 on a daily basis for pain. After a few months, I started taking a half dose (once a day), which has served me well. There were still days when I’d take a full dose but I can count them on two hands. 

During this time, I was having trouble sleeping and got my dr. to prescribe zolpidem (ambien). I’ve been able to get off the ambien once or twice in the past but never got more than a few days. Without it, I absolutely cannot sleep. 

Somewhere else along the way, I started taking a 1mg dose of Xanax as needed. “As needed” was supposed to be for when I’m flying but I found that, especially when couple with the Vicodin and Ambien, I could take it for recreational effects. It could make for a nice high but i was increasingly moody, erratic and out of sorts. 

About two years ago, I began smoking marijuana on a regular basis. (It is legal in my state.) At first, I was smoking on weekends, then  it became an every night thing. Most weeks, I tell myself I won’t smoke M-Th but I almost always end up succumbing to it. 

The pot seems to make me much easier to be around. I don’t blow up at myself or other people even a tenth as much as I do when I’m not stoned. But it also leaves me in a fog for much of the next day, and I feel much less intelligent when I’m smoking marijuana. The one good thing that I’ll say about my marijuana smoking is that I almost never do it in conjunction with taking Xanax (my Xanax usage has decreased by about 80%) and it has also enabled me to almost completely quit taking the Vicodin (I now take a total of about to bike it in pills every 40 days versus taking a half pill every day like I used to). Huge victory. 

But last night, I smoked weed for an extended period of time… for like six hours. Now, no matter how much pot I smoke I find that I do not sleep well. I can get to sleep very very easily, but I wake up in the morning not feeling rested. What I have since learned is that chronic marijuana usage in Hibbetts your brains ability to enter that deepest level of REM sleep, which makes a lot of sense given how I wake up feeling most days.

So last night, after smoking, I took a Xanax in addition to my Ambien. I woke up this morning, having slept eight straight hours, and felt well-rested. Drink my coffee in the morning, had a nice lunch around noon, and got some work done. But at around 2:30 PM, I noticed that I was in a really foul mood. With a meeting coming up at 3 PM and not wanting my mood to get the better of me, I took another half of a Xanax. In retrospect, I think I was experiencing with drawl symptoms from the Xanax that I had taken last night. Taking the additional half a tablet seem to level me out pretty quickly.

So now, I’m here laying in bed, debating whether or not I should go smoke a joint out of my front porch. It would be nice to break the fog (as I have been smoking every night for two weeks now without a break) but I also think it’s going to be difficult for me to sleep without smoking. Similarly, I’m wondering if I’m going to wake up in the morning again feeling like I need to take a Xanax to level out.

I know that this has been long and rambling and probably to many of you kind of pointless. But I guess I’m hoping to hear from other people who have struggled or overcome situations like mine. I’m not sure if any of what I’ve written above qualifies as a true, hard-core addiction, but I’m tired of Having all of the stuff in my system. At the same time, I know that when I’m not on anything (pot, painkillers, Ambien, Xanax) my anxiety and my anger are at near uncontrollable levels, and I hate never knowing when I’m going to freak out about something.

Anyway, I’m wondering if any other redditors have experienced circumstances such as mine, or can suggest alternatives for keeping my anger and anxiety at controllable levels when I am not otherwise “medicated.”

Any help/advice would be very much appreciated. I’m at a very low point in my life and not sure how to break the cycle.",04Jun2019,2
33,"My question:  I know normal people experience Lithium withdrawal coming off lithium, but I feel I'm more sensitive to it?

As little as 5mg of elemental lithium will induce a noticeable lithium withdrawal when it wears off. Like a hair-tangle in my emotional state, disconnected from the present.

36,"Some context: I (22F) am temporarily living with my mother (47F) and stepfather (63F) for a few months. I have not lived with them for 3 years because I moved in with my fiancé while we were in college. We graduated a few weeks ago. We’re in between places right now so I moved back home to save some money. 

I was officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 3.5 years ago, but for personal reasons stopped taking the meds about a year ago. Being back home has taken a toll on my mental health. I’m having trouble finding a job, and my parents are quite unhappy about it. Today I was having a pretty bad day and vented to my mom about some little things. She jumped down my throat and told me to “just cheer up. It’s not a big deal.” Which made me feel pretty guilty. She later came to me to talk about why I was upset, which is where it got complicated. I told her that when I’m extra depressed, saying things like “it’s not that bad” or “just cheer up” can be quite damaging for me, as it makes me feel extreme guilt. She said “okay. I just wish you’d be more positive. Maybe go outside more. We just don’t understand why you sit inside all day.” I tried to explain to her that it isn’t completely by choice and that something as simple as going outside it’s not always simple. She just didn’t understand. I’m not sure they want to listen to me about it. I believe they think I’m lazy. So, how can I help them to understand that I’m still a work in progress?

38,"
Sorry if this kind of long and if it's formatted bad. I am on mobile.

So I basically just don't know if there is any sort of medical condition of what I have been experiencing for about 5 years or more. I don't really like to go on Google about mental conditions because I feel like I will falsely assume I am this or that so I don't do that stuff. So I am just going to explain my mental state for the past multiple years and want to see if any condition relates to it or if I can just fix it. Or if it's just part of growing up.

Well it all started my freshman year of high school. Before then I was a pretty social kid and always wanted to hangout with my friends all the time and I mean I guess like I would assume most middle school kids but we're excited about the future.

So my freshman year of high school my dad shot himself. I was home, so was my mom and my brother. My dad had threatened it a couple times before and I had to run out of the house one time and pull him back in because he was going to go into the woods and do it, I had to go into his room and cry on him for an hour for him to give me the gun. He then bought another after promising me he wouldn't shoot himself, and then he did. While my my brother and my mom were basically watching. 

Well, I never really talked about this until my sophomore year of college. After my dad did that I just went like dead. As in, no longer wanting to go outside, school, have friends, do anything. Which I assume is a normal reaction, but that's not the end of it. Well, I kind of fell into a hole basically because I had never talked to anyone about what happened. I pushed all of my emotions behind a barrier and didn't feel happiness, sadness, sorrow, nothing for years. It was about until my sophomore year of college when that changed. My universities quarterback shot himself and then a few days after that I had a terrible dream about me stopping someone I have been very close to in my life from shooting themselves.

So I went to counseling for a semester and it helped with the situation of my dad but not like.... For me as a person. Ever since my dad shot himself I have never felt welcomed anywhere, even in my own friend group. I just don't really see the point in anything. I used to love playing video games, now I get on and then get bored after a couple minutes and then just play to pass the time. I watch Netflix but don't enjoy it and just watch it to pass the time. Basically since my freshman year of high school I have just been living life trying to find ways to pass the time.

I see no endgame in anything. Except for some days, some days, which is not often I will be like excited to do something, or it might even go on for a couple days. I feel good but then it goes right back to nothing. I feel like I can't trust anyone. Even though I have friends I do not feel like I do.

I guess I should mention that I am currently about to be a senior in college and I am currently 21. 

I never ask my friends to hangout because even when we do I just don't enjoy it. I'm just there. Basically no matter what I do I am just there, like a body. 

I don't really put input into conversations because I feel like my input is basically worthless and that it doesn't matter what I say. 

Right now I am not even sure if I want a wife or a girlfriend or anything because I highly doubt I will be able to make her happy or put any positive light into her life. 

About a month ago I took shrooms, and I had what the psychedelic community calls an ""ego death"". Basically forgetting who you are and everything you know about yourself. When I went through it I forgot what I was and who I was and at that moment in time I was only an observer of this Earth. But that is how I've felt for many, many years. 

Yes. I have had thoughts of dying but none have been real thoughts, thoughts I would ever act on. It's just kind of casual thoughts, it's weird. I know how much pain my dad caused my family and I would never do that towards anyone.

Even when I went to college I told myself it would be a fresh start and I can change myself because I wasn't happy with who I was, but that didn't change much. Yes, the environment changed and I joined a frat and hung out with people more but it never changed how I truly felt. The only times it seems like that I can truly be happy or want to do stuff is when I am drunk. And that is a very dangerous path and one I have been very cautious of. 

So, I just don't really know what has been going on with me all this time and I don't know what to label it",04Jun2019,1

45,"Hi all.  I'm not sure how to present this properly.  It's very involved and I don't want to be too wordy though it will probably be unavoidable.

Just let me start off by saying I am very functional.  I don't hear any voices now.  I don't have any ""delusions"" per se other than believing that I experienced some things.  I mostly leave what I experienced as ""unexplained"" and have accepted that maybe not all things in the universe can be answered.  That said this weighs heavily on me at times.

Over my life I have had psychic dreams. A few really ""big"" ones.  A lot of small ones.  I ""awoke"" to this fact around age 23 when a major one occurred.  Two months previous to this I experienced hearing ""voices"" for the first time.  The voice was of like a man telling me things which would happen to me in the future.  I took it very badly and was worried.  Considered that I had a mental health problem or that something else very bad was going on but just ended up going to sleep and forgetting about it (this is a common pattern with me).

So I had this dream and it shook my world as the world around me was also being shaken.  I did not know how to handle or take it so stayed secretive about it.  A month or two later I discovered a person was posting online where I had been posting.  They appeared about the time when I first heard the voice.  I found that this person was talking about very bizarre things.  They were speaking of psychic things, telepathy, even bending time.   There was also a post from them at least a month before the major event I had seen in a dream -- they too predicted the event.  They said they were there looking for someone - another psychic.  Because of my then beliefs and all that happened I was VERY distrustful of them.  In fact, I suspected they could be the devil themselves (I know how this sounds! believe me!)  But regardless I made contact with them and told them of my dream and explained I did not understand what was occurring.  They shocked me with some of their knowledge but were mysterious.  They said a lot but loved to speak in riddles and symbolic type words.  I still never trusted them fully but saw them as a source of potential knowledge.  We spoke in private more but more often then not they just posted things in public in a vague way which I was left to interpret.  At one point they speak of teaching me something.  Shortly after they basically convince me that I was possessed (but without outright suggesting it).  I believed this and was to the point where I was planning on driving to a church a few hours away known for exorcisms.  When I was very near leaving someone started posting stories about people all over the world committing mass murders and just snapping.  They started posting it in a countdown type form with a number in the subject and then the next number in the next counting down.  I interpreted this as a threat.  In my mind I believed that these instances were actually people going through what I had and that they were possessed.  That I was being threatened that if I attempted to go to the church there I would never make it and that I would ""snap"" and kill people.  This was terrifying for me and absolute rock bottom.

But then I remembered some of their advice as well as others:  that focusing on evil gives it power.  That to an extent what I believe comes true.  I then basically dismissed it all.  That I was not possessed.  I walked into it and just sat there that night and my spirituality radically changed.  You might call this an awakening experience.  I became extremely spiritual.  I removed lots of negative things from my life and made radical changes.  For the next year or so I would say that to some degree I was euphoric -- though completely functional.

Though the person was mysterious and though I still never fully trusted them, I began to see them more as a friend.  We never made private contact again but they continued posting their mysterious messages at the public place for at least another year.  They had a way of reaching into mind that is hard to explain.  They did this during the whole time when they were posting.  Basically what they posted had an effect on me.  There were usually multiple ways to interpret it.  My mental state during all this was very rough as a whole new world was opening up and I was confused.  In many cases I feel that they prevented me from hurting people around me.  In other cases I feel they didn't do enough and were somewhat malicious.  Eventually I lost contact with them as they quit posting in the public place.  Over time I learned to read them and take in what they said without giving them this sort of power they had over me.

About six years later when I went through a tough period someone very like them in some ways suddenly appeared and made contact with me.  They have the same mannerisms in some ways but are very different.  They helped me a lot but over the years turned very bizarre.  I at first suspected this was the same person using a different identity but honestly cannot be sure of that.

So this is bizarre enough already so I will leave out a lot.  And there is much I am leaving out.  I will just say that my family has a big history of bi-polar and schizophrenia.  

As I said from the start, despite what you probably think now I am fully functional and don't think I believe in any delusions -- though I freely acknowledge that during the time around when I thought I was possessed I probably was experiencing psychosis of some sort.  But we are talking over 15 years ago and it might not have been the cause but rather the reaction to the extreme things I experienced.

My position is that I have these dreams sometimes of things before they happen.  For the most part I do not control it.  It just happens.  I do not know exactly the cause or the purpose, though I have multiple theories.  Regarding my past experiences, I accept that I may have misinterpreted some things and perhaps had some delusions.  But I don't see my interactions with the others as a delusion.  It is very apparent that they were real enough to post messages to me.  I don't know their true purpose or who or what they were or are.  Only that it happened.  So, again, I'm not thinking I am Jesus or the devil, possessed, or something here.  I'm just saying that I had some past experiences and they are unexplained.  That they tie heavily into my life.

So now my questions:  should I seek a psychologist?  How do I approach them about this?  How do I make it clear that despite the bizarre background I'm not really currently hearing voices, believing I am possessed, or having strange delusions.  What about the dream thing?  I mean technically it is possible to coincidentally have a dream before something happened.  I don't personally believe all this stuff is a coincidence but I acknowledge it as a possibility and that it is still under the realm of scientific possibility.  There is a lot of ""baggage"" with the whole psychic label that I feel many just do not understand either for lack of experience.

I am thinking that I should seek out a psychologist as a grounding influence and as ""insurance"" so that I have a support structure in place if I do find my mental health slipping.  I am worried about possible future life events having a negative effect on me and sending me over the edge so to speak.  For different reasons I do suspect that I might be bipolar I but mainly with euphoric type mania.  For me depression is very rare.  It did happen in the distant past where it was severe but was very fleeting, disappearing the next morning. I have read that if untreated this tends to get worse with age and that concerns me.

Thanks for reading all this.  I apologize for the length.  It's very hard to convey my experience and my current frame of mind as there is a lot and this medium is rather limited.",04Jun2019,1
46,"I know self-diagnosis is bad, but I think I have ADHD. However, I'm hesitant about getting a real diagnosis because I'm afraid that if it's true, the best treatment is probably meds, and I'm not sure I want them.

Here's why I think I have ADHD: 
As a kid, I simultaneously thrived and struggled in school. I actually had to be pulled out of 1st grade and homeschooled for 1.5 years because school made me anxious and that made me disruptive and I ended up punching the principal. I went back to school in 3rd grade and was put in the gifted and talented program which I really thrived in because it was hands-on learning instead of listening to lectures. In middle school I struggled again, failing most of my classes, because I didnt have the self-discipline once I lost the hand-holding of elementary school. In high school I got put in a small school and thrived again due to one on one attention. I went on to graduate college and law school, however, I feel like it was a fluke. I don't say that to be humble, but because I don't feel like I did the work. I didn't/don't know how to study, but things seemed to come easier to me than to my peers and I got average grades with little effort. I thought a lot about how I could probably get excellent grades if I applied myself, but never could find the motivation to do so. Now I'm an adult in a career, and I feel very overwhelmed. I never learned time management. I cant do basic administrative tasks. I am great at my job when my job is talking to people or high adrenaline and handling crisis, but am drowning in the paperwork and administrative side of it. I also get this feeling, and always have, that I have always just described as a ""restlessness in my own skin."" It literally feels like I can't physically stand being in my own body. When it gets really bad, I start pacing and getting really agitated and sometimes do dumb, reckless things. Lately I've also been feeling like I can't control my own impulses. Like my brain will say no to something and my body will do it anyway. I also have been noticing that I frequently tune in and out of conversations, but manage to act like I heard everything the other person said. 

All of that leads me to believe ADHD is likely. However, I'm scared of medication for a couple reasons. The first is because I spent most of my childhood on antidepressants (starting around the time I was kicked out of elementary school) that made me suicidal, but when I told my doctor I felt that way, he just upped my dose. It wasn't until I took myself off them in high school that I realized they were causing those feelings. Also, the withdrawal was awful. So I've had an aversion to psych meds ever since. 
The second reason is because I know ADHD medication is intensely addictive and that just scares me a lot.

So anyway, that's where I'm at. I'm exploring the idea of seeking a real diagnosis, but don't really want meds, and I'm not sure that's worth the cost of the appointment.",04Jun2019,1

I had some struggles with Schizophrenia anxiety over the past few months. I am visited a Psychiatrist, A therapist specializing in Psychosis, a Clinical Psychologist and Counselor with experience with dealing with schizophrenics who said I do not have Schizophrenia, should I be ok?

I still feel anxious about it however, the fear being I never know when it will pop up. I keep asking in my head ""Am I hearing voices in my head?"". The worst it got to a point was then I started to imagine voices in my head, but I knew it was my imagination. Like it's happening again, where I am using my inner monologue voice and putting in under different pitches to imagine voices, but I have noticed this only happens when I think about it, which leads to the anxious state. When I don't think about it, I don't get these thoughts. My psychiatrist mentioned I had a good level of insight. I am also starting a full time job right out of college for the first time, so I feel a bit nervous about that. Not hearing voices, not seeing things, no negative affects, heck, I did over 9 job interviews in the month of May and landed a job.

I find that the least depressed people I know (or not depressed?) Have no idea what depression is, or anxiety etc. However people who know a lot about depression and/or helped a friend through it are themselves mentally worse off than what they were before. 

I know mental health shouldnt be avoided, and I know not telling anyone is the worst thing possible, but would it be reasonable for me to tell someone specifically to not look into mental health or TV shows /movies related to it (I.e 13 reasons why).

Constantly trying to find random things that could tell me if I am. Like buying the last bag of Doritos. What if someone else wanted those??? Someone way more deserving of a bag. And when I think like this it makes me think about how maybe I'm just thinking this way because I know this how a nonnarcissitic person thinks. Maybe I'm so much of a narcissist that I'm even lying to myself. 
Sometimes I let it affect my relationship with others. Whether I text too much, ask too many questions, wondering if I do enough for them. 
I keep letting this make me think I'm a bad person no matter what I do or how hard I try to not be. Just makes me think ""oh you're just doing this to make yourself feel better."" Maybe I'm just thinking all this to make myself feel bad for myself, or to make others feel bad.
The more I complain about this the more I feel like I'm doing it to get attention, or sympathy. And I think ""that's exactly what a narcissist would do"" so it's a never ending battle and it's driving me insane. My friend keeps telling me he doesn't think a narcissist would worry this much about being one but I don't know maybe I tricked him into saying that some how.",04Jun2019,1
52,"I have a medical condition that prevents me from breathing right through the nose. This causes extreme irritation of those around me and myself, snoring, and worst of all, completely ineffective sleep. When I wake up from sleeping 8 hours, it's as if I didn't sleep.

55,"I've been with my gf for the past 6+ months now. We first met mid-late fall semester. It started out great. We went on dates, hung out together at my place, etc. Soon enough we started having sex, and it was AMAZING. Christmas break was similar we lived just 30 mins apart so we still saw each other often. Now at this point I'm aware of her condition. She expressed worry that I'd leave her eventually because she'd push me away through her mood swings. I knew she loved me too, and she wanted something longterm and o want to give that to her. It's the summer now and her mental state has really been declining. I feel like the ""butterflies"" of a new relationship have worn off for her and now she wants to become this husk. From what I've learned about her past is that her parents have really allowed her to get to this point. Being strict, unreasonable, and offensive. Idk what to really do. I'm there for her and I'm always talking to her. She has a therapist she sees, but shes skipped a lot of appointments. I just do t want her to suffer anymore.

57,"Hi I'm a 13 year old suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. Now before you go saying ur a teen what do you have to be depressed about I'll give u my entire story of what lead up to making this post.

I was born into a poor family where one of my older brothers were in and out of jail through out the younger years of my life. My dad was addicted to crack and would pawn our stuff, use money for rent on crack, and even physically and mentally abuse my mom. I didn't realize or know any of this other my brother coming in and out of jail until I was 3 and my mom had to explain to me in the nicest way possible that my brother had to steal bread from our local Walmart so we could eat, and that our lights were gonna be off for a while. What do you fucking know, my dad used his ENTIRE FUCKING INCOME TAX on crack and left us with 20 dollars while he spent 7 thousand on crack. fast forward 6 days he's back from smoking crack for 6 days straight and decided to start an argument with my mom, it escalated quickly and it ended with my mom being choked by my dad. My older brother got involved and a huge fight between the two broke out which lead to my older brother getting a shotgun and shooting off part of his left shoulder blade. I don't remember much after that other than seeing my dad in the hospital and brother in prison. We finally moved out of the house we were staying at where that shit show happened and I thought all was well. Well it wasn't and fast forward 3 years my parents got into a huge argument which ended up with me and my older brother (not the one who shot my dad) being sent to live with my grandparents. It was nearly a year separated from our parents with 2 people we hardly know. Let's fast forward cause I don't wanna talk about that stuff. So 3 years later I'm 9 years old and we're living in a apartment where we were at least somewhat in a decent spot, well I was wrong. One day I wake up and my mom is off her ass drunk and her breath reeks of booze and weed, I decide I can't deal with that today so I spend the day at a friend's house and what do you know the reason for my mom getting fucked up is cause my dad pawned a bunch of shit and used all the money on crack, idk what happened cause I was watching a movie at said friends house but apparently my mom and dad got into an argument and my dad punched my mom giving her a black eye and in return my mom went into a rage with a knife and almost killed my dad hahahaha so fun to hear. My dad escapes through a window or some bullshit and eventually comes back later while my mom isn't there but can you guess where she is. Coming to my friends house while drunk and beaten to say some bullshit which completely killed my mood and embarrassed me. So let's fast forward to what lead up to this post my mom and dad were expecting our income tax to come in only to learn that this dead beat mother fucker decided to redirect the mail and go and fucking use all the tax return and you know wtf is the worst part? He left us with 20 dollars and no food in the house and we had to call a fucking homeless shelter to come pick us up. And that's the entire story and why I deal with depression and suicidal thoughts.",04Jun2019,3

59,"Tl;dr is the definition of empathy with regards to how we act, feel and/or think?

I have, what I think at least is, a rather narrow emotional spectrum. I don't get angry, irritated or stressed easily if at all. Same thing goes for happiness and other positive emotions. Doesn't mean I'm depressed, I think I have a relatively positive outlook on life despite all things considered.

What does concern me is how certain things (think liveleak) and some of my own actions don't effect or disrupt me whatsoever. If i see, for example, footage of a nasty shooting or something unpleasant on the news, of course I _think_ ""well that kind of sucks"" but I don't _feel_ anything.

With regards to I act, sometimes I say unpleasant things before thinking ""hmm, maybe I shouldn't have said that."". 

One more blatant example would be when I was in primary school, sitting on a bench on the tarmac playground. A classmate was running around the playground when I stuck my foot out just to see what would happen. He tripped and scraped himself something nasty. The teachers came, but I guess luckily for me, nobody noticed it was me who tripped him. I did think after the fact ""maybe i shouldn't have done that..."" but i recall not feeling anything.

Nower days of course I don't do anything like that,  and I'm much nicer to my classmates. But I still get tempted to, for example, push someone who's leaning on the rails of a ferry just to see what would happen. I don't enjoy the prospect of physical harm or death, it's out of curiosity more than anything.

I guess what I want to know is what the nature of empathy is. I wouldn't say I act like a shitty person (the vast majority of the time...), I try to be considerate of other people and I like to act selflessly. It's just that I don't feel anything when witnessing, thinking about or (un)intentionally causing pain/displeasure or death (no, I haven't killed anyone or hurt anyone that badly. Sorry about tripping you up Dylan, I guess). Is empathy about how one acts, feels or thinks?",04Jun2019,1

As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I had far too much than what I should have &amp; ended up having crazy anxiety &amp; panic attack. Previous to this I had never had an panic attack nor severe anxiety besides public speaking &amp; scary situations.

The panic attack caused major derealization/depersonalization and kind of permanently increased these feelings long after especially an increase of anxiety which is weird because I felt like I had a very normal relationship with it before hand.

I tried marijuana two more times after it, the first time it gave me mild derealization &amp; anxiety so I stopped &amp; the second time another panic attack so Ive decided to begin living a full sober life. 

Im more so just posting to find out what caused these &amp; will they happen again sometime soon?, when I was walking out of work a few days ago I started feeling derealization &amp; anxiety out of no where.

65,"recently i’ve been dissociating a lot more than usual, and it’s getting kind of different. 


i used to just space out, and loose my thought, now it’s getting to the point where when i’m dissociated i zone out for awhile, and forget i was talking to someone/doing something, and move on to something else or change conversation. the dissociation doesn’t last too long, anymore, it used to last a few hours, now it’s only a few minutes to an hour which is nice. 

okay, also, i don’t know how well i can explain this part so please bear with me. 

more often than not (but not always) after the dissociation goes away, i know where i am, what i’m doing, and what happened like 30 second prior, but when i’m talking to someone or watching something, it’s like everything is going in, but im not actually retaining any of the information, but if you ask me a few hours later what happened, i’ll usually be able to tell you, it’s just in the moment most of the time everything literally goes in one ear out the other, and it gets me in a lot of trouble at home, and it’s getting harder to control. 

when i’m alone and dissociated, or the dissociation passes i talk to myself a lot more than usual, and it’s usually recapping things that happened earlier in the day, or earlier in the week that i kind of forgot about until then. (forgetting things and remembering them days/weeks/months later happens a lot lol)

69,"[SENSITIVE MATTERS] Hey. I've decided to make a post about some things that have been bothering me. Some quite serious things. If you don't want to read it all, I'll do a TL;DR at the end. Here goes.

I grew up in a normal household: 2 siblings, a stay-at-home mother and a father who was at work most of the day. I had another sister from father's 1st marriage. Computers have always given me headaches.

I excelled in primary school. I was a smart-ass kid. In secondary school, I found that there were people better than me. I was not upset at this, as I enjoyed the competition (or whatever the non-serious equivalent is). It was in the first year of secondary, however that life kinda kicked me in the ass. My half-sister accused me of sexual misconduct with her (then) 3-year-old daughter. It _should_ have been a simple ""no I didn't"" with my parents to back me up. They did not. They belived her. That was back-stabbing if I'd ever felt it.

A couple years later, we move out of town. Well, very far away. To a different country, in fact. A country which spoke a language that I had no idea about. I had 0 friends and spoke the wrong language. After a couple years, I was able to speak at a reasonable level and made a couple friends. 

It's around here that things start happening.

I started to forget. Only keys and the date, and such. But as the months progressed, it got *worse.* I'm talking names, places, objectives, friends, routines, even my own damn name and age. Every day was a constant ""I've forgotten something... fuck, I know i have..."" And then tgere was the loss of concentration. My mind would cloud over. I could barely read because my brain refused to focus on words.

Talking to my parents was like talking to a brick wall. I would say on a monthly, maybe weekly, basis ""Mum, I have a bad memory."" Her answer? ""No you don't."" or ""You just weren't listening. You never listen.""

This continues. But a couple of years ago the Fire nation attacks. I'm doing a test in school when I hear someone call my name to my left. First- rude. We're in a test. Second- next to me is a window with a 30-foot drop on the other side. I was shook. But I soon forgot it. A few days later, it happens again, but it was the voice of a friend from my previous school who was in a different country. I notice the pattern of ""quiet, but shouting, like from down a corridor."" for those voices a day later when it happens again. A year later, I'm getting episodes of voices. One day, I hear the single worst thing so far. A scream right inside my ears, so loud it throws me to the floor. Around this time, the teachers decide to kick me from the science course because my maths, literature and philosophy scores are sub-par. The put me in the (you guessed) computing course. I hate computers. Now I'm miserable every single day. My scores have improved, but computing scores are low.

It's around now that I experimented with self-harm. I thought it wasn't for me, but after the 83rd cut, someone in class found out and I had to see the school psychologist every week. So... end of story, right? No. I hated her. She was the motherly kind. The kind I despise. All ""You can fight this addiction! I know you can! We can do it together!"" and I hated it. It wasn't an addiction, which she insisted it was (yes, I know she is a doctor and I'm not, but she's *not* me) and so I didn't tell her my problems. She firmly believes I have depression.

Fast-forward to a few weeks ago. The voices appear in bursts, loud and close, for minutes to days. I've started to feel paranoid. My balance has decreased and I'm getting almost daily headaches.

I went to a comicon in mid-May and got a photo with a girl who was dressed up. Rather, she walked passed and I froze instead of asking her. I spend the next hour and a half dragging my friend around looking for this girl. I did, eventually. I was going to ask for a photo and contact info. It was perfect in my head. I got her photo aaaaannnndddd forgot about contact info.
The next day, I had my first emotional breakdown. I'm a lonely guy. Never had a girlfriend, not great at making friends. I'm also not too emotional, so thinking back makes me go ""Was that me?"" 
I was crying and repeating ""I don't want to be alone any more!"" and being angry at myself for not talking to the girl, all vecause my stupid mind didn't let me. For the first time in my life, I felt lonely and vulnerable. It went on for a couple of hours. Since then I've had anger outbreaks and been generally pissed at everything. I've also started having days of not talking and being paranoid.

I'm trying to find a not-so-fluffy psychologist to talk to, but there aren't many around where I live.

In summary: I'm hallucinating, paranoid, not concentrating, doing poorly in school, miserable and uncharacteristically emotional.

**Backstory on parents!** They are both retired mental nurses. So they know a thing or two about mental disorders. I don't think they'd believe me if I told them this stuff because I'm not swallowing car keys or pulling the heads off pigeons.

**TL;DR**: Good in school, accused of assaulting niece (parents didn't believe me), moved to different country, memory starts declining, concentration plummets, memory declines *further* (parents don't believe me), starts hearing voices in episodes, moved to the very course I didn't want to do from bad grades, start self-harming, school psychologist thinks I'm depressed (I'm not), went to comicon and didn't say what I wanted to say to a girl, have 1st emotional breakdown in anger and loneliness, anger, paranoia, sadness and nervous attacks ensue. Any advice? What do these symptoms sound like? Should I be worried?",04Jun2019,2
70,"Someone I am very close to has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He found this out about a year ago, when I told him, after several major breakdowns, that his depression seemed like a lot more than depression to me (I have depression, too). After reading about various mental illnesses, and talking to other people about their own, I have a feeling bipolar might not be the right diagnosis. This is based on how short his mood swings seem to be,  compulsive behavior in regards to drugs/alcohol, and unstable relationships. From my readings, BPD seems to fit his behavior more. I am also by no means a mental health professional, so I am not qualified to make a diagnosis. 


For me, I think “self-diagnosing” to an extent helped me get to a psych professional quicker, and helped me understand myself, too. I think when I originally told him his depression seemed like more than depression, it helped him actually seek help. I don’t know how helpful bringing this suspicion up would be. I guess I don’t know how to bring this suggestion up to him, or even mention it, particularly because of how stigmatized BPD is, too.

This happened a year ago. I was staying at a friend's place that night. It was a pretty shitty day. Everything that could have went wrong, went wrong, so I was already a bit on edge. Suddenly, everything felt weird. The things people do, how the world works, I was even looking at a cabinet in my friend's room and all I could think about was how that cabinet is fucking weird. I must have said ""what the fuck"" about a hundred times that evening, because I just felt like this world and this existence is weird. The feeling passed but I have never been the same since.

That spring was very intense for me, I was on the move every day, getting shit done like I never had / have. (Shortly after, I burned out and was basically just a bag of meat walking around.) I couldn't get drunk at this time, no matter how much I drank. I do have anxiety and cycles of depression, I have experienced what I think is depersonalisation.

Could it be derealisation? Did it stem from me overworking myself? Maybe from me being on edge from all the things that went wrong that day and then being able to relax, so my brain just skipped a beat or something? Dunno. Send help.",04Jun2019,1

74,"I have some groups of friends, each of which I have times that I’ll speak to them (such as group chats on social media or game parties on Xbox), but recently I’ve not had much to talk about with a certain group as really a lot of their interests don’t appeal to me such as motorbikes and TV shows I’ve not seen etc. I’ve been trying to get myself money to save up for driving lessons and save up to pay rent on a house when I get one through working my nightshift job as a crew member at McDonald’s but recently I’ve been receiving digs about how me keeping my head down and how I’m just using my trying to start a future of some shape for myself is an excuse to be a lousy friend, I’ve never been 100% sociable after the age of 16 and I never wanna be in contact with people EVERYday of the week, these instances make me just want to hermit even more and just cut them off altogether though because these people can drive and have jobs etc but I’m the bad one for trying to do the same through my own pocket which is reserving more of my time. 

This is the kind of person that if they suggested to go somewhere they expect you to go with no questions asked and lord forbid you say anything regarding their idea, but if you mentioned the same place the day before then you would be torn to shreds for having a “dumbass idea.” Toxicity in its finest imo.

Does anyone else have problems like these that they can give me a sense of relatability behind toxic behaviours from others? As I feel I’m in a situation where I haven’t really got anyone to turn to and speak of it without needing to be weary of what I say incase it’s held against me because they’ve decided today I’m a “shitty friend.” 

I’m kind of rambling but I wouldn’t mind if someone could maybe give me an insight as to how others are being treated by other toxic people. A chance to get it out your system as well as maybe take something away from the comments for yourself.

78,"A few days ago there was a user on r/teenagers that had mentioned he would be ""dead by sunday"". As response, there were posts that circulated trying to raise awareness on numerous subreddits, I personally found one on r/memes. As result of the posts, the person in question was dm'ed by more than 1000 people, had numerous comments by random people, and while most tried helping in their own way, there were comments that i suppose would not help someone in that mentality. That person has taken a break from reddit, and his status is unknown.

Of course this isn't the first time that this has happened, so how could/should we act on reddit in that case? Of course with the objective of getting the user help by means of sometype of suicide prevention, while not pushing them over the edge by sheer numbers.",04Jun2019,1
79,"Most of my life is getting better but i am so lonely, i cry so often because i genuinely pity myself so much. I don’t know what to do to make friends, i’m not fit to work and i don’t go to school or anything. More importantly i have no way to make friends (nothing to talk about) because my personality is my mental illness, all of my humour is based around being mentally ill, it’s what i read about.

I understand people are going to say “get a hobby” but it’s really hard for me to do anything alone because i’m so sick of being alone and also is the best way to make real friends genuinely to pretend to enjoy something i don’t? Thanks.",04Jun2019,1

81,"I need to stop being a ''YES'' or ''NO'' man, instead i need to be a Man who takes life on and accept opportunities and stopping excuses , if i want to say ''NO'' i need to make sure that there is a legitimate reason behind that and not just some fear or excuse, if i want to say yes, well the same thing, But the point is that you live once, live your life, get asked to volunteer? this is a opportunity presenting it self, go and DO it, but don't try and make excuses, the whole point is no excuses and inviting the word Yes into your life a little more. It also dramatically decreases the habits of being a neurotic piece of shit full of excuses",04Jun2019,2
82,"Hello! First time poster looking to hear other people's stories, experiences, advice or general input regarding comorbid ADHD and Aspergers. 

For a long time I always felt I was different, sometimes superior to others, as i felt the way I thought was so different and unique. I never in my life thought I'd have ADHD or Aspergers (ASD 1/2). Long story short i began to suffer Anxiety and other self esteem issues around 17 after my first relationship. Fast forward to 19 i began to smoke weed every night as a form of relaxing as it was the first I've experienced the sensations of being relaxed. 

Then came the memory and executive functioning issue's, further relationship issues and experimenting with anti-depressants on and off at 21, 22, 23 and 25. Nothing worked at all prior and I was reluctant to try anything that wasn't valium (first time using it). The doctor put me on paroxatine and then a few nights  I had some fucked up dreams, such as: Dead disfigured bodies in an apartment I used to live in, dreams of being in the doctors and having the nurses and doctors conintuously saying ""just do it, just take it"" (regarding pristiq) and dreams that just where amazing, but also some gruesome dreams. The morning am I had the dream regarding pristiq, I woke up and instantly went to the doctors to switch to it, instead of paroxetine. Upon starting pristiq shit got real weird, I would randomly hyper focus and have so much motivation followed by using cocaine every second weekend or so and smoking weed again after quitting prior. I knew something wasn't right but it's almost as if my brain wanted me to be self destructive and go down this path. 

After seeing my psychologist for 4 months, I had a instinctual feeling one day to ask them what ADHD was, I related to all they spoke about. I then had to wait a while and I eventually had an appointment with the ADHD and Nuroscience specialist psychiatrist (Very fucking expensive, $700 a session). During this appointment the psychatrist is painting a picture of my psyche after reviewing the psychological refferal and clinical report. After that appointment I was shocked and in denial about the suggestion that I may have aspergers aswell as ADHD. I felt angry, sad, confused and overwhelmed. But most of all, in denial. I had an appointment with their psychologist to do more nurological testing and consults. The nurological testing suggested I have a Aspergie cognitive function, but suggestively have ADHD also. I was told they can exist together and keep eachother in check, but also conflict at times. After that appointment I left feeling so angry, confused and just wanting some medication that actually works so I can get my shit together. I began to feel extremely depressed and angry soon after. I felt as if my life has been flipped upside down and i just am extremely jealous of nurotypical people now. I also feel like a dickhead for being so judgmental my whole adolescent life. 

I suppose I don't really know how to gather and conpile my thoughts, but I was hoping to hear if anyone else has had anything similar happen and if their quality of life improved with medication, if so, what medication?  

Is it normal to feel extremely frustrated, upset and angry about this? My psychiatrist won't prescribe, won't offer advice or anything till the next appointment and my doctor can't do anything as his not qualified to treat it and my anxiety treatments with SSRI's didn't work. I've been told to read up on Straterra and Intuniv by my Psychatrist a few weeks ago, but I don't know why that would be suggested over a stimulant? And can any medication actually help Aspergers? I've lost all motivation and really began to question what's the point if I have no quality of life. I would never act on those thoughts, but I've identified them forming after trailing Clomid for two weeks and having to stop due to putting on 6kg, loosing executive functions and those thoughts.",04Jun2019,2
83,"I hope this is the correct subreddit. I'm sorry if it isnt.
I use my phone a lot. I end up wasting a lot of time on insta or YouTube.
Some things I've noticed about myself:
•Lack of motivation to do anything.
•If at all I do anything, I take constant breaks and end up on my phone.
•Sometimes, If in a day I sleep for 8 hours, then I've easily used my phone for around 16 hours.
•I spend like 95% of my day in my room.
•My social battery(if that's a thing) dies after 1-1½ hours.
•Couple of years back I could remember the details of conversations I've had with people for months/years. Now I can barely remember the details of a conversation I've had last week.
•I skip meals. I feel hungry but don't want to eat. If I do it take a long time for me to finish eating.
•I get angry/irritated very fast.
•i procrastinate big time.

I don't always feel sad. Although I have had suicidal thoughts a couple of times(not very often). I run away from my emotions and use my phone. My phone basically acts like a buffer.
Just wondering I'm depressed or if my phone is just affections other activities of my life.
Thank you for reading if you reached this far.",04Jun2019,4
84,"Did anyone notice that Cymbalta made them very hyper emotional early on or in general while on the medication? Ive been on it a little over a week. I’ve always been a very hyper emotional person so I was quick to write this off but, I’ve noticed I’ve been a little weepy or quick to anxiety in face of conflict since taking Cymbalta. It seems like it’s far too soon to say that it’s the medication but I’ve had two people that struggle with mental health tell me 1) That Cymbalta has that effect. 2) Not to write off early signs because it’s too soon to officially tell. What do you say?",04Jun2019,1
85,"For a while, I’ve been getting words stuck in my head. Usually these words are words that I’ve just learned. I’ll get a word stuck in my head for an entire day, and once I wake up the next morning it’s gone. It’s way worst then having a song stuck in my head. It feels louder, and they repeat in my head over and over again. Probably two times a second. It’s hard for me to sleep at night because my thoughts feel too loud in my head. 

Recently I also started learning sign language and I’ve become obsessed with finger spelling things when I’m trying to go to sleep. It keeps me up all night, and I just can’t stop finger spelling things. 

These two things could mean completely different things, but I don’t know what is going on. They’re super distracting and are making it hard for me to sleep, and I really need a way to fix this.",04Jun2019,2
86,"My mind is currently in turmoil because I got reminded of my school.
Because of what happened in my 2018 - 2019 class.
(In my school, we assign new seats every period, so everyone can get to know eachother.)
I was the last one left to assign for a seat, so the teacher kept looking for any empty seats.
When she couldn't see one, she asked the whole class on who wanted to sit with me.
No one, nobody. I was socially awkward, and very unpopular, so no one even raised their hand. Not even my friends. This made me realize I was alone. 

My teacher made me sit with a classmate whom I really hate, we hated eachother's guts, his reason was because I'm weird. Mine, he was the most perviest, mischievous person I have ever met, along with some of his gang. He once wrecked the tile outside of the classroom.

So finally, my teacher made me sit with an acquiantance. We got to know eachother, but it felt like he wasn't even trying to be a friend.

The 2nd memory was me and my other classmates stuff in our bags got piled on the floor, and destroyed. My sketchbook was destroyed, pages ripped and torn from the cover. My classmates book and notebook cover ripped, and the other's test got ripped too.
Of course, being the naive person I was, reported it to the guidance counselor. After that event, my teacher asked me why I didn't report to her first.
I was angry, and sad about my stuff. I worked hard on trying to improve and it's results was a destroyed sketchbook.

Or that time my teacher asked me to look at a classmate's project for reference but another classmate rushed him to pass it.

Most of the boys ask if I have a pool or a big house, and it made me angry at my little sister for telling them. And/Or asking me to loan from them, even though I didn't owe them anything.

Everytime I bring up to my parents that I wanted to change schools, they'd reply with ""You always complain"" or ""This is the best school for you.""
My father said ""I've been through way worse than you.""
And when I made an artwork about my experiences on school in Facebook, my mom just replied with ""maybe they just don't understand you""

I know it violates my father's privacy, but as a young child, his father made him stand up naked in public, punch him as punishment, and made him kneel in peas. When he told me this, I lost a chunk of faith for my grandfather. 
I know by Western standards, it is child abuse. But here it's considered normal, in the PH. 
I've heard stories from my grandma about this. But even if you're a Vietnam War-vet, you shouldn't condone this type of discipline.

I've felt really angry on remembering the school incidents, and I've resorted to Coca Cola/Ice Tea addiction to drink and forget it all away.

I know I'm too young for Reddit (13F), but I really don't like thinking about these incidents and a while ago, typing the 3rd paragraph made my eyes feel like they're burning. 
Yes, I'm allowed to cry, but I don't want to do it in front of my 2 sisters (6F and 8F) and cousin (11F).

I really got nothing to do about my situation since it's gonna get worse when I tell them I posted this, or show them this. 

I just ask you to please recommend any sort of method to cope with remembering these. Please.",04Jun2019,1

88,"To start off with, I don’t know where to post this, I don’t know what I’m gonna get from this but I just wanna write it somewhere. I hope people in this sub can give me some advice.

I was never a guy with a ton of friends, I’m 15 and I’ve moved quite a lot of schools. I’m not born in this country I came here when I was 11 or 12.
Moving school, taught me a few things about people who are really there for you and people who are fake.
I’ve been in this school for about 2 years now, when I joined I stayed away from the “cool people”, I knew that I could not bond with them, and they could leave me at any time, I hanged out with the average group.
A year later, some of the friends I made were not really aiding my study, and they were making me insecure, about the way I look, the way I talk, how no one will like me, just to let you know, I don’t have thick skin, so I take things personally, but sometimes, they took it too far.
I got away from them, and made new friends, they were pretty much the same, I was not getting anything from these friends, more than a few laughs, there is no real friendship between us. Now, I’m lonely, I got away from them to improve my study, and now I’m struggling to focus in school, and I just wanna go home.
I don’t know what to do, more than just push through it and go through high school and just focus on studying and passions.
I’ve been thinking about a few things, maybe it’s me, it’s all my fault, the way I am and that’s why no one likes me.
I’m not suicidal, I just feel real empty, and don’t see a point in life sometimes, I also struggle with a porn addiction (which I’m trying to recover from, however my environment is not the best), I don’t have much to do, haven’t felt real emotions in ages.
Any advice, feel free to tell me.
Thanks",04Jun2019,1
89,"Hello internet!
This is a UK based post, but I welcome views from anyone!
I am looking to gather the viewpoints of the general public regarding the recent resurgence of interest in psychedelic therapy in mental healthcare.
I'm looking to explore the social, political and economic barriers to the introduction of such therapies in the NHS. The evidence suggests that therapeutic doses (not recreational) in a controlled, clinical environment may be beneficial in treating addiction, depression and those being cared for at the end of their lives. However, significant barriers exist which prevents new research from being undertaken.
Do you think that further research into psychedelic substances should be done? And how would you feel about psychedelic therapies being introduced to the NHS (or in your healthcare system) in the future?

I'm wasting money on a shitty ACA plan that doesn't cover shit. I can barely afford the premium itself. And there's pretty much no mental health professionals in my area that it covers. I would have been better off without insurance.

I need antidepressants. I need anxiety medication. I need ADHD medication. I need CBT and a therapist.

I can't do this on my own anymore. I keep gaining weight. I can't bring myself to talk about my issues to my friends. My boss has noticed a decline in my work performance.

None of my immediate or extended family care to address any of these issues. Most are swimming in denial without knowing why they have the problems they do.

Well, firstly, even if it’s reduced cost, it’s entirely out of reach to me. I’m unemployed because I have severe anxiety that I need serious help with. I have this because I don’t have medical coverage to see any professionals. Unemployed because I don’t have insurance because I’m unemployed. It really is just as vicious and hard to break of a cycle as it sounds.

And as for free coverage, what are people talking about? In the state I’m in, Texas, Medicaid is a paid-for service unless you are ALREADY ON SSI or disability. Otherwise you either need to pay for the Medicaid itself or pay the parts of the prescriptions and checkups it doesn’t cover for the reduced cost plan.

100,"Really need a rant to people (who hopefully understand) about something that's happened with my work.

About a month ago I fell really unwell with depression and anxiety and was signed off work for two weeks. I was prescribed a higher dose of Sertraline and given Zopiclone for my insomnia.

I have a high stress job and I am in management.

I was signed off a few months ago aswell but returned after two weeks, now I feel I went back too early.

Two weeks into my recent absence I hardly left my flat with terrible anxiety and suicidal thoughts, so I was signed off for another two weeks. The next week (wk 3) I was doing slightly better, still sleeping poorly and anxiety was bad but better. So that weekend my boyfriend organised a day out to the country side away from the city to spend the day there and visit my family on the way home. We had a great day! I took a few photos and put them on a social media website, a few friends and my family knew I was off with D&amp;A so I was excited to share my great day!

I returned to work yesterday and my boss spoke to me about a colleague who brought up said post and was asked to be considerate of what I post to social media when signed off as it maybe taken the wrong way. On social media I am connected to 3 colleagues who I'm close with, 2/3 knew why I was off. My boss also is connected with me but I'm not with them.

I felt so hurt! And that I needed to worry about other people's half known judgement of my self care! I can understand how they might be confused but they don't know why I'm off, like I can't have a day out. This was the only post I made during my time off sick.

My boss has been blocked...

Just feel so annoyed as I don't feel the 3 I have on there would have made the comment. And if they did, not in the way I was being told they did. 

Reading what I wrote back I can't really describe the way my boss said it, what they said was harsher, and tried to put me in another person's shoes but if it were me then I would mind my own business.

103,"I've dealt with bullying in school and in the workplace. In high school, I was ostracized and excluded alot, so literally had no friends and no one to talk to at all as I had severe shyness and social anxiety. In college, I gradually overcame the social anxiety, as I only got bullied a few times, but I still didn't make any real friends, and none of whom I even keep in touch with now. In the workplace, I had to quit a few jobs because I was being ostracized, yelled at, and bullied. 

Life is better now because I have a job that lets me work 100% from home. However, I still do find it hard to be motivated at times, and get PTSD flashbacks about my past bullying. I've been seeing a therapist for about 10 sessions now, in which he did EMDR a couple times. Although he is a very nice man who completely empathizes with me, I wouldn't say I've noticed much difference in my depression and happiness. 

I think the reason why I'm still so depressed is because I don't really have any friends and I get no human interaction from my job. Outside of work, there's a couple ""friends"" I spend time with on our hobbies, but I'm not close to them. I'm ashamed to tell them about my past bullying and they probably wouldn't relate as they likely never went through that stuff. 

What really bothers me about the bullies I dealt with in the past is that they always seemed to have it better than me. They were taller, had more friends than me as I was often a loner with no one to talk to, had higher social status, girls found them more attractive than me, they weren't ethnic minorities like I am, etc. So why the fuck were they bullying and ostracizing me? I never did anything to them. Apparently studies have shown that having more friends, having higher social status, and exercising more leads to a happier life. The bullies I dealt with had all of those more than me, yet they had to fuck with me? Why would they bully me if they were happier than me?

People say the best revenge is success and moving on. But how can I move on when people my age (in my early 30s) aren't as willing to meet new people as they're married or in relationships, and even if they weren't, they're more likely to want to befriend the bullies I dealt with than me because they perceive them to be more outgoing, taller, caucasian instead of a minority, etc. For example, there's an upcoming meetup for a hike in the mountains that seems interesting, but judging from the photos of the members, it seems like there would be hardly any other ethnic minorities coming. Based on past experiences, I'm concerned I'll just get excluded and mocked for not being outgoing. They'll ""smell"" that I'm a weak, easy target and thus not want to deal with me

It seems like the only way I can really ""move on"" is by doing things that seem interesting solo, whether that be going hiking, rafting, scuba diving, etc

So... as you don't know me (and I don't know you) it's going to be easy to let out some stuff stuck down the throat by my fear of judgment from a beloved one. I will start as early as I can remember, using family stories for some parts because well... my memory can be quite a bitch, like everyone's I think

Well, I'm not sure if this post is well fitted in this sub and if it is not, remove it. I started typing my life, and in it I think there is some stuff related to mental illness. I have had multiples diagnoses through the time, have been in a psychiatric hospital, evilly medicate and had a few breaking down (and up). At first, I didn't thought to post my all past in this sub but... thinking about it, I remembered how discovering and reading about other people struggle help me to face them (in my mind right now I have a small book ""walking on the edge of insanity"", I'll give you a link at the end).

As it is, step by step, every thing that has marked me (beginning with my childhood), it is not straight up about mental health, that's why I m not sure if it will fit here. If not, I will upload the parts about it in this sub.

First of all, I did not had a really rough childhood, I'm a middle class guy born in a good environment.

&amp;#x200B;

.-Starting block-

I am a 26 years old guy and live in France. But let start by the beginning, if you don't mind.

In 1992, I saw the neon light of the operating room and was brought to a nice family, lucky me! My father, Martin, is a engineer who traveled a lot when I was a kid, bringing back presents from all around the world. I still have allot of them and can almost follow the equator with their provenance. My mother, Romane, is a loving house wife, taking care of every needs any of us could have, creating some more from times to times. I know she would face SCP-173 all alone if it was threatening to arm us. And at last my sister, Nour, three years older. As you can imagine, most of time, baby me was just a crying poop factory, cute for some but exhausting for most.

The first story I can share with you is my first time alone with Nour, as it's a recurrent diner titbit. So, there I was, in my cradle, minding my own business, when she showed her pretty 3 years old face. My parents were in the next room of the apartment when the heard her screaming:

""Why aren't you a little girl???"" And a smack right after.

She slapped me so hard I had a black eye for a few weeks (you should see my face on the baby me picture \^\^""). Well, I must say, even if I don't recall this meeting, it's pretty weird to have this remembered every now and then by every close relative.

\-Traveling-

18 weeks later, we left France to go to England, where my dad had a new job. We'll stay there for about 2 years, I am still pretty much the same piece of smelly baby but now I can move almost easily on my belly. I have a few memories, like the giant stairs to the living room, the endless garden with plenty of toys or the scary storeroom door that threw brooms at me if I played with her... shitty door of horror!

Mommy doesn't speak English (well she can introduce herself but that's about it) so the current gossip goes that she didn't left the house alone. Apparently, she waited all day in the house with me, venturing out only with Nour or daddy. Nour was in an English nursery and spoke with a stunning British accent, so she was going to the grocery store with her tiny translator. As daddy had a busy week schedule, he had to enjoy some never ending shopping every other weeks-ends.

\-Traveling back-

So, here we are, back in France. We lived in an almost American suburb, every neighbors had pretty much the same house, only details can tell who has a tiny bit more in his bank account. Now, I am as autonomous as a 2 years can be, meaning by that I still can't eat by myself, am not quite understandable, draw like a trunk man with beverage issues, walk like sedated giraffe, etc... You see the picture. Soon, I will go to school, to harvest my very first true memory.

Here I was, siting in class with everyone, looking at the teacher playing with her hands in a truly side-splitting manner, each one telling a tale of his own. I giggled, giggled and giggled and giggled... it started to feel weird down my tummy... my hand raised has high as I could but she was too into her hand's puppet show... lowering my arm, bashfully... and shat myself. It was still morning, no one had noticed and I kept it a secret until I no longer could. During the day, presumably surrounded by the odor all the time, not an adult told the dirty kidy me anything. I kept my shame stuck to my butt.

But the last alarm meant that Helma (a lady who was coming to pick me up) might see through my demeanor. And yes she did. In the car, she angrily told me what I already knew... I should have just stand up, no matter how shameful it was. I truly don't know why I didn't. Well maybe I do but it might to hard on me to admit.

As we arrived to my home, mom didn't react to the news, nothing at all. She washed me without looking at me in the eyes or just saying a word, probably ashamed of my non action. As I was tired of the day, mentally from the disgrace and physically from hiding the turd (try walking with a sticky brown in your pants for a day...), I went to bed on an empty stomach, sun was still shinning but kidy me wasn't. We never spoke about that day, I don't think my dad even knows that story.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'll stop there for today. Thanks a lot to those who read it entirely. Feel free to comment, ask questions, point the misspellings, yell insult at me (or my family and friends) etc...

110,"I currently feel like I need to see someone soon, perhaps even as soon as possible, but I work a 9-6 with little to no possibility of wiggle room for regular appointments of any kind. I also don't want to use my weekends because I'm in a moderately long distance relationship with my boyfriend and weekends are the only time we have and I'd rather never seek help than give up that time. Like, I don't do much in terms of going out and so I feel like even if I'm getting help, losing that will have a big negative impact on me.

Anyway, I was looking at the online directory provided by my health insurance and i noticed you could select ""evening appointments as a qualifier for search results and i was super excited. But once i started looking through the specialists, it seemed like, when googled, the facilities they work at don't really have websites and list hours that end at 5 or they're completely ""ungoogle-able"" with very little coming up for either the address listed on the insurance website or the name of the specialist. I then happened across one that said ""evening appointments available upon request.""

So I guess I'm just wondering, is 4-5 or 6 PM going to be the extent of the evening hours available to me? And if I go to a place where they're available upon request, is this an inconvenience to the employees and specialists? I know I can call the numbers given by these specialists on the insurance website but will it be looked down upon that I'm shopping around for a time of day and not a level of care? And with stuff that's available upon request, will that be based of need and seeing that my weekends are very ""technically"" open, I won't be allowed to request one? Also, will the price be different?

For years I have been struggling with ongoing mental health issues, but they never really defined who I am, or like stopped me from doing things ( until I kinda realized they do) I just supposed all the things I felt were normal or like not that big of deal. 

I grew up in an abusive household, that had a weird dynamic. My parents were not physically abusive to me but my bother was, mainly because of his mismanaged mental health issues. 

From probably the age of 9-22 I was abused physically on a daily basis and at better times a weekly basis.  The abuse was anything from sibling scraps and brawls to me hiding in the bathroom as he busted down the door to try to hurt me, calling the police as fast as I could to try to get help. 

My mother just made me accept this from my brother. My Dad left us at some point, I know they truly were trying to help him / us but didn’t know the best way. They used to tell me to get over it, I was never given any other options or way to live and I have a lot of resentment toward them. I’m letting that go the best I can. 

I have a daughter now and an incredible
Husband and life, but still deal with this all the time, outwardly and inward. Recently my brother had a Terrible episode again and it snapped me back so far. 

I decided to get help. After getting that help I’m working with a treatment plan that’s to help me for ptsd. Being what I would like to think is an educated person, I had a feeling it probably was something like that but hearing doesn’t feel excellent.   

I am relieved but nervous and also like pissed that i didn’t ask to be brought up in such a life, and I sure as hell don’t enjoy episode of relieving it. 

To make it worse I’m close with my mother and see my Bother and my other family regularly. Kinda just torn here because my mother like knows it’s wrong but also is angry about us not all being “ a happy family”. 

Anyone else out there have a story like this or live with ptsd ? Does it get easier after like working at it ?",04Jun2019,2
116,"I have been suffering from a very serious pure ocd for 10 years that has ruined my life preventing me from doing anything, even writing or thinking normally (because every time it emerges it causes a very strong anxiety).In 15 y i have virtually tried ALL psychiatric medication and also supplements/nootropics with no positive effects..since recently when i discovered that a turmeric or a gulp of golden milk sweeps it away 100% for several hours. The problem is that taking it even in low dosages as in the examples I have reported causes me a very strong mental confusion which in turn prevents me from concentrating even minimally,making me unable to perform any activity thus negating the positive anti-ocd effect. I have read from various sources that turmeric increases levels of serotonin and decreases brain inflammation, is this probably the reason for the mental confusion I experience immediately after taking it? Do you have any solution in this regard?

I point out that even some probiotic supplements with various bacteria strains, even taken once, eliminated my ocd for about five days in a row, but I experience the same confusion problem, in this case even stronger.

I must add that since several years I am taking a medium-dose benzodiazepine for social anxiety four times a day (that I plan to ideally taper to zero by next year) and that in my life I have never suffered from mental fog or concentration issues. On the contrary, I am a very reactive person

IMPORTANT:  I must add that that every day from more than a year i also feel a constant depersonalization..but i'm not tapering..then probiotics and turmeric simply greatly increase this feeling.But At this point I believe that in the long term benzodiazepines have ruined my brain. I found articles about derealization / depersonalization induced by benzodiazepines, but none of them talks about how to solve it. Incredibly,for benzodiazepine-induced depersonalization some detoxification clinics recommend the use of antipsychotics and / or synthetic antidepressants: obscene. I ask for help,again",04Jun2019,0

Since December I haven’t been myself, it’s like a random switch tripped in my brain but the problem is that I don’t know where to find it therefore I cannot switch it back, hoping it will do it itself. But it’s been almost 6 months and I know it won’t.

Regarding feelings… I honestly don’t know. I know what I WANT to feel and want to aim for, however actually achieving my wishes is the tricky part and it’s as if my mind is working against me. My relationships around me that I once treasured with the entirety of my heart and soul - only half of my soul is there but it’s still in doubt. I am worried. I don’t know what I feel, to the point where I’m not even sure how I want to feel because I’m scared that was I end up feeling will also be fake too. 

These worries make me wanna drop everything and sort of refresh, restart. Analysing each situation and choice trying to prevent things from zooming downhill unexpectedly.

I’m in a muddle and even after months of trying and jumping from medication from medication, I can’t seem to get out of this slump.

123,"So about two years ago I had a manic episode and was restricted to an psychiatric hold for 42 days. It’s been a rough two years since filled with antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs and I’m looking towards psychotherapy and any advice for help. My ultimate goal is to return to my life medication free. I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I’m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background

I had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn’t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn’t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and  I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend.  I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me. 

I think a lot of my issue is that I’m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn’t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident. 

Am I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched. Plus, I didn't feel that much of a connection and want to be picky if I'm paying to talk to somebody.

130,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've just had an utterly strange encounter with a friend of mine and I feel the need to vent and possibly ask for a little advice. This post might become rather long, but I would appreciate it if someone read it.

First a little bit of back story: My friend, let's call him John, is currently 22 years old, lives in Germany and is currently enrolled in college. He and I live in the same dorm, we've known each other for almost three years and I am one of only two friends he has at the moment. The other friend, I will call William.

When I first became friends with John, me, him and William would often sit in the common room of our dorm and discuss a wide variety of topics. John had was very open and he had a vivid imagination, which made me enjoy talking to him a lot. Some people in our dorm didn't like John very much, because he would sometimes say insensitive and inappropriate things. I had noticed this as well, but I didn't mind.

About half a year after us three became friends, William was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He started taking Lithium, got a girlfriend, moved out of our dorm and lives with his girlfriend at the moment. William is doing well at the moment, but John has complained to me that William doesn't have much time for him anymore.

In between semesters, John would stay with his parents in his hometown and work as a life guard at the local swimming pool. He confessed to me that one day, he acted inappropriately towards women who were going to the pool. These women complained to John's boss and his boss sent him home for the day. On that same day, John watched pornography  at his parent's apartment with the door wide open and his speakers set to full volume. This prompted John's father to send him to the local psychiatric hospital.

If I recall correctly, he had two stays at a psychiatric hospital in total, each one was about one or two months long.

He never told me an exact diagnosis that the doctors might have given him, maybe they didn't give him one, maybe he didn't want to tell me. I know that he was prescribed Ritalin and later an antidepressant, I don't remember which one. Both of which didn't work for him, so he stopped taking any medication for the last six months. I should perhaps add that  John has a history of excessive cannabis usage.

At this point, John definitely had his quirks, but he still seemed like a mostly normal person.

He said some things that hurt me personally and I was generally annoyed with his macho personality, so sometime around March or April of this year, I told him that I didn't want to spend time with him any more. We hadn't had any contact until about three weeks ago and in the time we spent apart, he got much worse.

He told me he had become vegan, which was unexpected from him. His mother reached out to me, telling me she was worried about him getting worse and she wants me to tell her if I noticed anything strange.

Well, today I had the strangest interaction with him that I've ever had with another human being.

He knocked on my door, telling me he needed help with a parcel of protein powder he ordered online. I don't know if this is a thing in other countries, but in Germany you can tell online shops to send the package to a store that accepts the package for you, the delivery service sends you an email when the package is at the store, and you can pick it up whenever convenient.

John had done this, but he couldn't remember which store, only that the store was located in the train station. So today he walked into the train station, went to the first desk he could find and asked about his package. Naturally, the lady had no idea what he was talking about, they argued for a while, John left empty handed and came to me for help.

I helped him check the online store page and it turned out the package hadn't even arrived yet, so I told him to wait.

With that matter settled, he stayed in my room for about 10 minutes more and we chatted a bit. His speech was erratic and hard to follow and he would often start laughing for no apparent reason.

I noticed that he had completely shaved his hair off and when I asked him about this, he said: ""The stuff on my head was just growing too densely.""

I have a USB powered fan and a computer on my desk. He saw both and said: ""Do you think we could get the fan and the computer to talk to each other?"". Upon further inquiry I believe he meant to ask me if you can control the fan from the PC, which you can't, so I told him as much.

Then, I sat down next to him, holding my electronic cigarette in my hand. Out of the blue he said: ""You know, you're having sex with that e-cigarette right now?"" (He didn't say having sex, he used the f-word.)

I asked him what he meant by that, he didn't reply and just started laughing. We sat in silence for a moment, then he said goodbye and left.

This sounds so surreal writing it down, but I assure you that it happened. I have no clue what I can do to help him, if I even should do anything. I haven't told any of our mutual acquaintances or his mother yet. I'm not sure if it's best for him to go back to a mental hospital, they seem to just prescribe him some medication and send him on his way. At the same time, it seems to me like he's losing his ability to function in society more and more.

I'd be thankful for any type of response.

i have friends, but i feel like i don’t. i think i am too dependent on people. when my friends do one minor thing, i think they hate me and then i block them on my social media. for example, if my friends don’t reply then i feel like we aren’t friends anymore and i delete them.  i know this is completely illogical but i can’t help it. my reaction is always too extreme. when a minor thing happens, i think we aren’t friends anymore. i know this is due to my insecurities and low confidence. 

i think this is why people don’t really talk to me much. i take things too personally and cut people out too fast. but then when my mood is back to normal i realize we are friends but then i sound crazy when i try to explain why i cut them off in the first place.

i am also super stubborn. i know i need help but i don’t want to get it. im just self sabotaging myself. i want to get help but in the past my therapists were unhelpful. and i know every therapist is different but when you go to so many and none of them help, it’s hard to believe that i will find the right one for me.

sorry for the long post.",04Jun2019,2
137,"This is my second post here, and this time I’m not on Adderral with no sleep for over like 36 hours so I should be easier to understand. For the past couple months I can hear voices, they don’t tell me to do anything. Actually it seems like they don’t even talk to me and most times it’s difficult to even understand them, but even when I’m listening to music and mowing I can hear them over the music but not totally understand what they are saying. My Dad has bipolar, I’ve never been tested for any mental illness, though I’ve had a history with depression and tried to commit suicide once. It was happening before I ever even have had Adderall, I don’t take any prescriptions really nothing changed around the time they started. What the fuck is it? It’s getting really hard to concentrate on shit I need to take care of, is there anything I can do about it?",04Jun2019,1

139,"I felt so good for a week after months of depression but now I’ve slipped back into it. I stopped self harming for a week and was excited about life. I stayed up all night to watch the sun rise and I even went for walks at all time of the day. 
I felt so happy but now? I feel lost again. It’s hit me 10 times harder. I want to kill myself. I hate this world and I hate myself. This world is cruel and I want to end it all.",04Jun2019,1
140,"I used to be like that, especially when I was upset or angry, I have such a strong need to express my thought process and argument. I feel such a strong need to be understood.

I was told by someone close that it’s a sign for poor mental health although none of us can pinpoint why.

I am not much like that recently after using my therapy AI app and start therapy too.
Until recently I see someone like that, I suddenly get what he means. There is clearly something wrong with her, yet I don’t know what it is.
Then today, a guy on Reddit mistake me as OP of a post and send me like few thousand words essay to argue about something irrelevant for me. I said I disagree and I am not OP. He again, sent me at least thousand words.

I really wonder what’s the problem behind this. I still text more than normal but I do it less now. Anyone has idea?

I thought it has something with: control, life priorities, being powerless in action therefore have to feel more control over words, maybe also the need to feel intellectually superior or feel good image about ourselves (like justify own value/behavior) so low self esteem too.

Any good article or better explanation?",04Jun2019,3
141,"Why do I feel so empty, so sad, so unfulfilled? Will I ever feel OK? I graduated college, I am 22F and in great shape physically. I have great friends. I am healthy. I am going on a great trip with my family tomorrow. I am moving to a beautiful state where I have an internship I always wanted. I have the world at my fingertips but here I am feeling fucking miserable again (like everyday) for no reason. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel like I am waiting for something but it never comes. I am NEVER really content and always contemplating the point of this lifetime. I have these fleeting moments of being busy and forgetting but I am just unhappy. I do not want to die, in fact I am terrified of being alone....but some days I do not like life. My mind feels like it never stops racing. I feel uncomfortable and not okay. Please help me understand whats wrong with me?",04Jun2019,2
142,"Last week I (M19) confirmed with my therapist that a big chunk of my problems can be labelled under Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN).

""Emotional Neglect is a parent’s failure to respond enough to a child’s emotional needs."" - Dr. Jonice Webb

As for a big tldr of my life's story so far: 
I only see my mom on Saturday's since I'm 8 while I live full-time with my dad. My dad works hard but we don't have an emotional connection or bond. I entered depression when ...situations happened when I was 8 until I feel 16yo. At 13 I searched for help and started to better my own life. While I'm really happy with how far I've pushed myself since, e.g. out of depression, my childhood and home is still the same and keeps me down in general.

So, are there any success stories out there of people overcoming CEN? Whilst I look forward to create myself a wonderful and happy future, I feel worried CEN will forever play a big part on my metal health throughout life.",04Jun2019,1
143,"I have a driving test coming up a week from Wednesday. It's my second attempt and I'm stressing like crazy.

My parents both say I have no reason to be worried or stressed out the way I am because even if I fail I can just take it again and no one will care if I fail.

I pointed out my worries about how much money would have been wasted paying for the test if i were to fail again and they said that they weren't stressed about the money so neither should I.

To be honest, I can understand them saying all of the above, but from here on is where it gets me... 

I then said that isn't it normal to put pressure on yourself? To which they said that's different, that's being anxious.

They continued on saying that if I thought a driving test was stressful that I should wait until I'm having kids and a house to worry about and then I would be stressed. Going on even more saying that if I was stressed out now, I'd be a wreck in a few years time.

I'm just thinking to myself the whole time, there's different levels of stress though, and what they said about being anxious is only half true as I see it as people can put stress on themselves because they want to succeed in what they do. And some people take failure worse than others. 

I want to start my own business, preferably my own therapy/phycology practice, or id even settle for working for a company. I want to do so many things but I'm INCREDIBLY hard on myself when I fail. First time I failed my test I cried while still in the car. I was embarrassed as hell and felt worse once I had gotten home as I didn't want to explain why I failed and that I was pretty much having a nervous breakdown during the test.

I'm a very nervous person and if someone said to describe myself in two words I'd say that I'm a stress head. 

No matter what it is I'm doing, if it involves anything I'm not used to, I'll stress and I'll worry and when it's all over I'll most likely cry. 

I don't think I have anxiety or anything like that, but it certainly is painful going through so much apparently unneeded stress and having no one at home who tries to understand where I'm coming from. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense and I'm especially sorry if I just seem like a silly teen wining about her parents, but if anyone could say anything at all regarding this it'd be very much appreciated xxx",04Jun2019,1

145,"My little brother has shown worrying symptoms from a very young age, around 4-5. He has an extremely violent temper and is prone to mood swings. He has a difficult time with social interaction. But my mom just refuses to get him help.

146,"Wvery time I ever bring up anything about my life, all I'm met with is invalidation, comments like ""you're being so negative"" and THEM telling ME what my problems are. And whenever I correct them or call them out it's met with nothing but resistance, and neither will back down and finally admit that I actually have issues for fucking once. And then when I isolate myself from them they wonder why? Fuck off, if you say you want to help and just HAVE to be right 100% of the time about everything you don't actually want to help.

The problem is they're the only people I can actually go to, yet I prove myself as a fucking idiot every time I say anything negative about my life, getting the same shitty results every time.

Or maybe I'm actually an idiot and just act dramatic over shit that doesn't matter. Maybe the reason everyone thinks I don't matter is because I actually don't matter. I'm the last person to think that it's everyone else's fault instead of mine. That's probably it, I am not going to amount to anything because I'm an ungrateful no good piece of trash and my problems don't actually matter. I punish myself at work via self harm because I constantly make the same stupid mistakes. I even do when people disregard me, then I punish myself for even bringing up such meaningless shit. I just want my miserable existence to end because there's nothing I can do to be of any value. If no one cares about me, then I might just be not worth caring about, so I won't care either.",04Jun2019,1
147,"I’ve started therapy and the one thing that has been on my mind is if telling my partner what I and the therapist spoke about or not? I tell
My partner almost everything, but I’m not sure if the things I talk about to the therapist should be kept between them and I. On the surface, it make seem like a stupid question (?), but I’m genuinely curious how people approach talking about therapy sessions with their partners. I don’t know if it be better to keep that between my therapist or not, or tell my partner what them and I spoke about and just tell them how the sessions go as a way to help them understand the growth, development, and help them understand what I am going through?",04Jun2019,1
