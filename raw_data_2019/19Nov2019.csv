0,"I am aware that some subreddit's forbid this and that it isn't exactly optimal to do so. But i am getting help with employment who help people like me who self identify as mentally ill.

From a young age, i wore hair that made people ask if i were a boy or girl. It destroyed me. I never changed it and it got worse through the years.

I self-exiled to avoid the words of judgement and it killed my grades as i become more focused on problems at home and what others thought of me. I made no friends for the rest of my life from 4th grade and then on.

After i got out of school, i became a full time NEET from then to age 28. I have yet to make any real life friends. I think most of my anxieties have went away and i feel i can handle people just fine. It's just that i have the social mental capacity of maybe a 13 year old. 

When people talk to me, i am so heavily focused on their judgements of me that i don't hear what they say very well or fail to absorb it. I think i am also so under practiced with direct interactions that it causes me to learn at a much slower pace if they're trying to teach me something.

Is there any snappy ways to summarize this?",19Nov2019,1
1,"I posted here a week or two ago and I wanted to post a follow up.

1. I disassociated (according to you guys) in the middle of an important conversation with my favorite teacher today. I know it doesn’t matter but now I’m really anxious about it. Basically I couldn’t focus on what I was saying and I kept forgetting what I was about to say.

2. My anxiety about guns got even worse after the Santa Clarita shooting. I actually had to leave an after school club early because it got so bad. I told my mom who was doubtful but told my school counselor about it, who said that she would talk to me. She hasn’t yet and I feel like this is an urgent issue.

3. Back to the disassociation. I noticed that I have felt like I’m falling every time I disassociate and every time I thing about disassociation it happens. I have also started getting a little depressed and not wanting to live anymore. I haven’t self harmed but I don’t know what is causing this. 

4. I have the previously mentioned teacher’s number and we text frequently. I am very comfortable going to them for help, but this is different. Should I bring this up? I don’t want to drag them into this but they have ADHD, so I’m thinking they might understand a little bit.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",19Nov2019,1

8,"Not sure if this is the best place to talk about this, let me know if it isn’t, and it would be really helpful if you tell me where to go instead , I really need to talk to someone about this... 

My friends have told me I should try and see a therapist because of the way I sometimes act, but I’m unsure if there is anything actually wrong with me. 

I have very extreme emotions, basically. But I think my extreme emotions are normal. One moment I can be extremely loud and jubilant, and super nice to everyone I talk to, then the next moment I can feel super depressed and the most tiny thing a person does around me can make me extremely angry. 

More often than not, when I get mad at someone I “cool down” by drawing disturbing images of their deaths, of course never acting on such impulses. My friends question my sanity for this though, and tell me I should see someone in fear that I might act on these impulses. I usually bat it off as that they’re overreacting, though sometimes I get really mad/hysterical and have headaches because of my anger, and it’s getting harder to manage. 

This is of course only my “anger” side of emotions, I also feel sad very often. Once again, the tiniest things can put me into this depressed mood. I feel like life is rather mundane and I always fear that nothing will get better. I am anxious to the point where I fear the future even happening, and think that I would rather not exist than have to face the disappointment of future days. I take this as just extreme pessimism, but my friends think that I might verge on depressive/suicidal thoughts.

This is a bit different than what I’ve mentioned before, but I also have had bad eating habits in the past, and “punished” myself by eating less than 1000 calories a day for a few weeks. I wouldn’t call this an eating disorder since it was so short, but I do fall into those habits every once in a while, strictly because I don’t like anything about myself. 

I wanted to know what you guys think about all this, I am thinking of seeing a therapist to get a professional diagnosis, but I’m unsure if my problems are normal and I’m just wasting time/money by doing so.",19Nov2019,1
9,"First of all I took 4tyimes of my recommended dose of Klonopin.
I feel like I've always been a sad person. Always drawing gory things since the age of 4(?) Always questioning  why we are alive, what's the purpose of life, is life just this etc. (I'm not saying this to be like ""oh I was a philosopher I'm above the other kids"" I'm saying this because it seems like I didn't feel like I had a purpose in life even when I started believing in God, I was very curious to know what's beyond death but was terrified of the idea of my family and friends dying).
 It bothered me how my classmates had ""crushes"" on others and how everything, Even music, revolved around love(I remember at a very young age asking my dad if there were any songs that didn't talk about love), having a crush for me was just silly and it was very fake like something people do because they think they should do not because they actually have a crush on tha person. I even treated people that had a crush on me like shit for that reason 
. I don't know if it's related but I used to be very loving even 'cheesy' with my mom always said 'i love you ' to my mom but she never said it back. I remember very vividly the last time I said it to her  from then on I became very cold
It makes me sad when people don't care about me.

Anyway thTs just one of the many things that makes me feel that I am a ruined human being and no matter how many pills I take I'm never going to be happy like normal people. Sure I have very Happ y moments in my life, but once that end I remember that my life still goes on N
And I'm never going to feel ok. It's either happy orr shitty and bored. I go to psychologists and psychiatrists but it's always ""oh do this do that"" and it never works they don't tell me what's my problem. Like please tell vme what do I have am I just spoiled an. I just an idiot I rather know what I am/have instead of playing stupid guessing games with them.

I'm writing this because I really wanna die. And I feel like writing letters help just in case I do. I've written and hidden some suicide letters and they say som stuff that I dont agree anymore. 

I've tried to kill myself before two times and I know how it feels, and the feeling is coming back although I don't think I will.

10,"So I am an F 17 (I’m not sure that will matter in this). But I am so lonely. Like it hurts. Not the lonely because im single. But the lonely that’s just having basically no friends (the friends I do have are shitty, I tell more later down) but honestly I am a very boring person. I work and go to school. Other than that I’m at my house or I’m out getting coffee and going to therapy. I don’t hang out with people because I don’t have anyone to hang out with or the people I want to hang out with are busy or I’m just not in the mood to put up with them. The one person that I actually feel like cares about me (outside of my family). Is my 45 year old coworker, I work at Panera and I have only know him for 6 months and I feel like he’s the only friend I have. That’s kinda sad that at 17 my closet friend is 45. I do have two close high school friends. They are very different so they don’t hang out together. One is depressed and has mental health problems, like me. But when I go to her to talk about it, seeking comfort and love. Which I do for  her when she comes to me, I just get a “I get that” and “me too”. So once again I’m alone, and I feel worse. She has become an drug addict. And I have lost my friend, when we would talk she was there but she really wasn’t THERE. You get what I’m Saying? So I don’t really coincider her a friend. My next friend is a boy, which everyone thinks we are dating. Unlike my other friend he is extremely emotional unavailable, when I tell him about my feeling (which I don’t like to share that often)  I get hit this “damn, that sucks” or “oof”. One time I said hi to him and he went “hmm” like what even is that. Then when I’m sad or mad, he will make me forget about it but he’s also one of the main things that make me sad. And I would just drop him but I don’t what him to be alone, because he only really talks to me at school other than his one friend.

12,"So, this has happened a handful of times. Not consistently and not necessarily “provoked” by anything. 

A few months ago, I ate a meal at work and got back to my regular tasks. Out of nowhere, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I convinced myself that I was allergic to something that I ate (I don’t have any food allergies). So I thought the best thing to do was make myself throw up. I did that, and afterwards I still felt like I couldn’t breathe and I thought I might pass out, I then convinced myself that I would pass out on the bathroom floor and nobody would find my body in time before I died from suffocation, so I silently panicked in my office until I calmed down ~20 minutes later. I chalked it up to being a really bad, random panic attack.

Now another time a few weeks ago, I was on the way home from work and I decided to stop somewhere and get a snack. I got a little snack mix and started walking to the front to check out. While I was in line, the thought crossed my mind, “what if my food is drugged?” And I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I checked out with the snack and walked outside just staring at it. I convinced myself that it was tampered with somehow, even though it was sealed and that I would either get sick or high from eating it. I knew it was ridiculous, so I brought it all the way home with me. Even when I got home, I couldn’t get myself to eat it because I couldn’t get the thought out of my head that somebody tampered with it. I threw it away.

Now, just about 30 minutes ago, I made a protein smoothie with Chia seeds in it. I drank some of the smoothie until I thought that I didn’t let the seeds soak long enough. I immediately stopped drinking it, put it in the freezer, and started panicking thinking that the seeds would clog my esophagus because they weren’t soaked thoroughly. I decided the best thing to do to avoid this was to drink a ton of water, and then make myself throw it all up along with the smoothie. 

I don’t know why I convince myself of these things or where the thoughts come from. There have been a few other weird thoughts or occurrences of similar things going through my head, but these are the worst “episodes” I’ve had. I don’t have the money to see a therapist which is why I’m posting this here, in hopes that somebody else might have had some similar experiences and might know what’s going on with my thought process.",19Nov2019,1

but right now, death is really really tempting. i hate anxiety. i fucking hate it. my wrist stings because ri try to distract myself from the constant fear by hurting myself. all i feel is fear. i don’t feel anything but fear anymore. 

i’m terrified that it’s going to stay like that and this cycle is going to be endless.",19Nov2019,1
14,"So lately I have been very frustrated by the way dating has been going for me. And I feel annoyed and angry and I know this comes from partially because of the way my second ex treated me. I  put in tons of effort when I am dating someone, willing to put out such as taking care of someone like when my ex was sick, helping them in any capacity, buying things for them to make them happy, giving them tons of comfort and attention which are things I enjoy doing. Every girl now that I’ve messaged on dating apps who are seeking long term relationships have turned me down either saying, ""They want someone closer"" meanwhile I LIVE literally 20 min or less from them, which is ridiculous. OR saying things like, ""I’m not looking to date anyone atm and no longer using the app anymore"" or when I message them they don’t respond at all.  And honestly, I am not sure if this is mean to say but I can't understand why people are so lazy I don't care how old someone is. I think people use long-distance and other matters as an excuse to make something amazing work. And I know financial can apply to not wanting to do something, which is understandable. But I feel like that is a poor excuse to not give it a chance.  And I don’t understand what the issue is?  I’m respectful, nice, and looking for an actual life partner as I wrote on my profile. I would think considering they are looking for the same they’d know how hard it is to find that since they are using apps, to begin with.  Anyway, I sought advice about the issue on this site.  I spoke with a woman on the website who gave me advice however, some of the things she said did not help me move on from one situation I was speaking about in particular. Then telling me being frustrated about how women are acting on these sites is a turn-off. I mean who wouldn't get mad or frustrated. When you have so much to give and people see how little your value is, it makes me so upset.  I would not accept the advice she gave on some occasions and I would sort of negate it. And honestly, all I wanted was to talk to vent about my frustrations in how lazy people are on these apps and find closure in the particular situation I was in with the one person I really liked.  So when I am venting/frustrated, I become or feel rather strongly about how I feel. And I can't understand why people would not be willing to put in the effort if something good came along.  I have anxiety because I think I must've done something wrong for them to get annoyed because I am venting. And I know not everyone will agree, which is ok. But why can't we disagree and just talk about it? Do you know what I mean? If I feel a specific way, I will stand by it because it is how I feel after all. I love advice and someone else's input but when I feel like it is not helpful Ill be redundant or Ill try to like explain it in a different way to find the closure that way. Anyway, should I feel bad I am not sure?",19Nov2019,1
15,"When I am feeling depressed or full of anxiety, I just go outside and talk a walk. There’s a big field and part of the woods that I could walk around in. There’s a park nearby I could jog at and a few plazas I can walk around. Plus my college has a floor that no one uses so I just walk around the floor and explore each room. I am a homebody but walking outside on a sunny day (or even a lightly rainy day bc I like rain) helps me out.

16,"Hi! So ive been working through some tough depression. Its been a rough 3 years, but Im in a much better place. Im doing well. I can laugh and smile and I have friends, and I'm only infrequently and casually suicidal now. 

I have a lot of internal pain that is silent through the day, but comes out at night when i wonder if I mean anything. If anything I do matters to someone. I often feel a gaping hole where my chest is. I suffer from disassociation. Sometimes i feel so other, I barely feel human, instead i feel like an observer. I think part of it has to do with my gender dysphoria, which for the most part has been alleviated by transitioning. But not all of it. I still feel unlovable (sometimes for real reasons, like being trans, bur other times simply because I feel as though I am a flawed broken human inherently). I feel marked and  i feel lost in a swirl of abstract and no words can fully capture it. Its as though im watching life  trough a giant glass at the aquarium, and the way the water shapes the light makes the dark room look strangely empty. 

Its not sadness. I dont feel sad. I feel empty. I feel lonely. Touch starved. but strangely motivated. Like a grass between the concrete.",19Nov2019,1
17,"I am in the 7th grade and nobody thinks twice when I say I want to kill myself. They think it's only teen angst. I've been pushed into thinking that every kid goes through this, and I really don't know what to think.

I cannot feel love or anything like it. When my family is having fun together, I can only sit and stare and feel a dark dread build up in my chest. It's awful and I hate feeling such a deep negativity when I'm around them. They do not welcome me anymore as I have told them my feelings and outlook on life. They say they don't accept psychopaths in their household.

I do pretty well in school. I get good grades and everything, and usually I get my work done. Kids are kids and they act as such, and it doesn't bother me. But sometimes, I snap for no reason in class or at lunch or anything. I fight anyone I can and like to do so, whether it be verbal or physical. I cuss out kids for no reason and say threats that I mean. Sometimes I tell kids that I'll snap their neck, break their spine, cut them and watch them bleed out, and I don't know where the threats come from. They just appear and as soon as I say it.

I've talked to some councilors but they all say the same thing. ""I just have depression."" But sometimes, it doesn't seem like that. It seems like something much more chaotic. 

I used to say that I wish I were dead or dying somewhere, but nobody cared enough to do anything. They, once again, thought I was kidding. And I tell them that I feel angry all the time and that I'm a hateful, spiteful person, but they say I'm just going though a phase. I don't think they're right, because this has been happening ever since I could remember. After about a year of cutting from time to time, I realized I didn't really want me dead. I'd like to have others die.

I take pleasure in hurting others. I know I manipulate people and use others against others, and I have fun doing so. I know it's an awful thing to like, but I just can't help but enjoy it. I wouldn't mind beating up some kids just because I feel like it. So ever since I could get the thought of killing other kids into my head, it's driven me mad with trying to find ways to do it. So far, I don't have any good plan, but I dream about taking a knife to school. I have no access to guns, just for the record. 

So as of now, I've written a hit list of those I will kill, those I would like dead, and those I don't want to kill myself. That list includes all of my immediate family and over twenty kids at school. I do not know when I plan to do this or if I even will. All I can really say is that I'm miserable and it's either me, or a bunch of other people. And, if I'm not mistaken, people only seem to care about this when I say that I am going to kill others.

I really wish I wasn't so bitter, hateful, and spiteful. Usually I pretend I'm beyond such feelings, but I'm so overwhelmed sometimes and I can tell that deep down, I want to be happy. I'm writing a book and I draw pictures of the places and people and the feelings I'll never know. I draw pictures of flowers and peaceful worlds that bring me peace for just a minute, just a moment. And then I go to school and remember that nobody ever said that life would be good. Yeah, right. Nobody said it needed to be cruel, though.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense. I'm pretty hysterical right now and it's hard to think. Am I really as far gone as I think I am, or is there something I can do to escape?",19Nov2019,1

20,"Hi.  I'll try to make this as brief as possible but please excuse me if I ramble.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been the type of person that needs things to be perfect. If I make a mistake in a drawing, project, writing piece, really anything, I need to throw it away and start over new. Mistakes need to be a calculated part of whatever I'm creating.  What I really mean by this is if I notice something is askew when I thought it was okay before I need to start over anew. I don't know if this is a control issue, a fear issue, or what. I just can't let myself live with having created something imperfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to a point where I can't deny to myself anymore that my life has had some very bad mistakes in it. I have epilepsy. I've been sexually assaulted and have PTSD now because of it. My parents didn't make the best choices in my childhood. I developed an eating disorder which I've recovered from. I've made leaps and bounds in my PTSD and working through my panic attacks. I've been so prideful thinking to myself ""wow, look at all of my hard work paying off!"" And it truly has. I'm doing so much better than I was just a few years ago that you wouldn't even recognize me. But I'm still not okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to feel like I was on fire. I was frantic to improve myself and I kept thinking this intense drive to improve myself would never fade. I'd always be this go-getter that could at least imagine the light at the end of the tunnel.  I guess what it really boils down to is I could put my logical thinking in front of my own believes. I didn't really believe the light was at the end of the tunnel, but I knew I had to go through to find out.  And now I've seen that light and I'm doing so much better.  But I'm not okay still. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My life is so tarnished with bad things, bad mental health, bad me. I want to throw myself away and start over on a clean sheet. The real question here is how do I accept that these things have happened. I don't want to admit I'm struggling. I don't want to victimize myself or think of myself as weak. I want to be strong. I want to be someone worth being. But is there any point in living a life as an epileptic? 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing keeping me going is that I have a job. I work with people with IDDs. I have a use and I'm a contributing member of society. People need me to keep things functioning. But take that away and I'm nothing. I'm inherently flawed as a human.  My brain can't even work properly on its own. A lot of times I feel like I'm just taking up space that a more able person could be using, a space that someone could be doing better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a bad person. Not in a moral sense. Why should I even exist if I'm just taking up the space a normal person could take? Even if I took away the rape, the eating disorder, the panic attacks, the ptsd, I'm still flawed. I'll never be an okay person. I'm just bad. No matter how much I work to be useful, to serve others, to live for them, I'm still taking up the space someone without epilepsy could be using. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry there's so much self-pity. I just feel like nothing I ever do will ever make up for what I am.",19Nov2019,1

23,"Hey all, thanks for reading. I'm a 25 year old guy and I am still haunted by the awful treatment my peers showed me way back in grade school. From Elementary to High School, I was picked on and bullied and put down so much that I have never had any real self-esteem to speak of.  I got through small periods of intense narcissism where I feel like I'm way better than I really am, but those moments are short-lived.  


An old photo of me and my friend from way back in 9th grade (11 years ago) popped up in my Facebook memories recently and checking the comments on the picture, my peers were so hateful towards me. I never did anything rude or mean to them, but they felt the need to pick on me. It was just a picture of me and my friend sitting on a couch -- and one person commented something like ""if X person was there, it would show everything wrong with the world) and even now, reading that hurts me. I just wanted to fit in and have friends like any other normal teenager but I was faced with such hate and vitriol that I felt completely worthless. I still do, even.   


Despite all of that being in the past though, it really took a big toll on my ego and self-esteem. All these years I've hated my own guts and felt I'd be better off dead, despite knowing logically that it's all just emotional bullshit. At this point I'm in self-imposed isolation from the few friends I do have still just because I don't feel worthy enough to be apart of their lives; which I also know is emotional bullshit. I just still feel like that same 15 year old boy deep down inside who can't cope with all the hate and negativity. It's made me so, so scared to live and be the person I am and despite knowing better through reason, my emotions are hell-bent on convincing me otherwise. How can I move past all of this? I've been in therapy and on medication since I was 7 so I feel really lost... almost like my life is already forfeit.",19Nov2019,1
24,"I'm so tired of dealing with this. I'm tired of hating myself and the things I say/do. I'm tired of thinking I am a burden on everyone, even on those who try to help me. Even on those who probably do care for me. I just convince myself that I am a bother and an annoyance on them. I convince myself that they don't care and that they think I'm faking. Even if I have a good day at school and act like myself, it doesn't mean that I am 100% better. I go home, and think about the day. I think of how I may have embarrassed myself. Why people think I am an idiot. I tear myself up. Then because of those good days, I feel like I am not allowed to have a bad day, because if I do people with think I am faking. They will just think ""Oh she was fine yesterday there isnt anything major wrong"". The truth is, I wish I didn't exist. I wish I wasnt in this cycle of hating myself and not being happy. I don't get joy anymore from my one passion. The one thing that used to excite me doesn't. It's like I don't want to die, but don't want to be here. Everyday though, multiple times a day, I think of how I could end it all if I really wanted to. It's a thought that can pop out of nowhere. I want to tell someone about it, but there are a few problems.
1. First of all I would need the courage to do so. I mean how does someone even tell someone they are thinking of ending it?
2. The only person I want to tell is a teacher. I've known her for 4 years and we have gotten close. She has already had to talk to my counselor about my mental health after approaching me over a month ago with concern. However it wasnt this bad back then. If I tell her about my thoughts, she would be required to report it. She might not even care though. That's what I keep telling myself. What if she thinks I am faking it? Is telling her better than not telling anyone? 
3. If I tell her, and my parents find out, will they get mad that I didnt go to them first? I'm just better at telling my teacher personal things since she has been the one to approach me multiple times before. I cant tell my parents super personal things about me. So I feel like the option is either my teacher or no one.

25,"Hello... I've just found this subreddit while searching for mental breakdown.

So... Today I gave up and finally had a mental breakdown.

The story is long. Like... Way to long so to summarize the whole thing,

The girl that I deeply in love with, let's call her Kaleido, is going to marry in December 14. Yeah. She knows that I love her and once upon a time she loved her me back but I fucked everything up. I stayed at her side until now cause just like me, she had mental issues and I saved her from suicide multiple times. But the thing is... I'm not mad at her. Not at all. I'm angry at myself. 
I'm mad at myself because I wasn't able to hold her 
I'm mad at myself because I was afraid at the time and I fucked everything. 
I'm mad because I'm a father afraid that my son will hate me for whatever reason 
I'm just desapointed with myself because I have someone who loves me and today I realized that I don't love her as much as she loves me. 

Kaleido was the one. She is the one and when she told me that she was going to marry, I lost it. She didn't want to tell me, but we know each other so well that I can tell just by her way of texting me (we live in different states). And I went nuts. I lifted up from my desk at work, walked to the elevator without saying a thing to anyone. And once I exit the building I just started crying. I walked to somewhere I could be almost alone and continued to cry myself out. I couldn't stop. I haven't came back to work. I went straight home. I left all my stuff there. My fiancé didn't understood anything but I said that I was fine.

But I'm not fine.

I'm broken. I hate myself. I'm a terrible future husband and I can't stop myself getting desapointed with my life. I screwed up. It's my fault that Kaleido it's not with me. I love her. I don't know what to do... Other than saying that it's fine all the time just to stop crying.

26,"I go through these phases where even on medication, I start getting very impulsive and I have this desire for change even if it’s bad change, aka self-destructive.

Like my girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half, like I love her a lot but suddenly I’ve convinced myself I don’t and never have, and that I should break up with her. She’s never done anything to hurt me or stress our relationship— I know that without her I’d be devastated and I’d regret it but I have the very strong impulse to end it. I cry and I throw a fit inside myself because I know I shouldn’t do that, I know I need to find something else like a better outlet or meet people and make friends to give myself some variety instead but idk how to make friends. I don’t have any money to really go out and do something like go to a bar, or whatever else adults do— club? I dunno. Like, I don’t even know what to do with myself, what I would do if I could go out and meet people.

She does have a history of cutting herself and schizophrenia, but it’s gotten better since we’ve been together as I can support her. She texted me tonight and simply said that she’d gone to a counselor for help and they recommended her there and she said yes. She mentions she hears voices. Again I’m so sorry for the awful formatting and all that bad stuff, but is there really a known time that she’s going to be gone? I can’t really live without her and it’s going to be tough.

Every kind word I read helped motivate me to continue on my upward conjecture, and I’m happy to say that a week later I’m still feeling wonderful.

30,"X-post from /r/microdosing because I'm not sure my post went through.

\--

Throwaway to avoid judgment by friends and family. 34 male if it's important.

New to microdosing, but have done preliminary reading and research to prepare myself for the first time. That being said, I am flat out terrified.

I've spent my entire adult life controlling every thought to fit the exact vision I have for myself. I'm prone to night terrors, sleep paralysis, and panic attacks. I'm accustomed to the first two, but my experiences with the last are what make me reluctant to microdose. My biggest panic attack - about four months ago - had me hugging my knees in my shower, crying to my wife about something trying to climb through the drain to get at me. I sleep maybe two or three nights a week with the lights on because I see stuff in the shadows.

I want to try microdosing so badly because I want to alleviate my depression. But I'm scared that if I give my brain a chance to go untethered, I'm going to experience something I'm subconsciously holding back. I'm scared to relinquish control.

Should I just go for broke and try it?",19Nov2019,1

35,"This has been going on for a few weeks now. I'm totally fine for a couple weeks, then one day I feel horrible. I experience self hatred that makes me want to stop being myself. I don't necessarily want to die, but sometimes I want to stop being me so badly that I consider the possibility of ending my life. Then the next day when I go to school, I act totally normal and the feelings are numbed somewhat, then I feel it again as soon as I'm alone. Then after a couple days it's almost completely gone for a week or so. Then the dysphoria (unrelated to gender; that's how the term is used most often, but the symptoms of general dysphoria perfectly match up with mine) hits again.

A couple weeks ago this happened and every evening for the rest of the week I just laid down and listened to music for hours. Then one night it was just gone. And now it's back again.

During those times I just think about how much I hate myself. The rational part of my mind knows that there's really not really a good reason for it, but it happens anyway. I think about interactions with people and how much they must hate me for doing or saying something slightly rude. Again, I know intellectually that this probably isn't true, but that doesn't stop it. Sometimes this devolves into me hating everyone back. On the worst nights I wish I didn't exist and think about suicide. I think about how I can't live like this anymore and will probably give in and kill myself. But then the next morning everything is just numb.

A lot of people say that self hatred is a good motivation for self improvement, but for me it just kills any motivation I have for doing anything to improve myself, even getting help. Like I said, it doesn't follow logic.

The abuse I went through from my ex last year was fucking traumatizing , and somehow I pushed it down enough to let someone in . ( I know this is a mental health thing but I'm getting to that part.) Anyway , I was a dancer for three years and I hardly struggled , I met my abuser and quit that life , a year went by that he abused drugs and abused me too . I got out , tried to start over again , and I met someone   he's so wonderful. I wish he would let me love him , he doesn't trust me and literally if we're not fucking were fighting . I FEEL like I make him miserable 😔 I'm trying my best to show him that he can be loved without having so many trust issues but it always comes back on me . For example , it was 2 am , some random that I don't even know hit me up on FB messenger and I tried to not let him see it because I didn't want him to freak out . It was a huge ass fight , I'm a liar , I'm hiding shit , I'm untrustworthy. Fast forward to the other day , my roommates baby dad writes me and says hey , ( this was awhile ago ) I guess I forgot about it and said he didn't write me , then my memory got jogged and I admitted he did , that blew the fuck up into a bunch of shit too.  Long story short really im at the end of my fucking rope with my life . After all I've been through I feel like all these fucking problems just don't stop . I feel like my past is always going to be there to haunt me . God damn it I'm really trying here , im trying to be better . I can't stop this feeling of just wanting to fucking die , God damn I am fucking TIRED OF MY FUCKING LIFE. I have zero outlets . I have no fucking one to talk too . Nobody to just get me the fuck out of this feeling . It hurts a lot, I just feel like nothing will ever change or get better .

The business is doing well, it picked up fast, and has already began supplementing the income I was making. So financially, it’s okay.

But that place is still eating at me. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 7 years ago. This old job is constantly in the back of my mind. The people there, everything, it haunts me. I have panic attacks over it and anytime someone mentions it or someone there(I still speak to one girl I worked with there), I immediately start physically shaking. When that happens, I start to panic again because I just want the feeling to stop and idk what to do.

Earlier this month my dad called to let me know how much he despises me and that I ruined their lives/marriage and my moms mental health. My boyfriend of 3 years was cheating on me so for a bit I didn’t know where I was going to live and if I could afford rent on my own. I got a new (better thankfully) job so I had to get used to doing something I’ve never done before and get good at it, quick.

All I truly want are parents but I try to talk to my mom and after 10 minutes she’s bored of me. I can’t afford therapy on my own. I know I’ll have to figure it out. Work is all I barely have energy for. I come home and I’m exhausted. I usually sleep and still wake up tired. I’m tired of being tired. I hadn’t self harmed in about two years and unfortunately broke that a few nights ago.

56,"An incident happened a few nights ago involving my best friend and my partner. We were having a get together and we got pretty drunk/high. They’d both shown interest in each other prior to this night and we’d actually talked about “messing” around together before. That night, my friend reassured me that they’d never sleep/mess around with my partner unless I said it was okay (and repeated this at least three times to reassure me after I said I wasn’t comfortable with it). I trusted them wholeheartedly, and I trusted my partner. 

My partner came clean three days later. In a text, he told me how when I left to get food for us, he and my best friend started getting really close... like... I’ll spare you the details but close enough to matter but not close enough to count as sex. He said my friend even asked to take it to the bedroom, to which he replied no, of course, out of respect for me (which is something my “friend” doesn’t seem to have for me). After learning about this I forgave my partner because of his genuine concern and honesty. I then confronted my best friend and that’s when it all went downhill. 

Not only did I not get an apology, but I also didn’t get a conversation, and they didn’t even ask if I was feeling okay. I told them I was upset and that I’ve been crying nonstop for the past two days—still no sign of empathy or any interest in my well being. Today, I got a text from them joking about the whole thing and it felt like a dig at me. I snapped at them for it and didn’t get a reply. I later apologised for my behaviour before realising how desperate I am and how low I’ve positioned myself here. I shouldn’t be the one apologising, but I can’t help it because I really don’t want to lose my friend. The bar was set so fucking low that all they had to say was sorry.

Anyway, I did some thinking about the reason I was actually upset. Because I’m not mad at my partner and I’ve never really been a jealous person with him (he also was remorseful, apologised, and has been talking me through this since). But I’m absolutely livid just thinking about my best friend going behind my back, lying to me, and completely disregarding my feelings and emotional well-being. They’re known for being emotionally distant and having questionable morals, but we’re really close and I thought for me maybe they’d put in a little more effort. I think I’ve apologised three times myself for either not replying or being angry, and I’ve had no reciprocation at all. I’ve given them so many chances and knowing me I’ll probably move on and let this slide with the fear of losing someone I genuinely care for. 

I’m possibly seeing them later tonight. I’d appreciate advice on how to stay composed. I’m very sensitive right now and I don’t want to burst onto tears when I see their face. I need to think of a way to talk about my betrayal without reacting to it so that it doesn’t scare them away. I’d also appreciate anyone else who can relate to this situation. It’d be nice not to feel alone. 

Another issue is that I’m currently in therapy for a possible bipolar or borderline personality diagnosis (public health system here takes like two weeks to process anything) so im a bit wary of my reactions right now in case they’re irrational. I also have anxiety... so with that it’s often difficult to pin point when I’m over thinking.

I’m sorry for venting, it’s just that the two people I usually go to with this have betrayed me, so that would be kinda awkward.",19Nov2019,1
57,"Hi, so I’ve struggled with eating disorders in the past and what I assume is body dysmorphia. I put immense value on aesthetics and the way I look and am perceived. I believe that I have to be thin to be attractive. 

I feel as though lately I’m constantly taking two steps forward and one step back. I had gotten out of a Psychiatric hospital in January and was put on some medication that made me gain 20lbs. For someone with body issues this didn’t do wonders for my brain. I’ve been so self conscious ever since. Even more than I was before.  I don’t want my partner to touch me or look at me. I feel like I have to hide under huge clothes and I want to be invisible.

I only feel worthy or attractive when I’m small. 
On top of this he has a beautiful tall, leggy, thin, busty, shiny teeth, blonde haired best friend. Essentially everything I’m not. I feel like I’m under water when I’m around her, like I can’t breathe and I need to leave because the comparison of how disgusting I am makes me want to leave this planet. It’s not that I don’t trust my partner, or think that he’s going to cheat, I just don’t see any reason why anyone would want to stay with me when girls like that exist.  It feels like he’s settling for me.

Although my partner tries to reassure me when I come to him feeling poorly  (he finds me attractive, loves me) I feel like there’s an underlying want for him to have a girl who’s traditionally beautiful. He never goes out of his way to compliment me, even if I dress up nice or something, it’s a rarity to hear that he thinks I’m beautiful :-/
 I feel sick to my stomach thinking I’m always going to feel like this. 

TLDR; I feel so insecure all the time it’s eating me up and affecting my relationship.",19Nov2019,1
58,"I’ve been battling,battling and battling my own thoughts.  I’ve built this entire life that is all at risk of crumbling. I live in constant fear of any of my past discretions being brought to light and ripping my sanity and comfort from my hands. My entire world will collapse upon itself.  This is the war. I have a muddied past of infidelity, drug use, homosexuality, been sexually abused, alcoholic non existent father, woozy of a mother , and now learning i may in fact be bi polar and/or suffer from severe anxiety.  Yes , I thought anxiety was a “Pussy “ feeling or a cop out excuse. Neglected my symptoms for years. Now I’m stuck trying to battle all these and still be productive day to day and I’m losing.  Side note , being in the middle class financially is not helpful when seeking mental health  help.  I need help or someone to talk to but unfortunately there is no practical for me to currently have time to set aside to visit a therapist.  Hoping maybe there is a community I could join or books people have read to help them?  I am so new to all this and been keeping everything suppressed for so long I feel like I did my self a disservice and now find my self panicking it may be to late.  
Not sure if any of these other things matter to my issues but here are few other things about me.
     Bottle it up then explode type of anger management 
     Introverted naturally but often the loudest or the one holding down court when in group. It’s weird but everyone naturally flocks to me a generally enjoy my company. Also really great at making new friends.
  Trust issues 
   Only sleep 3-4 hours tops per night, sometimes just small 30min naps 
     Probably seems like I just vomited all this nonsense out and am all over the place but i don’t know where to begin or where I’m even at.",19Nov2019,1
59,"What do you guys do/think to get yourself through the day and be actually productive ?

I have no energy no matter  how much I sleep or nap or eat. Even if I start doing one task I get Exhausted very quick. 

I make all these lists in my head of things to do and ways to treat myself if I do them, or sometimes I try to take the no pressure approach and just do things as I need to and I still can’t do it.

60,I decided to go on a cruise by myself and now I’m regretting it because I’m a very quiet/shy person with severe social anxiety.  As I’ve been following the group chat for the cruise and I just happened to see that there was someone else also having anxiety issues.  I posted to this person that I was also having anxiety and offered to hang out but I didn’t get a response so now I feel fuckin stupid for even trying.,19Nov2019,1
61,"Recently Ive been feeling immensely alone, I miss my friends. Yeah I could call, I get that! But why havent they? I never really got into social media (snap, IG) so I feel like without that presences nobody remembers me. 

I know people move on in life but why does it feel like im left behind? Ivwould love to make new friends but I always feel when talking to a women Its like this subconcious feeling that im trying to ""get to know them"" and I feel guilty thinking like that since im in a relationship. And talking to dudes is weird, feels like trying to make friends with a co-worker, you have an idea who they are at work but nothing about after hours. 

I know I have trust issues and yet the worst part is I can't even seem to trust myself, im not suicidal but feels like the urge is on my mind alot more recently. Im not sure if im thinking it because im afraid to be alone or afraid to be alone with myself? 

I have tried to contact people but they are either busy or just not interested is my best guess. I want to get out more but Im not good in crowded places, I wont break down but I tense up or start to vibrate and to ease that I bounce my leg, tap, play with my pocket knife ect. I just want to know what its like to live again, I don't want to feel Alone and afraid of who or what im becoming. I hate how passive I am and how people walk all over me even though I would litteraly sacrifice myself for a fucking spider. It kills me that I love everything living but I cant seem to get people to love me or be around me

62,"Sure it's bad. Sure, I know I shouldnt. I've been trying the whole ""self love"" shit. And then I might feel a little better. I might have a good day or two. Hell, maybe even a good week if I'm lucky. 

But then something happens. Something small, big, whatever. And then I remember how I'm shit and I hate myself. 

Two and a half months ago, a good friend killed himself. A year ago he invited me to move into his house, two days before he asked, I had agreed to move in with two other friends. Otherwise I'd have said yes. For the two months leading to his suicide, I was meaning to ask if the offer still stood. Since I met him a year and a half ago, I've wanted to ask him to go drinking, but just never did. And now hes 6 feet under. 
Last time I saw him was in a fucking coffin where the fucking coroner or whoever did an absolute shit job. Everyone says how it looks like the dead person is sleeping. He didnt. He looked dead. And that's the last time I saw him. In a fucking coffin with purple lips. 

Last week my great uncle died, as well as a buddy I went to high school with. I didnt know them very well, but when I had met my uncle, he was cool. And the dude from high school, one of very few people I was hoping I'd run into one day, get to know them. They were all good people. 

Last night my ex was texting me about how she tried to kill herself last week, and she really needed someone. I was exhausted and wanted a night to myself, and told her I couldnt do anything besides text her. I could have hung out with her or called her, but I didnt. On one hand, yes. She is very manipulative, but on the other hand. I know she wasnt lying about needing someone. And I fucking bailed. 

And now, tonight, I get a text from my mom telling me to pay up. I owe them money for my phone bill and my car. My parents are good people, and I've been an absolute cunt of a kid. 

My dad is about to lose his job. They're not really well off with money, and given my current life situation, theres not really any way I could pay them back until a few months from now. Most of the time when I talk to my mom, its about money and how I owe them. It's just how she is, straight to the point. It baffles me that there are people who consider their family their best friends. When I relate to any family member, it's just an awkward conversation. I want to have good relationships with them. But when your whole life has been ""this is right, and this is wrong."" and you suddenly believe differently, how do you do that? How do you build a relationship when it's always either an awkward conversation, or theres just not a spark between personalities? Or when theres just built up resentment from past shit. 

I'm the black sheep, the non christian. The youngest son who watched my older brothers fuck up, then come back to be decent people. My sister has also done pretty well in life.  And here I am. Just trying to stay afloat, fully expecting to die from suicide one day if life doesnt kill me first. 

I'm not suicidal right now. But I usually think very rationally/realistically. And given my track record, I'll be suicidal again at some point. And statistically, i imagine I'll become just another number. I know that suicide causes ripples that would deeply effect my loved ones, and even people I dont even know, or havent met. Hell, I lost two solid friendships because of me being an asshole after my friend's suicide. And theres potential for that to become four. 

Going back to the first paragraph, sure. I feel better than I have in a long time. But I can tell you that that is because I finally got perscribed ADHD meds  that work. So I can actually fucking think like a normal human.  But how long is that going to last? With so much shit that keeps piling on regarding money, I'm fucked and cant get actual psychiatric help. 

I hate myself for thinking all of this. And I feel that its justified.",19Nov2019,1
63,"Sometimes I can’t help but think about scenarios that involve hurting someone who has hurt my boyfriend

For example i imagine someone trying to start a fight with him and imagine myself harming that person to protect him

64,"    For over a week now I’ve been feeling like I’m the only person truly alive, and I’m kind of in a simulation sort of deal. I feel like God may be in control of the sim, or maybe even a group of people, and they’re trying to message me. I’m bad at de-coding, but I’ve found a few. 
    I know deep deep down that this is crazy and can’t be happening, but it’s getting so hard to believe. The only times I feel real is when I look at my family, and even then I still feel distant. Nothing seems to disprove these thoughts either, I mean, of course people say “I’m real!” Because that’s what I’m supposed to think. 
    These aren’t the only oddities I’ve been facing. Since early October I’ve been experiencing panic attacks and lots of paranoia. (The paranoia has been around for much longer though) Before I realized that nothing is real, I thought someone was stalking and trying to kill me. Again, I knew deep down it can’t be happening, but yet I still believed. 
    Once I was riding in the backseat of a car and I felt as though someone was going to shoot me. I could feel on my head where the bullet would hit too. It was very dark out so my family didn’t see my face, thankfully. 
    Right before the first and worst panic attack, I was looking at myself in the mirror. All the noises around me were driving me insane, and I kept feeling like something was right behind me. I looked at myself and it just wasn’t me. I don’t know how to explain it, but it just wasn’t.


    My mom has only really seen my occasional panic attacks and helped me get through them, and knows some of my weird habits from being scared. I want to tell her the rest, I know she’d believe me, but I just hate having people worry about me like that, and I don’t want to seem different. She wants to get me to talk to someone she knows to see what the next step to take is, but it hasn’t been a priority because I haven’t talked about “the worst of it”. 

    I just want to know what’s happening and how to make it stop.",19Nov2019,1
65,"So I started writing my feelings down in 8th grade and it might have saved my life, I started to get happier, but then shit hit the fan, I watched my dad die twice, I was in a shooting, and then I was in a horrible bike accident blocking me from the trip I had been waiting for all summer, anyways here is that writing from 8th grade 
 

I just kinda feel weird I guess, I mean I'm happy but, it just feels like I have a bandaid over a gaping wound that needs stitches. I guess that band aid must be my bikes, the joy I feel when a new part arrives or I get a new bike is immeasurable. I still dont know what the wound is. When I think about it I have really thought about hitting the quit button since I was 6. I was hit hardest when I was in the beginning of the 8th grade, I didnt like the friend group I had at the time since I thought they all hated me. After I just stopped thinking it all felt better, I feel like I should talk to someone about this but i always feel awkward around people and am just kind of these at events, no importance or anyone to talk to, just kind of there. I can still get out the occasional statement but then I cringe at myself for saying that all night until I finally fall asleep, I dont really dream any more because most of my life is just sitting there following directions and never doing anything extra, when faced with decisions that can lead to things I like I just freeze because I haven't been able to develop any interests that I can interact with in my every day life. If I end it all and are reading this, it probably wasnt your fault, you might have just tipped the scales or something, I just kinda feel that dying will just kinda be like, now I guess, not having any emotions, not being interesting in anything, being just kinda there. I am writing this in hope to just let it all out, if you see this I have gained confidence I dont need a councilor or are just looking back on how I felt. Some people just kinda dont understand what emptiness is like because they always some kind of thing driving their will to live. When asked me or my mom dont know what motivates me neither does my dad, and I think that might be a problem, if I had some sort of driving force I feel like I could do great things but right now I just feel like a waste of oxygen, I never contribute, all because I know that this poster probably wont effect my future life, but the addition of all that extra work is supposed to add up I guess, school has never pushed my limits(if I have any) but when more things are pushed on us it stresses me out and it usually isn't even challenging, just the same level as the lower kids and it kind of pushes me down with them with schools type of teaching, I guess all of this adds up to that gaping wound huh. I always feel like I'm just not liked or when I do something extra it's just kinda looked down soon as normal. I normally just sit around watching youtube to escape the constant down looking voices of others in my head the thoughts of not being good enough pester me every day but at the end of each day when asked how my day was I just say""good"" out of instinct to the point if I did something good I would say something along the lines or wait it was great but if it was bad it never went below ok. Alot of people as I see it are just ignorant and happy and I'm kinda jealous. I still like my intelligence and all but it just a keeps egging on the thought that I will never amount to anything in my life. I always wonder, is there anyone else going through the same thing? If so I wish there was an easy way to escape for all of us besides councilling (I font like face to face interaction, text seems easier to me, online is where I can feel confident and if all goes wrong I cant hear their down looking voices in my head. The worst part is nobody can tell that anything is wrong unless the voices go an extra 5 miles. Biking has just been a way to forget but not fix. I frankly dont know how to fix it. I hope this isn't a mindless suicide note where I will mindlessly walk out in front of a semi in a few hours, but if I think about this it just makes me more sad, it's like being in a room with a nuclear substance, if I stay on the opposite side of the room I slowly reach the point of death but it is inevitable but if I go near it I start to die fast but I might find a way to stop it. But there is always the chance that there is no stopping it and I will die from it anyways sooner or later.
I just feel if I open up no one will understand it and I will be sent away from the only things i found that will slow my decay. I just want some sort of gift that i will like that will just in appreciation of always doing the right thing when I'm supposed to and not fucking everything up. Ever. Just one thing that I can have better than everyone else, just one special thing I can talk about, just one thing that makes me stand out. Please. Save me from this torture.",19Nov2019,1
66,I’ve been having some interesting new mental developments that has made me realize that for a long time I was able to cope but also suppressed a lot of things. Zoloft also did not help and I got off of it a little while ago.  I started pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. Then something snapped after talking to my past abuser. I started remembering things. Bad things. I started acting like a toddler. I even took up a different name. Then after that I did some digging. I have many messages that I don’t remember sending to people. I don’t remember important events out with my son. Apparently I have been doing a lot more than I remember. This confused me so much.

71,"I've been doing bad in terms of mental health for years, but couldn't exactly figure out what my ""problem"" was.
Recently, I described what i go through to my psychology teacher, and she said my experiences resemble symptoms of bipolar.
What I go through is basically, I get very depressed/suicidal and just overall sad and hopeless for a certain time, and then I ""switch"" (I say switch because the change of mood is very sudden) to being very very inspired, happy, hopeful, confident and productive. It's like suddenly I'm not depressed anymore and I'm super convinced that my life is fixed and I am amazing and so on. Every time I am in these ""heightened"" moods, I feel 100% convinced I will never be depressed again and that I am ""healed"".  And then at some point I crash and it's sadness and despair and self hatred all over again. The contrast inbetween ""happy me"" and ""sad me"" is striking - peoole tell me I seem like a whole another person. Sometimes the changes in my mental state are very sudden (I can go through both depression and extreme bappiness in the samd day), sometimes the periods of happiness and sadness last longer, weeks or months. No matter how many times I've gone through these alternations, every time I am ""happy"" again, I am fully convinced that ""this time is the time, this time I'm REALLY finally healed and everything is fine and I'll never be sad again ever"". And then at some point, all over again, I go back to hopelessness.

I know humans aren't naturally nocturnal, and I can't seem to force myself to sleep with melotonin either (I should state, I have a doctor's appointment soon, where we will discuss sleeping and wake-up medication alongside my SSID).

For the aforementioned wake-up meds, I do know my depression is significantly stronger when I wake up, no matter the time.

Maybe some other factor is at play that I'm unaware of but one of you knows because you've been through it. This is my first post on the sub too, but that shouldn't matter much.

74,"Everything began with my first real relationship. My first girlfriend was my junior year of high school and it was the first time i ever truly cared about someone other than myself. She came from a very troubled home, never met her dad and her mom was a reforming alcoholic who at the time was in the middle of a relapse causing her to be abusive and lose her job leaving them with basically nothing. Our second date was at her house and her mother slit her wrists while i was there leading to them leaving to the hospital and me sitting in the apt alone. I didnt know how to deal with any of this and so i enabled all of my gf habits bc i came from nothing but privilege and so dodnt know how to help. This included letting her exceed the sexual limitations she believed in, drinking, and eventually started smoking weed. All of which i enabled and picked up myself. Eventually she wised up to the fact that even tho we may have loved eachother it was toxic bc i wasnt mature enough to realize i was allowing her to hurt herself. This left me fucked up to this day bc i feel nothing but guilt and confusion, without closure since it came out of nowhere. I eventually graduated and am now in college.

My senior year of hs i was super withdrawn and depressed, our relationship was completely integrated into our friends so when it ended our friend group splintered a bit leaving me feeling so alone. I started working at a restaurant 40+ hours a week and playing vball whenever i wasnt working which i love both of them but it was unhealthy only getting a 5 hours of sleep every night and many of those hours were shitty sleep or crying or feeling empty. It had felt like she took who i was with her when she left and we never really spoke afterwards. When we ended she said that she wouldnt date in hs again but ended up dating her best friends older brother which hurt so much bc it made me feel like everything she told me was a lie and that i wasnt good enough for her (at the time i totally wasnt tho after the things i allowed her to do when sad).

When i finally moved to college i basically had nothing. I thought i was ready bc my home town just had a lot of regrets even tho i loved the place but when i moved to school i felt so lost. Everything ik and loved was so far away and so disconnected from my new world that i felt the world wasnt even real. It didnt help that the school was only about 1400 ppl and 4 sqaure block campus with a large yet pretty shitty and empty town around it. Its really easy to get bored and fall into a routine that dont include actually really seeing ppl. And even when i did see people i wouldnt even enjoy it or know how to talk to them which i hate more than anything bc that used to be what i enjoyed most, just bullshitting with my friends. I started smoking weed basically everyday within the first month. I ended up getting arrested for having weed in my room which hurt my mental state even more. I never told my parents and dealt with everything on my own in fear that they would find out, something that is really hard to do alone as an 18 year old who has never really had to do much for himself. By the end of the year i ended up meeting a girl who i actually connected with for the first time since my break up but then after our first real date which we spent 6 hours just talking in her room she then decided didnt actually feel anything. This shook me to my very core leading me to not really sleep or eat for the last two or three weeks of school including finals.

After that i ended up making some appts with a counselor and ended up getting some med to help. They worked really well and i ended up meeting another girl that actually had been fucked over by that girl i just mentioned. Fast forward to now and i am in the middle of my sophomore year. Im dating that girl from the summer but my dissociation is returning and im starting to get back into not caring about anyone again including her which is stupid since she is so amazing and perfect. 

I stopped smoking weed this past summer for the most part but once school started i started again. Almost exclusively at night now which is better than it had been but im starting to think a lot of my change in attitude and dissociation is caused by smoking so idk what to do anymore bc its honestly the only thing i look forward to bc its an escape from reality and i can just sink into happy thoughts and tv.

Today I finally reported him to my hometown police anonymously because I befriended him on Facebook and saw that over half his friends list was young children and mostly males. I decided that if I allowed him to continued to play “doctor” with someone like he did with me, than I’d have to do something about it or I’d feel even more regrets.

Winter is my toughest season because of anniversary dates and my symptoms have elevated a lot since daylight savings. 

The only thing holding me back is that I don’t wanna deal with the trial and errors of finding the right combination. I don’t want weight gain or any major side effects. I also don’t want to be numb either and zombified.  I am aware that it takes a few weeks to a couple months to achieve full benefits. I want them to help in combination with therapy.

I’m high functioning despite my mental health. It is that much harder because I would appear solid on the outside but would be devastated on the inside to the point of needing meds and therapy. Sadly, I’ve always felt that meds were wimpy or weak because I have a couple family members that rely on them to function. In the end, I don’t really feel like relying on them but know it’s for the better.


I guess here’s my questions: 

What was your experience with meds and finding the right combination or dosage? 

How bad are the side effects? 

For those that found the right combination, is it worth all the trouble of finding the combo to improve your symptoms?",19Nov2019,1

This kind of attack is not common here at all. Then I read about burglaries happening down the road from me. I quickly developed anxiety about this happening to me, Im suspicious of every car or person passing the house, I feel like I'm not protected at home despite locking every door and closing every window and having CCTV cameras. I am now losing sleep over it and am finding myself having fits of crying through fear. This is really unlike me and I don't know how to cope.

I hate feeling sorry for myself. I hate the feeling of being down every single day. Sure I have some great days once in a while, but it doesn’t feel like enough...

I was so close one time, to end it all... if I stood in the railings for 30 seconds more, I would’ve been dead, and people would first find out a couple of hours later... 
I just stood in shock, realising what was going on, what I was about to do, and I just sat down and began crying silently... like I always do. 
So close...

What would people think?


I was a dumbass at my last session and forgot to tell my therapist that my sister was coming with me, as we were going to talk about my past, instead of how I was feeling...
I always hid how I truly felt inside for my family... 
it was a terrible situation, since my therapist could tell everyone was uncormfortable - my sister had to leave because I opened up, and she was scared... I would be too if I was her. She never heard me say such things out loud before, and I began to cry... 
it was my first time crying in front of my therapist whom I had been seeing for a year by now... and I scared my sister away...

My sister had reassure me that I didn’t scare her, and she tried to explain how the situation really was, even tried to make jokes, because she could see how sad I was...
I just don’t believe her... because she’s just as bad as me for hiding things....

I just want to dissapear, if it means by death, or just start a new life? I’m not sure...
But I made a promise to my therapist that I wouldn’t do it - but it’s getting really hard lately... 

Been up all night, and I have to be at work in less than a hour..... 

I feel so terrible... I just need to get it out, somewhere... anywhere...

84,"I'm  married to a wonderful woman who suffers from anxiety and depression.  She's had an effective medication regimen for most of the time I've known her, and despite occasional breakthrough panic attacks has done impressively well.  She's kind, funny, smart, loved by everybody, and breathtakingly beautiful.  She's also the strongest person I know.  Every day she's fought this battle in her own head against an invisible enemy and, more often than not, she's won.  If I wasn't utterly in love with her I would still respect the hell out of her. 

Last year we decided to try to conceive, and this April our daughter was born.  She's as perfect as we could possibly have hoped for, and my wife has been a wonderful mother to her.

During conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, though, my wife had to go off the meds that had worked for her for so long.  Her choices were limited, and nothing she could take really worked that well for her.  She changed meds, which was hell, then changed again to a medication that ramped her anxiety up to the extreme.  She quit sleeping and barely ate. She's since changed meds a third time, although the washout from the second set of meds was a unique kind of hell for her.  Somewhere in there she was briefly suicidal.  It's all kind of a blur for both of us. 

It's been over a year, now, since she's been on meds that actually work for her.  Her psychiatrist of ten years is retiring and we need to find a new one, which can be a trial.  She's hesitant to change meds a fourth time, even though she's done breastfeeding, not knowing what a new psyche will want to put her on, and she's intimidated to start interviewing new psychiatrists because, well, it's intimidating. 

I've watched the daily, constant anxiety creep back into my wife.  The cynicism.  The depression.  The hopelessness.  I've watched the walls come up between her and everybody, including me.  Especially me.  She's so distant from me now, although she would argue that she's fine.  It's been so long since she's felt normal that I think her baseline has shifted.  Her temper has turned hair-trigger and her patience is gone.  She's still a wonderful mother, but she has little patience for anything else besides our daughter.  She's missed weeks of work at a time.  

I'm losing her.  I'm literally watching her slip away from me. I've been trying to get her to set up an appointment with a new psyche for six weeks and she's avoiding it.  I think she's given up and accepted that this is just the way things are.  That, and she's justifiably terrified of changing meds again.   I love her so much and watching her change and recede day by day is breaking my heart.  I would do anything for her and I can do nothing.  Nothing at all.  I'm so fucking sad and hopeless right now.  I have no idea what to do.  There's nothing I can do but stand by her and watch.",19Nov2019,1
85,"So I am now in the United States but I moved here around 3 years ago from a country where the concept of ""mental health"" is practically nonexistent. I've never seen any therapists or psychiatrists in the United States, but I have tried 5+ therapists or psychiatrists online in the past two years, spent a lot of time and effort, and got nothing in return. Most of them diagnosed me with major depression, avpd, and other cool personality disorders, ocd, anxiety, etc, I mean it varies. Basically, I am really fucked up. I was also diagnosed with something similar to ADHD in my home country back when I was a kid.

I don't want to get treated for anything but ADHD but, from what I read online, it would be very hard to avoid getting diagnosed with other illnesses when I get to see a doc. I don't want to take any meds but the meds prescribed for ADHD. How should I do it? I would go to my GP and tell him that I suspect that I have ADHD and then lie on his test when I see questions like ""do you feel down or sad?"" or what would be the best approach? I really don't want to lie but I don't think any doctor will understand that I want to be diagnosed/treated for ADHD only. Would it be ok if I told the doctor that my daily life gets affected by ADHD and I want his expertise on this matter, not anything else? What should I do?",19Nov2019,1

87,"As the title says, I don’t know what is wrong with me. I use to be a happy, care free guy.

At the age of 26, I feel empty. I wonder what is the point? For months I’ve felt like this. I’d be lying if I said the thought of suicide hasn’t crossed my mind a few times - though I’ve never self harmed. 

I hide how I feel. Infact, the only time I’ve ever discussed how I feel to anyone is when I’m drunk. I’ve done it 2 or 3 times now talking to my mum when I’ve been blackout drunk. After the chats she’s spoke me the next day when I’m sober asking if I’m really fed up and if everything is okay with me. She never really tells me what I’ve said to her drunk - but it must be bad as she cries when she asks me if I’m okay. I tell her not to worry, that I was just being a silly drunk. 

Last week I was on a night out with friends for my birthday. I shared a taxi home with one friend. I can vaguely remember telling him I was unhappy with life. I don’t remember the full details of what I’ve said to him but I know there was more. 

My friend asked me out for dinner two days later. On the journey to the restaurant he asked me if everything was okay with me. I asked him what he meant. He said I was saying I was unhappy. But again did not go into detail of what I had said, but just asked if everything was okay with me. Again I brushed it off, stating it was just the alcohol talking and that I’m fine. This made me realise I was not fine. This was now the 3rd or 4th time I’ve said this drunk in just as many months. 

Now your probably asking - what does the sober you feel?

I struggle to sleep... a lot. This could be due to my irregular sleep pattern with work. I’m a police officer so I work shifts. I can lay in bed staring at the ceiling all night or all day. I can go some days with just a few hours sleep. 

If I’m not at work it’s when my head is the worst. I think a lot. 

When I first started my job I was forced to work in a town over an hour away from home. The commute was impossible. I was forced to live there whilst on shift. Days off I’d scarper back to my parents home to maintain friendships and a social life. 4 years on and a year on the transfer list later, I’m still working there. I can’t move on with life. I can’t go buy a house. Socialising is difficult as I’m limited to being back in my home town 2 days a week and hope that it ties in with my friends availability. 

I’m single. I have no one to turn to, to share my thoughts and feelings. That can be tough. Work is tough. I see some sights. I’m not single through extracting myself from the dating scene. If anything it’s the opposite. I date a lot. But never make it past the first few days, which is my fault. I move onto the next woman as I find the last one never meets my standards or she’s not what I expected. 

I’m extremely short fused now. I don’t get angry. I just have a low tolerance for things now and get really agitated or annoyed with things quickly. 

I sometimes wish I could be me again. The guy I use to be 6-12 months ago. Happy. I feel like life is empty, that there is no point in me being here. That maybe if life just stopped it would be better. 


I don’t know if I’m just bored or if I’m depressed. I don’t want to seek professional help through my doctor. My reason for this is I don’t talk about my feelings. I don’t want to be diagnosed with something and have it fed back/affecting my job because of what kind of career I have. I don’t want to be on medication as through my job I’ve heard and saw the horror stories sometimes of what medication can do through addiction.

•Snack: yogurt or dark chocolate or peas chips or potato chips

Also: a decent habit of mine is when I binge eat high carb food like small strawberry bread buns x 5 for dessert, I force myself to throw up until I’m empty and I feel better. (Happens occasionally, some weeks worst then others)

94,"There’s a lot going on in my life right now. I’ve always been a very anxious person, and I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder the summer going into my freshman year of high school (I’m 18 now and I graduated in June). I was on Lexapro until the beginning of my junior year. I randomly stopped taking it because I felt like I was okay. And for the most part, I was! I did so much stuff senior year that I would’ve never done prior, I made new friends, I became somewhat popular. I was okay.
Backstory: I have an abusive ex who broke into my house about a month ago. He’s on and off of drugs, and he relapsed. I was unaware of this because we had not had any contact for a couple weeks. This particular morning, my mom woke up for work and he was sitting on our couch. He didn’t even realize what he had done was wrong, he just wanted a place to stay. I basically told him to leave me alone. I cut all ties from him from that moment on and he came to my work yesterday and berated me in front of everyone. Now I’m scared to go to work.
Additionally, a couple days ago, the high school I attended had a shooting and two freshmen died. My brother is a student at this school, and I’ve never been more scared in my entire life. I knew he was ok, as he had made a run for it and someone gave him a ride home, but I feel terrible because I know he is hurting. It affects me too, because I love that school, but I know i’m not hurting as much as him and I feel bad for that too. If he’s not crying, I shouldn’t be either. He was the one who saw a person get shot.
Lately, I’ve just been dejected. Everything makes me paranoid- loud noises, seeing anyone who is a tall, lanky white male that reminds me of my ex. I feel my heart drop so often.
Just about 15 minutes ago I turned my fan on to go to sleep and (at the time I didn’t realize this) I immediately started to hear rustling noises. Like, in the walls. I turned my fan louder because I didn’t wanna hear these noises.
I texted my sister, who is in her room downstairs, that I was scared we had a rat infestation. She doesn’t think I’m insane, but tells me to go sleep in my dad’s room, since he is at work and I will feel safe. She reassured me rats cannot get into my room, and that I’ll be fine.
I went on a rampage and threw away all trash in my room that was in the trash can. I literally went OUTSIDE and threw my trash can away so these rats would have no reason to come to my room.
After I came back to my room, I turned my fan off to see if the noises were as loud as I thought.
Yet, there were no noises at all. None. Zilch. I can’t tell if the way my fan was placed was causing it to rustle, or if all of that was in my head.

I never thought I would be so anxious about everything that it would manifest itself in... rat infestations.
Does anyone have any advice for me? I’m not suicidal, I have never been to therapy. I’m just very on edge at times and I overthink many things. 
Medication is an option for me, but I would like to see if any of you have nonconventional approaches?

I’m terrified of doctors now out of fear of judgement but also being open and honest about my mental health and relapses in my ED and SH.

Since like September my boyfriend, best friend, and another friend have all pretty much begged me to get more help and go to a mental hospital.
Hell my boyfriend even said he’d drive me to a hospital.

I’ve stopped talking to them about my serious mood drops and any relapses because I don’t want to worry them but the more I think about it the more scared I get.

I get excited over the idea of a good future with my boyfriend but at the same time it all just feels pointless? Everything either hurts or I feel nothing.

96,"TLDR at bottom of post.

Background: 
Starting my mental health recovery journey currently, finally accepted I need to make some changes and seek help after years of ""not the best feelings/experiences"" to say the least.

-----

Actual post (sorry if this is long [which it turned out to be oops]): 
I'm about to start taking some prescribed anti-depressants and I'm wondering what people's experiences were (both long term and short term)? I'm cautious about taking brain altering drugs as my mind/consciousness is such a private and personal space for me (I currently feel like taking the drugs is kinda like letting a stranger into your home). Also things like dependencies and never coming off them have me spooked. 

(Also, please don't sugar coat anything. I'm not looking for reassurance as much as I am for the truth, in this case, experiences. I know everyone's experience can be different too).

More really looking for general experiences, but if I had to ask one question it would be whether anyone felt the ""cloud"" lift? Now I don't know if anyone else experiences this/these sensations, but it feels like a thick cloud/fog/muddy water on the mind (it's my most hated symptom. It would be like turning the lights off in your home and trying to find your way around, doable, but much more laboured). Makes learning feel slower, thinking feel slower, focusing hard, memory poor, less aware, which all adds up to making me feel mentally fatigued, tired, and irritable. If my mind were a bell it would ring with a dull thud, despite me knowing that it can ring with a shine (idk how else to describe it).

If you've read this far, thanks :)

TLDR: Cautious about taking anti-depressants, what's your experiences short and long term?

But now I’m wondering with something like high functioning autism that can go undetected in adults, could someone have mild autism and not know it? Would most people be able to tell?

Bottom line is I always feel slightly off. Different, my brain works differently, I’m always on edge. It could be just anxiety, or depression, or low self esteem, but I always get the nagging feeling that there’s something more seriously “wrong with me”. I don’t want to offend anyone with autism, but that’s just how I feel. I think I’ve felt this way for as long as I can remember.

I’ve brought it up with my therapist but no one agrees with me, I even got so paranoid my parents were keeping my “autism” a secret from me I went looking for old emails my mom sent as a kid to see if there was anything, medical files, etc. 

I just feel like I’m going crazy, it’s getting worse, some criteria apply to me, but I’m not sure. I feel like everything I do is “subtly” weird, like so subtle I can’t even notice sometimes. Idk it’s 4 am why am I doing this to myself",19Nov2019,1

So i thought that seems like bipolar disorder as far as I know. Eventually I was put into therapy by a friend. Now I felt like an absolute little bitch for doing this cause honestly that’s weak af. 

Then the psychologist basically tells me for the next four weeks that I need more than 9 hours of sleep and I’m just growing up until I cancel therapy because i think I’m being brainwashed by the Illuminati. Symptoms continue for like a month, then I realise one day that I feel normal. Not like my old self, but I’m not depressed, and I’m not crazy, I’m just fine. 

Fast forward a few months, I basically start getting memories from that period that I just forgot about, and they would absolutely freak me out,  like heart racing, breathing heavy just freaking it. I only recently have been able to listen to the songs I used to listen to without freaking out.

But now I feel fine. I hallucinate extremely infrequently and sometimes feel in that “high” state again and everyone goes “are you on drugs?” For a few days. But that’s whatever really.

Basically I just want some closure I guess. I really don’t want to go to a therapist cause I ain’t no bitch. Like “it’s not a sign of weakness”. Bs. Of course it is, especially here in Australia. But I still want closure and to know if somethings wrong with me and if it’ll come back.

I've   never had sex with ""free"" women. In my country prostitution is legal   but I have always had problems to cum with prostitutes- My cum is   delayed.

I am a schizoid   personality. Relationships are of no interest to me. But sex interests   me and I like it. So going with prostitutes for me is a good compromise   because I can have sex without having to entertain relationships etc  ...  I am an ugly  man so ''free'' women  don't give me their pussy  easily.

Unfortunately,  besides  being schizoid, I am a  very sensible person and the false  sexual act  with prostitutes does not get me hard me much and I have  difficulty to  cum and to get hard with them.

When   I'm alone at home in front of porn I have no trouble to cum. I tried   viagra but it didn't help me. I think I'm low testosterone (although I   didn't do any analysis)

I also   suffer from social phobia and social anxiety and this is another factor   to consider. I've always envied those who manage to cum with  prostitutes  in 7 minutes ... I can't. It's hard for me to get hard with  them. I can  do it very well at home.

Now   without moralizing ('' just go with the free women ! '') ... could you   give me some suggestions to improve my performances with prostitutes? I   just want to enjoy sex like everyone ... it's not fair that I can't   enjoy this pleasure of life

Free women do not date me .. I tried ... it' s needless to say '' go with the free women ! '' .. they don't give me their pussy.

110,"It just shows us the magnitude of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders and illnesses. It shows us just how many people suffer from them.

Life is hard. Very hard, traumatising. The World is a dark place, so of course most people are affected and develop mental health problems. Why do people think the posts are lying?

It is very likely that millions, billions of people suffer from some form of mental disorder and go undiagonsed.

It also shows us that these people's problems are not taken seriously in real life so posting online is the only outlet they have. They are second guessed and feel suffocated, IRL.

People underestimate just how much mental disorders affect every aspect of life and daily functioning. People need to express that, so they post online.

There is stigma associated with mental issues, posting online is safer than talking about it in real life. Plus, IRL, their illness and weakness will be used against them, to harm them, as well. Some people will use it against them or take advantage of them.

They are already accused of making excuses, being told their problems are not real, of being lazy, looking for attention..... The list goes on... In real life. Hell they end up believing it themselves and blame themselves.

They are already hurting and this hurts them more. Then they get accused of similar things online. So it adds to their pain, hurt, frustration, trauma.

Please don't just one sidedly accuse people of attention seeking when they need to get stuff about their mental issues off their chest or want to be open/ honest about it.

If 1 person out of 50 is lying, do not second guess the other 49 becoz of that 1 person.

If you can, please give people who post about mental health issues the benefit of doubt.

If you are not sure if a post is genuine, ignore it. Don't upvote it, don't sympathize with them but don't bash them, downvote them and accuse them of lying or seeking attention, either.

Thank you.",19Nov2019,1

113,"For whoever wants to take the time to read through these strange incidents, what do you think I should do? What do you think this is? 

What just happened?
INCIDENT 1
I previously wasn’t feeling well because of a medication. I went to take a shower to try to feel better. My thoughts started racing and they kept telling me that there was something wrong with me. They started screaming, trying to escape. I hurried out of the shower and went to get ready for school. When I put my clothes on, I froze. I sat on my bed with my head in my hands and stared in one place. I started to panic. At this moment, my mind realized something was wrong with me and tried to escape. My muscles were heavy and weak. This made me very frozen. I shook it off and went to brush my hair, trying to distract myself. In the middle of brushing my hair, I looked at myself in the mirror. My arms defensively wrapped around my stomach and I stood there frozen. I looked into my left eye for a long time, and everything warped. Everything was light brown and it was as if there was a very strong Instagram filter. Everything was dragging with my eyesight and my face was blurry and deforming. One eye was bigger than the other and it slanted. My mouth was disappearing and blending in with my skin. I was stuck I couldn’t escape. Then I told myself, ok, im not mentally in this room right now so I’ll go somewhere else. I thought, where would I wanna go? I didn’t feel like going to laronde, i didn’t feel like going to Charlie’s house, i didn’t feel like going on a beach, I didn’t feel like going to my childhood memories. I realized that there was nowhere that I wanted to be, and that I was trapped in this room, in this body. For a second I was back in my dad’s bathroom crying and then I was back at my moms. I started calling for my mom even though I knew she wasn’t there. It was like I was admitting to myself that I need help. Then I started calling for help. Then my mind told me that nothing is real and that’s why my reflection looks weird. I was scared and crying and couldn’t move. My reflection was pulsating, and with every time it did, I was nauseous for a second. I then somehow effortlessly walked to the toilet and got ready to throw up, which I didn’t. I walked back to the mirror and picked up my brush to try to continue brushing my hair, but I looked back at the mirror and I was stuck again and I couldn’t escape. I really wanted my mom but I was scared of her reaction. I hate the reactions she has to things. When she did come, she did have a reaction I didn’t like, and on top of that, both of the kids saw me and were confused, and that made me panic more. After the fact, when everything was a bit better and I was gonna go to school, I was scared of my reflection. Now I’m fine. 


INCIDENT 2
I was on my way back from school, my mood was fine. I got onto the metro and sat down, and there was a man in a tuque with round eyes sitting in front of me. He had a small black jacket and kind of a chubby face. He was staring at me and it made me uncomfortable. The way he looked at me made me feel like he knew something I didn’t. I got up and sat somewhere else. My mind immediately started telling me he was gonna take me. That he knew the guy that always parked in front of my house, he was stalking me and he was coming to take me where there are not many people who wait for the bus. That he was gonna set me on fire and roll me in a carpet and throw me. When I checked for him in the reflection of my phone, he was gone and I was relieved. But then my mind told me to still be vigilant because he could’ve moved to the next metro cart, seeing that I was suspicious and on guard. I walked out of the metro at my stop, looked around and didn’t see him. Ok, I walked up the stairs, still looking around just in case. Then I see him again. He’s at the bottom of the stairs, walking my way. I bolt up the stairs and hurry outside, looking for him older my shoulder. I see my bus, and I go to run for it but my muscles are week again and I almost trip over myself. I catch the bus and my mind tells me that if he doesn’t get on the bus I’m safe. He didn’t come. On the ride home, I was feeling like nothing exists again and my mind was racing. I’m alright now that I wrote it down, I was very nervous. 

There was a man on Facebook who was asking me to babysit his Samoyed. Samoyeds are my favourite dog breed so I was suspicious. When i looked at the profile picture, it was the man who was following me. At that moment, i felt like reality completely broke down. I was in total shock and confusion. I was thinking that he was gonna set me up. I was questioning if any of this was even possible.",19Nov2019,1

116,"I (19 M) recently got out of a 4.5 year relationship (broken up 3 months, fully over my ex). Afterwards, being intimate has been a challenge. I’m a good looking guy, comfortable with my body, size, etc., but for some reason have struggled with getting an erection with a new partner.

After my first girlfriend, when moving onto the girl I spent 4.5 years with, I had a similar problem. It took maybe 2-3 times of us getting intimate for me to maintain an erection, after which I didn’t experience any issues (apart from the occasional whiskey dick of course). Getting comfortable was important. We had a great sex life, and things were just fine for 4.5 years.

However now that I’m finding new partners, the issue is back. I was with someone new that I find fairly attractive, but I couldn’t get an erection when we got intimate. We did have a bottle of wine to drink and some edibles, but that’s never stopped my ex and I. The next night we tried again (also some wine but less edibles), and the same problem occurred. This time I just went in soft, and was able to get hard in a couple minutes and we did our thing.

I still get morning wood and random daily erections, but definitely not as often as the last couple years. I’m not sure if this is a natural part of turning 20 years old or not, but it’s something I’ve taken note of. This issue has made sex more of a chore for me than pleasure, and I’d like to have confidence in me being able to please someone without being concerned about sustaining an erection.

I’m looking for any advice weather it’s to change my mind set, other’s similar experiences, take a supplement (vitamins, etc.), or should I just see a doctor? I’ve contemplated getting a viagra prescription but its not cheep, and bad for the liver. However just having that back up plan might help my brain take the pressure off. Again, any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance :)",19Nov2019,1
117,"TLDR at bottom. I really do desperately want to live a balanced, healthy life. By balanced, I mean not constantly living in extremes.

Thing is, I just can't. No matter what I do I always find myself at extremes. Studying? It's either studying during my entire free time at all times, turning assignments in the day I get them OR it's barely studying at all. Games? It's either playing literally nothing at all and having no free time OR playing video games as soon as I can at all times, wasting my life away. Exercise? It's either working out literally every day OR constantly missing workouts for silly reasons. Eating healthy? It's either drinking disgusting but healthy green smoothies every day OR munching on chocolate and chips 5 times a week. Self esteem? It's either barely taking care of myself at all OR taking myself way too seriously.

It's not a discipline problem either, because I can find myself studying day in and day out to the point where I have nothing left to study for weeks. And I really don't want to live that life. I truly, DESPERATELY WANT to be able to enjoy things like games and exercise and school without taking it to one of two extremes. Every now and then I find myself being able to ""be balanced"" for a few days or even a couple of weeks, but soon I'm back into extremes. I especially fall into extremes when I find my surroundings or schedules to change in a way I can't control (eg school is cancelled for a day, I end early and I just don't know what to do, etc).

TL:DR; It feels as if my subconscious is forcing me to either live the life of the fat virgin gamer neckbeard OR the super disciplined buff military dude nolifing the gym. There is no in-between, no balance. I hate it and it makes me hate myself. I just want a life of balance, I want to enjoy things without overdoing (or ""underdoing"" it).",19Nov2019,1

121,"Hi there, 

I’ve never understood my own mental health. I am diagnosed with ocd, generalised anxiety, depression, and borderline personality disorder - here’s the catch though, I have had no huge traumatic experiences (so far as I’m aware anyway). I also have problems with intimacy as a huge trigger that you might expect from someone who was sexually abused (I haven’t been). When I am triggered I either have a panic attack or I dissociate really really heavily. My sister is also borderline (with no trauma) so I figure that must be something in our genes. 

My triggers also seem really random sometimes too. It’s like I start getting a flashback but there’s nothing to flashback to and my brain just goes crazy. It’s really hard to explain the sensation. 

Why does this happen? Everyone I know who have had/ has similar experiences to me triggers for a reason. Mine seems like there is no good reason and this fact makes it extremely hard to manage. Can anyone offer any advice?",19Nov2019,1
122,"CW: Child sexual abuse; emotional abuse; religious abuse.

Hey folks. Hope this is the right place to post this. 

It's been a really difficult month for me. I'm just so stressed, or sad, or some mixture of the two, all the time. But I'm finding it increasingly difficult to be understanding towards myself. I'm frustrated with myself for not doing better when I'm exactly where I wanted to be a few months ago. I don't even know why I feel so bad. Is it SAD? Is it purely stress? Is it something else? I don't know.

I've always struggled with my mental health. I am diagnosed with autism. Although I have no formal diagnosis of depression or any other mental illness, I am more or less certain that I have issues with it or something similar. At the very least, I have severe self-esteem issues, which I mostly attribute to the sexual abuse I went through as a child, and to growing up in a toxic emotionally abusive environment, and also to having been brought up in what amounts to an isolationist doomsday cult.

About three of four years ago I left the cult. I'm glad I did, and I'm doing so much better for it in many respects. But it was still a massive change, and I went from having faith in a higher power, and believing I would be saved by it, to having nothing. Death is a real concern for me in a way it wasn't when I was part of the cult, since I was promised eternal life after judgment day.

Also, last year, I cut ties with my emotionally manipulative father. Both he and my mother have been guilty in the past of basically emotionally abusing me, but my mum was willing to listen to me and change her behaviour, whereas dad was never willing to accept responsibility for his actions, and I couldn't handle that anymore. My mum is currently in the middle of divorce proceedings, which were complicated further by the cult, which my mother is a part of. The rest of my dad's family, as it turns out, are all horrible people, all of whom have only added to my trauma and the collective trauma of my family, and my mum's family are distant and hundreds of miles away, and I don't feel I have any connection with them at all. It's pretty isolating.

On top of all this, there are the more... I guess everyday stresses. I'm a full time Masters student, working retail part-time just to scrape by. I hate my job, and find it really stressful especially with my autism, but right now I don't feel I have any other choice. I'm barely able to afford rent as is. Right now I have about £15 in my bank account, which I need to make last until the 27th, somehow, because my family isn't able to help me. My boyfriend, at least, is able to help me with groceries, but he isn't exactly rolling in it either, and I don't want to stress other people out.

Despite all of this, I just can't seem to give myself a break. I've been feeling particularly low for the past two weeks, but all I can think is - what right do I have to feel that way? I have a boyfriend I love. I am doing the degree I wanted in the city I want to live in. Sure, I hate my job, but so do most people in retail; I should be glad that I managed to get it without too much stress. I should be grateful. Most of the stuff with my family, while awful, is over. I don't have to see my dad, I don't have to see his family, including my cousin who abused me and my aunt and uncle and grandparents who defended him. I don't even think about my dad most days, or my abuse, or any of it. So why don't I feel better? Why am I just not good enough? 

Once a friend told me, re: my abuse, that I had to stop feeling sorry for myself. At the time I was furious with her; how could she say something like that when she didn't know what it was like, and when she'd never understand that something like that always stays with you in some way or another. But over the past couple of weeks, that's how I feel about myself.

My boyfriend and my friends tell me that I'm being too hard on myself. That it's been a difficult few years, and I shouldn't beat myself up for struggling sometimes. That I have a lot on my plate, and it's okay that I'm finding things hard. But I just can't believe them. It all just sounds like platitudes, and I feel like I'm just waiting for them all to get sick of me. And I just don't know what to do anymore.",19Nov2019,1
123,"I am struggling so hard lately with everything. I will be 40 this weekend. I never thought Id live this long and, frankly, I never wanted to.  And yet, here I am and I can't do anything about it because I have 5 kids, 2 sks and a wonderful SO who all love me and don't deserve to go through that Hell so I am not going anywhere.  

Because of my age and because I know I am not as attractive and sexy as I was even just 5 years ago and not NEAR as much as I was 10, realistically, finding another man that I am attracted to love me if something ever went wrong between SO and I would probably be a pipedream.   So I find myself walking on eggshells trying to do everything in my power to make him happy and not leave me. I also feel my insecurities growing all over again. I had been doing so well in that area for quite a while but they are back, maybe worse than ever. 

Every time I am not with my SO (which almost always is just when he is at work) I obsess about him.   Like, what is he doing? Is he really at work? Is he just working a lot to get away from me? Which inevitably turns into me either wracking my brain for reasons he could be angry with me (even if logically there is no reason and he has not said a word to indicate he is) or examining and re examining everything in our life searching for evidence that he is cheating or that he has feelings for someone else and just stays with me because he is too nice to make myself and my kids homeless with nothing. I am struggling so hard lately with everything.

Thoughts like this used to be something I dealt with pretty much every day and they destroyed/damaged a lot of my relationships both romantic and platonic.  The last 5 years ago or so I haven't felt more than a momentary lapse of insecurity or paranoia and I had gotten really at making those little voices shut up and making myself see and acknowledge how ridiculous those kind of thoughts are. But for some reason this birthday has  it all ramped back up in the worst way and it is all I can do to make myself stop freaking out and not blow up his phone begging for attention all day long. I haven't had to fight myself so hard in ages about this. It is frustrating.

At the end of our session, I asked her our of curiousity, ""Have you ever had a patient who broke your heart?""

I'm not sure if I had some motive that I don't know of but I thought it was curiosity in who she was and what it was like on her end. She seemed very taken aback and uncomfortable. She kind of abruptly ended the call (It was about time to end it anyway) and I'm scared that she will not want to continue because I made her feel uncomfortable. Maybe I should have waited, but I sent her an e-mail right after the session. I usually do it to reflect on our session. Here's what I wrote.

As always, thank you for your time today. I'm sorry to always take much of your time, as you are very busy setting up your new life in \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*! 

I'm sorry if my question made you feel uncomfortable at the end of our session. After our conversations I often try to go over my thoughts and process them (often because I have a hard time retaining information.) Please allow me to explain myself a bit.

I just thought that you were very personable and compassionate and I thought that it might be hard for you to hear some things from patients who have experienced traumatic events, It was a logical part of me that began to wonder if even professionals like yourself feel heartbroken when they witness the experiences that some people have gone through. It was inappropriate for me to ask especially considering that we had no time left. 

I will try hard to identify the source of my panic, as well as look into things that may help my sleep hygiene.

So I've now been unemployed for over two months, with no sight of a job happening any time soon, and honestly, I don't want to live any more if this is my life. I feel like a fucking waste of space.

135," Hello,

I started therapy several weeks ago  with someone specializing in a specific type of trauma therapy. So far  there have been several times where I had a feeling she might not be  safe for me but because this therapy is rare and I really need it I  continued and wanted to wait and see how it develops.

 So recently we had  a session. 5 minutes after the hour was officially over (she was a bit late at the beginning of the session though) she said we need to come to  an end soon and we continued talking for a short time and then I wanted  to answer something she said or add something and she said in a quite aggressive/mean tone ""we need to finish now. I have actually another  session now. i already said 10 minutes ago we need to finish (it was 5  minutes actually, i looked at the clock) and if I say I say it because I  mean it."" and I felt so shamed because of how she said it, the tone of  her voice/the energy, and because she could have just said ""ok I need to  go in a normal tone without the added blame/guilt part"". how am I  supposed to know if she continued talking before that now i need to  stop? It seriously felt like a slap in the face and i have never felt  that with any other therapist who ended a session. it just felt so  aggressive and guilt inducing. i had made myself very vulnerable during  the session and talked about very severe trauma so that made it all the  more awful. Now I dont know what to do...if this is a sign that she is  not a safe person. this is not the first time i noticed behaviour that  made me uncomfortable",19Nov2019,1
136,"I(30F) grew up as an only child, with very low confidence and often got beaten up by my dad over my poor grades. I never realized how damaging it was (until I grew up), and thought the beatings were ok since hitting children over grades is normalized in our culture. He used to beat me violently. However, my dad was a very devoted husband and father and worked really hard to provide us with a good life, and presently we share a good relationship. But that’s not to say the beatings didn’t f me up. It made me question my self worth and I never really had any friends growing up- I mean I had friends but none that I was really close to; and that’s something that followed me into my adulthood. I grew up having daddy issues and dated some horrible men who treated be badly, and didn’t have much luck making close friends. I thought I was close to people that I thought were my friends, but I it was always a one way street.

At present, I’m doing well and live comfortably but I don’t have a single friend. I’m always thinking how people judge me, or think how weird I am, or that I must be really boring, which is why people want nothing to do with me. I also have occasional meltdowns and end up fighting with my dad when I get triggered due to past trauma, but now he doesn’t react, or fight it, and stays quiet when I tell him how much his actions have affected me. He feels sorry about what he did but the damage is done. I hate being this way, and I just want to break this cycle, come out of my childhood trauma, and socialize like a normal human being. I also want to clarify my dad has done a lot for me as a father and continues to do so. I don’t want anyone to think there was lack of love, but rather a lack of EQ and probably some emotional support that children need- and that along with the beatings made me grow up in a really dysfunctional family. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",19Nov2019,1
137,"I got a call earlier and it was some terrible news. My cousin took his own life. I'm still processing this situation. 
We were very close while we were younger but as we grew up, we drifted a part. I'd see him post stuff online about sad things and quotes but idk why i didn't reach out. I feel shitty now.
I won't be able to attend the funeral because i live in a different state and it'll be held tomorrow. I want to talk to his mum but what do i say?

Also, my brother has been struggling with mental health problems too and I'm scared that it might trigger him. We weren't gonna tell him just yet how our cousin passed away but he found out from his friends.

142,"Possible Content Warning; PTSD, assault, gas lighting

So I experienced a trauma almost 2 years ago. The trauma anniversary is coming up so my symptoms are flaring. I was talking to my friend about how I feel that because this horrible thing happened to me, there is this immense pressure to do something amazing related to this trauma ( like starting a non profit, working to change the legal system... something big) to counteract it. (Sidenote: has anyone who has experienced a trauma had this feeling? ) Anyways I said that if I don't do something amazing, it feels that all this trauma is just pain and when flare ups happen it's because I'm weak. 

Anyways my friend says to me that it's not true, and that by going through this trauma I learned to know what to look for. The trauma was related to an assault. I got upset because to me that was completely invalidating, and I told my friend this to which I think he gaslighted me. He said I'm misunderstanding. I asked him to clarify, to which he said that he's always hyper vigilant around everyone in public. This just reinforced the invalidation and my understanding of what he said. 

I told him that I was taught from a young age every single precaution a woman could do not to get assaulted, so it wasn't a matter of learning what to look for. I learned that long ago. I said that if anything, this trauma taught me not to trust anyone, and that everyone including him are capable of assaulting me. This dude flipped and stormed out, heading to work super early. Last year around this time he was super supportive of my symptoms and flare ups. He knew exactly what to say and do. This year it feels like he's just constantly in a rush, and that I'm a huge annoyance. I told him while he was getting his stuff together that I feel that he's been acting less kind and gentle with me compared to last year, and he just told me that he hasn't been. 

Am I understanding this situation wrong? My first language is french so I don't know if I mis-learned the expression ""learned what to look out for"". I tried to google it but I didn't find too much insight. I'm not sure how to remedy this situation, but I feel really lousy and depressed. He was my biggest support and safe person, so having him act unpredictable is just worsening my PTSD flare up.

146,"I don't know what happened in the past few months but a sudden increase in my hand washing has been hard to ignore.

This is (and this is only one example out of many) how I go about food.

I enter the kitchen, wash my hands, don't feel ""clean enough"" (what ever the fuck this means), and I wash my hands 3 more times.

Take out all the ingredients, wash them, wash hands 3-4x again.

Start chopping up all the vegetables, (I also usually eat A LOT of garlic so my hands end up sticky) feel dirty, wash hands 3-4x again.

Continue with the dish, whether it be with frying stir-fry/veggie omlette, or just putting a great deal of effort with hummus. Wash hands 3-4x again.

""Oh now it's time to eat, gotta wash those hands!"" Guess what happens now.

And this is just with food, it can happen with going to the bathroom, just cause, or after petting/feeding my dog.

At first it wasn't bad, but it's now gotten to the point where it hurts like crazy. My skin is dry as hell, I can't put on my boxing gloves at krav maga practice because it hurts like hell. I can barely take off and on long sleeved shirts (which is bad since it's freezing now). Certain, very normal hand positions really hurt, and ironically I can barely wash my hands (didn't put a stop to this though, it's driving me mad).

I wanna share this with my therapist as it's really interfering with everything especially with krav maga. I also don't wanna sound vain but it's also not the best looking. I literally have a line on my hands for most of the day where after a certain very visible point my hands are just red, crumbly, and not very pleasnt to look at.

The Friends I do have are...not that great. They are fun to be around. One is a girl and one is a boy, (I’m not sure if that matters) but my one friend that’s a girl-let’s call her S- so S and I became close about Two years ago. She and I both suffer from mental illness, so our friendship suffered, our conversations were always sad and we would confine in each other but she wasn’t really there for me like I was there for her...so I distanced my self. She got heavily involved in drugs and I did try along with her but I stopped because it wasn’t for me. She almost overdosed. And she almost is always grounded so I never get to see her or text her. 

My other friend, Let’s call him C. So C and I became friends two years ago. He was the quite kid in the back of the class. I talked to him but I didn’t get much, me and the other girls at out table eventually wore him down and he began to talk to us. Flash forward to a year later. He is a normal teen boy. Loves video games and being lazy and drugs. He had treated me horribly and I have let it slide. S hates him and I don’t blame her because I do too. He’s an interesting person, I have recently come to realize that our relationship is toxic, after denying it. He will, make fun of me for my speech impediment and my studded and my spelling. ( I’m dyslexic. Sorry if there’s any errors) like I said before im struggling with depression. When I would talk to him about my feeling he would say “damn that sucks” or “oof”.

153,"Hello, 

I'm currently doing a voluntary year in Israel.
I'm living now 3 months in Israel and I don't enjoy it. 
The work I'm doing is physically and mentally stressing, I can't get friends with my roommates (they are also volunteers, but I just don't like them), and I don't find a way to cope with the culture and the way of living here in Israel, it's just not my cup of tea. 
As a result I'm currently just being in my room, being sad and tired. 
My only escape right now is thinking what is happening after the year. It motivates me and kinda keeps me going. 

I just cannot think of a way to enjoy this year. I even thought about going home early, but that is really the last option because it is connected to a lot of trouble.

The problem is that I know he has bad memory. Actually super bad. His short term memory is very hard for him sometimes. So I don't really have a reason to be upset but I did anyway. I couldn't control it. I didn't yell or get angry but I just started laughing but I was also crying.

155,"So this morning I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dyn38r/lost_respect_for_my_wife_without_realizing/) about a marriage issue, basically I thought my marriage was failing because of my wife's behavior. The very rapid dressing down I received from redditors shone a bright light on an issue I know I have had for some time. I am completely unable to show empathy, compassion or accept other people if they behave differently to what I perceive as ""right"". I become judgmental and critical when other's behave in a way that doesn't align with my values and I'm unable to put myself in their shoes. I need them to change and I'm never willing to adjust my beliefs. 

This issue is ruining my life, I don't feel like I can have a successful relationship because I expect robotic perfection. Humans are flawed and I can't accept it. 

I have been to therapy to try and address my lack of empathy and compassion but never had a lot of success, and end up quitting. I don't see the point paying $200 a session to get nowhere. I have read a book, Daring Greatly, that I found interesting and eye opening, but I felt it never really addressed my problem. I am great at learning about the issue, and even accepting it, I just have NO IDEA how to address it. 

The biggest issue right now is I need to stop needing my wife to change. I need to understand that everything is not black and white. I need to change ME. I need to understand everybody has flaws and to accept and love her for who she is. 

Are there any good books around this topic? I found one called [Radical Acceptance](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Acceptance-Embracing-Heart-Buddha/dp/0553380990/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) that sounds good, but it seems to be more about accepting oneself rather than others. 

Is anybody else dealing with this, and if so, how? 

For those interested, I think the reason I am like this is because my upbringing was a very cold and emotionally closed off one. I never experienced empathy or compassion because, well, I never experienced many emotions at all.",19Nov2019,1

My background: To keep it short, as a child, I had neglectful parents.

He was very intelligent and manipulative. (He was a victim of severe abuse as a child.) they were an upper middle class family, I ended up leaving my house at 18. 

During my teenage years until about 25,  I was impulsive, wanted to be the center of attention. In work environments I always wanted to socialize, put things aside to do later. I was unorganized, my room was messy, etc. I was forgetful. I was overly emotional, pretty extroverted. 

Now at 28, I am meticulous about my room and house decor and cleanliness. At work I am dedicated to my tasks and job. I don’t like getting up and socialize all the time like I used to, I would rather try and finish my work. I ended up in accounting and finance and made my way to manager. I am very attentive to detail and extremely organized. I became really driven and goal oriented. I also have a lot of anxiety. I feel more introverted.

Hello guys, 

My brother has mental issues. He was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which was about 12 years ago.He alienated himself from all his friends (just cut ties with anyone) and started speaking bad stuff about everyone, including me and people from my family. We were ok when it was just talk, but he started to become aggressive and even jumped to beat me up when I was still in High School. One night he took many painkillers due to what he said was a massive headache and we had to rush him to the hospital. There he was evaluated by phyicologist which said that he has ""bipolar disorder"", and that he is hearing voices inside of his head which are controlling him. The doctors tried to scare him and said to him that his condition is a very serious one and he absolutely must take his meds daily, or he will suffer for the rest of his life. He understood and started taking the pills as perscribed. He was good for 5-6 years, and then his mental health started going down again. We thought that the pills need to be changed, and we consulted the doctor that changed the pills he was taking. But he was not changed. We soon found out that he simply doesn’t take them. He pretends to put them inside of his mouth but he was tricking us really. We searched his room and found MANY of the different pills he was supposed to have taken, under the mattress. 

He told us “don’t worry guys I am cured, I am fine I am going to school I am studying I feel good, I don’t talk shit to people anymore I don’t need the pills”. The doctors insisted for him to continue taking the meds, but he completely refused. My father was like “ok, it is your call if you feel better, and want to take a break I can’t force you to take the meds”. As you might guess his mental health went down, and down and down. He dropped out of college 1 semester before completing a BA in Marketing. He simply refused to go back again, my dad did some reading on bipolar and told me “ok this is very serious, don’t push him too much if he doesn’t want to work or study that is fine we will figure it out, we will get better allow him to relax, don’t demand or expect anything from him.” 

His health went even more down to a point where he started stealing stuff from stores nothing major he stole a banana once, even when we gave him cash to buy stuff when he needs them., He also started entering the yards of our neighbors who not surprisingly got a restraining order from him, he didn’t take it seriously and continued bothering them which resulted in him being arrested. He was sentenced to 60 days of prison for going to my neighbors' yard and stealing items under 500$. He ended up not in prison but in a mental facility. He spends 7 months there. He refused to take pills the doctors said ok we won’t release you then, and he spent 7 months. In the end, he gave up, and they reach a compromise no pills, but a shot once every month. The shots brought him back to live, he was released and soon returned to school. His doctors were against him signing up for classes as they said he isn’t ready yet. He not only signed for classes he signed for 16 credits – 5,6 subjects, to which the doctors completely said NO, you have to drop the most you can do right now is a class or maybe 2 you are not ready for 6 subjects not now. 

He didn’t listen, the midterms came and he failed every midterm he took, big time. His head told him “if you are failing the drugs you are taking are not working stop taking them.” He stopped getting the shots, soon he started going down mentally again. He dropped out of school, and just started talking to himself all day long. Telling him that he is a CIA agent. That 9/11 was done by his best friend from HS, etc. We tried to convince him to start taking the meds again, he said no, and my dad told me to just leave him alone, as we can’t help him “its up to him to start taking the right steps to get out of this mess, you can’t influence him no one can its all up to him.” He hasn’t taken any meds for the last 2 maybe even 3 years. He is completely anti-social not going out, not talking with people, not even watching tv or using computers as he used to. 

Until 2 months ago, it was kind of ok. I mean he was a mess but he was not causing trouble. But, he started doing stupid stuff again. He went in our neighborhood and took out all the grass with hands. Over the last 2 weeks, he started walking in our house, and even outside completely naked even without boxers on. I saw him peeing and taking s\*\*\* in our backyard. We became concerned called the crisis center twice, but every time is the same thing they take him in, he refuses treatment, the judge sees him-  he determines that my brother ain’t aggressive, and the doctors release him. 

I feel hopeless, I want to help him but everyone I speak with is like “you can’t help him relax and focus on your life”.  I too have some mental issues I get depressed sometimes, I have self esteem issues no were close to his issues. I go to work 45 hours a week. I do my best, to live life as close to normal as possible. But, in a lot of times I just can’t. I get lost in my thoughts. I start being scared about him “what will happen when our parents retire?” “Will I need to take care of him?” “What if my future family my wife, or my kids have issues with him?”  I always picture how he will end up being homeless and alone on the streets, which I hope doesn’t happen, but his actions are too much some time. My father is trying to assure me that “its all going to be ok” but I just feel that its not going to be ok. 

Sometimes I feel like packing my bags and renting out my place so I can find a little bit of peace in my life, but then I feel like I cannot do that. I cannot just leave, my dad can’t leave can’t he? And if we all leave what is going to happen with my brother? 

I am lost, I  don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I don’t know what to do. I feel like the best thing for me right now is to focus on me. Do a good job at work, find a partner to build a family with etc. But in the same time I don't want to leave my brother behind, and I feel like focusing on me is doing that.",19Nov2019,1

170,"I will sometimes be honest on Facebook about my journey with my mental health and today after hours of laying in bed and crying I decided I needed to open up so people do not feel alone and I can get some support. 99% of the comments were of support and telling me I got this...then there was one comment...one comment that made me cry. One comment that made me deactivate Facebook. One comment that made me feel like a burden. 

“I feel like you post about your mental health a lot...I am not sure Facebook is the place for that. It can only help momentarily and makes people uncomfortable. Hopefully you are actually getting real help and not just doing this for attention.”

171,"I've had such a rough year, going from severe anxiety into depression and just sinking deeper and deeper, losing all my energy, going from a really outgoing person who loved to do it all and was full of life and ideas to someone who couldn't even get off the couch or out of bed sometimes... In the past three months, I hadn't had a single good day, one where I didn't just feel like crap or fantasize about ending it. Then all of a sudden, I woke up one day last week feeling like the massive rock in my chest had lifted a little and I could actually breathe again, I didn't have that sinking feeling of despair that followed me around all the time. It lasted for 2 days, then I had another dreadful weekend, but today is the second day I have been feeling ok once more. Despite having encountered one of my greatest triggers, I didn't panic or spiral. I wasn't happy and still felt exhausted and in a dream-like state, but I could breathe, had hope and didn't just wanna dissapear and die...I'm not sure what the future will bring, maybe I will crash many more times before making a real recovery, but these mouthfuls of oxygen have been priceless and I can't express how grateful I am for them! They showed me that there is real hope that one day, out of the blue, I may wake up and just feel like myself again and that it's not all lost forever. And
this gives me the energy to keep on fighting.

this is my first time on here and i just need somewhere to comfortably talk about things. I am a 16 y/o female who has had depression for a while and i’ve been learning to cope with it. but recently I’ve had a lot of really personal issues and that has led to having panic attacks, which I haven’t had until this year. I don’t know how to control them and I don’t know who to talk to. my parents don’t “believe” in mental illness and I don’t have a therapist or enough money to pay for one so a lot of stuff is pretty bottled up.

179,"I’m a 29-year-old asexual white male with a misdiagnosed neurological-difference that I believe to be ASD. I currently live in Ontario, Canada.

I’ve experienced a lot of emotional trauma in my life which caused me to feel physically uncomfortable and confused a lot of the time. As a result of this life, I gave up on society and became more introverted and less of myself which at a subconscious level caused recurring feelings of depression, anger, and unhappiness. I view myself as having a hard life, and it wasn’t until I used Psilocybin, I found a partner and thought about my life that I realized all of this. This next bit will be hard to read but I want you to focus on this sentence, I enjoy living, my partner is truly amazing, and my family is composed of real people whom I love deeply and my true friends span across the globe and I love them all.

If I had to objectively describe myself and my personality characteristics I would end up telling you I am a person that fundamentally enjoys asking questions, questioning current knowledge and truly interested in living as many experiences as possible. I’m an incredibly intelligent and honest person, I am reliable and loyal to a fault and am willing to try, help, do anything with anyone at any moment.

Currently, my unique reality is that I am an individual that has a neurological difference and I feel like it makes me different from normal society. I am 29 years old; I am unemployed and have a feeling of hopelessness about future career prospects. I would best describe the emotion I connect the most to is pain and sadness. I’m subconsciously depressed, sad and full of pain and yet the exact opposite. I’m confused about who I am at a fundamental level due to internalized emotional pain caused by a society that told me what a man is. From a young age, I was told I wasn’t allowed to have feelings, I had to dress a certain way and was presented with a generic example of what an average male is that I don’t identify with and troubling enough I wasn’t aware of this confusion until recently. A common trend in my life is that I’m sad, I don’t tell people that I am sad but I am deeply sad and I say I don’t know why but I know that those feelings are the result of living a life on a planet that wasn’t designed for me and paired with a life thus far that has been unfair, cruel and terrible to me at times. I want to take a moment to just write about that because if someone else is feeling this I am too and would love to talk with you.

I enjoy being alive but the life that I am living at the moment feels like something I don’t want, there are great parts to it but there are a lot of negatives that hold me back. If it was possible, I wish I could restart because I’m not happy with my life as a whole and I feel like a lot of people can identify with this. These feelings aren’t something I inherently had they have been taught and learned from an early age. Due to my neurological difference I couldn’t express these feelings as a child and was labeled troubled, angry or ‘special’, I had people that should have cared about me as an individual fail me at key moments by giving up on me, lashing out at me, putting me in social isolation or forbidding me to express myself in ways that were more comfortable to me. The result of that childhood life on my adult life and mental health is that I have a lot of subconsciously deep emotional pain and when I think about my existence I am presented with emotionally crippling pain, this pain torments me and holds me hostage in my own life. The emotional pain is so severe that sometimes I think about suicide, I imagine how it would end all of this suffering that I never asked for, but then I am presented with the realization that I don’t want to die, I enjoy thinking, I enjoy being alive because of my consciousness and am afraid to lose that.

Imagine if I chose to kill myself at this moment, Imagine all of the people that would be saying great things about me right now and how many of the people closest to me would do literally anything to sit down and speak to me for another moment. That is this moment, I’ve been on the edge for most of my life and have grown comfortable living at this edge which has allowed me to experiment with things with a partial disregard for my own life.  


But that thought is off-limits, I cannot share or talk about it because of the structure society has created and limits it has in conversation, I am an extremely intelligent individual that has identified that at a fundamental level society as a whole was not created for me and as a result my specific struggles are even more confusing and frustrating to deal with. But the mental health struggles and feeling of suicide are not an experience that is unique to me, it just feels more unique due to my inability to connect to traditionally used methods of assistance. And that is why I chose drugs; I use them responsibly and preach research and safe consumption of substances but I’m always aware of how easy it is to die when you live in this world. But it’s the only thing in the world that feels right to me, so I keep doing it, and the most normal, safe, okay, good I have ever felt is when I consume Psilocybin. When I microdose this drug the relief I have from my life makes all of my mental anguish disappear, I am free to be myself but I’m aware that I cannot consume it because it’s illegal. That makes me feel terrible, because of a lifelong story of not knowing who I was, what was different with me and being given dozens of different diagnosis, medications and misunderstandings end with the reality that the medication I need is illegal and I can never have it.

When I use Psilocybin everything is perceivably easier, I’m happy, I’m able to enjoy living in the moment and I feel more normal than I ever have in my life. Because it isn’t legal to obtain in the country, I live in it’s like the government is saying the mental anguish and suffering you are feeling is right and you should continue to feel it. But it is a medication to me, it is the only substance that has given me extended relief from my neurological difference and also has no other negative side effects where the typically offered medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, etc carry huge lists of side-effects. But this doesn’t matter, as a child doctors manipulated my mother into believing I had any number of differences, ADD, ADHD, Asperger’s, Tourette’s, etc and then they told her to put me on medication.

Ritalin is the worst thing that happened to my life, during the time I was on it I was angry, hard to deal with and it caused several issues that educators and adults believed were a symptom but in reality, was a side-effect of the drug they were giving me. Ritalin caused me to emotionally mature at a much faster rate than my peers, likely because it caused me to enter puberty and reach maturity by age 8 – 9 which caused a whole handful of issues. Medication trapped me in the body that was physically more mature then I was able to handle. I didn’t gain anything from ADHD medication, it damaged me in ways that I’m unable to grasp, because of these symptoms I had teachers at Tecumseh Public School in Burlington, Ontario put me into ‘social isolation’, for days at a time I was locked in a room by myself by a teacher, EA or other faculty member. With nothing but the work they wanted me to do and whatever I brought in with me, I chose not to do the work and as a result, I didn’t gain an education from the whole time I was at Tecumseh Public School and when I left it left me at a disadvantage in school in comparison to my peers. At this time my mother was acting as my advocate trying to get me into specialized programs that would provide the help I needed, she never found the help through the education system, she did her best to try to get me the best, I had an IEP, I had all of the common systems and tools available to neurologically different individuals but I couldn’t thrive with any of them because all of them were so generic that they didn’t touch on my unique case.

But I want to focus on the decision by educators to place a child into a room by themselves for 8 hours a day, several times a week while allowing them to go outside for lunch and recess where they were bullied by their peers. When they placed me into a social isolation program, they framed it as being ‘experimental’, ‘helpful’ and made it seem like a good thing to an overly medicated child and then ignored the consequences of each session. What they framed as ‘social isolation’ was a requirement by those adults to say the only way they could deal with me was to lock me away for several days a week over the span of years. It was a form of torture that permanently altered my existence. The education system did it because they didn’t know what to do, they gave up on me and as a result, failed me at an important age while I was still developing intellectually leading to a host of mental health issues. **It damaged me in ways you would never understand.**

What social isolation did was allowed me to overthink, every social interaction I had that day, I would go through every moment in my day until I found the exact moment that lead to me getting placed into isolation. But the punishment didn’t end when I had figured it out, educators left me in that room for hours even though I had learned my lesson, this caused me to keep searching for the reason why I was there but I was never able to figure it out. This later lead to me developing a personality characteristic of overthinking which leads to social anxiety and a general impairment of my ability to live, unless I use psilocybin. Due to their actions, I developed issues with anxiety as a child, paired with a troubled family life you could imagine how to an 8 to 9-year-old everything would look like it was caused by them which lead to a lifetime of self-hate and confusion. I believe that I was originally put into social isolation because adults had no idea how to handle me or speak to me, they placed me there because they did not want to deal with me and their actions were wrong and did cause long-lasting damage to me.

In my late teens and early adult life, I started to feel the effects living had on my mental health and its crippling and on-going battle of depression, sadness and feeling alone. At the time I didn't feel comfortable admitting it but my life was the reason why I wanted to kill myself, I had an overwhelming sense of displeasure, unhappiness and pain present in me at all times but felt like I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. It’s interesting to me that as a society we say it’s not okay to speak about mental health or be open with each other about our struggles with our mental health and yet it is the one feeling we all share, regardless of age, race, social status, etc. Our mental health struggles are okay to talk about and the internalized feelings I and you have should be spoken about because if they aren’t they can and do lead to suicide which was the path I was trending at the time. At the time what stopped me from doing it was the construct’s society created in which suicide was looked at as a selfish, immortal act and due to that awareness I knew the act of killing myself would viewed as a greedy or selfish choice by general society and that isn't something I was okay with doing, I didn't want to be a statistic, I wanted to try to be better and help people and I became happier for a time.

Paired with this at the time I could think of all of the people who would be negatively impacted by it and feel terrible as a result of my action which is what has prevented me from doing it in the past. I can imagine and feel the pain my mother, partner, brother, uncle, friends and extended family would feel if I was to kill myself and it adds to the weight of my painful existence. Because of this life and all of my unique struggles when I interact with people, I’m interacting with them at a genuine level and deeply care about them, I would help them with anything that they need and just listen to them and yet I’m afraid to ask for the same type of help. And this is because I’m somehow undeserving of the same right due to the neurological difference I have and societies' seemingly inability to want to adjust to understand who I am and how to best approach me and help me. And yet I would be willing to do that for someone else.

Society has failed many individuals like me, my story isn’t unique and it connects me with so many other individuals at a deeply personal level but I chose to not follow the trend and do the hard thing which sometimes is living and have chosen to ignore all of the negativity in my life and try to focus on being happy instead. Instead of giving in to all of the hate and cruelty in my life and world I choose to operate as someone who is frequently faced with decisions that are challenging and difficult and make the correct decision regardless of the damage it could do to me personally or financially.

I choose every day to live as the best version of myself constantly growing at an individual level while simultaneously living in a body and brain crippled by my past. I enjoy trying new things, being a part of new things and learning and that is the exact characteristic of my personality that I believe best describes who I am. ",19Nov2019,1

I also have proof he lied to me on our chat because of two pictures he sent me. I wouldn’t want to accuse him, I’d just like to let him know I know he’s not being honest.",19Nov2019,4
191,"This film beautifully showcases someone working through suffering, being placed in a spotlight, and then being expected to hold more responsibility than any human can individually hold. Dealing with societal expectations.  It's so indicative of our culture and the pressures being put on kids as they take smartphones and attempt to build a following or fanbase.

192,"so i won’t be doing any of that. it’s been my code since seeing a lot of it in 2014. but as i am a minor, and my mother doesn’t believe in mental illnesses, i cannot get diagnosed until i’m eighteen. it’s difficult to live like this. if any of you know anything about mental illnesses and can somehow unofficially diagnose me so i have an idea of what i maybe might have, it would be greatly appreciated. i apologize if this sounds dumb or generally stuck up, but i have no idea how to ask without sounding offensive or stuck up to those of you who are medically diagnosed :(

trigger warning! some subject here are sensitive so read at your own risk.

regardless. my biggest worry in life is getting close to people. i’m constantly afraid of telling people personal information and then having it used against me. the only way i can share anythjng about myself is if i overshare to strangers, which isn’t any better i don’t think. maybe that’s just a thing teenagers have. i have no clue

-

i’m generally in a good mood when around other people, but usually, the second i get home, i have suicidal thoughts. i feel like tearing my skin off or ripping my lungs straight out of my chest. i’ve thought about it, in some detail, of how i would do it if i ever felt like i absolutely had to. but some days, i’m okay. i get home and i just do homework and watching youtube, stuff like that. other times i scratch at my skin in the shower and count how many ibuprofens i have. sometimes i feel suicidal when at school too, but i usually distract myself somehow.

-

my personality is always changing. i don’t know what i actually act like. at school, i’m the class clown, the funnyman. i’m loud, and touchy. at home, with family, i’m quiet and passive. i don’t do much else but work and be on my phone. the fact that i don’t even know myself when i should be the one who knows me is infuriating, and maybe this bit isn’t relevant to the overarching subject of this post, but it feels relevant enough for me to add.

-

and finally, i am extremely quick to anger. touching my stuff without asking, eating my food, calling me annoying, shoving me, and other minor things make me mad for the rest of the day. sometimes i get so mad i cry. maybe i just have a short temper. i’m not sure myself.

-

i’m sorry if this is worded terribly and/or offensively. i don’t want to offend or harm anybody but i am writing from the heart and i fear that if i reread, i will rethink posting this. i also apologize for the clickbaity title. i just want this post to get some traction. i hope everybody has a nice day :)",19Nov2019,2

195,"I'm in the process of creating a product that'll encourage people to cech in with themselves on a daily basis, by answering some daily questions of their choice in a digital diary. The concept of the app is set up as a conversation with your ""past self"". I was thinking about making the slogan something like

""Talking to yourself does not make you crazy""

or

""Talking to yourself makes you saner""

I'm playing with the stereotype that people talking or mumbling to themselves have mental health issues, but I wanted to make sure I'm not accidentally hurting people with such issues.

196,"I am in Canada for reference,

Here it goes, so Im a male in my mid 20's and Ive been in the mental health system since I was 16 I believe. Currently I’m on Seroquel for a mood stabilizer. Whether thats for anxiety or anger management or low mood I’m not super sure. I’m angry a lot, it’s embarrassing, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable. I just got laid off, I have ei but I need to cut costs everywhere and its stressful. While working at this job I got by but made no money (despite budgeting), was passed over for paid certification (it’s fine I’m not the senior employee), came in 6 full days a week for the past few months at no extra pay (its a non profit there’s no budget I was paid for 35 hours when I worked closer to 50 with and hour of traveling every day), I was injured at work and had to pay for medical expenses I couldn’t afford; through in some employee favouritism and thats the last number of months, I have a college course in this field.

My ex girlfriend (messy breakup but nothing unusual we just don’t talk anymore) started dating someone that had been a good friend of mine before the breakup (not a big deal it had been some months). I was upset about that for a few reasons 1) he snapped chatted me everyday and never told me 2) he let me complain about her to him when I was drunk and he didn’t tell me 3) I heard about it through some wild game of telephone through two a chain of two drunk friends. C bragged about sleeping with her to S, S didn’t tell me for months but eventually told R, Who told me the next weekend cause he was mad at S. When I found all this out I was pretty pissed off and vented about him to a few friends S and R, I said some things I didn’t mean (“kicking his ass” was mentioned) though nothing terribly derogatory about either of them (note I don’t have a history of violent behaviour, I’ve been in one fight self defence from a drunk guy at a party and I didn’t win). I cooled off in a couple days, so obviously S went behind my back and told every about what I had said. The big issue with this is it affected my social life, we run in the same circles and there’s been picking and choosing and there’s two of them. While S claims he didn’t do this there is a healthy amount of evidence that he did, and he has an extensive history of being a lair and a gossip; as well as needing to suck up to C for something he had recently done to him. I walked away from it as much as possible but it hasn’t been easy; the gossip, comments from their friends and family, . 

My childhood was kinda rough I guess, my mom seems to have a mood disorder (suggested by several therapists and her behaviour isn’t normal) she put me through years of emotional and physical abuse growing up (physical till I was like 12, hitting, slapping, throwing dishes at me; emotional, referring to me as “pathetic, defeated, ungrateful, ect.”, kicking me out of the house if I disagreed with her or stood up for myself starting in like middle school, constant harsh and often inaccurate criticism, reminding me how good I had it and calling me spoiled, constant snooping and accusations, blaming me for whatever men had did in her life her father my father ect.). My dad wasn’t around much and didn’t really want to be a parent, he was a pretty mean drunk (just verbal never hit me or my mom), lied a lot (hard to understand when your a kid), he’s been better since he quit drinking. They despise each other and constantly insult the other when I’m around. 

My mom leans on me for support constantly, surprisingly she doesn’t have any friends and doesn’t get along with her family, it’s hard cause she did keep me fed but I can’t be around for any amount of time ( I just walk away when I’ve had enough). She constantly reminds me how hard she has it (she makes 50% more than the average income of the area at a fairly cushy office job, has no debts, and has a boyfriend that hasn’t left despite everything about her) if I have any complaints about my job. She mostly acts normal now but it’s because I rarely see her and she has a highly manipulative nature. 

I have a therapist that says I don’t need regular appointments, and frequently suggests medication changes. I’ve been on a dozen different substances over the years and I don’t think it’s going to help much more than it currently is. I was one one medication for several years with a heavy sedative effect that left me quite vulnerable to my mothers manipulations and abuse. Despite my complaints of being too tired to get out of bed, nodding of while driving and at work (while standing up) it wasn’t changed, so I’m rather hesitant to try again. In my opinion I need coping mechanisms not a magic pill. 

I don’t have many people to talk to about all this, I have a friend that understands but is very busy and I don’t want to put anymore on him, he supported me through my break up. My other friends don’t really understand and don’t get me started about my family. 

End rant

So my current method of improvement and recovery involves pursing several interests and hobbies (learning french and programming to aid in career development; reading psychology books and philosophy to improve my mental health and outlook; exercising everyday), I play video games and watch netflix in the evenings to relax but not excessively, and applying for jobs to improve my financial situation. I should note I have a healthy social life, I have a number of friends and can go out twice I week if I want (or if I could afford it lol), people to go to the gym with ect. My romantic life has been dead lately (talking to two women right now, doubt its going anywhere they have some concerning issues, not that I’m in any place to judge), and I haven’t had any amount of actual romance since me and my ex split up (makes sense I’m kind of a wreck these days). My mood state (anger and occasional social anxiety) have kept me out of the gym and my martial arts club, both of which help keep me sane. I’m also trying to develop meditation and journaling habits.

I deal with anxiety and anger frequently and feel that I have fallen behind my peers in many aspects of my life (financial achievements, pursing romance, being in the career field I want to be in). I'm ore sensitive or reactive than I'd like to be in many situations. I'm also slightly on the spectrum though most people don't seem to notice a social impairment (I do of course).

So I guess my issue is progress is slow and I don’t know if I’m just spinning my tires or not. I’ve been trying to build myself back up the last 5 years or so (I was a high achieving teen if fairly troubled) but despite my progress (confidence, graduated college, more romantic success at times, more self sufficient and capable) I often feel like I’m not getting anywhere. 

Any advice?",19Nov2019,1
197,"I have psychosis. I've had it since I was a kid, and luckily in my case it isn't usually SO severe. I have a couple of more common hallucinations, and whilst they suck, I can deal with them because I'm used to them.

However. Sometimes I've had ""episodes"", where reality just sort of kicks the bucket for a while and I see things, hear very clear voices, etc. 

About an hour ago I came out of the worst episode I've ever had. Unable to breathe the whole time, multiple voices yelling all sorts of horrific things, faces appearing in front of me. It started kind of out of nowhere; I'd just turned the light off and was getting ready to go to sleep when... things... started appearing in the darkness.

I still can't turn the light off. It's well into the night but I know I'm not gonna get any fucking sleep now anyway. It was so scary honestly, in more ways than one. The knowledge that your own senses and mind are lying to you is bloody terrifying. The things I was seeing and hearing were awful. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight. 

What's worse is that I'm quite a rational person. I'm studying a science course at university. I like dealing in facts and absolutes; if I don't know about something, I research it, find out what science says about it and what the facts are. 

Throughout most of this episode, that final tiny rational part of my mind that was still fighting KNEW that it wasn't real. I knew that the voices weren't actually speaking, that there were no faces or things in my room with me.

But they sounded real. They looked real. God knows, it felt ***so*** fucking real. I think that's what terrifies me the most. The total lack of reason makes me feel like I'm going insane. Like the whole world and all of its rules and laws are suddenly snatched away from me and there's nothing I can do about it.

Fuck, tonight has been rough.",19Nov2019,3
