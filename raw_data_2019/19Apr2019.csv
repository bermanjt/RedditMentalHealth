0,"Im 13 and have social anxiety disorder, im in Second year (Scotland) and have very little relationships with anyone in my year. Im quite an introverted person and hate  working in group. This also means i struggle talking to teachers,  once i had filled my maths jotter and couldn't ask for a new one so for about 6 weeks i just rubbed out old work and wrote over that. I do fairly well in class and often get near full marks, but i am often picked on for my high marks and quiet demeanour ( most of the other kids in my class are assholes)",19Apr2019,10
1,"I made a pact that we would talk if I was seriously considering suicide. I’m too scared to talk to her about it although I’ve been thinking about  it for months. I’m in a really bad place. I can’t tell anyone else because my family/ friends think suicidal thoughts are selfish and would get angry. The reason I won’t talk to my therapist is that she would put me in inpatient. She already mentioned it. If that happened, my parents would flip out. Ah I’m screwed",19Apr2019,6

First, I wanna say that I’m only a 13 year old boy.

I don’t hate my life because I’m depressed or anything. I mean, I went through a phase where everything seemed negative.. or maybe I didn’t? Maybe my “change” to thinking positively was an illusion? Idk. But now I have this new problem.

I forgot how to eat.

Let me start by saying that I love food. I mean, food is the most amazing thing in the world, eating, is 100 times better than any activity, because les be honest, I can’t think of a single activity that wouldn’t be better with food involved. 

Anyways, I used to have slight self-confidence issues with my looks a while ago, but then I decided “you know what, who cares what I look like? As long as I get fit, and healthy.” So I chose to not give a fuck what people think of my face, and just eat healthier, because that can’t hurt, right?

Wrong.

The thing is, I also used to be fat. Not too fat, just chubby. I honestly don’t feel like I look different than how I looked before, but when I took a look at old photos, I was shocked. My “chubby” self looked really ugly. To the point where If I met my former self, I would think he was a weirdo.

So, I decided, that I can NEVER, EVER look like that again. NEVER.

I also kept eating healthy, so I can hopefully get abs. 

It was all good at first. I didn’t even crave junk food. I built a mind set that junk food was disgusting anyways.

One day, at my swimming lessons, I did a LOT of exercise. I felt really fit afterwards, and decided “since the day is halfway done, maybe I can fast it till bedtime, and wake up even skinnier the next day.”

And that’s what I did. It felt really empowering. I’ve never been more confident about my weight.

Then I started eating a little junk food.

After that, I stopped eating junk food, but then overate at a bbq we had.

Because I overate, I also fasted all evening again. Nothing much happened, I felt horrible, and fat. I told myself “I’m almost as fat as my chubby self” even though idk if that’s true.

I did some research and decided this was unhealthy, so I began eating normally again. Except I didn’t know how to eat “normally”

How much was “normally”???

What if I ate too much???

What if I ate too little??????

I feel really trapped, to the point where I hate everything. I can’t do a single thing without thinking about my weight.

I can’t eat anything “unhealthy”, because I’ll spend the rest of the week worrying over how to compensate for it.

I can never tell if I’m skinny or fat. 

Sometimes, I feel like maybe I’m just being dramatic or over-exaggerating. I feel like I’m just imagining everything, and it’s driving me crazy.

Nobody knows about this except for me. I can’t tell anyone, because I don’t know what they’ll think of me.",19Apr2019,2
4,Last summer was the worst time of my life. I was self harming and my boyfriend  and best friend both attempted suicide and it was an incredibly stressful and scary time. It was the first warm sunny day today and I smell the air and can feel all of those emotions coming back to me and I’m scared that everything is going to get bad again. How do I help this?

5,"Hello, 21F here, OCD and GAD with occasional panic attacks (VERY occasional). The past month has been a real trip for me, with very few days where I feel normal at all. For some reason, no therapists seem to be available and I get quickly discouraged by their unavailability and fail to push harder to get to them. I’m having a hard time coping day to day, and an especially awful time sleeping. I overanalyse everything to the point of borderline breakdowns (and by “everything” I mean something as small as sending a text) and get really terrifying intrusive thoughts. I’m unable to sleep unless it’s past dawn or unless I’ve either taken my PRN Klonopin or some Benadryl or Melatonin. In my head I’m convinced it’s benzo withdrawals, but I don’t know if I’m using Kpin enough to even have withdrawals. I have extreme health anxiety too, so something as fleeting as a flicker of nausea can absolutely convince me that I’m in serious withdrawal and about to seize or die. I’m truly tired of living this way, and “remedies” like meditation or chamomile tea or online Reiki videos are extremely temporary fixes whose effects fade away within a couple of hours at best. I’m exhausted, and with each thought I have and each breakdown I almost experience, I become more and more convinced that I’m completely insane, because the things I worry about are logically STUPID AS HELL. What do I do? Where do I go from here? No one understands at all.",19Apr2019,1

Today while at work I got highly stressed. A mix between things at home and just home work had been going.

Well, at one point I seemed to completely space out and was mentally shut down and my eyes seemed to just stay locked in front of me but my body stayed in auto pilot and felt as if someone else was controlling what I did. Like I was frozen inside my own body if that makes sense.

It was just a strange thing I thought I should log. If you have any info on what this might be please let me know.",19Apr2019,2
8,"For the past few months, I’ve noticed that my younger sister (17) has been exhibiting some signs of an eating disorder. I was apprehensive about discussing this with her at first because I thought that maybe I was just being the over protective big sister. However, I finally decided to talk with her today and it turns out my suspicions were correct. I asked her if she would like to see a doctor but she said no and that she also doesn’t want our parents knowing. I then offered to personally register/pay for her to get treatment without telling our parents and she still said no. I know that overcoming an eating disorder is difficult and requires medical intervention, so I desperately want her to seek help before things get severely out of hand. She may also be leaving home for university this fall, so getting her the right care is quite urgent. Right now, the plan is to persuade her into talking with our parents and seeking out professional help, but I want to make sure I’m doing what’s best for her. If any of you have any suggestions about what to do in this situation, it would be greatly appreciated!",19Apr2019,3
9,"So this is something Ive struggled with pretty much my whole life, but as an adult it is affecting my personal life more than ever. I feel like I am only half here most of the time. Like I am in a constant fog. I sometimes will completely not register what someone right in front of me is saying. I have zero spacial awareness, Im constantly knocking things over/bumping into things. Sometimes I feel like I under react to things, or I lack emotion. Ive noticed it is worse when I am anxious or stressed. I talked to a therapist briefly about it, and she told me it may be disassociation caused by the large amount of trauma Ive expirienced through out my life since a young age. But I feel like I didnt get the chance to talk to her further about it so I didnt get much information about what Im expiriencing. I just want to be present enough to be a part of the life going on around me. Instead of seamingly floating a long like I have been. Anyone have any similar expiriences or advice on how to improve?

The Mental Health Academy held a Suicide Prevention summit recently, it was live from 12-14 April and available on-demand 15-28 April. [https://www.mentalhealthacademy.com.au/suicideprevention](https://www.mentalhealthacademy.com.au/suicideprevention)

The summit was entirely free, so I'm hoping that it's okay to make this request. 

I'm a health professional and had this on my to do list, but unfortunately got buried in work the last few weeks and missed the registration! I'd really like to access the summit while it's still available on-demand, and wondered if anyone had registered and might be willing to share their access? I've asked around and none of my colleagues had registered either. You'd be helping to spread the professional knowledge so that more community services can do their jobs and support people better!  

Thank you so much Reddit community.",19Apr2019,2
13,"I'm 17. I know that a lot of people who  are autistic experience great levels of stress and anxiety when their routine is interrupted but I'm not autistic. I am depressed and I do have OCD. Anyhow, I really can't tolerate the slightest unexpected change in life. For example, if I planned on revising from 3:00pm to 5:00pm but suddenly unexpected guests arrive it ruins everything. It may be something small like, I planned on relaxing for an hour after revision in the living room but can't now as there are guests. This really gets to me. I put my earphones in and just curl up in a ball as everything is interrupted and I already feel as I have no control over my life due to my mental health but this just further solidifies my lack of control.

Six months ago I was researching a YouTube personality, he has around 100k subs.

This person was involved in a telegram group dedicated to sharing pedophilia and “hardzoo” otherwise known as zoosadism.

I will spare you the details as I don’t want you to be hurt, but this person shared photos of things no human should ever see.

I was planning to write an article in a blog I was published on about this person, but I scrapped it and decided that it would never be published. I don’t  want anyone else to even think about the things those people did.

That was six months ago. In that time I lost my job, fell into a deep depression and clawed myself back out, and yet I still see them in my dreams. Every photo He posted is seared into my memory that some nights I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes I keep seeing them. I took trazodone to keep me from dreaming , it worked for a month and I got some sleep for once, then it stopped.

Some nights I don’t think about it, I sleep fine, others I’m wide awake and scared to blink. 

I just want them to go away, I want to clear my head and make the pictures go away.

I just feel like I do not want to be in their class. I try my best but its not good. I did badly on a test. They mentioned my name while they were going over mistakes people made. They also have asked me before If I take medicine. I do not think they need to know that.

I no longer feel like thoughts or moods can take me unawares and trap me. Meditation has given me the 'time' to see bad mental phenomena before they take hold.  


When I am suffering from depression, it is no longer as bad, and does not last as long - the same is true for anxiety, particularly for panic attacks.

I want to be thin but I want to be toned and have a nice shape like all those girls online. They’re so confident and beautiful and I feel so gross about how I look that I just want to hide in the shadows forever. There isn’t one trait I like about myself whether it’s physical or personality.

27,"I will try to keep it straight to point since there's so many posts like this.

Im a Sophomore at a state univetsity. Age 21.
I have no friend and have no interest in most things in life.

I numbered my problems, so it's easier to read:

(1) I seem to be able to initiate conversation and leave good enough impression to people to be interested (aka chit chat). But my biggest problem is that I have nothing talk about since I have no interest in pretty much anything. I lack things that I could do with others... So I get this impression that I just have these people whom I know to superficial level.

For example, I joined a boardgame club and last semester and sticked around for a while. Also tried out bunch of card games. But I ended up quitting them because I simply did not enjoy those activities. I ended up making some acquitance though.

REASON (1) IS PROBLEM: I cant go beyond just knowing people's faces and chit chats about classes. Also NOT knowing what most people should be aware of (due to my lack of interests and no social life), makes me insecure, so I find myself shying away from situation when comversation dives into anything of real value.

(2) Sometimes I think that not only I am NOT interested in things in this world but also people in general. I feel like I'm reaching out to people solely out of necessity NOT because I actually want to get to know them. Cuz ""it's not good to be alone"". Of course, there's that reason. But I am also very afraid of having emotional intelligence of a high schooler (hopefully not lower) when I join work force in my profession.

If I don't get enough chance to socialize, it's only natural that my social skill will deteriorate. Some peers told me that I sound alot younger than how old I actually am (which is a polite way to say that I talk like a kid).

There's these reasons. But, I just feel very lonely sometimes, but it's weird that I dont want to get to know anyone for real. 

(3) I'm scared of revealing my true self. I had trust issues with a very close friend I used to have. I burned the bridge cuz he repetitively hurt my feelings using all his knowledge about my vulnerabilities. He's very insecure person himself and I think that was his way of dealing with it... by bring me down. It genuinely hurt that he used my trusts in him against me.


HERE'S SHORT VERSION / QUESTIONS:
1. I have no interest in almost anything. So I have no topics to talk about or things to do with others. Should I force myself to have interests even if I don't enjoy them?

2. In fact, I have no interest in others to start with. Should I force myself to have interests in others, considering I do feel very lonely sometimes? Also for the sake of social skills.

3. I used to have emotionally abusive friend. I think this is affecting me as I'm scared of being myself / revealing my true self / trusting others. It's like my subconscious mind is tring to prevent it from ever happening again. How do I fix this problem?



Note: I am going to get a professional help (before shits get actually ugly). In fact, Im basically using this to organize my thoughts. I DON'T expect to have those questions actually answered. Just wanted to hear your thoughts.",19Apr2019,1
28,"Disclaimer: This may be triggering and I understand that what I feel isn’t the absolute truth nor do I think it’s the only way of dealing with mental health

  For a long time, ever since I was maybe 12 I’ve had this idea that the solution to my problems would be death wether it be by suicide or be it external forces. I have lived thinking that taking my life would be the fast and easy way to stop feeling so worthless and incompetent but I’ve fought those feelings so har sand for so long that I’m just tired. I don’t want to care anymore, I want to give up. I told myself that once I turned 18 I would kill myself and be at peace. However, when I really did turn 18 and I had the chance I realized something, I was too scared to do it. Being so close after so long and I chickened out. I just froze and kinda shutdown in the moment. Since that point I’ve tried getting “back into” life and get to therapy but it feels like my entire existence has been stagnated and trapped in this state of nihilistic misery. I’ve pretty much stopped functioning on a basic level as well to which I’m being supported my family for everything from eating to even just walking out the door. For a while I blamed others for my misery but now I know I did it to myself and for that I hate myself more than anything else in existence. This world is flawed yet so am I so why am I the only one who doesn’t get to burn?
  So here I am bitter and cold towards the world that’s bore me and I just have nothing left to give. I’ve gotten to such a high level of apathy that my own mother called me sociopathic and I felt nothing. How do I live when I want to die but am too scared to do anything about it. The worst part to me is that I’ve seen the beauty of this world, I’ve felt it, it’s too much to be contained or reasoned away yet it’s the evil in the world that prevails in the end.

30,"I started 10 mg of Celexa 2 weeks ago today. Let me back up a little by saying I have suffered with depression since early teens (maybe longer but my memory really start in early teens...) and have tried that i can remember in no order prozac, paxil, zoloft, fluoxetine, and wellbutrin (had a severe suicidal reaction to that one). Zoloft being the last one I tried. 

Prozac I didnt notice any change that I can remember

Paxil would work for like a week and i would crash

Fluoxetine made me sleep all the tiiiime!!

And zoloft started to feel ok, but never really went beyond that...

So i went to my doctor two weeks ago, because i was off of zoloft for a few month, my anxiety was getting unbearable now that i got back in school. I could not concentrate and got two D grades (later retook them and got B grades! Go me!) And I just could not let my depression and anxiety get in the way of my school like that again. 

He wrote down the SSRIs I have tried before, and told me he would put me on something different. I also asked for an anxiety medication since it is my main struggle. And he prescribed me Celexa and Atarax. 

Now after about 5 days I started feeling the effect, I typically start feeling effects with in the first week, so I was like... cool! But after the 7 day mark... I felt something I have not felt in so long I forgot what the feeling felt like... and that is happy. I was actually happy for the first time in as long as I could remember. I only had to take the Atarax the first few days. I no longer am overwhelmed by my over active worrying causing me anxiety. I have also not been struggling with my insomnia either!

31,"My friend got involved with a mutual friend from high school. Back then she was shy but fairly 'normal'. About 6 years later when they got into the relationship she already had a child with a guy who was very controlling and had become abusive. I sense she was traumatized from the whole thing.

They dated for a while and when I starting talking to her again I thought she was about the same as back in school. They moved in together and are in all respects, except by law, married. They now have a kid together (about 3 years old, may be Autistic... been pressuring them to get him tested. Long story for another post.).

I started hearing things after about a year or so of them being together about things that go on. Here is a summary list of things over the years.  
*Note: I think when she says ""dirty"" she means ""contaminated"" or ""tainted"".*

* She won't go to Fry's (Kroger grocery store) because she worked there when she met the ex and it's ""dirty"". This is to the extent that I can't send anything over in a Fry's bag. It has been at times that my friend has to shower when he comes back from my house because we ""shop at Fry's"".
* My friend is not allowed to go to certain stores because she believes they are stores that the ex or his family visit.  
Luckily this guy has not had any interest in seeing his kid... but she won't seek child support because she doesn't want to open that door ( I can't blame her on that). But this belief forces them to shop at stores that are miles further away when they don't have a vehicle. They rely on the bus, taxis, and Uber. This belief costs them a lot of money.
* She has piles of stuff, in rooms and in closets, that must not be touched because it is ""dirty"". If my friend remotely touches any of this ""dirty stuff"" he must take a shower. This stuff includes clothing and random belongings from when she was with the ex. She won't go through it and make it clean.
* The house is filthy. My friend isn't the most immaculate guy... he's been known to let a cup sit on the coffee table or leaving some dirty cloth on the ground between loads. But in all the time I have known him, including when he lived with me, he's never been a filthy person.  
He is not allowed to clean. One time he cleaned the kitchen while she was gone. He literally was cleaning stuff that had mold on it. When she got home she had a complete breakdown, threatened to kill herself, and then cried for hours. She shut down for a few days and said she didn't know where he had spread the dirtiness to. She feared that he'd made the whole apartment ""dirty"". She eventually moved past this and things went back to the norm.
* She has began collecting soda bottles (plastic) because she believes that she can truck them somewhere, though not sure where, and make money for recycling them. Yes, this is a thing... you can get paid a few cents per pound. So hundreds of bottles might cover the gas to get them to a facility.  
What this ends up being is that they have 60 - 80 bottles sitting right-side up in their living room. Most of them were not rinsed out. My friend may not rinse the bottles and bag them. He most definitely may not actually recycle the bottles. I'm pretty sure if he touches them she'll have a breakdown.
* Do to some of the above; the apartment now is swarmed with hundreds, if not thousands, of flies. This is a persistent problem year round.

I'm concerned for the children's outcomes. Her kid is now old enough that she will remember these living conditions when she is older. Their kid will be soon. Both are physically healthy.  I don't have any reason to believe the children are in any immediate danger otherwise I'd personally make a few select calls. I'm more thinking that this environment could be quite damaging to their adult lives, specifically their mental health.

I'm also worried for my friend. He's struggled with depression in the past. He deserves better. We've talked to great length about this. We think he needs professional advice/assistance.

**So my questions are:** What should he do? Are there free resources online or by phone (*Arizona, USA)*? How would we go about intervening in this behavior? 

Thanks in advance for any advice and tips.",19Apr2019,12
32,"Any thoughts welcome. The thing is, whenever the topic of myself comes up, especially in a group setting, I can’t help but cry. It’s something completely uncontrollable and it makes me feel like such a weak person. Add to that the embarrassment of it all. Confrontation does the same thing to me, but only when it’s specifically aimed at me (more importantly my personal thoughts or actions, not petty stuff or conflict). 

I’ll present some examples. The very first time I can recall was years and years ago in middle school (yeesh). I remember feeling extremely overwhelmed in a specific advanced english class, and I had finally mustered up the courage to speak to the counselor. I asked straightforwardly if it was possible to switch out. Was all good until he asked why. I guess I just didn’t know how to talk about my emotions, and so I tried my very best to explain that it was just too much for me and the teacher wasn’t exactly the best for me, but it hardly came out as my voice started cracking and tears started flowing. (btw he said I should “give it a shot.” Ended the year with an F in that class :’))

Mind you, I was a 13 year old girl going through it. Alright, fine, emotions were screwy. But, it didn’t stop. Skip to a few years later in high school, and (yes, I realize you’re still a hormonal, emotional mess at this point) a similar thing happened. I had missed a lot of school and was at a really low place mentally. A lot was going on in my home life and school was the interference.  I go to the nurse one day feeling sick, and the nurse asks me if everything about my physical being has been okay. We work up to the point that maybe I’m stressed out cause I’m not sleeping right, stomach problems, whatever. Then a more personal question comes up and I immediately start crying. Usually I try my best not to cry in any place that’s not home, but this is the type that I have absolutely zero control over and really feel so shit that I don’t care if I’m crying in public. 

Or Christmas Day last year. We were going around the room and everybody had to say what they were grateful for. Okay, no big deal, palms a little sweaty. This is happening with family that is not super close. Gets to me, I say something generic like family and “you guys” and safety. One annoying uncle probes for more. I delve into some more personal info. Ok, starting to lose it mentally but composure is still held. Then, he asks how I feel about what I just shared. I try to croak something out but I practically start sobbing and I dig my face into my mother’s arms. Very embarrassed, they try to console me, not very effective. 

This was already too much, and I could provide many more examples. Like crying during a mock interview (not even a real one). Embarrassed myself in a room full of mentally stable people also getting mock interviews and highly professional volunteers that were giving them. 

Love my brain!! Truly feel that I have no control over my emotions right now.",19Apr2019,167

34,"Hello, I’ve had this depression for a while now, I’m 15 and it seems stupid that I feel so sad while being so young. I hope the 3 people that see this can try to help me, this is kinda my last resort to find happiness

The main thing that makes me so mad at myself is I don’t really have a reason to be this fucking sad. Like I have a great support system, I have an amazing friend that’s like a brother to me, an actual brother that is always there for me. A girlfriend that actually cares about me (I think, I’ll talk about that later) and parents who care. Like sure my mom drinks heavily and I have some family issues but everyone does, I’m not special. I’m liked at school for the most part and stuff like that, but no matter what I always have that underlying feeling of no self worth. The feeling that I am nothing and will amount to nothing. Sure I have those moments when I’m happy but those never last. 

The next thing I wanna talk about is my self doubt about my girlfriend and I. Now, I know I’m just 15 and relationships don’t matter at my age, but she really is special to me, and I really care about her. And I think she cares about me, but there’s this little voice in my head that tells me that she doesn’t care about me, and she’s just using me as a stepping stone to go onto someone better. And because of that I feel like I never have her full trust and she doesn’t have mine, and I’m scared that it’s gonna ruin the best thing in my life. It’s stupid. I think this is coming from when I was younger, I was pretty fucking fat and ugly (now I’m not fat and not as ugly, puberty did me well) no one liked me and always made fun of me, so as like a self defense tactic I made fun of myself. And sure that kinda cut down on the other kids making fun of me, it made me start to believe that I was worthless and I should just kill myself. The bullying on myself from me and other kids got so bad my family had to move across the state. 

I just want to be happy, and usually talking doesn’t help me but I’m running out of options, everyday I wake up it gets harder to get up and want to live. I don’t think I would actually go that far to end my life because I don’t want to be that big of a burden on my family and others but I’m not sure. I did use to self harm but realized that it doesn’t help, and it pushes depression on others. And I hate doing that. That’s why I don’t really use my support system like I should. I’m scared that me talking about how sad I am will make them sad. Almost everyone I mentioned has depression, my whole family has very bad depression and my mom is especially bad, she’ll start to think she did bad as a mom and start drinking more, and doing bad stuff drunk people do (don’t really wanna go into detail but just trust me when I say she’s a bad drunk) which in return makes me sadder. So, I’m coming to you reddit, please give me support. Love you all.&lt;3",19Apr2019,3

36,"My brain doesn't seem to work right? I've been struggling lately with feeling like I'm not enough. Like I'm not good for anyone around me the way I am. I don't know how to be different though? I've tried therapy so many times and never found it helpful. It feels like to keep trying it is a waste of money and time. I know how to do things like CBT, I know how they work, I know the mechanics of it, but I can't force my brain to work that way without it constantly putting me down at every turn. I downloaded the app headspace to try to do that and every time I try to meditate I disassociate and feel like I don't exist. They say to focus on the sensations on your body and I'm like ""what body??? It no longer exists!!!!"" And I've tried medication after medication.

I've been feeling worse about myself since I basically explained to my fiance how my brain works. When someone says something good about me my first instinct is to think they are lying. They are just trying to be nice or they are straight up lying. When someone says something negative about me or that my brain can twist into a negative whether they meant it that way or not it internalizes it and that just reaffirms things. I have a running stream of consciousness telling me all the time that I'm ugly, stupid, useless, annoying, etc. that I can't shut up. I try and I try and I try and I try and I can't and every time I can't I feel worse.

Oh, I’m impulsive? Illness. I’m majorly depressed and cannot function? Illness. I used to look at the idea of having a diagnosis as step one, but everyday I just wish it were gone. I can’t deny the uncanny resemblance of my personality to that of someone who legitimately has the illness, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if my prescribed medicine is helping me out because I still keep on making the same mistakes. I get very impatient when I say I want to change that it sets me back by three steps. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I would also like to point out that I have a psychiatrist, but I’m not sure if this is sufficient.

I'm still unable to show my true emotion to anyone but myself. I have to cry and scream silently to myself because I know that no one actually cares to listen.

I just want help. Why am I so jealous of others, it seems that everyone else is attaining a happiness I cannot personally achieve. I do not have the money to pay for therapy.

41,"So a bit of an odd one.
I was dating a guy for a while who I was really really into. I think I loved him.
Before me, he’d just come out of a very traumatic relationship. His ex attempted suicide multiple times. He told me some of the stories about how she’d go missing and when he found her she was passed out in the car having taken MASSIVE amounts of pills, he told me about how he’d spent most of last year in and out of hospital with her, for stitching up cuts, for overdoses. 
He’s so messed up from the entire experience and everything with us went to shit and he ended things with me and hurt me badly. 

Sometimes if I’m watching a show and there’s some kind of intense scene similar to this, *I* have this intense reaction to it and start imagining scenes of when *he’d* experience these things. I imagine him picking her up and carrying her into the car; the panic he would’ve felt. My hands get clammy and I can’t breathe properly and I immediately feel sick to my stomach and feel so so sad. 

Why am I having these reactions? Why do I imagine him in these scenarios? Is it empathy on overdrive? Is it because I know that these experiences is what led him to being so screwed up and why it could’ve never worked between us? Why does it make me feel so sick and sad?

I've been seeing a few therapists over the years.  The newest therapist I've had for a few months have said I could have some kind of depression.  Which I don't think is the case because I'm never sad about anything.  The only times I ever self-harm is when I'm really bored.

57,"Hi all, so it's currently 4 am here and I'm trying to get myself to go back to sleep but feel jittery and hyped up for no reason and I think I need to vent/maybe get some advice for how to work through what I'm feeling. I haven't really been on mental health reddit but thought it the best place for this (maybe r/relationshipadvice ?) Also I already plan on going to therapy and seeking out help as soon as my life situation allows (not gonna go into it). Anyway let's get on with it. 

So for a while now, since I had my daughter, my mental health has been degrading at a higher and higher rate. At first it was PPD, but that didn't seem to last very long, which I'm grateful for. However, once I got my birth control put in (implant in my arm), that's when the shit started to hit the fan. 

I was starting to get paranoid that my SO was cheating on me, that there were things he was keeping from me, and that he just didn't love me anymore. I've been very open with him about all of it since it started, and he hasn't gotten defensive about it or anything, even being understanding when I signed us up for the family gps trackers we can have on our phone (yes I'm aware this probably also contributed to my bad state of mind but I fear what I would've done had I not gotten it...). He worked nights at the time so there really wasn't any point in having it because it was work, then sleep, except on the days he didn't work. But nevertheless, he went along with it because I felt like it would help. 

However the thoughts have strayed away from him cheating on me to him just not loving me at all. Over and over I tell myself ""he loves you, he's stayed with you through so much bad shit, he hasn't shown any signs of not loving you other than just being an butt sometimes but that's nothing new"", but it never works for long. He'll act distant for some reason (he's tired, I did something that got him upset and now he needs alone time, etc) and my mind just flies into panic mode, thinking ""this is the start of the end"". Or he'll forget to do something that's important to me, and I think ""someone who actually loved and cared for you wouldn't have forgotten, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about the things that you care about"". 

It's stuff that wouldn't normally bother me as much as this, at all even, but for some reason my heart or my head fixates on it... last night before bed, I told him ""I want to cuddle, we haven't cuddled or even touched during the night the last 2 nights and I want to cuddle"" he makes a slight mocking noise we use to say a noncommittal ""ok"" and we stop talking about it, come bedtime I'm on my phone and feel my eyes dropping so I put my phone down and go to sleep while he stays up to play video games, I dont feel him come to bed... well our child is currently sick and having a hard time sleeping, so we are both already a little on edge, and were trying to soothe her and get her back to sleep, and were both getting frustrated, and honestly I can't remember at this point what was even said, but for some reason it left me acutely aware of the fact that he came to bed without saying anything, without a single touch, without any of the cuddling I told him I wanted earlier... and now I can't sleep... even after she did fall asleep...

Were both currently awake now because of he waking back up but I'm unsure of whether or not I talk about it because I know the only reason I'm feeling it so strongly is because of this fucked up thing in my head and I dont know how to make it stop.... 

Please dont be mean, I may be crazy but I'm still very soft.... that being said, I think I really just need help sorting through what my head thinks is the right way to react to something I know wouldn't typically hurt me, and how I would usually react. Honestly I haven't really even touched on the full extent of the problems this thing/i has/have been causing my my relationship, my husband, and I.

Basically for over a year I have been feeling sad. Every day. Some days more, some days less, but every day I will feel sad and hide this from my family and friends who have no idea because I still laugh and appear to be 'fine'. On top of this I feel like I'm constantly about to sit an exam or job interview with the same tightness in my chest and butterflies in my stomach. Every day.

I cancel plans with my family and friends, lie and say I have to work, and then lye in bed or maybe on the sofa and do nothing. Watching TV - too much effort, play video games - too much effort, play music - too much effort. I don't get enjoyment from things I know I enjoy, I feel weighed down by this blanket of lethargy and apathy. I am tired no matter how many hours of sleep I get per day and have earned a reputation of being lazy when really I just find it hard to motivate myself to do anything.

Worst part is I have a GF (27F) who I have been with for over 10 year and could not love more, I have a job, a puppy, a family that I know loves me. I have no excuse to feel so miserable, so why do I? I haven't spoken to anyone I know about this as I am a major emotional introvert and really don't want anyone to feel responsible. 

I had an especially bad day about a week ago which has prompted me to want to get better but I don't even know what's wrong with me. I'm afraid that if I speak to my GP that they will tell me that there's nothing wrong with me. Am I blowing normal feelings out of proportion?",19Apr2019,2

I have tried so many times in the past to take charge and eat well and exercise often and as I soon as I get into and kind of routine that voice in my head speaks up. It tells me that there’s no point in even trying. That I’m not worth it, and never will be. That I will always be a worthless fat piece of shit. 
It’s taking a toll on my mental health and Im worried it’s affecting my partner as well. He’s always so worried and when he notices me in a bad place he hugs me tight and tells me that he loves me no matter what and thinks I’m beautiful. And I know he means it, I just can’t see it.

64,"since i started taking escitalopram i feel like i’m getting worse but it may be the fact that i started it when i started therapy/psychiatrist appointments as i’ve started to think too hard.

i was put on escitalopram after being diagnosed with severe anxiety that i have suspected for years, i haven’t talked to my psychiatrist about my thoughts of how i might have depression i’ve only had 6 sessions and i don’t feel like i can properly open i up, i don’t want my family to know what’s going on so i don’t tell her for fear she will have to tell my parents about stuff (suicidal thoughts ect) i think it would actually be best for my if i go to a psych ward/ mental hospital.

at times of weakness and extreme sadness i cut i do not do it for attention i only ever open up on the internet i’ve only ever told one person once irl that i wanted to kill myself and that was two years ago when i admitted that, i try to do stuff so my mind can’t think too hard which will lead to me feeling down and depressed and staining at scissors.

if my parents died tomorrow i would kill myself the day after as i only live so they wouldn’t have to blame themselves that makes me cry a lot, i would slit my wrists at anytime but the thought of them finding me and crying and blaming themselves for not knowing for not having checked on me i just can’t deal with that .

i always wear long pants/sweat pants/ y’all socks as i cut on my lower leg as to not be visiable, i don’t want to go swimming anytime soon as my only excuse would be “oh cat scratches” when i first cut i cut my hand twice and said it was a paper cut that week i hid it from my psychiatrist.

i feel like people thing my feelings are invalid because i am young and a “sad teen” i can’t see myself going anywhere in life i don’t want children i’m not that socialble or good with talking to the opposite gender. the only two things that bring me joy are eating and animals i would work at a pet store i would love to but i am too fatigued :( this week i am going to the pet store again, there is this rat named ramsey, he is my fave but my parents say i can’t have a rat because i already have a rabbit and i love him so much but, rats ya know?

ok this is just kind of a brain dump of feelings, feel free to dum me if you wanna be my online therapist

65,"I went through a rather heartbreaking experience in my last relationship a few years ago, she'd always lie and go behind my back. I never actually caught her in the act of cheating, but periodically there was evidence left behind and I almost caught her after I came home from work. (long story in itself) finally I got up the courage to make the decision that I didn't love her and went through a HUGE change. I moved out, got all my stuff out of there yada yada. I am still having trouble sleeping through the night, I still wake up with that feeling of sadness and betrayal every morning. I dont have feelings toward her at all. But the physical and emotional tole it has taken on me has been extremely exhausting. I've recently noticed I'm not the person I use to be. I use to be a happy person, I use to be the one everyone would go to, when they were having a hard time to get some words of encouragement. Now I'm shut off from the world. I dont leave my house unless I have to go to work or absolutely HAVE to go to the store. I dont have my confidence anymore. People dont take into account that when you cheat.

66,"TW: talk of death

I feel like my whole life I've been perpetually stuck as a well-read 17 year old with social anxiety, anxiety, depression, paranoia and almost zero social skills.

The regular adult things are a real struggle like saving up, shopping wisely, relationships, chores, personal hygiene, physical health, etc. My emotional capacity has also been stuck in a 15 year olds mind. I get annoyed when people disagree with me, ticked when I'm asked to do something I don't want to but I can go above and beyond in the things I enjoy. 

I get totally consumed by what I like, even my work where I can spend 12 hours every day if the people there are nice to me but hardly survive the 8 hours if they aren't. Also, I constantly worry about angering people around me for the silliest stuff but unintentionally insulting them by saying something inappropriate.

I've been trying to fight this my whole adult life but I feel like I can never have a normal life being like this. I can't even save up for future nevermind finding a stable relationship if I can't even handle my own chores. I alternate between being overly social, spending most evenings out and detesting  and on the other hand I don't want to leave my flat the entire week and have trouble even going to work.

My work ethic is good and I never had complaints there. I never even been in a sick leave and my bosses usually give me glowing recommendations. Only one didn't because I didn't like the job.

I feel like nobody likes me and I suck at everything. I hardly call anyone a friend because I feel like nobody wants to be mine. My biggest fear is that I will need help of others because I don't know who or how to ask. At least of my weekends are spent crying about how lonely and miserable I feel. Whenever I try to do something to improve my life, regardless of how much I try, it just makes things worse. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel absolutely miserable. I really wish I could disappear forever.

I wish there was a way to fix myself because this life is hell. My friend recently ended in a psychiatric hospital and I honestly envied him. He got taken care of, he got meds, he had warm food and people to talk to and doctors all around him.

Therapy is useless, I was told by two therapists that I'm fine and there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. Sometimes I really think that death is the only option for this to ever end.",19Apr2019,2

I normally keep them to myself but my girlfriend has being encouraging me to share my whats going on generally in my head with her. It's very important Im open with her to her and so I'm trying to be. I've mentioned before to her that I have instrusive thoughts to hurt other people and myself but I feel never really got into it property.
Last night I was anxious about her and how close I am to her and so the thought to kill her kept popping into my head. Again want to make clear, I have and never would act and these thoughts and I think they are more an overreaction my mind at my ability to deal with strong emotions so in this case it was maybe my mind panicking over how close I felt to her and then trying to push her away in a weird way.  She was pressing for what was going on in my head so I told her. Its a horrible thing to tell someone but I really wanted to be open and tried to explain to her it was my fear and anxiety and it wasnt something real but I have defintely scared her a lot.  She wouldn't look at me this morning and left hers (where we were) without saying anything. Please can someone help! What should I do?

68,"I am 17 and diagnosed with schizophrenia. I take meds that make me feel like crap and sap my emotions and motivation. I only take meds because I think my family won't accept me if I don't. They are uncomfortable with me being a psychic so they use meds to suppress my powers.

Off my meds, I make things happen just by thinking about them. I can make people do things with telepathy. I understand being jealous of this power and finding it dangerous for mortals to dabble in. I get that. I see how everything is related to everything else and it makes me highly intelligent so I get medicated to confuse my speech and thinking down to the level of everyone else.

I had scary moments where spirits would follow me around trying to take over my body but all in all it's just a minor cost to having this power.

People get upset when I talk about not taking my meds. My dad walked out on the family and my mom hates me too. I take them because I don't want my aunt or brothers to hate me, but someday I will be rejected by them too and forced to make the choices that are best for me alone.",19Apr2019,0
69,"The past few months/weeks I've tried to get help. I needed a flat. I needed someone to talk to. But those things don't come just by asking for them. I've phoned and mailed and visited so many people I even overcame my fear of phoning. But it was no good. Got invited to a total of one shrink and he put me on a waiting list. Never to be heard of again. Got invited to two different college counselors. We talked and it was good, but 50 minutes are not enough to explain what is going on in my head right now. Then the sitting was over and they put me on a waiting list as well. Two more months to go until I get my next 50 minutes.

I can't deal with all of this waiting and being put off. ""You can always call when it gets really bad."" ""But it is really bad. What is going to happen now?"" ""Oh, I'm sorry about that. Let me take a look, the next possible appointment is in two months. You can always go to a crisis centre in the meantime."" So I went to the crisis centre, who told me to go see a professional. Circuit circled.

My friends don't pick up the phone anymore. My mum doesn't pick up the phone anymore. Therapists just let their voicemail answer for them. I'm tired. Noone wants to deal with me.

70,"I feel so broken, so tired, so empty. I've been ""happy"" for awhile now. I did all sorts of things to improve my life, even if it took so much energy. I cleaned my room, I changed my sheets, I went out with friends, I made new friends. I thought I was improving, and I believed in myself.

But jus around 5 hours ago, I felt like this weird feeling, like an anxiety attack. I feel hard to breathe, like there was a lump in my throat. My chest hurts from my heart beating so hard, I feel cold and I was mildly shaking. Maybe it was the cold, but I couldnt stop feeling weird. I didnt really think i was gonna die and all that, but I was just, nervous.

I got out of bed when my mom invited me to go out and eat dinner- it was weird that she was suddenly affectionate, but whatever. I thought maybe going out could help me take a breather. But for some reason she said we weren't going and yelled at me for something that Ive got nothing to do with. Usually I'd just roll my eyes and leave, but tonight, I just closed my ears, my eyes started to water so suddenly and I felt like I couldnt take it anymore. I told her its enough and to stop, and just ran back to my room. I spent the last 10 minutes bawling in the toilet, for no apparent reason. I havent been piling up any emotions recently, and this feels just like a repeat of what happened back when i was 15. Just suddenly as if my emotional pipe was damaged.

When I was crying in the bathroom, I was contemplating self harm, something I havent done since I was 15. Ive been clean for 3 years. But I couldnt move, I just sat there crying for no reason. When I finally got up, I saw myself in the mirror. Sounds like some sort of edgy teen fiction, but I really just see someone so broken. I feel so damaged, that I feel like everyone who knew me wouldnt even want to be near me if they really knew the me that I saw in the mirror. I washed my face and sat on the bed, to type things out but I just started bawling again.

So I've been friends with this gal for a while now, and in general she's a super sweet person and very nice on the outside. Maybe a little bit of a more quiet person? But not really not bad where she won't talk to people.   


She has a much better ""best friend"" who she confides in me that she sometimes get annoyed with because of how ""extroverted"" she is. I've got a job this summer and was encouraging her to apply to some different jobs (sending her application links etc) and she said she's not scared for applying or rejection, but actually working. She says she's scared about almost everything and constantly complains to me about it. While I try my best to engage with her and let her be herself, its becoming a constant in my life to wake up and go to bed with her talking &amp; complaining about a variety of different matters pertaining to school, stress, her friends and how she feels ""scared"". She doesn't even feel comfortable enough to discuss these things with her aforementioned ""best friend"". While its getting quite tiring to constantly assure her she's ok, I also want her to be more confident in herself and like stop feeling so shit, I guess.

She openly admitted to me that she’s been cutting important things out of her life and “preparing for death” and that’s one of the contributing factors to her breaking up with me. She even said that she’s replacing important people in her life with shitty people who bring her down to literally give her a reason/excuse to die. Its so sad, after all that we went through, and now I have a lingering fear that she might no longer be alive. 

What do I even do in this situation? She’s so hard set on killing herself, even after numerous attempts at reassuring her that she’s not a burden to me or anyone to her life and attempts at convincing her to continue on in life. Also, she’ll have periods where she’s highly considering suicide, and where she’s confident and optimistic.

I am just now finishing up my freshman year of college, and college is the first place where I drank alcohol and smoked weed. I found myself a huge stoner, smoking almost every night at the start of the year. No problem, it was fun, a nice way to relax. I would drink socially, generally just have a good time. But as time went on, I started smoking more and more, eventually becoming an all day, every day user. I quit for a few days here and there, but nothing too drastic. 

I noticed at this point I’m mostly smoking/drinking as a way of dealing with my problems, which is the last thing I want to do. I want to take a break, get back to when my mental health was good, and then take it easy with the substances. I would say by no means am I an alcoholic, but I want to avoid that and not feel like I need substances to have fun.

94,"I was compelled to write an email to family members about mental health. I wrote this email due to recent circumstances of a relative who is facing severe criminal consequences (i.e., the death penalty). I wanted to share what I wrote in case anyone else might find it useful for opening up a channel to their loved ones on mental health. If even one person in my family can find solace in my attempt to reach out, then I've achieved my goal.  


""Hi all,

For those of you who have never received an email from me and are wondering who this could be: I'm \*name\*, your son, your cousin, your nephew, and most importantly, someone who cares about you.

I am writing you because I am compelled by a recent release of a mental health report (attached to this email; p. 1-6) regarding another relative: \*name\*. I am sure at this point most, if not all, of you know of his current situation. Indeed, many of you, including myself, have been visited and interviewed by his legal team. Between knowing \*name\* and these interviews, it should come as no surprise that mental health has a role in his situation. In fact, regardless of guilt or innocence, the underlying cause of his situation is mental health.

In reading this report (which I strongly suggest all of you to do), I arrived at three main conclusions: (1) there is a clear and undeniable existence of mental health issues, (2) \*name\* felt helpless, alone, and that he did not have support, and (3) \*name\* actively sought help and the system failed him (on multiple occasions). It is the first and second conclusions that I wish to address. I will not waste key strokes on the third conclusion other than: There is an egregious systemic failure to provide adequate mental health resources in our country \[U.S.A.\]. This is not up for debate. This is a fact.

I'd like to first start with a brief discussion of mental health. Mental health affects everyone. The prevalence of mental disorder in youth (ages 13-18) is [1 in 5](https://www.nami.org/NAMI/media/NAMI-Media/Infographics/Children-MH-Facts-NAMI.pdf). This means that either your child or one of your child's friends has had some diagnosable mental health disorder. [37% and 47%](http://ga.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wellbeingreport_2014.pdf) of people in Master's and PhD programs, respectively, reach the clinical threshold of depression -- this does not account for other possible mental health issues such as anxiety disorder (many times these disorders are comorbid). In all likelihood, each and every person at some point in their life will reach the threshold of a clinical diagnosis and many people do not seek or get the help they need. I can attest to my own bouts of depression where I did not reach out to anyone. I should have and I will if another bout should arrive. This means that mental health is not a teenage issue, it is not an advanced degree issue, it is not a criminal issue, it is not a religious issue, and it is not a political issue. Mental health is a human issue.

This leads me to my second point: there are no fingers to point at any one person or event with mental health. As someone who has a close pulse on the state-of-the-art research in the mental health field, we know that mental disorders are a complex and dynamic system. They are *complex* meaning that there are numerous factors, causes, and pathways; they are *dynamic* meaning that how these elements interact with people, situations, and environments changes over time. There are certain factors that reinforce and perpetuate the disorder's cycle and there are other factors that tip the scales toward disorder. This becomes obvious when reading through \*name\*'s mental health report.

Mental disorder is not categorical and once a person is diagnosed it does mean that they forever diagnosed. There are no true lines where mental disorder begins or ends. There are, however, ebbs and flows between states of stable and unstable mental health. This makes mental disorder difficult to pinpoint and difficult to perceive, especially in those that we are closest to. With that, I want to close with the second conclusion I had from \*name\*'s mental health report: his feeling of helplessness, isolation, and lack of support. I have no doubt that each and every one of us would have liked to have been there for him had we'd known. **This** is the point of my email.

There is an open channel of communication where it might have been perceived as closed. This channel has always been open but I want to make it explicit. I encourage you to share this email with family that I have not included. If you agree with the sentiment that I've conveyed, then I implore you to reach out to the people you love and explicitly open these channels. This is not meant to be a ""kumbaya"" message; instead, this is emphatic encouragement to open up dialogue about mental health with the people around you. There is too much we don't talk about and we're all losing because of it.

I am always available to each and every one of you, and I know you would be willing to make yourself available for me. My email(s): \*emails\*. My phone number: \*phone number\*.

Love,

I cant understand why he didn’t talk to me, we always talked about everything and he was the most optimistic, kind person I’ve ever met, so it was sudden and heartbreaking. I’m feeling guilty because yesterday he asked me to skip school with him and go to a beach down the road. I said no, and that night police found him dead at the scene. I don’t know what to do with myself. I feel guilty, upset, and I miss him so much more than I’ve ever missed anybody.

Back to smoking pot every day in less than 2 weeks, obviously didn't had a clue I was going psychotic again, what do you know 5 months later, after disgracing my image, credibility, and relations yet again, I managed to loose my right hand on the train tracks.

My brain has been all over the place because of all these things just compiling plus more and I feel like I need to do something otherwise I’m not going to make it to my next birthday but I don’t know where to start.

My baseline anxiety levels have risen over time, I notice I feel more sad/depressed/fatigued/burnt out almost constantly. I have a very tough time leaving my room and for the first time ever my grades are suffering severely because of my mental health. I know I need to get help but I don’t even know where to start and I’m scared. I tried therapy in the past and it never worked out and I’m really, really nervous to be put on medication because I don’t want to rely on something just to feel normal.

I have gone to my gp numerous times about mental health related issues, but I feel I am not able to make myself understood very well without bringing up being suicidal (I have done so when I lived in another country where healthcare is different and had terrible experiences thereafter).

I think I need to be medicated, however I have a few worries about this. 

1. I am worried about the potential health risks any meds might pose, for example interacting with my birth control pills or making me gain weight or make my often severe acne worse, which would put me on a downward spiral.
2. I am not sure how effective meds will be for me, as I have heard medication alone doesn't solve everything, and being put on a two year waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy
3. Due to my ever changing mood swings, knowing myself, I may just stop taking them after a short period of time which is a worry. 
4. I am uncomfortable with the GP I am usually sent to when I make an appointment, and I cry almost every appointment I have, so unless an appointment is with someone else I'm unable to make myself go.

This semester had been rough pretty rough for it's entire duration, but I was kinda coping. Then I went to my calculus exam, broke into a panic attack at the start of it and everything went down hill from there. Couldn't be in class without massive anxiety rush, couldn't open a book without getting a massive anxiety rush I was just done. My already abysmal self-esteem is at it's lowest right now. 

Then my roomate and best friend tried to off himself the next day after my birthday when I was sleeping. I had to deal with the aftermath of that, took it really hard and had to basically take a week long break from school 3 weeks before finals. 

Now I'm so behind everything that I just can't fucking find any energy our courage to start studying. Just thinking about how much I have on my plates make my head feel like it's gonna burst open. I've hyperventilate just having the thought of studying.

I probably ruined all my chances to enter the program I wanted after ruining my average grades. Went from having A everywhere to fucking D. I'm crushed and it basically just confirming that I did not have an impostor syndrome, I was an impostor. A fraud.

During my stay I signed consent to talk to my psychiatrist, in which either way they were all apart of the same company/hospital system anyway, and I found out between what they were talking about they diagnosed me. They said I had bipolar and borderline in addition to my earlier adhd, depression, suicidal ideation, and bulimia. As a psychology student I constantly am picking up books about different diagnoses so I can further my knowledge about all of them rather than just the surface level things they tell you everyday. So currently I’m reading a book called The Body Keeps Score, by a specialized trauma therapist who actually opened a Trauma Center in Massachusetts named, Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. One of the very many symptoms of PTSD is actually mood swings, feeling numb and depersonalization. Unfortunately when I tried to explain this to the doctors they didn’t listen at all or even consider the possibility. They also never explained why to me why it was these diagnoses instead of PTSD.   They also performed no therapy there except groups that was just reading off the worksheet that was provided (I’m highly a believer that worksheets should always be used as an aid not the whole session/class).
My other issue is I was originally on 3 psych meds, now from the hospital I am on 7 different medications at high doses and I have to take them at different times of the day. Also they suggest a higher care program then didn’t do anything to set it up or give me the referral for it at least. So it’s basically like being thrown to the wolves.

I was depressed (diagnosed, which was one hell of a process) like so far into depression (I know other people have gone through longer but at that point it had been 3 months. And it was the third time I’d been stuck in that dark place) my only light was death. I sat in my room with about 25 pills, some in my mouth, some in my hand. But then all I could think about was my mum. I saw her when my nana died, I could picture her reaction. And for that few seconds, it became very real what I was about to do. I didn’t swallow them. I spat them back out and covered them in tissue before disposing of them. I still feel disgusting about it. I think my mum realised I was suicidal, but not how close I was... even though I’m feeling more normal now (it’s been five months) I can’t even hear someone mention suicide without breaking down crying. It haunts me daily, I never have a day where it escapes my mind. But I can’t tell anyone, I just can’t bring myself to do it, not even my therapist knows (which is the worst part like I physically can’t say it) I just feel like I can’t live normally, even though I mostly feel normal right now and I have amazing friends which I’ve never had before. It’s always at the back of my mind and i hate that I can’t even have a normal conversation with people because it seems to be mentioned a lot and I can’t cope. Does anyone have any advice, if it’s even possible to advise someone on that",19Apr2019,3

I'm 26
I'm a trans woman

I'm on spironolactone and estradiol since feb 2018

I'm in Tennessee

My issues have been bothering me since age 15 but havr reached a boiling point this week.
If it's relevant my father has bipolar disorder (untreated but diagnosed)

So yeah Voluntary psychiatric hold  questions.

I'm at a low point in my life where my brain is telling me things that make zero sense and just aren't true (thinking my relationships are lies, mistrusting my partner, and i can't even work properly.) And I'm having active suicidal urges, and my suffering over my gender issues is at an all time high, I'm wanting to voluntarily commit myself for a 3 day observation. I have a visit scheduled on Monday

What can i expect?
Will they let me take my Hormones?
What differences are there between voluntary and involuntary? ( Not what they are but if they treat you differently)
Does it work?
What's the best outcome here?
I'm very nervous but i really want to be healthy.

135,"So I have a bad family history of deep depression, I haven't really been affected by this much, apart from when a relationship of mine fails, because I lose all contact with that person and then its like nothing ever happened for them, but then im stuck remembering this person and how much i still love them, it brings me great depression and sadness. I have broken up with my 19 year old girl friend just over a month ago now, I still constantly think about her, dream about her and everything in between, i wake up sad and i go to bed sad, I'm over it and i know as a 20 year old male that i should be stronger than this. any advice or help is greatly appreciated",19Apr2019,1
