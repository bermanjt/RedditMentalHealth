I feel his music gave young lads a safe space to feel their feelings and relate to how as a male the world sits on your shoulders and theres nothing ever to relate to cause people think we have it easy..

Anyway going off track a bit.  He will be greatly missed

1,"Hello all, I have a question about some odd behaviors of my brother.

He is 28, has ADHD, and maybe something else. I'm not sure.

Anyway, he tends to make noises or say things out of the blue that don't always have relevance to the conversation. He tends to ramble on when he does get talking, many other things obviously. Most of this is can be attributed to ADHD clearly, but I was wondering about the weird noises and saying things because he knows that he does these things, but if you ask him "" Why are you making cat sounds?""  the answer is always ""I don't know."" 

I read about Tourettes and watched some videos of people having those tics. There are no similarities, so I was wondering is anyone on reddit has had a similar situation or know anything about it?  My only theory is that it helps him concentrate, but I'm not sure. 

Thanks in advance!",09Dec2019,1

4,"Ok just to clarify, I’m a 13 year old guy who has severe mental problems, anxiety, depression, ADHD, social anxiety, etc. I’ll literally not talk to anyone, always be paranoid that people are watching my every move, I’ve literally been thinking about my self in a negative way to the point were my doctor recommend a therapist, and even where my clueless parents recommended a professional! (My parents are great but, they can’t         help me that good) I’ll literally sit down, go through my classes and interacting when I have to. It’s a daily occurrence when I contemplate committing sudoku, I have nothing to be depressed about as I have a nice life, but nobody is here to support me, and I’m alone with no friends, so i have nothing to look forward too.

5,"I'm having a hard time this past year, since becoming a recovering drug addict I've really been struggling with the sheer lack of progress I've made in my life especially during that time I was using.

  
Growing up my biggest fear has always been to lose time so when I finished high school I didn't go to college and jumped straight into starting from the bottom in the creative world. If I look back from that point today, I've done a lot of stuff but I haven't really gotten anywhere.  I wasn't aware of this at the time obviously but I've essentially lived out my worst nightmare and so my question is how in God's green earth can I come to terms with those six years I've lost at what was a crucial time in my life and I will never get back?",09Dec2019,1
6,"So this is a bit of a specific moan, but I was just curious to look up what 'malignant narcissism' means, clicked on to this page [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-recognize-a-narcissist-4164528](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-recognize-a-narcissist-4164528) and you get this silly stock photo of a guy shouting at a group of students/coworkers and it really irks me. Like people with these kinds of personality disorders of course have problems, but boiling them down into caricatured stereotypes through stock imagery and the like does nothing but distance people from them, branding them the villain or weirdo, where actually these people need help and therapy, not too be shut off by society. 

Also, it annoys me because I did a random personality disorder test online for funsies and what not, and it was pretty innaccurate as it said i had symptoms of Histrionic Personality disorder. I look this up online, and there's a stock image of a woman being overly dramatic, and the way the page described it was also pretty horrible, basically implying 'these kinds of people are attention-seeking egocentrics' again, caricaturing them to their disorder traits. (I can't remember which website this was sorry).

As someone with anxiety, depression and symptoms of BPD, it really annoys me that websites that are meant to inform just feed the stigma against people with personality disorders. People may be flawed, but they are still people. People are not their disorder!

Okay rant over.",09Dec2019,1

I don't know where to even begin with this discovery- he was an all-star athlete turned recluse living with our grandmother and now this.

8,"idk man. i know other people's lives aren't perfect but at least they have a decent one. i look around myself and hear my classmates saying how they're gonna spend the holidays with their loving family, giving each other expensive gifts and joking around. i open ig and see them partying in their stories as if they pooped money. i see them having best friends n shit. why can't i have this too? now i know they ain't the happiest people alive (our teacher asked us if we're happy and literally just one girl said yes) but if they feel down they'll have a shoulder to lean on at least.

my house sucks. it's moldy and full of useless things and in complete chaos, it looks like it came straight outta obsessive compulsive cleaners. i wonder how tf i still haven't caught asthma. half of my parents bedroom ceiling fell off.

my parents. well i hope they get a damn divorce soon because i can't handle them anymore. my dad's cheated (and still is) on my mother with another woman and bla bla bla other shit i don't even wanna talk about. if i ask him for money he just shrugs it off saying my mother has to give it to me. once i cut my foot and asked for a damn bandaid but he said no. my mom is just a depressed angry woman. they both vent their anger and frustration on me n my sister. i often stand up for myself so once my dad tried to twist my arm or watered down my food because im fat or thrown it on the ground or even threw a damn knife at me. i mean it wasn't the sharpest of the knives but, still a knife.

my sister didn't want to go to school for almost half a year and they tried to take her to a therapist but since we don't have money for that and the waiting list for the free ones was too long my mom shrugged it off saying you can't be depressed at 14. well she once locked herself alone at home and my mom had to break the locker to get inside. but yea u cant be depressed at this age so maybe she just wanted do yoga alone haha.

my whole family isn't close. since my granny's death everyone stopped going to my grandparent's house for christmas to celebrate it together. i'm not close with my cousins even though i wish i were, i just know their names and age nothing else.

i dont have close friends. i've been abandoned so many times. sometimes i hang out with my classmates but partying isn't for me nor i have the money for it so i often say no to them. i only have one friend outside school but i'm not good at keeping up with her. i just dont feel like living and doing what a teenager is supposed to do. when i go out i just think ""this is gonna end so what's the point?"".

i'm always so fucking paranoid about my relationships because i feel like the people i talk to both online and in person just hate me and consider me out of pity. if i don't get a message or don't hear what i wanna hear from my favorite people i get sad. i obsess too much over certain people. when i meet someone new and they're nice to me i develop a sort of obsession and want to be loved(platonically) the same as i do for them. i get jealous if i see them with other friends because i feel like they're more important than me so i could easily be forgotten.

i suck at talking. i can't handle a conversation and i start crying if i get asked something personal or i need to state an opinion.

i've never talked about my feelings to someone in person, i just start crying at school and my classmates ask me what's wrong but i just say nothing because im ashamed of my life. 

also im lesbian and the only person im fully sure that would accept me is my sister, idk about my dad, my mother supports a right wing politician and doesn't want gays to adopt children, my grandpa used to beat the shit out of gays when he was younger. maybe my aunt will be nice. she seems the type of person to say ""live and let live"" even though she's old. this also affects the friendship aspect (if i really have one) of my life because im constantly afraid of getting closer to someone only to find out they would hate me if they knew i was a lesbian. 

i would like to have a therapist but this 100% won't happen until i become an adult. 

and let's not talk about my childhood haha. my granny's caregiver went nuts and tried to break into our house with a crowbar after getting fired n then the police found out she photoshopped me and my sister with a man i've never seen in my entire shitty life. one of so many things that happened. ive been bullied in elementary school. i had no one in middle school and now im 15, 3rd year of high school and useless asf

9,"While I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, the quickest way to describe my problem is to suggest cyclothymia or bipolar and one of the hypermanic episodes. I feel so energetic, talkative, confident and optimistic right now. I have done for the past week and a half and I expect to for another week or so. But I tend to get very irritable and impatient during these periods. I have just seen my GP and am in the process of getting help, but ever since I have, time feels like it’s slowed down and though I got another appointment as soon as I could (later today) it feels as though it can’t come quick enough. 

Has anyone advice for calming this irritability and impatience?

11,I want to help people. I love to help others. I live to help others. Recently though I found that one of my friends is being abused and neglected by her parents but doesn’t want to reach out for help because she doesn’t want removed from her home. I have been manipulated by someone that is likely going to grow and become a pedofile that goes to my school. I can’t do anything to stop him. I sound crazy when I give people my ideas and evidence. I then found on a group chat that my friend’s hamster died and without thinking I left an insensitive comment and felt really bad about it. I feel like a worthless failure that only takes from society and does nothing but hurt people because I so useless. I feel like I need to stop existing because I have no place in society.

Am I actually depressed? Or am I just acting depressed? I can't differentiate fake feelings from real feelings. It's probably due to me NOT knowing how a certain emotion feels, for as cliche is it may sound, like love. Being raised as a male in a Hispanic household, I was taught not to express myself too much.

14,"I have recently noticed I get very irrationally distressed/irritated/anxious when remembering stuff from a bad time in my life.

I was 19, had a yet to be diagnosed (rare) health problem that doctors refused might exist, and was talked into trying antidepressants that were in hindsight were dangerously inappropriate for me. So understandably, I ended up in a bad place mentally and spent time in extreme untreated sickness. I became quite suicidal after a couple years of this. My mental health eventually leveled out when medications were switched around to be less detrimental and at 25 the illness was even diagnosed and my daily health improved enough to not be in bed all day.

The reason for posting this: When I think back to a primary hobby I tried to engage with in that terrible time, and I feel an irrational fight or flight. I don’t like feeling that way about anything and it’s a hobby my husband loves (we both met via it) too. So this is something I’d like to fix and avoid letting ruin something I like.

17,"I'm sorry as I have a lot of trouble putting my feelings into words but in short my whole life has been.. hard.  Ive been through a lot of emotional and bits of physical abuse as a child. Back in elementary/middle school, I had a few friends but i never shared or talked about what happened at hoe because I was afraid to put my mom in a bad light. She worked very hard to raise me, and sometimes I felt maybe she just needed that release. At some point, i received a Kindle Fire tablet and discovered the internet.. but not in a good way. I talked to a lot of people older than me and was introduced to a lot of.. adult topics that I now wish young me never even heard of at my age. Then in 3 years time, i cut myself off from those people because I felt like they abandoned me and I didn't want that kind of pain anymore. It was then i felt incomplete with myself and thought of myself as nothing but filthy, a waste of space, or just unwanted ( I still feel this way even now..). Since then Ive just spiraled myself into terrible relationship where i sought out compassion and care but go selfishness and anger each time. Entering high school I struggled with dissociation, I never went to any dances like homecoming or prom because i felt like they weren't me or something I'd do or I just didn't wanna handle the atmosphere.. I had a few friends who tried their hardest to get me out and about.. but i couldn't do it and stayed home.

Lost the most kindest man in the world who meant everything to me but i couldn't show him physically how much he meant to me.. No car, stuck living with my grandparents with absolutely no drive and completely lost on what i should do with myself.

18,"Hello,

My therapist is currently out of the country so I thought I'd post here.

I'm having a weird situation and not sure how to make sense or deal with it. Last Friday I was in another town visiting family when my sister tells me my mom is in the hospital for chest pain. First I was updated that there was nothing wrong and she was going to go home. Then the next several hours I kept getting updates that she needed a heart catherization, that they only had 27 minutes to do temporary surgery or she'd die, and finally a schedule for emergency heart bypass surgery. Suffice to say I was an anxious wreck and ended up on a plane to a state 600 miles away.

While I was there for those days, I didn't cry much but I felt really anxious and wired. I've been home now a few days and I keep randomly crying on and off and having feelings of dread. My mom is at home now and recovering nicely.

Is this a delayed response to stress and trauma? Has anyone else ever had this?

Not sure how to cope.

Thank you for any advice.",09Dec2019,1
19,"I am a 20 year old college student. I am diagnosed with add and dyslexia due to difficulties paying attention and general poor performance in school as a teen/pre teen.

I have pretty much been lying to my psychiatrist in order to keep my ADD prescription. I have purposely downplayed my marijuana use, other drug use, and issues related to my general wellbeing because I wanted to keep my prescription to do well in school. I fear that if I disclose my current problems, I will lose the current meds. I am not abusing the medication, however I am sure that my studies would be more difficult without it. 

Here is a list of things I can think of off the top of my head that I have been struggling with that I haven’t (~can’t~) tell the psychiatrist:

• Mood swings
Mood can be either sad, unmotivated, depressed for seemingly no reason, or enthusiastic, happy, and good. Sometimes angry for no reason, sometimes completely level headed clear feeling. 

•Feeling ‘out of it’ 
Space out a LOT. Like daydreaming, and they happen involuntarily multiple times per day. It mostly happens when I think a thought that is way more interesting than real life and I get sucked into my head. This is a big thing that other people notice. They say I go completely emotionless and just stare listlessly into the distance. 

•Difficulty speaking 
I forget my point a lot. I struggle with putting thoughts I have in my head into coherent language sometimes. Sometimes I go down tangents in conversation and am unable to recall my original point. If I am mentally tired I sometimes can slur simple words or make incoherent sentences.

• Anxious feelings and social awkwardness
This is a weird one. Sometimes I can be very charismatic and am able to socialize effectively and charismatically. Other times I act nervous, forgetting words, social cues, and body language. I get anxious thoughts about past social situations and conversations and I go over them in my head. I feel like I am becoming more awkward, not knowing what to say, how to hold myself, and losing general skills like proper greetings and goodbyes. 

•Social problems
Have really retracted socially in the past few months and spend more time alone than I used to. This is in part due to external factors outside my control. I feel like I have lost touch with the majority of my social groups, and multiple close relationships. Lost a romantic relationship because I simply stopped talking to them regularly, even though I wanted to. I find myself more often than before choosing to be alone rather than socialize.
 

TLDR

I really have no idea if there is something causing me these issues mentally or if I am just going through a rough patch in my life due to the current circumstances. I know that the answer to these types of posts is always “go see a doctor”, but I can’t share these things with my current psychiatrist. This is because 1) If I tell the doctor I will likely not be prescribed my current add med which helps me in school. 2) I do not want to seek out a diagnosis. I believe that people who do not need {Medical} help sometimes get sucked into the psychiatric system. If I truly have something wrong, I expect that it would eventually be diagnosed without me seeking it personally. 3) I don’t want to have to deal with whatever problem I may have. Right now, these problems are just in my imagination so to speak, but the moment I tell the psychiatrist they become a real part of my life I have to address.

Does it sound like I may have a mental health problem? What are your thoughts on my predicament?",09Dec2019,1
20,"I've made a post on r/relationshipadvice about my current situation with my partner.

Long story short. She's told me she needs time apart to fix herself before we can be together. The only thing is that we are on an overseas holiday and not only have I lost the person I've spent the last 5 years with as a couple and the last 9 as a friend but when we get back home I have no place to stay as we were staying at hers and she said she would like me to leave as she works on herself. This gives me no other place to stay as my mother and I had a big fallout after I was kicked out over a year ago and the rest of my family are in full houses. I recently quit my job to take a position in an industry that I've always wanted to work in to only be told recently that there is no work for me.

So here I am.. no home, no money, and no love. I've found myself having very dark thoughts that I didn't think I could ever have and it's pretty scary. All I can seem to do is cry and try distract myself but every time I try distract myself reality will hit me and I'll start breaking down again.

So for about 4 days I will be really happy and motivated and get 8 hours sleep and be up early and be focused at work and do some good training at the gym in the evening.

But then for about a week I will not even feel motivated/bothered to do even simple things like get dressed or shower. I do not feel depressed generally but on those bad days I am just in the mood to stare at a wall or lay on the floor for hours and it wouldn’t bother me.

She permanently goes by a nickname—Pri in this example—which is unique enough that people don’t even know/realize it isn’t her full name. 

When she broke up with me it devastated me for a very long time. One coping mechanism I developed was calling her by her full name (Priana) whenever I talk about her, basically creating a mental wall between the girl I loved and was with (Pri) vs who she is to me now (Priana). 

Even though I’ve been doing this for a long time my friends still get confused for a sec when I say her full name because they have to figure it out. Finally last night one of my closest friends told me he hates the fact that I do that because it seems unhealthy and that every time I use her full name he worries about me.

I have most of the will, just not the way. Things have been on a steady decline for me over the past 6 months. Things WERE going well. I got a new job, lost weight healthily, a new purpose - it was all supposed to be good. 

Then my personal anxieties got in the way at work, other stresses occured there and I got really low due to it. Additionally, I got super lonely and felt like I was a bother to everyone, no matter how many times people told me I wasnt. I've developed some nasty trust issues and poor self esteem. Made or two bad choices that I thought would make it better but only amplified everything ten-fold. (So now i have all that mess on me too - ill get into it in a dm if youd like)

My life has become a pattern of being managable, then awful, then bad thoughts, I get depressed for a few days, snap out of it and cycle back. And its been this way for literally months.
And before ppl go all up in arms, yes, I have tried looking for a therapist. They either rnt taking new patients or it dosnt work with my hours. And ive tried 2 diff times over the months of calling and emailing. I even tried self help podcasts and books and nothing.

I cant break free of this torment and I dont know what to do. To everyone else im ok but my close ppl know its bad. Thankfully they dont let me push them away, but it all feels like it can happen at any moment. 
That my friends will get sick of my shit and leave. That my boss will get tired of my mess ups and fire me. 
That I'm just destined to do this for a very long time more. 

I have so much guilt and anguish that honestly has no reason being there, and i cant rid myself of it. I dont know how or where to go. All i want to do is be a good person and help others and be a source of good for others ):

It took alot to write on here cuz i know the perception people have, but im aiming for the better side of reddit to find this.

I was riding the bus to my home school (I go to a career technical school for Digital Arts) and was feeling completely normal, when I decided to start drawing a character I’ve always liked. The character I’m talking about was not created by me, but is a character in a video game, which I’m not going to name, as I’m sure someone here will figure it out and say, and I find it embarrassing enough to have this obsession. I finally finished my drawing of her once I’d gotten home and fell in love with it.

I decided to start doing other things, but couldn’t focus, as I couldn’t stop thinking about the drawing, so I’d went to bed to try and let my feeling of accomplishment pass. Well, I woke up the next morning, but now I wasn’t obsessed with the drawing, but more so about the character herself. I was lying in bed for what seemed like hours fantasizing about being in a relationship with this character. I think she’s my soulmate really. I fantasized about how cute she was, how fluffy and warm her coat of fur would feel. I wanted her to appear in front of me, so that I could hold her in my arms. She’s the type of person who I aspire to be. She’s really talented at what she does, really smart, and is popular. I feel like I would do anything, if I knew it would let me be in this world I’ve been dreaming of living with her in, my only boundaries being to end my own life. I love life as it is now and nothing is going wrong, besides this desire to be this character’s SO, but I do believe that with the possibility of this continuing to occur and my desire to achieve this fantasy grows stronger, I feel like I might actually start considering that route, which I don’t want now obviously, but you always hear about people in similar situations like mine doing so eventually. It scares me. I know realistically I can’t have her
and she doesn’t exist, but I want to be with her really bad.

I try to put it in the back of my mind all of the time, but her face always seems to be clouding my thoughts. I don’t want this to start messing with me more than it already is, but I just don’t know how to get over her. I just really want some help getting over this situation, so that I can go back to living my life normally. I’m sorry if the formatting or the way I word this is weird. I’m trying to type this as quick as I can.",09Dec2019,1
30,"What constitutes childhood trauma? When I hear ""childhood trauma"" I kind of assume the worst. I kind of assume sexual abuse or stuff like that-my childhood had nothing that severe, but it wasn't normal either. I was talking to someone saying how I spent a month in the hospital, and how frightening that was as an impatient at 9 or 10 years old (I forget the age, but definitely younger than 10). My parents never validated my emotions when I was crying. I was a particularly tough child to raise. I would be upset a lot, and I'd just be told to get over it. My parents didn't really know what to do with me, so they put me into a hospital. This was the first time I was away from my parents and I could not see them. I was sleeping in a bed that wasn't mine. I was forced to sleep when I wasn't tired. I was forced to eat food I didn't like. I was forced to sleep in the same room as a stranger. I was forced to see doctors, to take pills, all in a very strange environment where I was so lonely and hurting and just wanted to see my parents and they said they did this to help me. It was SUCH a frightening month, and though I don't remember all of it, I do hate hospitals because of it. Every time I go near the hospital I remember vague things, I remember which room I was forced to sleep in, I remember the older teenagers who were there with me (at least they seemed like older teenagers in my memory).

In grade 4 I think it was 4 anyway, my parents didn't know what to do with me, so they sent me to a school for kids with behaviour problems, the teachers here were very strict and very tough on us and it was a very unpleasant year. I would cry a lot or be angry and my parents didn't know what to do with me, and because I wouldn't stop being angry at myself or others I was sent here.

In grade 3 I had a teacher who didn't like my writing so he showed the entire class how bad my hand writing was which made me cry too. He said ""that is not an E, does this look like an E to any of you?"" as he passed my writing around. I don't know specifically what letter it was, but it was something like that. My childhood didn't have any physical abuse, but it had a ton of small incidents, lots of group homes, lots of hospital visits. I remember the first group home I went to, and I was up at like 3 AM starring out the window looking at the moon, silently sobbing to myself, not understanding why I was there, knowing that wasn't even my home city, knowing I was far from my parents, and just feeling utter horror, being kept here against my will.

One time when I was around 8 or 9 I wanted to play in a cardboard box, I was so angry my parents took it from me, I locked the front door when they were on the lawn (I don't know why, it was really stupid of me) and as a result I was sent to this group home for a week where I saw yet more doctors.

My parents have always told me I would only get angry at myself as a child, but that completely contradicts my memories. Those incidents were all my fault, right? I chose to do stupid stuff. That's not trauma, right?

My biological dad (who I don't have much of a relationship with, I grew up with my mom and stepdad), would always try to give me images of sexualized women, he was so concerned with my lack of interest in women (I was 9 or 8)... he at one point convinced me his house was haunted, just to fuck with me, and I was a gullible and trusting kid so I believed him. He would also put this toy lizard under my pillow and he told me it kept moving there on its own, so I'd throw it in the basement, and the next day it would be under my pillow. I trusted him, so it was kinda scary.

Please note: I am not looking for a medical diagnosis, I am not looking for anything of the sort-I am simply wondering if trauma pertains only to sexual abuse or anything of the sort. My childhood seems relatively tame in comparison to what I am sure many go through.",09Dec2019,1

I'm not all that acquainted with this subreddit/community and what it's meant for, so forgive me if this post seems out of place (I'd appreciate if someone could point me toward a better one to post to, if that's the case.) Also, forgive the length; I'll try to summarize as best I can (**TL;DR**): It's really just an auto-biography.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have panic disorder, severe social anxiety disorder, and mild agoraphobia. I was raised by an emotionally abusive, medication-resistant father with bipolar I; and a now-medicated mother with clinical depression. I grew up never being able to predict my father's reactions to any number of things I'd do, from expressing disagreement, down to holding a fork the wrong way at the dinner table, or washing my hands by wetting them before applying soap (all things which caused him to reprimand me.)  I grew up never being able to please my mother, who was quick to punish the things I did wrong, but who never said a word when I did something well/without prompt, and who was never able/willing to provide emotional comfort when I needed it. I became quick to censor my more dissenting thoughts, and later to avoid potential conflict altogether.

I grew up having this aversion reinforced by other children, who liked to tease my uncommon interests and approaches to situations. I was transferred to a completely new school in 3rd grade, when my first elementary school shut down, meaning that I had to rebuild friendships (that I hadn't actually made yet) from scratch. Come 5th grade, I hadn't actually done that, and withdrew further inward. I moved up to a new middle school and had to start the process over again for a second time. There was no success in this environment either, nothing more than passive acquaintances based on nothing but sitting next to certain people in certain classes. My parents, seeing this as a sign that I wasn't ""getting along with"" the kids in my school/school district, pulled me out of that school in the middle of 7th grade, placing me into another brand new school. This time, an online school, where I made no interpersonal connection and hated each and every one of the teachers for a year and a half, before being sent to high school (my 5th time readjusting) - in actuality, it was a K-12 school where most of the children had grown up with each other since kindergarten, and so didn't have much interest in welcoming newcomers.

By the time I had reached 9th grade, I couldn't bring myself to interact with other people. I was too afraid that I was a burdensome waste of their time, saying stupid things they didn't care about, or worse, saying things they didn't like. At this point, when I raised my hand to participate, even when I did so confidently, panics shut down my body. It got to the point where I couldn't even be in the same room as other people, even when I had no intention of saying anything - even when I didn't even expect to be noticed. The school had three floors; when a class happened in a room on one of the upper floors, I often removed myself just to avoid the temptation of an open window as a solution to the panic. I ended up making shameful arrangements (i.e. my parents were disappointed that I needed to do it) with my teachers to give vital presentations in private, excluding myself from group work. I never took part in class trips, spirit events, or other such things, to the further disappointment of my parents and, by then, even some teachers. I know that I came across to pretty much everyone else as a miser or misanthrope who just couldn't be bother to be seen with them. I actually cried on the inside every time I turned such things down, not only because I knew it would bring about more shame, but because I actually wanted to have fun.

Despite all the obvious problems I knew doing such a thing would pose me, my dumbass started a club in 11th grade. It didn't really last past the first semester - honestly, before that even ended, attendance was down to about three people, including myself. Each time I went to announce a meeting on the P.A., every god damned time, my voice cracked, and I'm almost certain people could hear the fumbling of the phone in my hand as I trembled, drenched in sweat and ready to die. Standing up in front of the people who did attend was so unbearable that I had to bring medicine to pre-empt the migraines and aches the panic would leave me with.

And somehow, would you believe it, I made a friend that year - a friend who became my girlfriend. She was about as quiet as I was, and I could tell she was quite nervous in social interactions. It seemed like the perfect fit, even after she told me that she had some pretty serious disorders herself, like trichotillomania (obsessive hair-pulling); even after she told me that, to deal with past bulimia, she was prescribed medication that she hated, wasn't taking, and instead was vaping and smoking marijuana. I heard all of it, but didn't really think about it. I'd never even talked to a person for longer than a few minutes before meeting her, so it really didn't matter what baggage she was carrying.

When she got caught possessing those things, and her parents sent her to receive therapy in Idaho of all places - a place she has been in for the last year and a half, worryingly - I didn't acknowledge that either. I kept talking to her, then, when she lost access to a phone, writing her, for months and months and fruitless months.

Senior year came, and I had little fight left in me. I developed a bad habit of lying to my teachers, saying that I was sick and needed to go home, when really, my panics were tearing my body up and I didn't want to deal with that, five days a week for almost nine months. They had progressed to the point where I fainted on several occassions, having debilitating aches afterwards. Couple that with the absolute expectation my family had for me to attend my graduation, and couple that with the lesser expectations that I go to senior prom and homecoming, and I checked out completely by the second semester. I flat out lied to most of my teachers and said that I was too sick to attend some finals, and spent the weeks before graduating prepping for what amounted to my execution.

It came, and it was unbearable. My family got their photos. Those still images didn't capture the absolute terror and the pseudo-seizure I was fighting against, but, hey... it was their only chance to ""celebrate"" my accomplishments, so I gave them it.

I tried contacting my girlfriend throughout the summer. Contact got slower and slower, until August, when she sent her, as of writing this, last letter to me. I can consider that relationship to be over, no matter how much I tried to fight that suspicion. I tried, painfully, to reconnect to some other people I knew from high school in lieu of her absence, but only one has even graced me with his attention - graced in the past tense, because I haven't heard from him in almost a month now.

I went to college in September... yet another thing family pressured me into doing, because ""if you don't do that, you'll have to get a job"" - did I mention that, for obvious reasons, I can't hold a job and never have? Yeah, anyways, you can likely intuit what transpired. I had to rebuild relationships again, even thought I've now only had *one* experience with someone who didn't hate me or wasn't scared by me. Oh, and the cycle: panics, escapes, coercion into returning, panics, etc. Well, that also ended, because I dropped out!

I had went into school on an otherwise normal day, taking my mother's car. I was unusually wary this time around. My nerves would not shut up. I had two classes that day, one at noon and one several hours later. Walking to my first class, my panic began. I had delt with this so many times before that I began to insult myself for not being used to it, but of course that did nothing. I left before the class even began, went out to my car, and drove around, stalling and taking my mind off of things.

Eventually, though, I felt obligated to return to my second class. I drove back, went into the building, and sat down. People began to file into the room, some sitting very close to me. All of the symptoms picked back up, as I feared. I insulted myself again - I had seen all of these people before; they knew who I was; no one would care enough to hate me anyway. Nothing worked to quell what was coming.

Afraid the onset panic, I ran out of the room, past arriving students, past my professor who was walking through the front door, and out to the car again. I called my mother, telling her that I was coming home early. She wouldn't have it. Her response was something along the lines of ""Running from your problems solves nothing, I'm paying for you to be in class, now get back in there (and if you refuse, I'll consider it that you've stolen my car.)"" When she said that, I was still in the midst of the panic, and on the verge of tears. I simply screamed that I wasn't going back. She then threatened that ""If you come home, it's gonna be ugly between me and you.""

I snapped. I told her, in colorful language (something I never do), that I wouldn't go back to class, but that I wouldn't be coming home either. I told her that her car would be in the parking lot, and that she should ask my dad if he could drive her down here to get it. At first I went to the campus police and asked if they would hold the keys until my parents came to retrieve them, but they told me that wasn't their policy. So, I went back to the car, put the keys in the glovebox, and left it, wandering off into the wooded area behind the main buildings with no particular plan.

I tried to contact the few acquaintances I had through phone, including a former teacher and a former classmate. In desperation, I asked if I could stay with either of them (indefinitely, but in theory just for that night.) Neither were able to accomodate me on such short notice, of course, but both stayed on the phone with me, attempting to contact crisis centers and shelters. All the while, my parents were contacting me, although I didn't answer them. They figured that I was bluffing, but as day turned to night, the texts and phone calls got more frequent. I went back inside one of the main buildings as it started to get really dark, since there were much fewer students around to scare me. I went to the top (4th) floor, where there was access to the roof, and thought seriously about what I wanted to do. I stayed on the phone with my teacher, who tried to keep me calm.

After a few more hours, my mother got in contact with both campus police and the police department of the town the college was in, attempting to report me missing. I looked out some windows high above, watching for their car to pull into the parking lots, as she had texted me several times ""Don't let me come in there and find you.""

She then called me ""Greg."" Now, my Uncle Greg has become a persona non grata to my extended family because, a few years back, he'd cut all ties to them after a dispute over his right to send his son off to boarding school - although, he did it by going on a ruthless tyrade over the phone to his elderly mother, leaving her in tears. By calling me ""Greg,"" she was insinuating that I was basically acting as narcissistically and callously as he did... by succumbing to a panic and then not tolerating her lack of empathy.

I had calmed down significantly by then, but once she said that, the entire panic ramped back up. I flipped several chairs and almost a table, throwing my phone at the window, and swearing up a storm - all in a hallway, mind you, with some occupied rooms being only a few paces away that went quiet as soon as I started screaming. I wanted, right then, to make a made dash to the roof and dive over the side. But, grasping on to what little sanity I had left, I told my teacher (who was still on the phone) that, if she came to find me, I would fight her. I didn't want to say that I'd kill her, but I had no idea what I'd do if I saw her at all.

A few more hours passed, and I kept on the phone with my teacher and another woman, my aforementioned friend's mother, while they looked into potential shelters. I gave them as much information as I could, but I couldn't help but keep looking at my parents' texts rolling in. After some more time, I started to see campus police cruisers driving around more frequently, and knew that things had gotten way out of hand.

In a seriously difficult moment of what I consider maturity, I answered my fathter's phone call, seeing as he was much less involved in this situation than my mother. He immediately gave the phone to her, though, and I was forced to speak to her. She asked about my whereabouts, and I told her nothing but that the car was in a particular parking lot, the doors unlocked. She was in the middle of a conversation with a police officer when I called, though, so she hot-potatoed the phone to him at his request. He was a rather friendly man, and I complied with the questions he asked - whereabouts, the reason why I was ""missing,"" etc. He and I made an agreement that I would meet up with him outside the building I was in, but I didn't want to see or hear from my parents (i.e. my mother) at all. That's what happened, and I further informed him on the situation.

At that moment, an uncle of mine, who had been alerted to the situation, called and asked my whereabouts. I told him, and after he spoke briefly to the police officer, he urged me to come back to my grandmother's house and to spend the night there (my grandma's the sweetest lady, but it wasn't easy to do, since her house was right around the corner from my own, so it would've been easy for my parents to come there if they wanted to. They promised to the police officer, my grandparents, and my uncle that they wouldn't, though.) After wrapping things up, I reluctantly went. It was past midnight, and I barely slept afterwards, but in the morning, I talked to my uncle again - ensuring that everything was okay and I was actually at the house.

I'm a naturally forgiving person, and I'm still quite close to my mother. I know her well enough to understand that she's horrible communicating softly and kindly, but she did all that she did that night to make sure I didn't kill myself or legitimately run away. So, even after that monstrous event, I called her and told her that we'd be going to lunch, where I'd reconcile and explain to her what happened.

It was there that I finally broke down, admitting to previous lies concerning my (then still undiagnosed) illness and the extent to which I'd been suffering. I explained my panics, and put them in the context of various things I'd done since junior high. I knew then that it genuinely made her understand why I acted the way I did. Up until then, she'd been under the impression that I was either simply social inept or incredibly stubborn (unwilling to try new things), but she now knows how everything was the result of violent maelstroms of physical pain and mental distress. I made a soft demand - to which she agreed - that we couldn't be ""zen"" and hollistic anymore, and that I *had* to see a psychiatrist about this issue. Along with that, I needed to find a new psychologist, as the one I had been seeing wasn't nearly a good match if something like that could happen.

While that was being organized, I switched all of my courses from physical classes to online courses - the selection of which was lackluster, but I did what I could to to remain a full-time student. But even then, I was experiencing panics, and they increased in frequency and severity. I couldn't upload required homework. I couldn't participate in group discussions. I couldn't write the text in the box, even without posting. I couldn't even bring myself to open the page by the end of my attempts.

In early October, after several strenuous meetings with my academic advisor, a disability advisor, and the financial aid office, I withdrew completely from college, receiving a full refund a few weeks later because I left for health reasons. My parents were relieved. I was utterly empty.

Fast forward a bit, and I met a new counselor that month, whom I've been seeing since. Talks with him have helped me to understand some things about myself and my predicament, albeit very slowly. He's helped me to get to the root of *why* I behave the way I do. However, the mental and physical reality of my illness is still present and painful - nothing tangible has changed. I don't *feel* better, even if I've been thinking a little bit clearer.

Panics have driven me to avoid visiting Jackson, especially after one incident this piece is already too long to detail. I made promises to contact some other people from high school as a comparatively easy way to regain a social footing, but I've not been able too. Each time I open Messages to text them, my panic starts up and spirals out of control. I avoided all but two situations. One happened the week of Thanksgiving, where I'd planned to meet someone at a tea shop, but lied and said that I was busy to escape the outing - I ended up half-playing a video game with him and barely speaking over my microphone. The other one is still to come, but I'll mention it later.

Thanksgiving itself was a pain. I went, begrudgingly, after taking Klonopin to dull my stupid nerves. I was able to get through the night, but I was evidently out of it (it makes me quiet tired).

It was after Thanksgiving that I decided to make a Reddit account, as one last barrier to my ever-worsening retreat into agoraphobia.

37,"Hi- 

Long story short my husband and I decided to open our relationship to being polyamorous. His partner didn’t work out for him for various reasons including some faults of my own. 

Today he gave me the ultimatum of be with my partner or be with him. He wants pure monogamy and it was not open for discussion.  

My partner and I have known each other for well over two years and have had an amazing friendship. Due to his vast years of experience with poly relationships I trusted him as my first partner. He is amazing. He is understanding and giving. He’s never pushed for anything or ever come in between my husband and I. 

Now that I’ve been forced to break up with my partner, whom I really did love, I feel resentment for my husband. 

This is where the mental help and advice needs to be given. 

I struggle with mental illness all together and this sent me over the edge. I was forced to break a love I did not want to and now I’m so depressed I can barely move. I have finals this week and I just hate myself. 

I hate I brought up the poly relationship idea, I hate that I trusted my husband to have the best interest of me and my partner in mind, I hate that I broke my best friend and he will probably never talk to me again, and I hate myself for involving myself in my husbands partnership. 

I feel like I am being punished. I feel sick. I feel emotionally manipulated and destroyed. 

I’m going to cross post to relationships and relationship advice but I need mental health advice too because I dont feel safe being alone. I’m a self mutilator and I don’t trust I won’t do anything stupid. My husband is home and is with me but I want nothing to do with him. 

I don’t know how to feel or what to feel. I’m heartbroken and devastated and feeling overall betrayed. I feel like this is all my fault at the same time. 

I was so happy. My marriage was the best. My partnership was blooming. And it’s all been taken away from me because of my husbands lack of true and real communication.

38,"I am 15 and for a good portion of my life I have been silently suffering with something I can’t really explain. My brother is bipolar and that has affected me for my whole life and when my parents separated when I was 9, my life took a different direction. I began to have anxiety so badly that my mom finally decided to take me to a therapist. I would find myself at school or at home and having to do/say arbitrary things over and over again. If I didn’t do these things I just would feel right, like I couldn’t focus on anything and I had to do it. I would have these thoughts that something terrible was going to happen to my family or me. My therapist’s techniques didn’t really work so after about a year I stopped going. These symptoms calmed after a few years, but recently they have sparked back unfortunately.  Over the past 2-ish years I’ve had it very badly. More recently, I’ve begun to be paranoid about random things, like that I’m going to die in a shooting, and these thoughts play into my paranoia. I’ve looked for many years and all I could think of was OCD. But I don’t think it is this because I don’t find myself doing things in ritual, just on the spot when my mind feels like it. Even if what I’m doing is correct I will find myself doing it 16 times over again or something horrible will happen. When I’m at school, when writing, I’ll have to write the same sentence 8 times or else as hook shooting will happen, for example. I’ll have time when I’m so paranoid and my stomach just has this sinking feeling it’s so strange. It’s like there’s a different version of me in my head and I don’t know what to do? Whenever I feel as though I need to get help, my mind says compensates and just says it’s not real, and that it’s all in my head, like it’s just psychosomatic.

43,"Having a problem lately where I am feeling very irritated for a lot of the day. Like having a short fuse, about ready to blow my stack, constantly clenching my jaw, a lot of pressure in my head.

First step would be to try to figure out what's causing these symptoms, I'm leaning towards caffeine and the medicine I am taking.

Second, I need to figure out a way to cool down when I am feeling very bothered. I do meditate, but that only seems to help for a short time, and even during meditation I'm still usually irritated. I have been reading a lot, and I think that is quite helpful.

But I thought I would see if anyone here has experience dealing with irritability and if you might have any advice. Thanks.",09Dec2019,1
44,"Hello, I am a New Zealander. I don't want to speak to anyone I know about this as I'd rather share this anonymously on Reddit.

I stress too much, and this is usually a result of either overthinking or believing I am inadequate in terms of knowledge and social skills (e.g. not knowing some basic knowledge and my inability to retain information easily, and my listening skills can also be an issue). Recently I have been feeling slightly miserable, and I feel like I don't have a hard shell for when things aren't positive for me. For example, at work I have been having trouble with what I am doing. This has led me to think I am inadequate at my job, which then leads into feelings of misery and sadness. I wish I wasn't like this, but it just happens and I can't seem to control it.

My stress is also derived from being at work and my fear of being unable to meet the performance requirements expected of me. I also start thinking of thoughts I really don't want to be thinking about, and it's really taxing on my mental health.

However, a positive for me is that I am attending the University of Waikato next year for my degree, and this year and last year I have earned mostly A grades and some B grades. I then wonder how I am able to simultaneously feel inadequate whilst also achieving so much when studying.

Thanks to whoever reads this, I just felt like telling someone about how I am feeling, and this is the only place I have shared this. I am not ready to share this with anyone I know.",09Dec2019,1
45,"So, I’m not sure if this is actually what I’m feeling, but I feel like it’s probably better to find out now if that’s ok. 

So like, I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and depression, but I’m always worried about opening up to people about it. It seems like every time I bring up how I’m not feeling good, people start to stop talking to me or just get distant when they talk to me, and I’m pretty sure I’ve even lost friendships from talking about my feelings. I think I might have just been going overboard with how much I was telling them, but I never really talk about my own problems, so when I start I think I have a hard time stopping?

I don’t like bothering other people with my issues, but I feel like I should be able to, but I hope that wanting that doesn’t make me seem selfish. I just kind of want people to care about me, but it sometimes feels like that’s too much to ask for. What should I do?

46,"Before anyone says anything I have not gone to see a psychiatrist but I do plan on it soon. My mind feels like it’s always going. 24/7. From the second I wake up. To the second I fall asleep (often times have a hard time falling asleep because I’m thinking so much). It feels like I just can’t turn my brain off and be in the moment. Even when I’m with my closest friends or girl friend, there’s times I wish I can just enjoy what’s going on with me, but I feel like I and thinking about literally everything except for the important stuff. A lot of times this causes me to procrastinate and not be able to do small daily tasks that some people do with no problem. An example would be my laundry. When I finally get myself to do laundry, I’m the type of person that will through my shit on the ground and leave it until I’ve worn everything and have to wash it again. I can’t spend an extra minute hanging up a jacket when coming home. Things like this are almost overwhelming to me and I wish it was easier. School has been a nightmare lately. I totally bullshitted my way through high school cause I never studied, and always did my hw within 10 minutes of it being due (not joking my lunch break usually consisted of me copying friends HW). 

The thing is I’ve always thought of myself as a very intelligent person. When I’m interested in something I can spend hours upon hours doing it without worrying or thinking about other stuff. Usually this tends to be tasks or hobbies that involve creativity. I can have really intellectual conversations with friends and family about stuff that really excites me. But when it comes to small talk I often think about what the other person is thinking rather than what they are saying. When I get into one on one conversations, sometimes I think I’m being annoying cause of the different things I talk about (random/energetic) I use to think it was anxiety, but now I think anxiety is caused because I put myself in certain situations. I always get obsessed with different things at different points of my life. I’ve had friends tell me they think I have ADD before, but again, not too sure. What possible problems could I possibly be dealing with? Id love to have a couple ideas when talking to a psychiatrist to get things started and better help a diagnosis",09Dec2019,1
47,"Just for some background information, I was hospitalized for a super intense manic episode back in march. in the hospital for 20 days, out of school for 4 and a half months. the mania was beautiful and amazing and a lot of good game out of it, it was very odd because there wasn’t really that much wrong, there wasn’t a lot of bad coming from this besides the fact that i couldn’t sleep (which is why i was hospitalized) i was hyper aware of my surrounding and was incredibly connected with everything, it was an incredibly spiritual experience and i believe it was some sort of awakening, but anyways at first they thought it was a drug induced psychosis, but that was later ruled out. never throughout the entire experience was i in psychosis, nor have I been. I did not hallucinate or have any delusional thoughts or actions either. That being said, one strange thing would happen in the months AFTER this experience, very rarely, and it just happened for the first time in probably 6 months. It’s (the glowing circle)...and it just came back. this time when it happened i looked at a particular point on my turned off light fixture in my room, and just kept on focusing on it. and after a couple minutes, a bright white light started seeping out around the edges of the structure. and then it started coming out through the cracks. beaming almost. and it would come in flashes. and then, after a while, the whole thing would begin to move as one solid entity, and it would drift away from the psychical light fixture on the ceiling. and it looked just like my light, maybe a glowing outline of it. but it was there and it moved, and i watched it move across the room, it kind of went in an downward motion and  to the right, and then faded away into nothing. and then i continued to look at the light and eventually it started happening again. and then another one of these glowing figures formed. and it moved away from my light, and as i blinked, it remained in my view, and i could see this one for almost 20 seconds, and it just drifted closer and closer to above where i was laying. and then it went out of focus. and i would blink and then i would see another one form a couple feet away from the light fixure, and then it would start moving towards above where i was laying. and they would last shorter and shorter each time, and now they were all coming from this new spawning point a couple feet away from the light (which was off the whole time) and they became more and more faint until i couldn’t see them anymore. i remember something similar to this happening months ago when i was still in the treatment center, and i briefly told a doctor, and it was kind of brushed off. and it didn’t happen again until now.

52,"Since the day I could hold a crayon I found that I had an aptitude for art. I have spent my entire life from that point pursuing art and bettering myself as a ""real"" artist; and it worked. I had a huge following on social media, sold my art world wide, and even been featured in a few magazines. None of it brought me happiness. I decided to go to school to become a speech-language pathologist to pursue a new interest, and I got my degree and love where I am in life. Along the way, I lost the spark to create new beautiful artwork. I still love art and enjoy creating things from time to time, but I have found that that part of me is long gone. I haven't been happy creating art for about 3 consecutive years now, no matter how many long breaks I take from it. I know it is classic burn out, but at this point in my life when I close my eyes and imagine my heart's desires I see a hot cup of tea and a good book to read, not making art. (LI have dysthymia, and I feel like it becomes more severe when I start doing art now. In fact, it has gotten so bad that I become depressed for months worrying about it and have panic attacks when I do create art. I decided a few months ago the best thing I could do for my mental health was to delete my social medias and focus on me, and even though it was very hard  I was right. Unfortunately I have been getting an ""itch"" to create again, but when I try making something I won't be an hour in and I'll already be overwhelmed and ready to pack up my supplies for a couple of more months. I think the best thing for my health is to learn to let go of creating artwork altogether since it always has such negative side effects, but it's literally been a part of me since my earliest waking memory. Deep down i think I attribute my artwork to my self worth, but I don't know how to break this toxic way of thinking. I'm having a hard time acknowledging that art is something I do and not who I am, and that it's no longer okay for me to allow myself this constant self abuse.

54,"Quick-ish background. I have struggled with both depression and anxiety issues for years, officially being diagnosed years ago. I think most people can agree that a lot of the time, those two issues often times go hand in hand. By this point, there isn’t really any type of treatment that I haven’t attempted in terms with dealing with them, whether it be therapy, medication, etc. Through the past couple years, I have proudly been able to find ways to deal and cope with the depression aspect. Obviously I’ve had periodic setbacks, but overall, I have generally accepted my depression disorder (which was possibly the hardest part), and have discovered my own personal ways to break out of the funks that depression inevitably causes people to fall into every so often.

All that being said, the complete opposite is the case with my anxiety issues. I generally deal with some constant anxiety, which is most times bearable for me. However, I do experience periodic, and sometimes frequent, panic attacks. Now, I know that people with anxiety disorders experience panic attacks in different ways. To put it in perspective, for me personally, my panic attacks are pretty crippling. Heart racing at an outrageous rate, hyperventilating, feeling as though my whole body is shaking while simultaneously feeling like the room is spinning around me, rushes to my head that make it feel like I’m fighting to stay conscious and not faint, the awful “sense of impending doom”, among many other physical symptoms. 

For whatever reason, different types of behavioral therapy, while effective for the less severe and constant anxiety, become completely ineffective when a panic attack comes on. Obviously, there are medications that help during those attacks, however, I don’t want that to be the long term solution with dealing with the attacks. I want to be able to recognize their onset, and be able to overcome them myself without the aid of any medications.

I find talking to others with similar experiences to be the most helpful way to deal with my mental health, so I would love to/hope to hear from some fellow Redditors with similar experiences and they’re journey in conquering them. Sometimes using ideas that have worked for others is a good way to discover the best way to help yourself personally.

TL:DR...I can’t seem to find a way to conquer my severe panic attacks, especially when the physical symptoms of them become scary as hell and feel like something terrible is happening to me physically. Just looking for tips from people in hopes to discover what works for me without having to utilize medication.

59,"Hi all,

I’m a 25yo male that is recovering from a nasty burnout related to a toxic relationship, messy breakup, and toxic work environment. I pushed through my burnout for 6 months, piling more and more chronic stress on my system. Eventually it became unbearable. I could barely function. My memory, concentration, and decision making abilities took a plummet - I couldn’t do my work anymore, struggled to connect with others, started losing my sense of self, and mostly lost the ability to perform simple tasks. I became depressed and decided I needed to get out (my pride and ignorance of my health kept me from making that decision for those 6 months), so I quit my job and left the city I was living in.

I’ve been doing all the recommended things for recovering from burnout and have made some progress but still struggle with it daily (I’ve been away from the stressors for 2 months so far). I can’t help but slipping into depression any time my burnout hits and my mind shuts down - it’s hard to enjoy life or feel like I’m improving my situation when i can’t think clearly. My strategies so far have been: therapy, exercise, meditation, journaling, talking to friends and family, switching my environment, and rewiring negative thoughts patterns. I know I still have a lot of work to do for rewiring negative thought patterns but find it so difficult (sometimes more destructive than constructive) to try to rewire them when my mind is so agitated and scattered. 

The next thing I’m trying is spending a month with family, just sitting on the couch and watching tv. I hope that being in a safe environment with nothing for my mind to do will allow it to relax and recover from the chronic stress it’s been under. And once that relaxation is hit, I’ll be able to better rewire the thought patterns that contribute to the stress and poor moods. 

Another strategy I’d like to try is to commit myself to some kind of manual labor work for an extended period to achieve the same goal as above (give the mind little to think about to allow it to relax).

I’m wondering if anyone has gone through a similar bout of burnout/depression and if you tried anything beyond what I mentioned or have any advice on how to better handle my situation. This is the most challenging thing I’ve faced in my life, and I would deeply appreciate any support :)",09Dec2019,1
60,"I didn't want this traced back to me so this is a throw away,

I just, really wanted to vent about something I recently learned about myself and I hope this is the right place to do it, if not then feel free to delete this.  

I was talking with my boyfriend about why I beat myself up so often, and he told me how he couldn't understand how I beat myself up for my mistakes the way I do, for example if I say something wrong to a friend and make them upset, instead of apologizing and having them forgive me and I move on, I end up like, telling myself how stupid I was, or even if they're fine and I apologized that I think they definitely still resent me and I just can't let things go. Or like how in general I tend to judge myself like a third party would, like I just disassociate with myself and I judge myself how I react, and in talking to my boyfriend about it he helped me find the words to describe it, I feel like there's two of me. And idk how to describe it cause they're both me, I'm the same person, it's just like, there's the me that is outside that makes mistakes and is a person, but then the mental me that sees and knows all of this, but I don't even know how to say it but it feels like they're different, even though I relate fully to both. 

I'm sorry if none of this really makes any sense, it's one in the morning and I'm tired and I already have a hard time putting my feelings and emotions into words, I hope this was at least somewhat coherent. If you got this far thank you so much and I appreciate you.",09Dec2019,1
61,"I have GAD and have always gotten mental blocks where I need to do something but my brain decides Something Terrible will happen if I do. Of course I also get anxiety about what will happen if I don't do it. I get obsessive thoughts about what could go wrong if I do or don't do it and end up not getting anything done.

Anyways, on Thursday I asked my boss if I could dispose of some things and he told me to send an email to check with the other supervisors first and cc him in it. I hate email. I obsessively check every email I send even if it's a just a quick reply to a co-worker. Group emails are worse. Sending a group email to all the supervisors is my nightmare. I'm so afraid of saying something wrong or emailing the wrong person. I still haven't sent the email and now I'm worrying about it again.

I'm afraid of getting in trouble with my boss, getting fired or reducing my chances of getting offered a permanent job (I'm currently temporary). Thankfully email isn't a huge part of my job but I get mental blocks about others things too. I was given the opportunity to volunteer to facilitate the weekly meetings and declined to because I almost had a panic attack from being put on the spot during the meeting. Someone else volunteered but I'm still worried about it looking bad. My anxiety level has just been so high lately I didn't want to add anything that would make it worse.

I'm not sure if I should bring up my anxiety with my boss. At my last job it was inevitable because I had panic attacks and huge mental blocks related to the work I was doing. I don't think I ever had to sit down with him and say what my problems were. My boss was pretty understanding but we were also closer (he was my coworker when I was hired so we maintained more of a co-worker relationship, plus it was a more casual workplace). I'm afraid if say anything it could backfire or I could get told to just get over it. I'm just not sure what to do.",09Dec2019,1
62,"As the title says, my girlfriend struggles with depression and I'm not sure how to help. She often feels heavy and overweight (which she most definitely is not) and feels like she's not good enough. When she is overcome with her depression it leads to her shutting down, not wanting to talk or to be around me at all. When she's like this it could last hours or it could last days and I'm just not really sure what I should be doing. 

I want to help her but I'm not really sure how to best do that. Times I will try talk to her and try encourage her to talk about what she's feeling but often this just leads to her 100% ignoring me which in turn frustrates me which probably makes her feel even worse. That's not what I want. When this happens I tend to walk away but it's always after I have unintentionally shown my frustration (usually through tone of voice). I try encourage her to do stuff with me e.g. go get something to eat, take a walk on the beach or a swim (things that she enjoys) etc. This rarely ends in us doing something as she would prefer to just isolate her self in our room and not do anything. 

This is my first time posting here and I'm looking to see what advice you guys have. I know I'm not doing the right thing by letting it frustrate me and showing her that I'm frustrated, however, I want to do better.

Sometimes I question how depressed I really am. I wonder if I'm simply being too sensitive or faking it or being manipulative. I have been hospitalized multiple times ever since 2017 and everywhere I go, I apparently seem the most ""normal"". I've been told this and I sometimes think it myself. 

At one hospitalization, I was asked what I have to be depressed about. I may seem successful (good grades, well-spoken, nice, etc) on the outside but I hurt on the inside. The lady said that she wasn't trying to be mean or anything but she was trying to say that I have so many good things going for myself that I shouldn't be so sad. I bet other people think the same things. I see it in their eyes and I feel them judging me. 

It's something my dad touched on just now. At every hospitalization I've had, I seem the most okay. Some of the people have pretty serious issues, but me? It's different for me. 

People care about me more than I care about me. I let them down because they try so hard but I'm just done. Why can't I just be done? People argue that I'm too young to be so tired of the world (I'm 17) but I really do feel tired. But I guess I have nothing to be tired about. I start to push friends away because I feel like no one deserves to have such a crappy person as a friend. If I'm ultimately going to kill myself, I'd rather not have anyone care about me because I don't want them to be sad.

I recently started checking out dating apps and was chatting up this girl. I recognized her the other night while out at a bar with some friends  and we started chatting and hit it off.  I ended up back at her house for the night. I also returned earlier today for more adult activities and a few beers. 
 She told me before we hooked up the other night that she was bipolar. She also has a career. I am accepting of all people. I know she didn't choose that so It didn't stop me from showing her love.  Anyways here's where things get really complicated.   Im just out of a relationship, still in another long distance. Have been exploring ployamourous reltionships. I feel I've got a lot of love I can give to more than just one. I told her and she is ok with that. So it seems were heading towards a casual sex relationship. Which is great, we both enjoy each other pysically.   But things get even more complicated. I only drink socially and usually fairly lightly.  I now learned shes a full on alcoholic. I've also learned that shes had a recent psychotic break.  It involved being hospitalized and leave from work.  

I am not really sure what to do. I like her a lot she is a nice girl  and don''t want to hurt her. This was never going to be about a long term future. She wasn't even sure I would call her again after the first night as alcohol was involved, also she is overweight and didn't think an attractive and athletic person would be into her.   

What do I do next?  I am seeing she is in a bit of a crisis. I definitely don't want to make anything worse.  I can see she is all alone here and needs some support. Id like to give her some but at the same time I'm not sure its a good idea. 
I don't know if I should stop seeing her. I think having trouble with the alcoholism part.  Its a chronic disease yeah?  she can't control a disease.  So I just accept that about her?  I'm seriously all about acceptance shapes, sizes, gender, orientation, whatever makes you happy.  Should I just see her casually and offer a littler support. I worry she wants more.  Im worried about causing stress and hurting her. She really doesn't need that in her life. 

Anyways if you got this far thanks.  sorry for rambling

**TL;dr**   hooked up with a bipolar , alcoholic girl who recently had a psycotic break.  didn't know what i was doing and still don't .  I like her but cant see us being together full time.We are more looking at a bootycall situation.  Also really wanting to tread lightly and not hurt her.

Originally, this post was gonna say that tomorrow or the next day, I was gonna go to the abandoned train bridge and consider throwing myself off. It’s something I’ve fantasized about ever since some friends and I crossed it for fun back in March, and with recent developments in my life, I figured it was time to put those fantasies in motion. I would extract the suicide note I’ve been keeping in my wallet for months, lay it on my bed, and then let the wind take me into the river below. But sitting here at 1am mad as a suicidal hatter typing out a reddit post has made me think twice. I desperately want my life to end, but why? It’s to stop all this insufferable pain I suppose, pain I’m facing alone, and for the first time in a long time, maybe ever... I’m fucking terrified. 

And yes, while I love my parents, they’re part of the problem, and therefore while yes, I do “have” them, I don’t really want advice and compassion from the people that so often bring me anguish and grief. Friends, I have none of those left, long story. And relationships, well, got out of an abusive one in August and then had a brief and equally red flag heavy fling with someone else, seems my good judge of character is not as in tune as I thought.

Knowing my posts however, often they seem to get buried or ignored and that’s why I originally felt coming here and explaining that I was gonna throw myself off a bridge was okay, because nobody would see it. Even if this one gets buried... it’s given me a new perspective at least.",09Dec2019,1

78,"Long post, sorry. I had to include this stuff though.

I (20f) have BPD, and although I had already been suspecting I have it for a while, it was only recently recognized and confirmed by my therapist and psychologist a few months ago.

Anyways, I know a decent amount of stuff regarding mania, but I definitely don't know all the signs. I'm really starting to think I experienced a manic episode recently. I don't remember having one before, so it's all new to me.

From the end of October to mid-November, I suddenly had this ""realization"" about life and felt like I had somehow unlocked all the answers to everything. I felt as if I was blind before and could see everything for what it was for the first time. I love movies, but I suddenly had the urge to watch a LOT of films (I just counted, I watched 23 films in two weeks) in the beginning of this weird episode. Every movie ""spoke"" to me, and everything that wasn't life-or-death suddenly felt so trivial, like I felt as though I finally realized what was actually important in life. I was drawing a lot, which I rarely do, and had all these ""great"" ideas, such as emailing my best friend inspirational quotes (I never email friends...no clue why I did this) every day, and doing EXTENSIVE research for a story I wanted to write. I'm talking 11 pages worth of DETAILED research abt a topic I wanted to write about, which took me three days without sleep to write.

I also had little contact with anyone outside of my mom (I live on my own) and did not leave my apartment much for weeks. I felt complete and like I was suddenly in on this little secret about life that others weren't. I can only describe this as some sort of ""enlightenment"" I thought I was experiencing, even though I'm now aware that was...not the case. 

I had to write everything on my hands because I was forgetting things so quickly and had to write on myself in pen to remember to do things.

I slept a decent amount but did spend a lot of nights not sleeping. I slept through probably 4-5 nights each week for those few weeks. I wasn't really eating, but I'm not sure if that's just because I deal with an ED and I was just falling back into my bad habits. I came to the conclusion that I don't matter, and nothing really does, but I felt happy about that. I felt *really* content with that ""realization.""

I also neglected most basic responsibilities such as cleaning or showering enough. Ironically though, my grades were really good during all this (I'm in college) and I was skipping class a lot less often. Every lecture in my Sociology class became so interesting and ""spoke"" to me in the same ways that the movies did.

I won't get into everything I did since it would be an extremely long post. These are just the main things that stick out to me. 

I'm now back to my normal state, and am painfully aware of the dumb things/thoughts I was experiencing. I'm really questioning if this was mania. I can't remember any other times like this in my life. I know people with BPD can experience mania, but it's not always a pattern that can be found like in a lot of Bipolar cases. 

I thought I knew what mania was like, but I was completely oblivious to the fact that I wasn't thinking normally. I think that since this was the first (maybe?) manic episode I ever experienced, I had no reason to assume that it was mania at all. I genuinely believed that I suddenly knew the key to life. I thought I was just thinking clearly for the first time ever, and since I've never had a manic episode before, I never thought of that even *being* a possibility while I was experiencing all this. This behavior and thought process lasted roughly 3-4 weeks.

I only began questioning this possibility after watching this small series about a YouTube creator with Bipolar Disorder. When the person was having a manic episode, they suddenly felt ""enlightened"" and had all the same thoughts I did. Like, they were such specific thoughts that I KNEW I experienced something similar. I kinda freaked out when I realized that this was describing my exact experience. I never knew that these could be signs of an episode, and wasn't aware that some people think that way when going through one.

TL;DR: From the end of October to mid-November, I had all these ""realizations"" about life and felt like I was seeing the truth about everything for the first time. I was drawing, writing, and doing completely useless research on useless things way more than I ever do. I now am back to normal and am questioning if I had an episode. This was the first time I ever felt this way and now know that I was being irrational.

I am not sure if this is a crime or this is abuse. With few people to talk to, I rely on your judgement. 
I am 22 years old Male, and when I was 19 my alcoholic father passed away. He was always a good man to me. Immediately after my mother and seven years older sister began being hostile and agresssive with me. They made me feel guilty for my dads death and that I didn’t deserve to get into a good university which was my way out, making my sister jealous. 
- They began forcing me to sleep with my mother and one night she put her hand on my stomach and I felt uncomfortable and pushed her hand away and then she placed her hand back on me. The atmosphere was strange and it was like she was going to have sex with me and I felt paralysed. Nothing happened. 
- They began forcing me to drink alcohol on many occasions against my consent. 
- They ultimately forced me to work in a bar serving drunks all summer as some punishment, against my consent. They were relentless and aggressive in making this happen. My sisters friend is a bar manager and my sister would come in to work to ensure I had not left. 
- I got into a good uni so I thought this would end, but it continued and continued and now I just want your help or guidance. 
- My mother didn’t support me getting help from my uni in the first semester refusing proof of my dads death so they could help me.
- My mother did not support me living in a flat with friends and instead isolating me by putting me in a one-bed flat that is free to live in as it was purchased with my dads apartment money from his death. 
- Lonely in the flat, I bought a rope for attention to wake my mother up and have heart-to-heart and feel compassion. She did the opposite and forced me to go the GP and forced her way into the meeting against my consent, and forced the NHS to provide a service called IHTT which administers drugs to people at home, despite the GP being very surprised at IHTT being offered and reassuring my mother  that I am fine and not to interfere I was 20 at the time.
This is where my story gets worse and I became a victim of institutionalism of psychiatry and my mother in collusion with the doctor forced drugs on my against my consent for a year, drugging me out of university for a year and traumatising me with myofaschial pain. She beat me, shouted at me and made feel guilty for my dads death. I bought her £500 worth of Christmas presents under the subordination I was in and to make her stop. She treats my sister like a goddess.

83,"7 months ago, I decided I was going to focus on all aspects of health for 1 year. I was on 7 psych meds every day and had just got out of the hospital after being inpatient for 5 weeks. I had been to the hospital (psych and ER) about 15 times in 1 year.

I am now down to 1 scheduled psych med, and another as needed. I will soon be on just 1 medication. It takes a very long time to lower meds and wean off, always have a doctor help. I have lost about 50 pounds. Ive been working on the weight loss for 7 whole months. I had to practice eating less and eating healthier for months and months before I lost weight. My hair and skin looks very healthy, and I am the healthiest I have been in general.

I have been in group and individual therapy for 2 months. I take vitamins (multi and D3) and minerals (high dose of magnesium), Greens (wheat grass, spirulina), L Theanine (a component of green tea), Flax Oil (Omega 3, Omega 6). I eat clean and whole foods mostly, cook every day. I often fast for 12 to 15 hours and sometimes only eat salad for a whole day. I stay active. If I dont want to walk/run, I clean for hours, organize or trim trees. I had to also quit all substances, including alcohol and nicotine. I only drink caffeine very occasionally. Even a dose of cold medicine or an asthma inhaler can set me off. So I have to be very careful. Meditation helps. Staying busy but resting when needed. Getting a list of coping skills, instead of relying on meds. I also got rid of social media, cut off everyone who dragged me down. I had to completely start my life over and cut out everything that was not benifical.

I am still going to lose 50 more pounds (half way there). I will be at a healthy weight in about 30 though. I am working on getting into a new school, so I can get off of disability. My goal is to support myself in the next 3 years. I have to set goals. 

I hope this gives someone hope. Mental illness is not the end of the world, its possible to turn things around. It just takes work, and you cannot give up. You must believe in yourself. I have been diagnosed with some serious stuff, and I am on my way to living a normal life. My old Dr said that I can never be on such a low dose of meds, that I would need certain meds for life, that I would be completely psychotic and manic, but I am better then ever. Nobody is perfect though. There will always be those occasional struggles. I believe things can get 90% better for most people. (:",09Dec2019,1

idk if many will read this, i just wanted to vent my thoughts that are stuck in my head


some background about me: i'm 20 years old and a university student and i feel like im suffering from anxiety. whenever im in the moment, like taking an exam or having a conversation or working on a group project, i cant focus. my brain freezes and i mess up. i cant hold a conversation and its hard for me to articulate my thoughts. i havent visited a therapist or anything and idk how. i live w my parents and its so hard talking to them about it. my mind is going crazy and i think im depressed too, i cant find the motivation to do anything. i get suicidal thoughts but i immediately do something else to distract myself and im afraid of killing myself anyway so im just living because i cant die.

now referring to the title: everyone uses the same exact phrase that there's people who love you and are there to help you. so what? people love me and im just living for them? what about myself? shouldn't i love myself first? like i get it that there could be people who love me but i really dont understand what love is in the first place. i've never really experienced it. i know my parents love me but i dont feel it at all and my parents dont really get along with each other either. 

i dont want to live just because people love me. i want to live and complete my goals but im so worried about the future its too much to handle. i cant see myself living life to the fullest.  i cant even imagine myself with a job bc its so hard for me to live in the moment and make decisions. maybe its just a problem i have idk. people find help in people that they love, they get to express themselves but i feel like i have no one. im stuck with all these thoughts in my head.

In the past 6 months, I have been struggling with severe anxiety, depression, and both manic and psychosis episodes.

My brain just isn't wired to be happy, because I feel like I've never been happy for more than a couple days at a time. Is there hope for me? Will I ever be happy or am I just going to live the rest of my life continuing to try things to no avail, as I've done thus far? Posting this is very out of character for me, but I don't know where else to go and if there's anything I can do. I doubt anyone is actually going to see this, let alone care about it. At this point, I'm just so lost and hopeless and I don't know what I'm going to do because I feel like there's nothing I can do besides give up and give in to my mental illnesses, because it is uncurable. It's like my thinking has cancer that is so deeply infested in my brain that it has replaced any and all semblance of my former self identity. I'm so fucked up",09Dec2019,1
103,"Sometimes I feel like my brain has made too many connections it’s not supposed to and I can’t do or enjoy the simple pleasures of love and life. 

I am someone who has been pure and sincere with my thoughts, intentions and actions since young.


I started developing paranoia as I grew up and just be myself in front of adults my age, in their 20s. I realised everyone looks at me like I’m a failure in life for being someone pure and sincere. It sucks that I can tell when they’re being sympathetic or just waiting for their turn to talk about themselves.

Lately it feels like the whole world as I know it is against me and doesn’t understand me.

I feel like there’s nowhere to run in my country and the only way I’ll find peace of mind and soul is if I either leave this country or die.

My wife is giving me quite a hard time, and although she is mostly right and mostly supportive she knows how to press the right buttons to fuck me up mentally.

I don't talk about this with my family never had such type of talks with them. I guess I'm just trying to be able to talk to someone, I know I should get a psychologist but it's unaffordable.

107,"So my (22f) husband (23m) is going to school for aviation mechanics, and hes been doing that for nearly two years now. Hes finished 15 of 16 classes, taken one at a time five weeks each, so hes SO close to the end. Unfortunately, neither of us have family help (which is partially why we got married so young for the financial benefits) for school or living expenses, so we both work as well.
We have downsized our house twice, downsized our Bill's, and we have the best paying jobs we can get right now (him at 15 and me at 9.50 an hour), we dont have health insurance, we dont eat out, our cars are owned, and we dont buy clothes. Even still we are finding it hard to pay our Bill's like car insurance and electricity, and we both have loan debt. 
Because of this, he works from 8am-4:30pm and goes to school from 5pm-11:30pm, so hes out of the house from 7:30am-12am. Hes done this for nearly two years with a couple months break last year when we had a bigger savings and I wanted him to rest. I wish I could tell him to quit his job, but we need the money.
Hes depressed, and I'm really not surprised. Sometimes he breaks down and cries because hes so tired and he wants to quit school but he will be making double when he graduates next month. I want to take care of him, and I need him to have hope enough to pass his license exams, but I feel like hes been trying so long that he doesnt realise how close the end is.

Basically, how do I take care of him so that he can study enough to pass his exams? Once school is not taking his time, hes able to sleep, and hes making more money the depression will be easier to handle. He just needs to survive another 6 weeks.",09Dec2019,1

I'm posting this for a school project to practice writing in different genres by explaining a topic which we have already researched on some form of social media. The topic I'm focusing on is mental illness (specifically as it effects soldiers) and some of the history surrounding it. If there are any questions that come to mind I'd be happy to answer as many as I can If you think that there is another subreddit that you feel would be more appropriate for this post feel free to let me know.

Mental illness has been an issue for millennia, but only in recent years have we begun to increase our understanding of it. Where the story starts for us is in the mid-19th century with a very early mental health advocate, Dorothea Dix. At this time, the mentally ill didn't have people who could care for them effectively. As a result they were kept in places like prisons and almshouses, which Dix would argue was not only detrimental to the mentally ill, but also those living in these places. She called upon the government to reform and build new asylums, so that these people could get the help they needed, or, at the very least not suffer through being chained and barely kept alive.

These asylums did initially improve conditions dramatically, however there were still issues in places. Because understanding of how to treat most mental illnesses was extremely limited, and as World War I started this problem was exacerbated by the decreasing number of staff. Eventually, many of these asylums became obsolete and were replaced by new systems. New treatments such as electroshock therapy, insulin coma therapy, and lobotomies would arise near this time, however each of these procedures could have major permanent side effects.

Now that I've established how the mentally illness was treated, let's focus on how it effects soldiers. While exact statistics are difficult to quantify, there were an extremely large number of traumatic brain injuries (or TBIs) during the civil war, due to lack of head protection. TBIs can cause amnesia, headaches, and personality changes, and are still very prevalent today. Also extremely common is Post Traumatic Stess Disorder (PTSD), also known as shell shock or battle fatigue in WWI and WWII respectively. PTSD is caused by situations of extreme stress and traumatic events, and can result flashbacks, violent outbursts, loss of interest, and has lead many to commit suicide. The effects of PTSD can last for several years after the initial trigger.

The military attempted screening processes during both World Wars in an attempt to exclude those who would be unfit for combat or were likely to react especially poorly for mental health reasons. This included a very small number in WWI, but increased dramatically in WWII. However, the incidence rate had doubled, and because of this, the screening process was seen as mostly ineffective. This is because even today we are still trying to understand the biological and environmental causes that contribute to mental illness.

Although the stigma around mental illness has decreased and our understanding of it has increased greatly since the time Dorothea Dix, there's still more that can be done. Many mental illnesses can cause people to isolate themselves, but by increasing awareness and availability of treatments, while further decreasing the stigma, we can reduce this problem. The military has noticed this and today has programs established to do exactly that. However, there are also several free resources available to educate yourself or get help if you find yourself in need.

If you read all the way through, thank you, and if you have any feedback, questions, or could just let me know that you read through it, it would be greatly appreciated. Sources are below if you would like to verify or do some research of your own.

tl;dr Mental illness is a major issue, especially among soldiers, but things have improved a lot over the last 200 years

When i was really drunk on saturday i did cocaine and ive not been able to get out of bed for the second day in a row. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, annoyed, angry and so many other emotions and I have no idea how to get rid of them. Not even from the drugs as ive done them on occasion beforehand but even embarrassed etc about how I acted even though I know i didnt do anything outrageous, I was just in a state i dont like being in.

I thought I had the correct time and date for my appointment. I was severely wrong and disappointed.

113,"I'm in my mid-30s and I've lived with anxiety and very low self esteem for as long as I can remember. Thanks to a tricky childhood and some bullying and random attacks, I've internalised a very strong habit of self policing and self criticism that affects my daily life in a whole bunch of ways.

I constantly feel like I'm a failure, that I'm pathetic and that I deserve judgement of others. I'm always afraid of being judged, I'm always too nervous to speak up in meetings or go to social gatherings or assert myself in any way. I have no clear idea of who I am or what I want in life because I spend my life deferring to other people's needs and desires, either ot get them to like me or because I fear their anger and judgement. Physically, I'm constantly exhausted, often nauseous, my muscles tend to be tense and I grind my teeth.

This has been my way of living and thinking for what feels like my whole life. I've tried a few types of therapy. I've spent several years seeing integrative/psychodynamic therapists and CBT therapists. Nothing seems to have made any shift in the way I experience my life, and I've been unable to make any new habits stick (such as incorporating CBT techniques). I tend to be unable to make any new habits stick in general, or to change any old ones.

Nothing ever seems to change and I feel utterly hopeless. After decades of living like this and hoping I'll one day transform into my true self, free of the layers of fear and self-loathing that keeps me buried, I've gotten nowhere. In a few years I'll be 40 and I still feel like a terrified little child.

The one thing I haven't tried yet is medication, and I'm thinking about giving it a shot. But I wanted to also see if this resonates with anyone or if anyone has personal insight that might help guide me or give me some hope. Thanks very much for reading.",09Dec2019,1

Idk how to explain it, they feel so real but I logically know they’re fake it’s like 2 sides of me are fighting against each other. When I’m at home I actually have no idea how I pass the time, I play video games (sometimes) but most of the time I’ll just.. be there?

117,"Eight years ago a group of six doctors and police cams to my home address, they were all amongst themselves and the police said if you don’t take him we will... so they took me by ambulance to a mental health unit where they over prescribed me an anti psychotic that nearly killed me, 12 days later I was released after being the first person in that hospital to win an appeal, white, confused and lobotomised.

I should have never been there, and if they kept me any longer I’d of been dead

The problem now is I’ve went eight years without treatment for these injuries visiting doctors where they’d blame it on me faking it

These drugs cause disastrous effects on your brain and life and should not be taken long term or high dosages

It’s another Gosport scandal they’re prescribing people drugs and are aware of the side effects yet they don’t tell you that it could cause this or that

These drugs cause artificial Parkinson’s disease diabetes liver disease you name it most of your ailments are probably due to long term drug use

They’re a prescription for cardiac death

I’ve been going for years complaining of life threatening symptoms that they’ve all diagnosed themselves 

Yet they told me it wasn’t the drugs they gave me it’s the bread in your sandwich, and to only eat the ham they told me it was just anxiety and it’s not permanent it will subside

Then when I prove to them that they’ve actually damaged me and that it’s permanent and that I’m going to die a painful premature death 

They kick me out of everywhere this year and blacklist me not giving me access to a GP in over three months and when I attended a&amp;e with acute stomach pains the doctor breached confidentiality and then they get me locked up! 

I was released eight hours later without bail or charge!

I’m still suffering in severe pain and the doctors have only now admitted that the muscle spasms I’m having all over my body are because of this drug 

Yet I’m still receiving no treatment or care I’m not allowed in their buildings even though they’re saying I have all these life threatening illnesses

It’s Christmas and I’m having to move my family away from their friends and school - not for the first time - just to get appropriate healthcare !

The NHS is a con and some parts are very shady, look at all the scandals and cover ups, yes they do save life’s, yet they don’t care about the patients aftercare or if they make mistakes - especially serious ones

They’re doing this on a massive scale up and down the country thousands of patients suffering in pain being brain damaged and they’re not even aware of it and a lot of vulnerable people in our society are being made more vulnerable by the very people designed to protect them from harm!

If you have anxiety or depression don’t go to a doctor, get some fresh air instead, it’s much better than the drugs they peddle - codeine - SSRis - tranquillisers even diazepam causes brain damage they all do

118,"Hi guys, looking for a bit of support/advice. I’ve had bad mental health since I was 13 (10 years) which has included regular overdoses and self harm. My mood swings are erratic and I’m struggling with everything. I was referred to the NHS crisis team about a month and a half ago after I was adamant I was going to kill myself. They advised they would take me into their care if I promised I would remove anything that I could use to overdose on. I got discharged purely because I was going on a 3 day holiday and because I was out the country I was essentially not their problem. I just feel helpless right now. 
I’ve spoken to a ridiculous number of GP’s about getting referrals for psychology and psychiatrists but they don’t think I “need one”. 
I’m at this point where I’ve given my GP’s enough cause for concern but they don’t seem to care, I just can’t cope anymore and feel like the only solution is to end my life as nothing has improved at all over the last 10 years. 
I was taken to A&amp;E last night and telling NHS 24 that I couldn’t do this anymore, they tried to talk me down but felt like they couldn’t so sent an ambulance. I spent the night in a&amp;e and spoke to the mental health team who said “you’re not a cause for concern. If things don’t improve see your GP” which made me so angry. If after 10 years someone has only gotten worse should you not get help? 
I just feel like it wouldn’t matter and I’m just a waste of resources. My only worry about suicide is that I’m worried it doesn’t work and I end up in a vegetive state. 

So I guess my ask here is : what can I do if there’s any way to improve? Or is there a surefire way to kill yourself?",09Dec2019,1

Talking to anybody just makes me feel worse about anything that I even say to them or just makes me feel like a bother.

I'm not even sure at this point what to do or who to speak to about it.

It's just something that I've dealt with throughout my life, and is probably why my friendships never last long, god knows how my mind has become this fucked up. Anyway, i started forming friendships with some new people at the end of last year to the point where i had about 3 close friends and around 5 'standard"" friends i guess. These friendships grew throughout this year to the point where i was actually leaving the house socially, something i had never done in the past, at least not consistently. Life was good, i felt genuinely liked for once, but the thoughts started to creep in, 'these people just put up with me' , ""i'm a burden"" etc. Anxiety got bad, that indescribable feeling within was horrible, but when i was with my friends, it sort of went away, i felt good when i was around them. But over the last month it feels like they just don't like me anymore. School is off at the moment and i haven't left the house my ""friends"" no longer make an effort to speak to me, the complete opposite of what was happening in the last set of school holidays. I see them on the wonderful invention which is snap map, all hanging out, without me. You can imagine how this makes me feel, like utter garbage. That feeling in your gut that you get when your rejected is constant, it sucks. So my only source of happiness is gone and i'm just sad all the time. I have no idea what I've done wrong, am i annoying to be around? Maybe i'm a bad person? Am i just unlikable as a person and the more time they've spent with me, they've realised? My days are just shit now, wake up at 10am have breakfast and just fuck around on ps4 and my phone all day, looking at everyone on snap map hanging out without me, going on my phone til 3 in the morning because i cant sleep and just repeating the cycle. This more a vent than anything, maybe some advice. What do i do to get happy, what about my ""friends""? I loved 2 of my mates, like brothers, that reciprocated for a while but now it doesn't and it fucking sucks. It's just constant sadness now i dont know how to get better, where do i find another source of happiness, it feels like i can't find it. I don't want to sound like some shitty, cliche depressed teenager, i am genuinely sad, and its been like that for a month. Compounded tonight with someone sharing a video of them having fun.

127,"Having lost both my brother to suicide and  my job only a few months apart. I spent the year in shock, almost denial like, convinced that because I had gone through so much in my life, that I could handle it.
I had met someone that was a casual affair in the beginning, but slowly turned into more.  We had a good connection. The thing is, I also slowly was falling into despair, but I wasn’t being open or honest about it. I invalidated her feelings and pushed her away, and resented her for it. I also pushed other people I cared about away. 
I ended up moving for a new job, though, now many miles away, but only 20 minutes from where my brother killed himself. After one year, I now, am feeling the full weight of my brother’s death. I am crumbling. Lost all sense of self, and in moments of desperation and  guilt, I kept reaching out to this girl I was seeing, and still kept saying the wrong things and wasn't honest about my true feelings and insight into what was going on with me. That further plunged me into a spiral of no self control and self esteem. Constantly checking her social media and reinforcing this emptiness inside me.
Now, I have to start everything over again. Reading self help books, getting support from friends, helps a bit. The struggle is feels impossible. So much so that my own death feels  like an option sometimes. 
Letting go of everything feels like I'm  letting go of the remaining little bit of me I have left.

128,"I’ve been diagnosed with just depression and anxiety for the past 6-7 years over and over again. It just doesn’t feel right. I don’t want to self diagnose or even know how to so I have no idea what’s going on. 

I see a psychiatrist, but it’s extremely hard to actually get out what I want to get out. I only started going because my mom was worried after I had a conversation with her when she (allegedly) hadn’t even said anything. I decided to try to take it seriously, but I ended up only feeling disregarded there. Some things I haven’t opened up about, but it seems like every time I finally get something out that I’ve been holding back it’s like I’ve said nothing. I admitted to thoughts of harming myself for the first time ever and all they did was ask me what I should do if I think of harming myself. Obviously I just went with the “tell someone” route. That was the end of it. She also said seeing shadows is normal and I don’t even know what to think now. 

I definitely do feel like I experience manic or something like that. I stay up for 1-2 days sometimes. Get extremely restless. Get extremely cocky. Talk way too fast and way too much for anyone to understand. Start several things at one time and keep adding because I get distracted. One night stands. Spending all of my money without thinking. Shoplifting. Get so hyper sometimes that I have to run around yelling for around an hour straight. When my psychiatrist asked if I experienced any mania I said maybe, but not certain. I didn’t know how to explain it, but it was written off anyway because I don’t stay up for *days* at a time. 

Some other things I’m not sure where they’re categorized include not feeling real, dead maybe, not sure how to explain. Feeling like I’m playing a first person game and I’m controlling myself from the outside. Excited/happy to extreme irritability that comes in a split second. Mind being like numb I guess? Like I don’t control myself. I speak and move without feeling like it’s me doing it. Sometimes I blackout basically, where I don’t even know what I’m doing. I come back in a different area and sometimes in the middle of a sentence. It’s like an ER scene in a movie where everything is disoriented. Distraction, I’ve closed this and drafted it at least 20 times by now and I don’t even have anything to do. Seeing shadows. Sometimes vivid. Hearing voices or chanting. Locking myself in the bathroom because it feels like someone’s watching me... but that could be real. There are so many little things too. 

Honestly I don’t know if these things actually mean anything, let alone if they’re more severe. I just wish I could get it all out and not feel stupid. I want a proper diagnosis. Depression just doesn’t feel like the end of it. I want to be healthy minded normal. I’m sick of answering questions that don’t matter and the things that do get brushed over.

So, im usually okay. Maybe a little anxious at times, which goes away, nothing overwhelming. I'm also depressed, but that is more or less bearable. But every year or 2, especially around this time of the year, I seem to fall into a pit of overwhelming anxiety and panic. I get very anxious when I feel trapped with a feeling, sensation, a situation, or a place. So when I get anxious, I feel like nothing helps calm me down, and that causes panic. I also struggle with having free time on my days off. 2 years ago, I fell into one of those pits, where I wound up in the hospital several times. They gave me a prescription for Cipralex, which helped after 2 weeks or so. I was able to live my life again. 

About 3 weeks ago, I got sick with gastro. I was puking and stuff, and felt awful. And because I was staying home, my anxiety went up, and up, and up, until I fell into another one of those holes. I had no appetite because of the gastro, so I was barely eating. Because I wasn't eating, I felt worse, but even thinking of food almost made me puke. Once the gastro went away, I was still extremely anxious, unable to calm down or cope. Even the usual things I used to distract myself weren't working. My brain turned literally EVERYTHING I tried into a trigger. I had nowhere to turn for comfort. And because I had anxiety and panic attacks in my bedroom, I associated my bedroom with anxiety, and couldn't sleep there. I moved to another room, which made me feel better, but had an anxiety attack the next morning, and now that room doesn't feel safe either. I was too nervous to take the Ativan I have, because I didn't want to become addicted or build up a tolerance. I went to my psychologist, where I just broke down. I wasn't able to do it anymore. I was crying, which isn't something that comes easily for me. I told him how anxious I was, and that I needed help, both psychologically and also physically, since I wasn't eating and losing weight. I told him that I maybe wanted to go to a local psychiatric hospital. He told me to do it. So I went, very nervously, accompanied by my mom. There was a woman having a breakdown, and that triggered me even further. I finally got seen by a psychiatrist and a student. After talking it through, he gave me a prescription for Wellbutrin 150mg. I've heard good things, so I left a tiny bit hopeful. I started them the next morning. My problem is that every morning, I wake up at 6am to take my synthroid for my hypothyroidism, and then my mind remembers my anxiety, and it just spirals into an anxiety attack. Deep breaths help somewhat, but I feel like they just skim the surface. I just want to go back to sleep, but I can't. And then if I have the day off, I have nothing to look forward to other than sitting in bed and having overwhelming anxiety. Usually at night it gets better, but now im almost nervous going to sleep, for fear of what awaits the next morning. I keep telling myself that maybe tomorrow will be the day I dont wake up anxious, but every morning is the same. I know it's my thought pattern, but I just can't snap out of those thoughts when im trying to go back to sleep. I can't watch tv or take a shower, because for some reason, doing those things in the early morning feel...*wrong*. Like as if im not supposed to be doing stuff like that then. I take my shower in the night, so showers during the day make me anxious. So im just stuck in bed, with my thoughts spinning, and my anxiety getting worse. A day later, I tried eating some soup, but almost puked it up. I started feeling anxious as hell, felt desperately ill, so my mom and I went to an emergency room, because I couldn't eat, and I was getting very weak. We waited for hooooours, only to be seen by a doctor who came in, looked at my file, and wondered why I was in the emergency room. She basically said she couldn't do anything, and to just give the Wellbutrin time to work. But the thought of having to deal with this for another 4-6 weeks is unbearable. It's not anxiety which I can just live with uncomfortably in the background, it's debilitating anxiety and panic. They checked my blood, and everything came back normal. The next day, the same thing happened in the morning, and I told my mom I couldn't cope, and that I might need to admit myself to the psychiatric hospital. I felt so scared. I felt like everyone there would trigger me. But I was so unwell that at that point I gave up. We went back to the emergency department of the psych ward. I went into triage, and was met by some woman who was barely empathetic. I told her that I just wanted to know what was wrong with me, I just wanted to talk to someone, and that I needed help. She basically said that the only thing they'd even do is switch medications, but since it was only 3 days on the meds, it was pointless. She basically said that unless I was suicidal, there was nothing she could do for me. I felt such utter despair. No one was helping me. She gave me the phone number to a crisis center and told me to call them. I called them, explained, and they basically said that they basically just offered therapy, and it would take some time for an appointment. But I needed help NOW. That crisis center gave me the number of a crisis line. So I called them, and no one picked up. I was defeated. I had nowhere to turn. Not the psych ward, not the actual hospital, not the crisis center, and not the crisis line. I wanted to just go home, but the triage nurse finally got someone to just sit with me and talk. I talked it through, and she calmed me down a little. She told me that I shouldn't feel nervous to take the Ativan, and to just give the meds time to start working. I left feeling a little better. Now, I knew that if things got bad, I had the Ativan. So that night, I went home, tried eating dinner, but had an anxiety attack. I took an Ativan, and it actually barely did anything. That sent me spiraling into panic, because now I didn't even have ativan to help. I felt trapped with no way out. 

Now, my appetite is slowly coming back, but im still struggling with anxiety attacks in the morning, and feelings of being trapped which make me panic. It's been about 6 days of Wellbutrin. I've been posting on different mental health subreddits, multiple times a day. And so many people are saying that Wellbutrin is not good for anxiety. Which makes me feel even more panicked and trapped. The emergency psych prescribed it, knowing what I was dealing with, so why would it cause anxiety. Why would he give me something which would make it worse?

I feel a little better, but I still feel like my sanity is hanging by a thread. Like it take nothing to send me spiraling. I feel so scared, so lost, and so hopeless. I feel like I need very regular therapy (I see my therapist every 2 weeks), but there are months long waiting lists. I don't really know what to do anymore. Will my anxiety get better? I know it needs time, but I can't cope for another few weeks of this. I need help.",09Dec2019,1

131,"Hey everyone, 

My entire life I’ve generally been surrounded by people with bipolar disorder (I don’t like using the word disorder but I feel it’s needed for some reason). 
It runs in my family - my brother and father have it. They also have ADHD. 
I was in a pretty manipulative relationship for about two years with a guy with sever bipolar disorder amongst other mental health issues. 

I finally went to a therapist Friday as some recent events I prefer to keep off of reddit have been rooting up and stemming a lot of previous issues I have been drowning out. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression. I’m not surprised, but I’m having a hard time with it. 

My anxiety is brutal lately to where my mind is flooded with thoughts that I cannot stop. 

I guess I’m just coming here in hopes of knowing I’m not alone and I’m not crazy. Since the diagnosis, I’ve become more and more reluctant to talk to people about my concerns and really don’t like myself even more. 

Most days are good, but the bad days are getting worse and more tough to handle alone.
Today is one of them. I don’t know how to communicate my feelings well with others so lately I just avoid people or the subject.

I’m diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (doesn’t matter much to this but oh well)
I’ve been dealing with depression for some time now (about a 1-2 years) 

Ok now that that’s out of the way, I’m currently getting out of a rough place I’ve been in for quite some time. I’ve dropped out of school twice, been in an extremely toxic relationship, been so suicidal that I would just stop walking in the middle of the road, I’ve cut my whole arm up multiple times, I’ve felt terrible and lonely for such a long time.

But in the beginning of this year, i got out of the toxic relationship, I got back to school and finished my exams, in spring I met a girl I fell in love with, and got together with her when summer came around. I dropped out of school for the second time since I couldn’t make any friends and felt awfully lonely again.

Now I’m better than I’ve been for a very long time, starting school again soon (maybe), still with that girl, and my parents are supporting me (for the most part).

The thing is though, I don’t feel any better than I did before. I feel the same. Everything in my life is currently going great. But I still feel lonely, sad, worthless, like I don’t matter at all. And trust me I have no reason to feel that way, my girlfriend and family are really making an effort to show how much I mean to them, but it just doesn’t help. I’m still suicidal, not to the same extent as before but I constantly think of ways to hurt myself and sometimes it’s really difficult to hold back.

Anything can set it off really; doors slamming, children, animals, people moving, people talking, people being behind me, feeling trapped, sometimes just nothing.

I don't know where my threshold is or if I even have a proper one. It changes everyday. I can get through a chaotic day and be fine (though it's very rare) and then a day later, break down over something as small as losing my pen.

I feel like talking to people is so draining. If I'm not having a full blown anxiety attack from it, I can deal with half an hour to an hour MAX and then I start to dissociate.

When I start dissociating, it's pretty much game over as far as productivity and just being able to ""human"" is concerned.

I can't absorb or process information. I lose my ability to use most machines/electronics because I just can't process what is said on the screen. I can't talk to people because I can't process what they're saying. I can't think. I don't know how else to describe it besides that, but my mind just goes completely blank of thought.

141,"Hello everyone, I'm a first time poster here, so let me give you a little background.

I (32 y/o married male) have suffered some form of depression since about ten years ago, when I dealt with a very negative life change by suppressing my negative emotions.  Unfortunately, this also managed to quash my ability to truly 'feel' positive emotions except in a fleeting way.

For instance: I can be involved in a discussion that results in laughing or is trending towards what would leave a smile on some folks faces.  The MOMENT that discussion is over, the positive emotion is gone.  I'm back to a state of 'grey' or neutrality.  I've been accused of not having empathy due to this situation.

When I'm having a worse day, I lose much of my work ethic because I cannot focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time.  This affects my normal mental state by preventing me recovering mentally from the situations I deal with.  Thankfully, this only happens a couple of times a year.

Now for the life change.  My wife and I are moving in January into an area that gets nearly 4 times the sunshine days throughout the year.  Obviously this is a huge plus.

I want to do the right thing by my wife, and I know that my current emotional range weighs on her.  It can't be easy being married to a guy who's non-reactive to... well practically everything other than in a very bland way.  

So I want to make changes that do not include medication.  I've dealt with it for ten years already, and I've operated on a 'it's not bad enough to worry about' point of view as we've dealt with other life events first.

I'm looking for any real feedback.  I'm a detail oriented person that prefers specifics, but even generalities I can apply to my life.

146,"Hey all, going to try to keep this as concise as possible, but including all the relevant information is still likely to make it a moderately long post. I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to read this.

**Relevant background/history:**

\- Mid 20s, diagnosed ADHD at 10, wasn't prescribed anything due to also having tics

\- Lots of drug abuse between 15-19. 100-500mg MDMA 1-2x/wk, mixing with psychs, etc. 18-19 cocaine a few times a week while drinking. Stopped all non-psychedelics after that.

\- Since 18ish have been tired all the time, 1-2L coffee per day, occasional month long periods of abstinence to see if coffee was the problem, always ended up back in same place

\- Depression and anxiety around 22, also late autism spectrum diagnosis. Doctor suggested that ADHD meds might also deal with the depression and anxiety. They did, and I also became way more capable of basic life tasks -- cleaning, groceries, paying bills on time, socializing, working, etc.

\- No ADHD medication worked for more than 3-6 months at a time. Since then I've tried Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin SR, Foquest, Biphentin, Strattera, about 5 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Modafinil, as well as a bunch of nootropics(racetams, choline, alcar, lions mane, uridine, etc). I've tried all dosage ranges for the ADHD medications, typically have settled at the top for both methylphenidate products and amphetamines, although I suspect with amphetamines I should have been placed closer to the middle or low end. Antidepressants all made things worse, amphetamines worked amazingly for a while and then started to induce paranoia/dysphoria/agitation/obsessiveness, methylphenidate products all worked great, although with a very short duration -- 2.5-3h effectiveness(e.g. SR would be 2.5-3h useful, 2 hours dip, repeat). Despite the duration issues, it's drastically helped everything from depression to anxiety to ADHD. Modafinil was great, but that was a different doctor and only for a month.

\- In the last year or so, I'll use methylphenidate as prescribed for a while, then eventually have 1-5 days of binging. It's not to chase euphoria as there really is never euphoria anymore, it's just to...actually be able to function for the majority of the day. I've never experienced negative side effects due to this(e.g. nothing like amphetamines, HR barely rises, no agitation or anxiety, can still sleep at the end of the day, etc.) with the exception of terrible comedowns and having less medication to actually use properly. People close to me don't notice that I've been taking more during the binges, they just notice that I'm more depressed and less productive on all the other days. Coffee is objectively more stimulating(alertness, anxiety, talkativeness, etc) than methylphenidate for me, even compared to the binges. But the doses scare me. The worst has been a few 24-36 hour binges of 600-900mg in 40-100mg increments. Lately it's more like 200-300mg/day for 4-7 days. It doesn't feel recreational, it's always functional despite being clear abuse. There are certain areas of my life that I struggle immensely to get in order with regular doses, and the binges seem to give me the clarity to actually figure out how to deal with them and take the needed actions.

\- I'm scared of talking to my doctor about this because it is the primary thing that has helped get the majority of my life in order, and at this point the only problem are the binges. I don't want to lose access to a medication that I'd be near non-functional without. I'd switch to Modafinil, but my doctor isn't comfortable prescribing it off-label, and generics from India don't have the same benefits for me, nor does Adrafinil.

\- I'm not sure what to do to stop this pattern. I already do all of the basic health stuff -- exercise, healthy eating, o3/b complex/vit D/magnesium/zinc, melatonin on days where I binge, etc.

\-One option I've thought of is keeping medication in safety deposit box and just walking half an hour to the bank every morning. Alternatively, I'm guessing taking NAC in the morning might help, possibly along with a week off. I dislike taking time off because after a few days of being useless my depression tends to get significantly worse -- it's by staying productive that I feel good about myself and avoid ruminating. One main issue is that invariably after a binge the regular doses do absolutely nothing, so I end up tapering down(e.g. 160, 140, 120, 100, 80) and then run out. So I'm thinking the most actionable time for intervention is when starting a script -- maybe I should start lower than my prescribed dose and try to get my body used to that? Or have careful behavioral interventions set into place(e.g. safety deposit box?)

**My questions:**

1. Given the history of going through all of this(22+) with the same doctor, are my worries about having the prescription taken away unfounded?
2. Even if having the prescription taken away is a legitimate risk, should I still talk to my doctor?
3. Assuming I don't talk to my doctor, any advice on what I can do to get this under control? Whether it be behavioral interventions or adjustments to my medications/supplements.
4. How likely is it that I've done long-term/permanent damage through this? The majority of the research I've read seems to point to methylphenidate not being neurotoxic or particularly dangerous as long as the abuse isn't IV/insufflation, but I'm still concerned about this. Even after taking 1-3 month breaks the medication seems significantly less effective.
5. If there's a non-negligible chance I've done long-term damage, what can I do to attempt to recover to baseline?
6. Any other thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",09Dec2019,1

I’ve always been super sensitive about school, I mostly care about what the teachers think of me and my work. Lately I’ve been over analyzing everything.

Last time I handed in my papers my teacher was amazed over how much I wrote. This of course made me happy. The next day, after he read the papers he didn’t seem very happy. This made me spiral into bad thoughts and I again convinced myself my work was extremely awful. I reread the papers and thought they were super bad even though they seemed fine yesterday. I seriously think about everything the teachers say too me, how they look at me etc. Fx. Today I talked to one of my teachers because I needed some extra work. He didn’t seem happy at all, almost like he was annoyed by me asking. Again this can be my imagination. This made me think I’m not good enough for extra work, that all my work is bad and that I’m stupid and every teacher knows it and thinks I’m a person who thinks I’m good but in reality I ain’t.

about 2 years ago when I was in my 7th semster, I finished my last exam and that night I went back to dormitory, so I called my roommates and ask them where they are, they were out of dormitory already for having some fun , so I asked them I want to join you now, so when I joined them we went to a resturant for  dinner, while we were eating dinner my friend said i told one of our friends to bring his basketball for playing in the cour which was located near that area, that was winter and so cold, and i wore a tight jacket that i even couldnt move my hands, so we went to the court and started playing, honestly last time i played was about 8 years ago and its not common sport in our country, after 10 minuttes of playing my roomie, who always makes fun of other people , told me you can even take shot, i got angry infront of the crowd, there where too much people in the court, so i told in my mind i will defend him and get his ball but i knew that my jacket was too tight and my cellphone and big wallet were inside of that jacket i told myself i will take it off and give if to one of my friends but all of them were parcipitating in the game , so i wanted to take it of and put it in the cornet of the court with all the things in it , but i said if someone steals it what should i do? Was cold with out that jacket to, so in a blink of eye i choosed the wrong decision and went for the ball with my jacket wearing on, i went in front of him and he was dribbling so i said i will catch the ball but i couldnt reach the ball because of the tigh jacket so i moved closer to him , less that an arm streched, so when i went for anger to  get his ball, he was not even looking me and doing his job, suddenly he raised his head from leaned position and i came for the ball at the same time, suddenlly my nose and his head came into collision and the sound of my nose broken sillenced the crowd, i thought i broke my teeth at that time suddenly i raised my head up and my nose wasnt in the old place. Make the long story short the main problem started when i went for closed reduction of my nose and after that my nose is not the same, it got from medium ,or little maybe, nose to a bigger size of before and from upward and fine tip to a droopy and edgy tip that i event cant smile sometimes and i told everyday to myself wished that i didnt go to fix it, after 2 years past of that time, it buggs me everyday and night when i look in the mirror,  it effected in all my  relationships my mood my health and i ve got mentally sick , i dont know how to forgive myself for that night, i wished i never had a friend like that , and blame myself for taking him seriousley at that night, i dont really enjoy life anymore because i dont have the same look as before and it haunts me everyday.

153,"Hello, sorry but most of the people here seem to be professionals so I'm not sure if my post is valid. However throughout my life I've had social anxiety that i know of and well due to my natural personality I'm a nihilistic person. Now although I've taken it as ""well life's meaningless might as well enjoy it"" it's a policy that sometimes doesn't work because well not everything is enjoyable and in my situations i can rarely change them to something I'd like. To give you context here's my life story i wrote a year and half ago:

I'm adopted, my birth parents were too poor too keep me so they gave me to a mid-class family. My birth father died when i was 4 and my adopted family turned out to be fucked up as well, dad is an asshole who makes me hear every penny he spent, mom is mentally insane and they're both mentally abusive and call me alot of names.  My sister is also pretty crazy, she had a good life but she's currently drowning herself in injection addiction. Me and my younger sister(blood) are now in this family that has no communication skills, always arguing about bullshit. But i have developed a positive take on life that keeps me problem free at most days except bad ones lol.
Sorry about the complainey tone, I've changed a lot since writing this mainly shifting through 2 months of crying about life and finally coming to terms with it at the end of it, which brought me to atheism and nihilism. Though society finds that to be a pessimistic change, i found it to be the most positive one I've ever had. Anyway nowadays I've found out i have PVC and a few vitamin deficiencies and so I've been at home for nearly a month. Regardless of this my overprotective family controls most of my life so i hope no one says ""fix it"" by just doing something cause most of the suggestions that would involve my taking action I've already tried. Anyway I'm curious what i might have and you may ask more questions. Also I'd like to add I've been through a breakup from an online relationship I've had recently for 9 months and overall I've been feeling very empty these few days. Though this feeling of being alone and empty never goes away, only most days i am able to be distracted from it.",09Dec2019,1
154,"My boyfriend went to an out of state rehab for three months about a year ago. He didn’t have his phone but we were able to write letters to each other. Then he moved to another state to live in a sober living home for the last 9 months, and is now finally back home.

Obviously this has been a crazy year both of us. 

Alright, normally I wouldn’t mind my bf having other female friends. However, his drug use did lead to him cheating on me once.

The sober living home my boyfriend lived at was an old renovated sorority house, so there were up to 20-25 guys living there. The “girls” house was right next door, but was smaller so there were only about 5-10 girls living there. The boys house had a lot of space to hang out, a kitchen and an eating area. Girls were allowed only on the first floor of the boys house. 

My bf and I met in an outpatient therapy program so I’m highly aware that group therapy and other activities can get really deep and emotional. This is why I’m struggling with all of this, I completely understand the type of relationships that are built while in treatment. Even if their not meant to last forever they can mean a lot in the moment. 

I ended up finding out that my bf had been texting/snapchatting a couple girls that lived next door. (We have an open phone policy since the cheating) I had no idea he had been texting and snapchatting other girls until he was about to move out of the house. He says their just friends, but there’s a couple girls who just rubbed me the wrong way.

-RANT-
 (I know this is off topic but I need to rant ha. One girl immediately gave him her number and added him on Snapchat. Whenever they were around each other she would take videos of him and post them. She would randomly text him late at night just “because”. She made cookies for everyone in the house but made a separate batch to give to my bf specifically. She worked at an ice cream shop and was always bringing him free/discounted ice cream. She asked my bf about me and our relationship a lot. And she was always bringing up how she wants to style my bf’s hair. She also offered to pluck his eyebrows one night. I know, totally wrong subreddit but thanks for listening.)

TL;DR 
Was I (23f) wrong to expect my boyfriend (25m) to not make female friends while living in a coed sober living home? What were your experiences with coed living situations, and do you think you could maintain a long distance relationship while in recovery?",09Dec2019,1
155,"I mean, as soon as you do something, say something or do anything; that’s it. You can’t undo it, you can’t unsay it. You just have to deal with it. So many things could be so much easier if you could go back and change just a single decision, now that you know the consequences. Every single moment is time you can’t get back and with it also the possibilities you had in that time. Sure, sometimes you get a “second chance” at something, whatever that might be. But it isn’t a true second chance. Your first attempt is still there and is locked in the past. Jesus, I wish I could go back and change just a few things in the past. It’s just such a horrifying thought that a single moment of outburst, a single moment of lost focus or a single sentence could change your life so much. How can you even make a decision if so much depends on it? You get one life and you can ruin it in mere seconds but building up a good life takes constant effort. But I better stop, before I depress myself to much with my nonsensical ramblings and erratic thoughts.",09Dec2019,1

158,"A few months ago, a friend of mine sent a video of someone being killed. Now this friend of mine was known for sending Gore and other related content. Having seen a few of the messages he had sent, I finally let curiosity get the best of me and decided to look for death videos. At first it was fine, and I satisfied my curiosity. But eventually I found myself watching some more brutal and extreme murders. After realizing that i was watching real people dying and that they were losing their lives, I felt very guilty and decided to stop.

 At first it was fine, but then I began to think about how I was finding entertainment by watching others lose their lives and the guilt slowly started to sink in. For some reason I came to the conclusion that these people would resent me if they realized that others were watching them die. This caused me to get a little paranoid. Now I'm not someone that really gets scared easily. When I was younger my dad would show me horror films and I would like most other children get nightmares. But i guess because I went through that faze a bit earlier I was fine after.

 I sometimes listened to stories on YouTube(those long compilations of scary stories) as well as watched scary movies, and I never got paranoid or scared afterwards. Although my mother is very superstitious, I never really got into it once I grew up. But after watching those videos I've become extremely paranoid at night. It's as it all those movies and stories I heard all of a sudden reentered my head and I was just imagining every scenario possible. I started noticing every single creak the house made at night and could no longer feel safe in my room at night. I would like for this to all just be my brain hallucinating, but with a superstitious mother, it's gotten to the point where I'm starting to believe something is really bothering me.

I made a few rash and reckless decisions that had bad consequences in just five days. I’m guessing this means I’m having a manic episode and that I had bipolar disorder.

My oldest two daughters are living with their dad now, who allows an anything goes atmosphere. Most people don't know what's going on so I'm dreading sending out Christmas cards because every year I had my 3 kids on the card. Not this year. I took photos of my youngest daughter with our dogs last night and attempted cards but I just can't do it. Sending them out will be obvious to everyone what's going on. I know I did my absolute best as a mom but I can't compete with a dad who let's teenagers do what they want. I hate looking like a failure. My husband loves Christmas cards and I just can't. 

Now my middle daughter booked her birthday weekend up with her dad, grandparents (his parents who NEVER celebrate their birthdays) and her friends. I had a day picked and people invited and she cancelled to be with them and offered me a Monday night which I have busy with another commitment. She blew off my birthday, her sisters birthday, my husbands birthday and now pushed me from hers. It hurts. I always made a big deal of my kids birthdays every year and now this. 

My dogs passed away a few months ago and I'm still really struggling with that. We have two new dogs (puppy and a rescue) which are very demanding right now. It's draining. 

I have no ambition to set up anything for Christmas because no one will help. I don't want to deal with it just to take it down in a couple weeks.

I was trying to find a way out of the building, and I could physically feel the fear coursing through me. I ended up in a large open area, and I looked up to the second floor (had a railing going around it). I saw someone, so I quickly tried to run the other way, and then all of a sudden I felt an impact to my stomach, i had gotten shot. Like I could physically feel the pressure, and then the pain. I felt the impact, and then this hot burning pain all over my stomach. I was so scared, i couldn’t move, and I felt another impact. I felt a horrible weight on my chest, and was struggling to breathe, and then I hit the ground. I could still feel the pain and I still couldn’t breathe, everything went dark and then that’s when I finally woke up. 

I’m so terrified to go to sleep again. Even after I woke up, I could still feel a trace of the pain and I was so scared, I just started sobbing. I’ve never had a dream like that, and I never want to.

So you can imagine how that goes, during our 5th or 6th month of being together she confessed that she cheated on me and when I told her to get out of the car she said, ""no I'm just kidding it was a joke"" which obviously it wasn't but I took her back anyways like the idiot I was. Anyways fast forward a month or so I found out she was still cheating (with a friend btw) I used to have in my classes and when I found out it broke me so we split. Another month or so goes by and we were still talking and yet again we had sex and this kept on for a while. Telling me she loved me one minute and putting a different face with everyone else, it stung... I found out yet AGAIN that she was with the same guy and they were dating, when I found out I completely snapped wrapped my hands, hit the dude the next day, getting expelled the next week not only forcing me to not graduate but I was put on parole for 6 months, I understand now what I shouldn't have done and what I should have during that time but the months that came were hell. I was smoking hard, popped anything and everything to get high and forget. Once put on parole after a variety of court dates. I sobered up a bit but it didn't cure the depression that came with the reflection of how 30 seconds ruined everything, because in reality all it took was 30 seconds for my life to turn in shambles. It's been around 8 months since it all went down and not only did I lose myself and my education but I lost my friends, and my family. I now weigh 272 pounds and it hurts my back just to even wash the dishes, I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to end it. Being  labeled the ""family disgrace"" and often told at family events ""why can't you be like so and so?"" It hurts.. the worst part is my mother is going through hell with her physical self, her knee gives out almost everyday pulling shifts because we don't have the goddamn money!! and I can't even get myself out of the fucking bed!!! I feel so fucking worthless.. the confidence I once had has turned into social anxiety that person 10 months ago had it all in front just to throw it away over emotions that should've been bottled.. On days I feel drained I can't even shower just even thinking about lifting my hands pains me to the point to where I become even more helpless, overeating to feel good throughout the day knowing one day all that food will kill me... hoping even..

Which brings me to today, I woke up... and just the thought of getting out of bed smothers me to the point to where I feel like I'm being choked, but today is different.. I'm going to wash the dishes, I'm going to clean the house, I'm going to workout, I'm going to put that fucking laundry in the right places because god knows it's time for shit to be put back together in the right places.",09Dec2019,1

182,"For so long I’ve struggled with eating and gaining weight. I’m so exhausted by it. It’s never-ending. I either binge and hate myself or I starve and hate myself. It’s a never ending cycle. 

I’m almost 21 years-old and I’m so underweight. I saw a guy today who wasn’t skinny at all. He wasn’t chubby and he had some “pudge,” but he looked great. His clothes fit, he had a nice ass, and he looked healthy. My clothes don’t fit, I’m bones, and I look like I’m on crystal meth on a good day. 

I WISH I could just eat and not worry so much about gaining weight. Of course, I want to have healthy eating habits and exercise regularly, but I just don’t want to worry about it anymore. If I wanna eat cake, I want to be able to eat cake. If I want to eat ten chicken sandwiches, I want to let myself be able to eat them without feeling like a douche canoe. 

I WANT TO BE A HEALTHIER PERSON. I want to have a healthy relationship with food! I don’t want to worry if I’m gaining weight. I just want to L I V E.",09Dec2019,1

184,"Hi! I’ve been wanting to go to therapy for a really long time now. In highschool my parents wouldn’t allow me to go, saying it was a phase and invalidating my feelings. My mental health was extremely neglected during my childhood. They’ve told me therapy won’t help me and shamed me relentlessly for wanting to go. They have given me numerous reasons why I shouldn’t go. They tried to tell me medication won’t help me, and could possibly make me feel worse. My Dad had a pretty rough childhood so he tells me I have no reason to feel depressed. They made me feel crazy/guilty for even suggesting I go. I’m sorry if I sound dramatic when I say this but their reaction to my problems has kind of... scared me out seeking help? I feel super lonely and helpless all the time and I’m not sure what to do or who to talk to. So I’m just wanted some insight on what therapy is like? Or medication? Anything will help, thanks for reading.",09Dec2019,1
185,"TL;DR at bottom xx

(18F) dating a (18M) been together for around 2ish months, known each other for a bit longer.

I struggle with my weight and eating habits fairly regularly. It started roughly 2 and a half years ago and has notably interrupted my life over 3 times throughout then and now.

Recently, I've been concerned about my weight and how I look. 

I am an 18yo female, 5 foot 3 inches and weigh 7 stone 1 pound. 

I know I am technically underweight but whenever I look in the mirror at my body I feel chubby, not fat, just chubby and for some reason just the idea of being chubby scares me. 

Don't ask me why. I just am.

Anyway, I usually don't trust new people with my problems but I felt as though because he's opened up to me about some problems he's had, I could start gradually doing the same. There have been a few instances where I've felt like crying, I've been so upset or angry (not just because of myself) that I've wanted to burst into tears, but I can't when I'm around him. It's like I'm scared or something.

Earlier today I opened up to him after he asked if I was okay, when I said I hadn't slept much last night he asked what was wrong. So I told him. I told him that I had stood in the ladies room at college on my own and looked at myself in the full length mirror, I had lifted my jumper slightly and looked at my waist and stomach, that I felt like I could lose a bit more weight before I felt happy.

I won't bore you with more details, but let's say that through no fault of his own, I feel guilty and like I should have kept my mouth shut.

Maybe I just need more time? But then again, he's the one I trust the most out of everyone I've met from college. He's weird and frustrating in his own right but I work with it because I believe we can go somewhere with this relationship. I just don't see why I'm finding it so hard to share my negative emotions with him even when they aren't about me.

TL;DR.
I struggle with eating habits and body image and also can't cry or share negative emotions in front of my boyfriend despite him sharing a lot of his troubles with me.",09Dec2019,1

Hey guys,

I suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Seasonal affective disorder. This time of year, something that helps me is trying to give back and to show others how we can fight this together. For that reason, I am going live tonight on my twitch stream [twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://twitch.tv/spidermojo) in an effort to help talk to people for a couple hours about my depression and my goals and how I am working to get on track with them.

If anyone wants to chat stop by and discuss this with me! if you want to just listen that is fine too! I will probably record a podcast episode about this tomorrow at propositivity podcast. Thanks!

187,"Not sure if this is the right place, but I’m looking to get my friend a sort of self-care box for Christmas. She doesn’t struggle with any mental illnesses (that I know of) but I’ve struggled all year and she has been an incredible help to me so I wanted to get her something which sort of reminded her to look after and pamper herself too, given I know she gets stressed with college but it’s (unfortunately) often masked by my bad episodes or me trying to get help. 

I’m wording this badly, but I guess I just wanted to get her something which reminded her to treat herself, and that everyone’s mental and emotional health is important. Particularly because I know I’m probably taking a toll at this point on her (which I feel extremely guilty about). 

Do you think this is a good idea? And if so, what sort of things would you include in a self-care pack for someone who doesn’t necessarily have a specific mental illness?",09Dec2019,1
188,"I've had a lot of not great things happen to me this year. This year feels like one of the worst years so far. Normally when I get in my sad bursts I do things that typically make me happy like listening to music, cleaning, art, etc. But recently when I've tried doing those things to cheer me up it does nothing at all. I feel the same, it's almost as if I'm locked in-between emotions (most of the time) I can never get to feel even in the slightest bit of happy. I've stopped looking forward to things in my life like club meetings or choir (which I love with all my heart). I just can't seem to get myself to feel happy no matter how hard I try and I hate it. I'm not sure what to do, I'm stuck in a dark area and I don't know how to get out of it.",09Dec2019,1

I have anxiety and depression over the whole situation, I talked to her about it and apparently she won’t do anything to help me until I have thoughts of harming myself... by then it’s to late, you’re to far down to even care if you want to hurt yourself. She said it’s because I’m already fat and the meds will cause weight gain. This is why no one wants to seek help.",09Dec2019,1
190,"I am a fifteen year old girl, in tenth grade, in an American highschool

So I've been noticing that over the last six months I've contemplated suicide more often. Which, as well as alarming, is unusual. These lows were just, so low, and I can't really pin point a specific reason why they happened. I haven't lost a family member recently, or anything of the sort, they just kinda happen when they want ig? There have been three lows so far. The first one was July 23rd 2019, second one November 19th 2019, and third one was today, December 9th 2019. The first two I was contemplating killing myself, and writing a farewell note to all my friends, family, and teachers. This time I just broke down because I felt insanely alone, when I know that I wasn't.
I've never considered myself a suicidal person, or even a depressed person at that. This kinda came out of nowhere for me. I've been trying my hardest to see the positives, because I am an optimist, but it's just really hard.

I made this post cause I really needed to vent a little, and because I want to know if this might be a mental illness or just teen angst. I thought of bipolar depression just because it sounded right, I'm gonna be honest my research has not been done on this topic, I'm just looking for some advice on what to do.
Thank you for reading : )",09Dec2019,1
