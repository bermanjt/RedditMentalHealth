I thought this sub might be better than r/relationshipsadvice. But it is a bit of both. 

My (33f ) boyfriend (30m) and I have been together for a little over two years. 
Back in May he called me at work saying he thought he was having a heart attack. I took him to the hospital (he didn’t want to take an ambulance/cab or get one of his coworkers to drive him) turns out he had a really bad panic attack.  Over the next couple of months he had more panic attacks but not as bad. At least from what he has told me.
Starting in the summer he started to be not as open with me. He normally isn’t super open to talking about feelings etc because of how he was raised but usually if I would ask him something he would answer.  He literally admitted to me last week that he had been crying on his lunch breaks sometimes because he hated his job and was getting made fun of by coworkers. 
In August he finally admitted he might be depressed and talked about trying to go to the doctor to get medications He initially couldn’t go because we live in Canada and he is Irish and didn’t have coverage.  He finally went in November but he said the doctor ran out of time for him to talk about it. 
At the end of December he returned to Ireland to visit his family. During a checkup his doctor told him he is depressed and really bad. My bf won’t tell me what he was prescribed but he was told to take 50mg of an antidepressant every day. He’s been on it for about a week and a half. Unfortunately he is not going to counselling. I am not sure if the doctor recommended it but he says 20 minutes is too far to drive to see a counsellor and he can’t afford it. (Even though many places near him do sliding scales — some are only 5 euros an hour)

The reason I am here is because he is becoming more of a giant jerk. Yesterday he told me I stress him out because all he can think about is past arguments we’ve had (one is from when we first started dating) and that he blames me for the way he is. I know him being a jerk, blaming me and pushing me away is part of depression. My question is - do most antidepressants really take 6 weeks to kick in? And if/when it does - will he realize he’s been a giant jerk or will he just feel better but forget? I’m worried without counselling he will not realize how he’s been acting and the role depression has played on it. 

Thanks for your advice! 

TL;DR: boyfriend is depressed and just started taking an antidepressant. He isn’t going to counselling. Will he eventually stop being a jerk and pushing me away?",17Jan2019,1

2,"I was in the cafeteria and the way its set up, we dump our ice/left over drink into a little tray next to the dirty cups. Well my cup was empty so I just poured out the ice and was just about to put the cup itself into the rack. Then this woman comes from my right flank and pours her drink into the tray and I could've sworn I saw a drop or something fly in front of my face. I jerked back a bit but ultimately wasnt hit by anything. In that moment, all I could think was ""would I have hit her if a drop got on my face?"" It sounds ridiculous but I cant get it out of my head. I wouldn't think I'd just impulsively hit someone for that but it keeps replaying in my head. Something so minor - yet its big to me. I just want an opinion - do yall think its possible to just smack someone over something trivial (provided youre a sane individual) or is my OCD just CONVINCING me that I would. I dunno what to believe anymore. Things like this happen every day. ",17Jan2019,1

I’ve also had problem with this girl, she doesn’t know how I feel but I don’t know how I can tell her without pushing her away. Any advice appreciated just need to get rid of this feeling.

Tl:dr: Friend ran away from home and only told me. I told her family after lying to them and they threatened me with a lot of things, I now have uncontrollable anxiety over things that only relate to them. Want to know what I can do about it that doesn’t involve a therapist. 

Back in July (2018) One of my really close friends (19f) messaged me(18f)  and said she was running away from home. Which I was expecting, because where she was living was in an insanely toxic environment. She told me she was leaving the following morning, and told me not to tell her little sister (17f at the time, 18f now). Which I was confused on because the previous times she talked about running, she said she’d take her little sister with her. 

But she was waiting until little sister turned 18 so she couldn’t get charged with anything. But something happened and she just decided to leave by herself. And me, being also really close friends with the little sister, felt a little trapped. But I kept my promise. So the following morning, I know she’s gone. Everything is fine, and a few hours later the little sister messages me asking if I know where her big sister was.. And I panicked. I just said no and pretended to ask people around if they knew where she went. 

That’s when the initial anxiety set in. Please, before the keyboard warriors come at me, yes I know I should have been straight up and told her. But for my own selfish reasons I felt like I needed to keep the promise and pretend like I didn't know anything, at least until I knew my friend was out of state. 

So a day goes by, I have the little sister talking to me, worried and what not. And I never went to bed, didn’t eat. That cold anxiety feeling in my chest never went away. So I downloaded an app that gives you a free number that you can text real phones on, and texted the little sister anonymously and said ‘Big sister is on a bus going to this state, she is safe and fine” and then deleted the number and app when I knew she got the text. Which I quickly learned was terrible on my end, i kinda made it sound like she got kidnapped or whatever. 

Day three, anxiety still there. I have a full blown panic attack and call the little sister, telling her it was me who sent the text and that I knew everything. Because I was the only person that my friend told. Thus, ending a three year friendship. I talked to her dad on the phone, which he yelled at me and all that. Just like any other dad would. I gave them the passwords to her snap. 

Day four, and I didn’t hear from anyone. Day five, her dad suddenly thinks that she is at my house, even after explained that she was on a greyhound and all that. (I used to live in the same town with this friend but moved out of state a year ago.) So he’s screaming at me, calling me all these names, asking me where my address is. He told me what I did with the anonymous text was illegal. It’s not illegal, but at the time I was anxiety ridden and believed just about anything. 

Then he demanded my address. So I hung up the phone. He texted me, ‘give me your fing address.’ little sister texted me, asking me the same thing. Both of her dads girlfriend blew up my phone. So I finally had enough and got my parents involved. And that’s when I realized it wasnt illegal, and that’s the last time I had ever talked to that side of my friends family again. 

There is so much more things that were said. If i typed everything out, this post would be way, way too long. There were a lot of threats and hateful things that her dad just nailed into my brain. I had a week long anxiety attack and I only really had myself to blame. I didn’t hear from my friend until a month later where she got a new phone and everything. She didn’t understand why I was so upset.. So I just kind of stopped talking to her about it. 

Everytime I hear her little sisters name (its a common one) I instantly get a wave of anxiety that doesn’t stop. Everytime I see my friends name pop up on my phone, I get anxiety. Everytime I hear or think about her dads name I get a full blown anxiety attack. Every time someone yells are starts fighting around me, I get an anxiety attack. Whenever I see a car drive slower than usual past my house, I start thinking “Well, her dad finally found my address!” 

I don’t really know if this is some sort of ptsd, or if those events made me develop some sort of anxiety disorder. I don’t have health insurance, and I definitely dont have enough money to pay for a therapist out of pocket. Is there something I can do for myself to try and forget that this happened and moved on? Because I’m tired of being afraid.

5,"About a year ago I came out of an abusive time. People had mentally and verbally abused me for several years and i got out at the end. The first 3 years I went through a stage where I  had several suicidal thoughts, daily panic attacks and restless nights. This all came to an end when I met my now girlfriend who helped me see things otherwise through hours upon hours of talking, support and caring. Now we are a while later and somehow I have fallen into this weird new swing of feelings. I don't feel like I am going to have suicidal thoughts or panic attacks but I still feel like I don't care. It's like I don't care about dying, losing things or people,... It's like I have lost the ability to care about where my life is going, what I am doing with it or even if I live it anymore. I don't necessarily want to die but I wouldn't care a bit if I dropped dead in a hour. What is going on? Why am I feeling this way? What do I do with it? ",17Jan2019,1
6,"Good day. (19 year old male)

I'm *J*, and I'm writing in behalf of my girlfriend, who is unfortunately too afraid and doubtful to ask herself. 

Simply put, my girlfriend, *S*, has been suffering from a very hard and challenging depression for a long time. She hasn't been to any treatments and she has very little faith in the medical staff in general. 

The reason she's depressed is because of her body. She feels that she's trapped inside herself, she feels its surreal how much ""worse"" her female body is compared to any mans body. She basically hates, not dislikes, hates almost everything that comes with being a woman. 

Out of all these things, she has a few things she absolutely despises. 

Her larger hips compared to men trouble her very often, her inability to grow muscles as quickly as men do, she hates the fact that she can't run properly without putting on a sports bra. She often compares her own body to male bodies, and it makes her feel absolutely awful. 

Another thing she hates is the fact that ""she's made for reproduction"". 

She's convinced that the only thing she's capable of is giving birth. She absolutely despises the thought of reproduction and we've both agreed it's never going to happen with her. She even sometimes says hurtful things about people who choose to have children, but it's not her fault.

She hates everything that comes with her female parts, out of these things the worst things are period, discharge and other bodily fluids, and she's having a very hard time dealing with all of this. 

She's made it very clear she wants nothing to do with any of these things and she has collapsed and cried about this many times for hours on end. 

She feels upset about the fact that every time we try and find some closure about all of this on the internet, people tend to brush her off and tell her to love her body, which she simply cannot do, at least for now.

She feels the only solution to her problems would be the removal of her uterus, but we've found out not many doctors are willing or allowed to perform the surgery, even if the situation is very bad. 

She also feels that taking testosterone would help her with her other physical issues such as muscle gain and fat storage.

She feels that due to her age, 18, she won't be taken seriously by the medical staff, and that her issues will be brushed aside and her requests denied. She is very convinced there are no solutions to her problems. She has a very low self esteem and she holds a low self image. 

The mental impact this all combined has on her is very worrying and at times she feels very helpless and lost. Although I'm there to support her in any and all decision, I feel it's high time for medical staff to step in. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our questions to you are:

I've told her its possible to talk to a doctor by using for example paper to write on. This has given her some hope but she's still very doubtful about it. 

If possible, could you confirm this for her?

What's a good way to approach the situation as a whole?

What options does she have if we can't find/afford a surgery on her uterus?

Where should we look for help in her case? (she lives in Spain)

What effects and how strong would the effects of testosterone be on her? 

Where to go about getting testosterone, and is it a good idea?

***(she lives in Granada, Spain.)***

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should mention, she's a very closed off person, even before depression, she's always had a hard time talking about negative things, especially things that concern her or upset her. She comes from a very cultural family that has a strong opinion on sexuality and how females should be. Due to all of this, she simply cannot find support through her family.

The last thing I want is for her to suffer any longer, and I'm willing to do anything in my power to help her for as long as it takes, so if we can find closure and advice here, we will be very grateful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read through our problem, I know it's a long and frustrating one. Any and all advice we receive is highly appreciated.

We Hope you're having a wonderful day.

 we don’t ask for this life yet we are forced to play ball in society 
Society condemns us to a life of pain as we are force fed what we think we need but only want and can live without  

We get absorbed into fake people and situations and expect not to get hurt fully knowing what we are doing the world has turned us all into weakens pathetic  creatures

We seek dominance over others however we can’t control ourselves 

We can no longer fight our minds as they control us but yet it itself  doesn’t know what it wants as the diseases inside fight for control 

We lose all and yet we lose nothing 
Why can’t we chose what we want instead of being the mans bitch 

We sit and we watch as we destroy our own lives yet do nothing as we are too weak
 
We have turned into a new race that can’t even understand what happiness is anymore as each day we forget what that feeling once was as we were children without a doubt or a care in the world 

It’s unfair we are set up for failure and then force fed it like a wounded animal ready to be put down 

There is now gold at the end of the rainbow or sun over the hill because eventually the world will forget you and everyone you thought you loved as it turns it’s head away from you because it doesn’t follow you it follows time

11,"I'm 19 tomorrow, if that changes much. I have hallucinations and have been in the ward against my will before since I straight up told my doctors that I was a danger to myself. I have severe depression, severe OCD, and a dissociative disorder as well, which possibly get me put into the hospital, I guess.

My mom is angry at me and keeps threatening to call the cops on me and have me put into a mental hospital/treatment center for months even though she has no proof that I'm actively suicidal, which I make jokes about but wouldn't do because I have loved ones that I couldn't do that to. The only way I'm a danger to myself right now is because my OCD keeps me from eating foods that are ""contaminated""...which isn't an issue if I buy packaged things from a clean store and I'm not underweight right now or anything. 

I've been more depressed and haven't been leaving my room lately and I had a few small visual hallucinations, but that's because I'm a little more stressed out with her around and why would I leave my room much if she's just going to yell at me when I leave it? Every time I am away from her I do far better, so I just want to be allowed to live somewhere else (I can't afford it because I can't get a job).

&amp;#x200B;

If I haven't told my doctors of any actively suicidal thoughts and am not a danger to others right now and appear pretty calm and collected overall to them, and my mom has no proof of any of these, can I still be deemed incompetent and be put into a hospital if my mom claims I need to be or tells someone I'm threatening suicide?

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to go because every time I've gone to those, they don't help at all, they do those weak generalized treatments that can't do anything for me and having so many mentally ill people around me there makes me far worse and its crazy expensive, which I can't afford. There might be better centers that are more specialized, but those are even more expensive. I don't have much money and don't want to be in debt over something like that and won't get a good job any time soon to pay it off and if anyone else would be forced to pay for it, I would die of guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like my life is in danger at the moment, and it would be a better route to convince my dad to let me live with him instead or for her to leave me alone. I would rather use the money spent on a useless psych ward to actually pay for specialized treatments if I had to spend money anyways.

13,"I got out of therapy almost a year ago, I have depression and social anxiety. It’s been about a year and six months since my last overdose. I’m really not sure where else to go for help/advice, my best guess was reddit. My life has been getting somewhat better and I’ve gotten my mental health more under control, but mainly because I’ve been able to avoid my parents as much as possible. I’m a teenager, you should probably know that. They used to be abusive when I was younger, and now even the slightest things they do will send me into breakdowns with crying and wishing they were dead. The other night my mom walked in while I was changing clothes, I slammed the door shut and she didn’t bother to apologize or say anything about it. She just kept on yelling at me to do things I had already finished. I know that sounds like such a small thing, so I don’t know why things like that bother me at such an extreme level. I think it’s more the fact that they don’t give a damn about my privacy, or me as a person at all. They call me ugly almost everyday and point out my insecurities, and get offended when I become upset. When I show signs of anxiety (like not being able to talk on the phone, or not being able to check out items by myself at the store), they yell and swear at me and ask me why I’m so fucked up. They break things, and honestly they scare the shit out of me. I get filled with anxiety anytime i accidentally do something they wouldn’t like, like accidentally knocking over my dad’s beer or something like that, and I’ll immediately try to fix it and hide in my bedroom (if they’re not around me at the time of the mistake I mean). I pretend to be asleep most of the time I’m home because I hate being around them. My dad especially scares me, and honestly the only reason I’m alive is because of my friends.

I’ve tried CPS, i’ve tried hotlines, i’ve tried talking to my other relatives. They say there’s they can really do. I don’t know what to do anymore. I hate crying everyday because of them.

20,"Dear Doctors, 

I get it. I'm 20. I'm in college. You don't trust me.

I'm also the daughter of a pharmacist. I was raised in a pharmacy. I wanna work in pharmaceuticals one day.

So, when I tell you I know the dangers of benzodiazepines, *believe me.* I've seen what narcotics and controlled substances due to people. I interacted with them on a daily basis, I've seen the addiction and desperation. 

And when I tell you I don't want to have to take them, *believe me.* I dislike medication as much as the next guy. But Zoloft made me fat and anxious, Lexapro keeps me from killing myself, but when I'm not in a near comatose state from it - I'm having anxiety.

Three to five panic attacks a day to be specific. I've had a hell of a year. I just need to get back on my feet. 

Again, I'm educated in this, I know what I'm talking about and I know what I'm doing. But when I keep my boyfriend up all night because I'm having anxiety attacks *in my sleep*, I need a little help because that's out of my control.

I know you won't believe me when I say I never sleep alone, I spend every night with my boyfriend or my best friend, and they'll monitor my usage. I know saying I don't have an addictive personality and I'm not going to sell them is not enough.

But I am *so* close to getting my degree, if this anxiety does not get to me first.

I just want to stop being a burden on my friends. I want to be able to sleep at night. I want to go to class and therapy and not be forced to skip because I'm shaking so bad I can not stand.

I'm going to therapy on a weekly basis. I'm 2 for 3 on SSRI's, they're not working.  I've tried exercise, and yoga, I do not smoke or do drugs, I rarely drink.

But, I have panic disorder. I've had it since I was **six years old**. I started showing signs of anxiety at 5. How many six-year-olds do you know out there who get anxiety attacks? I was literally born this way. We've been trying treatment for 7 years. And for five of those, I was able to control it pretty well. But I've strayed from the path, and this time therapy is not enough. 

I have done all I can do, but I'm at my wit's end. I do not want to head down this path but I don't know where else to go.  I need to get a grip on myself so I can get back on this path and be off *all* medications and be my old self again.

So either you find a way to make my anxiety manageable overnight, or you create a non-addictive pill that actually works, or you start treating me as a patient in desperate need of some help - and not some kid looking for drugs.

Give me one solid treatment that I haven't tried and doesn't involve benzo's and I'll gladly take it. Again, I don't **want** to be on them just as much as you don't want me to. But, I've tried everything I know.

Just hear me out, please. I'm not just some kid. I'm a human being who is struggling to live a quality of life and frankly, I do not want to keep living if I'm living like this. 

Sincerely,

A patient who needs you to put their ageism aside and help.",17Jan2019,1

I always had problem with attention growing up, but when I got tested for ADHD they said I didn't have it. But I dont know, some days I'm barely able to function and some days I feel great, so it's confusing as to whether I need to go to the doctors or whether or not I should be making a post on here right now, because I go from fine to need help immediately within a day.

It seems like the simple stuff, and the things that to others are common sense that I just make mistakes on. Like I'm not actually thinking about what I'm doing, I'm just doing it. I'd say I'm not ""there"", haven't been in a long time. This morning I put on the wrong shoes and didn't realize until I stepped on a rock in my flat-bottoms instead of my workboots, after getting to work. I'll forget how to do things I already knew how to do, or I'll second guess myself until I need to ask for help. It just feels like I don't realize what I'm doing wrong, even if I'm looking directly at it, and it seems like things that I should be thinking of never even cross my mind. It's this lack of focus and attention to detail that has made some of my coworkers think of me as a stupid kid, and it's these dumb mistakes that send me home wondering if I should just go quit and find something easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only this, but whenever I'm outside, and I see something pretty, or I look up in the sky at night with all its stars, I don't feel the contentment it used to give me. I just don't feel as much, it seems. It feels like my souls been taken from me, and I'm just a zombie walking about in my day. It doesn't matter how much sleep I get, my diet, my exercise, nothing I change makes a difference. I just have a foggy mind, I feel woozy, exhausted, and that I just don't have enough time to do anything.

  
I've also noticed in social situations I've said or done things that I know I'm later going to regret or that they thought was weird but did it anyway. I think of some people as weird but when I think about it I'm a lot like them and I'm not aware of it.

I don't know if I'm depressed, if I have ADD, mild autism, schizophrenia, or whatever. I just want to feel more alive.",17Jan2019,1
22,"I weep as I write this because ive been alone for far too long. I don't get why kids are so cruel in highschool. I don't get why im so behind on everything, im the only one whos not dating, the only one without a friend group. im so frustrated and sad. its not fair",17Jan2019,1
23,"I’ve been diagnosed with both ADHD and depression.  I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago.  I tried antidepressants and they didn’t work.  I tried two therapists and they didn’t help.  I was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 months ago.  tried stimulants and they somewhat work; I’ll feel really happy, oddly (maybe overly) talkative, and energetic (maybe overly) for a few hours, but then crash during different periods and feel the worst I’ve ever felt in my life.  I can’t take these stupid medications anymore so I’m planning on quitting them, even if my grades suffer as a result of not taking the stimulants, I can’t feel those lows any longer.

All I want in my life is to be happy.  I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy for an extended period of time for my entire life (this assumption is purely off of memory so it is possibly inaccurate).  My parents said I was a happy child and rarely cried so it’s kind of funny how I’ve been depressed for 2+ years (and that’s just the time I knew what depression was, so I could have had it for way longer).  Happiness is subjective, so I understand why many people cannot give quality advice to others on the subject.  That’s why I’m asking you guys because you’re likely to actually understand how I feel.  Most people just say, “You have to find what makes you happy.”  My response to that is I don’t want to rely on finding a “passion,” a pretty and sweet wife, etc. in order to become happy.  I just want to be genuinely happy with life in general.  I’m not expecting to be happy all the time, as that is impossible,  but I want to be happy more than I am depressed at the very least.  I know that genetics play a role in one’s happiness levels (happiness levels sounds really weird but that’s the best I could come up with 😂), but even if my genetics don’t favor happiness, I don’t want to give up and just be miserable my whole life and/or kill myself.
Disclaimer for the anxious people/over thinkers out there: There is no chance of me committing suicide at this point in my life.

I don’t think I’m like other people and I know that sounds selfish, and if I posted this on almost any other subreddit (with a few exceptions), I would be bombarded with hate comments (I might even get a few here but I understand 😂).  If you guys do think I truly am selfish or egotistical in saying that, I’d be glad to talk about it.

This world is full of jerks and it saddens me.  I want to help people while I’m on this earth, but why would I help jerks?  And there are some truly good people out there, and that’s who I want to help.  I’ve always gotten my feelings hurt easily and when I’m treated with hatred, I can’t stop thinking about why people could be so mean.  I’ve obviously been rude at times just like all people, but I try to be as kind as I can be.  I saw an article discussing research done that proved almost all people believe they are morally superior to their peers, so that’s kind of ironic looking back at my previous statement (delete laughing emoji here because they’re getting repetitive).  And just so you guys know, I’m not that person that laughs at his own jokes.

This paragraph is going to be controversial but here we go.  I can’t stand people that are fake.  For example, I used to be friends with this girl (I stay away from her to the best of my ability now) and 90% of her words were related to either gossip or complaining about small things.  She constantly talked bad about people (still does), and still hangs out with them a lot, pretends they’re friends, and they all have complaining sessions.  I know I’m technically complaining throughout this whole post, but my problem isn’t complaining.  It’s complaining about the most unimportant things.

This paragraph may also be controversial and is related to me feeling different.  The quote, “Ignorance is bliss” is what I’m discussing here.  Most people don’t think about the meaning of life multiple times a day.  Most people don’t consider the invalid proof of a supreme being/beings existing (being flexible with terminology to cover most religions).  Most people at 17 don’t fear looking back on their life at 50 and realizing they wasted.  I think about all of these all the time and many more, and I bet most of you do too.  Disclaimer: I’m sorry to any religious people who read this paragraph as you are completely entitled to your own beliefs.

Throughout my life, there have been times where I’ll get utterly obsessed with one hobby and can’t stop thinking about it and I build my whole life around the addiction.  All of a sudden I’ll just put it down and move on to something else.  Sadly, video games were a problem for a long time, even before my depression.  They’re starting to become a problem now too.  I’ll feel great in the moment but after taking a break from the addiction, I feel deep regret.  Maybe I think I’m wasting my time, I don’t know.

As of now I either want to be a psychiatrist or a music artist (I know, they’re quite different).  I have a new idea of my future “career” every two minutes so we will see how long those two “career” ideas last.  I’m interested in psychiatry because I want to help people who are going through what I’ve experienced.  And with the other career, I just love music and love the idea of making my own music.  I might have a heart attack performing live though.







1.  I’d prefer if you guys kind of respond to each of my paragraphs but you don’t have to.

2.  I know I said I get my feelings hurt easily but if you have any constructive criticism, please give it.  I need some critiquing because no one can improve without accepting criticism and using that criticism to make their lives better.

3.  If any of you want to dm me I’d love to talk personally to each and every one of you.

28,"Hello, I wasn't sure where to post this but I just woke up from one of these dreams and it's beginning to freak me out. Ive cross posted this in dreams but someone recomended therapy so I figured I'd post here just in case.

For the past 2 weeks, I've been having semi-stressful dreams that are so hyper realistic I can't tell the difference until about an hour after I've woken up, or unless the dream causes me to go into a panic and I realize that way through some kind of investigation. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe anxiety, slight agoraphobia, BPD, as well as several other things that I was diagnosed with when I was 17. I am 20 now, almost 21. I have not been on meds and have not been able to afford therapy for over 2 years.

Just a few moments ago I woke up from one where I was ""woken up"" by a call fdom my sister in hysterics saying my father had been in an accident, I then actually woke myself up by saying ""what?!"" And getting dressed out of bed only to realize my phone wasn't even in my hand. But I couldn't tell any difference. Nothing was out of place and it didn't feel like a dream of any sort. This sent me into a mear panic attack and I called my mom just to make sure everyone was okay. 

My other dreams have been more anxiety based, such as missing my job interview and getting a ride up there, chatting with my roomate and just walking around our apartment, going to my first day on the job nefore my first day even started, talking with coworkers, being a cashier, ect. Mundane things, but its getting to a point now Im not understanding whats been a dream and what isn't. Sometimes its nightmare esque, sometime I'm just having general anxiety and other times its just me living my life as normal with no way to see a difference. I can see myself in mirrors, I can read in the dreams, and theres no way for me to get out of them.

I'll keep talking about something that happened only for my finace or roomate to look at me funny and ask me what I'm talking about, trying to bring back up conversations that happened in my dreams but not reality. Its getting to the point I feel crazy and like I'm being lied to, or that my dreams are bleeding over so badly I cant see the lines anymore. I really want to know whats going on, is this normal?? I get anywhere from 6-8 hours of sleep, so I don't know whats happening, but its very scary. Any advice?",17Jan2019,1
29,"For those who have had to face this tough decision, what was your outcome or what would you recommend? 

Some background: Im fairly new to the workforce (first job out of college w no prior experience) so I’ve been struggling with the anxiety of not knowing if whatever task I’m doing is correct, and depressed because It feels like everyone else just ‘gets it’ and i don’t (i have ADHD if that provides context). I’m also constantly on edge from all the mistakes I’ve made at work and just feeling like I’m going to get called out for another mistake any second. 

I was put on a performance improvement plan (PIP) and while I thought I was improving, my managers said ‘my growth is not enough’ so that doesn’t sound like good news. My PIP will be over by the end of the month and again, it isn’t looking too well. Getting a PIP is like walking on eggshells because I feel like they are designed to make you do worse due to all the stress and anxiety you undergo. This just causes me to make more mistakes in the longrun. 

Should I resign while I’m somewhat ahead of it? I know those who say to ‘wait and get fired’ advise this for unemployment money purposes, but money aside, would that truly be worth it? The thought of getting fired would probably put me in a deeper depression because not only did I feel like a POS during work, but now i feel even more worthless with being fired. It just doesn’t sound like the viable choice for my mental health. So I guess the choice comes down to ‘feeling some sort of sanity from leaving on your own terms vs feeling like absolute shit but with a bit more money in your pocket’

How did you guys (who have a similar experience) handle this?

32,"so this is my first ever proper post on reddit, it's currently 0450 GMT. I haven't slept well for over a month and a half now.

i've gone through a lot of bad shit in my life, a lot of bullying, my dad left me when i was a child but i didn't know so I thought my stepdad was my actual dad, which they only told me when i was 7, i didn't understand why and got angry at everyone for keeping this from me and why my biological dad left. about a year after that my step-dad left me and my four siblings so it was just my mum and us kids for a few years, we struggled a lot.

I remember feeling starved a lot, constantly checking the cupboards for food but finding nothing, with my mum not noticing my decline in mental health because she had four other kids to take care of. I was so angry at the world, two father figures left me, for reasons no one told me, the kids at school saw me as a freak and so i got bullied, everyday, all day, without remorse because hey, when do nine and ten year old kids know when to stop.

I had a lot of resentment and anger issues and acted out a lot, swore so much that i'd be disgusted at it today. at one point my step-dad came back, asking to see his kids and he only meant his biological children - my three youngest siblings. this made me feel so unwanted, especially seeing them come back with privileges every week, like fast food and new toys and stuff that i couldn't have, why? because i wasn't wanted, again. three times i'd been left by a father figure. by the time i finished primary school (11 years old) i had no friends, no father figure, emotional resentment and hatred towards the world and my mother was falling apart too. 

secondary school was a mess, bullied everyday by the same kids for four years straight, again i was the freak, poor, dirty kid who was ostracised because his family didn't have enough money for the latest trends and he didn't understand how to get along with people because he had no one there to teach him. again, my siblings had all the privileges and nice treatment whilst i had to stand there and watch.

i fucked my GCSEs by getting kicked out of schools, i got 4 gcses out of a possible 8. my options for my future were limited. just before my gcses though, my biological dad came back, i was so confused and didn't know what to do. I didn't know what he looked like, sounded like, acted like or was like at all for my whole life! 15 whole years this man didn't want to be in my life and poof, he appears out of nowhere. craving some sort of father figure i got attached quickly, and sometimes he'd say stuff about my council house background that would hurt but i'd bite my tongue, especially since he came from the same place. 

my dad was in the army and i had a somewhat interest in them, so along with my failed gcses, i decided to join up. it took a while but i finally got in, everyone else i knew went into sixth form or college or whatever, i was the only one in the army. that made me feel alone, no one knew what i was going through, how i was feeling. i learned to have a thick skin whilst there and not to take people's shit. i was so used to just being abused and at the end of everyone's jokes. i'm not a big lad, i'm 6""2, 135 pounds and never had a fight before, despite my efforts in secondary school. sometimes i would fit in and sometimes i felt like no one whilst there, so i decided to leave, this brings us to december 2018. 

the consequences of me leaving were no job, which means no pay, going back to no routine, going back to a friendship group that knows i was struggling but still doesn't hold back on their ""jokes"".

this saturday just gone i stayed in whetherspoons (popular local pub) for five hours to drink with them, at the risk of me getting IDd (i'm 17) and i got absolutely smashed, and hateful, angry, sad, depressed and i didn't have the will to hold it back this time, like i could in front of my family and friends normally.

i got home at two in the morning, carried on drinking and wrote a jargon suicide letter, stating that i am sorry for being a burden on everyone and i hope life is better without me, i posted the paper under my mum's door, went downstairs and grabbed the biggest kitchen knife i could. poking into into my chest and pleading with myself to just push! push! push! if i just pushed then i wouldn't feel anything anymore and i'd be okay! but i didn't. i couldn't. i hate myself for not following through, and don't think it's long before i'll try again.

My biggest problem is that I can’t sleep at night, usually because my thoughts go crazy and my anxiety completely hates me. I usually fall asleep between 6am and 9am and sleep until lunchtime (I’m currently studying from home, so I study during the afternoons)
I live with my boyfriend and he just gets really mad at me if I don’t fall asleep, says that it’s so easy for me to fall asleep if I just “stop thinking”.

34,"I'm the middle child out of four (Two older half siblings and one younger sister). I only grew up with my younger sister and since becoming an adult have cut contact and disowned my older siblings.

Problem: My younger sister denies to acknowledge my mental health issues and seems to blame me for them (Diagnosed Depression and Anxiety, Highly suspected Autism*). 

Just tonight, she told me that I've been ""depressed, sad, angry, etc"" my whole life and I blame everything on that (as in, she seems to believe that I don't take responsibility for anything, I think?) She said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""You turned 26 and suddenly you have Autism"" in a very condescending and critical way.

I've tried talking to her and explaining how things affect and/or trigger me, but she just basically starts spouting inspirational quotes at me and denying that theres anything ""wrong"" with me because she thinks I'm just looking for attention.

I have no idea how to talk to her anymore because everything ends up in a fight to the point that I get so upset that I meltdown.  Just seeing her at this point sets my anxiety off and I just want to close myself off in my room and give up.

What do I do?

*I have done a lot of research over the last year and have consulted with a number of people including my regular doctor (who said she was happy when I brought up my suspicions because she had thought that I was but didn't know how to bring it up), my therapists, a friend with Asperger's, among others.

35,"Long story short, i keep getting these annoying thoughts that i might have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). the reason why i'm worried like this is because the way i feel about certain people changes from when i meet them for the first time after i hang out with them. like, i met this girl a while ago and at first i liked her a lot and thought of her as a potential girlfriend, but after hanging out with her for a while my feelings for her changed and i've come to the conclusion that she's just a good friend of mine, nothing more or less and we wouldn't work out as a couple although i still like her a lot.

And i'm not sure if i'm this is normal or not. my opinion of these people doesn't shift randomly and doesn't go to extremes like ""Idealizing them"" and then directly switching over to hating them like they're the scum of the earth, and i've been told it's alright to change my opinion of some people after a while of hanging out with them.

I'm not asking for a diagnoses but i just want to know if you guys think this is normal behavior. if it helps : i'm 19, i have panic Disorder and i tend to worry about getting conditions like these, i've had depression a year ago, i'm not self harming/suicidal, my sense of self/identity has been the same for as long as i can remember and i've had the same goals and values for years, i have plenty of stable relationships that have been going on for a while and my opinion of the said people stopped ""changing"" after i spent some time with them, in fact, it would only get better after i hang out with them more.

43,"I have a sister who isn't doing so great. My other sister, dad, and I don't know the best way to talk to her as she seems to be dismissive of the idea that she might be losing it.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister was talked into starting a contracting business with her now ex (although, it seems that she hasn't been exactly honest about the nature of her relationship with him). Long story short, that did not go well. The ex was the one mainly handling the actual work, managing employees, and buying all the stuff, but overall just did a bad job with it. He also convinced my sister to put the business all under her name (first as a sole-proprietorship, then as an LLC), so she's been left with massive credit card debts. She was supposed to have left the business and left it all to the ex, but it seems that that hasn't 100% happened...

&amp;#x200B;

During my sister's period of active involvement with the business, she suffered mentally because 1) the stress of running a business really got to her, especially with the ex making bad choices for the business 2) she used to have her finances together and had been saving up a chunk of money after making some financially savvy moves, so wrecking her finances just messed with her a lot, and 3) the ex was abusive (he'd apparently been physically violent toward her on some occasions). It was apparent that she wasn't doing great so mentally because talking to her over the phone, she just didn't sound very present, her train of thought was just extremely difficult to follow, and she would ramble on about a whole bunch of conspiracy theories. She'd also become more withdrawn, becoming harder to reach over the phone (I'm in Northern California while she's in Hawaii) and just ghosting all her friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also got to see her when I visited Hawaii in November and when she visited Southern California (where my dad and other sister are), but she also just doesn't look healthy--she looks like a skeleton. She was always on the skinnier side, but she used to have healthier, a bit rounded cheeks, but those are just gone. She also seemed not exactly present most of the time whenever we had conversations. She also behaved a bit strangely because she believes that she has morgellons disease, a scientifically, completely unsubstantiated condition that conspiracy theorists claim that the medical community is trying to hide. As a ""symptom"" of the disease, she seems to think that she feels air shooting out of her pores. She also seems to think that when washing her hands at the sink, air bubbles come out of the stream of water hitting her hand because bacteria is releasing it...

&amp;#x200B;

This decline all happened rapidly. She still had things together fine for the most part just last May. She's just a completely different person compared to then.

&amp;#x200B;

She's now trying to rebuild by making money through Airbnb and going back to bartending, but as far as my dad, other sister, and I can tell, she does not have a financially feasible plan. Ideally, we want her to give up on the Airbnb and come back to California, at least for some time, so that she can pull away from the whole mess and get better where we can be available to her. Though it's true that her finances are in shambles, in her mental state right now, she doesn't seem capable of adequately dealing with the mess. We also don't want her seeing her ex, whom she seems to be at least trying to be friends with. We don't want that obviously because he had abused her, but also he might use her for more money. We're also starting to believe that he got her into drugs...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been rambling on now and I don't know where to start with my questions... However, I don't know how to reason with someone who can't really think straight anymore...

My therapist has suggested that this fear(or rather, my inability to stop thinking about it) might be related to my ocd, and while i recognize that I'm not pregnant and it's most likely due to mental illness, I just can't distract myself from it and I honestly feel like I'm losing my mind. I just can't seem to fully convince myself that I'm okay. I feel like I don't have control over my mind or body. I feel like I don't get to choose whether or not i eat or sleep, got to school/work, or even get out of bed. People have tried to tell me how ridiculous it is, or that even if I am pregnant it's not the end of the world, but none of it makes me feel any less paranoid.

 Anyways, I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope until I can get further into therapy and (hopefully) learn to deal with or even fix the problem permanently.",17Jan2019,1
46,Could a history of self - harm (specifically cutting and scratching) be classed as a traumatic experience? Despite it being self inflicted could the memory of it (particularly with the blood and stuff) be classed as traumatic?

47,"I’ve been watching shit about Sociopaths. And it FEELS like everything lines up. Isn’t that ironic? I just don’t feel anything. Well, I feel like pain and feel some shit sometimes. But everything is like a consistent state of boring. Unless it’s difficult it’s not that interesting. School just feels like it has no purpose. Of course, it could be nothing! I could be perfectly fine and looking for an issue to make things more interesting. The more dramatic the backstory the more interesting the character. But they also say Sociopaths are normally Narasscicts. It’s just so confusing. Everything I’ve researched would make me a Sociopath: I don’t feel much, I don’t have any decent friends, suck at school, etc. But I couldn’t because Sociopaths are usually narriscists and wouldn’t question themselves. Or, I could just be looking for nothing. Does it even matter? Not like I exactly have anyone that cares. Left my only friend in Texas. And I even treated him like shit. No one here actually cares. We’ll laugh but no one truly listens. They made their groups long before I got there. I’m just fucking dragging myself in, one guy there wants me gone. The others probably do too. Ugh.

49,"I am 22 years old man living with my parents (NC, US) and I have been dealing with things since middle school. I decided to tell her because I have been struggling with this for a long time. Which the only reason I was able to tonight is because I drunk a little bit of alcohol. It helped me overcome the fears of talking and asking for help that I have had since middle school. Week after week I previously would chicken out.

I finally told my mom but it didnt go well. She kept saying things like ""Oh everyone has been through it"" You can read the other post on my account for some of the things I go through. I dont want to repeat it because I have highlighted most of it in my other post which I talked about me having very bad anxiety(with half of it from social stuff), Paranoria? (Which I say that because I think everyone is talking bad about me 24/7 and plotting to make me feel like the dirt I am by bullying me or beating me up. This includes my parents which I feel like they are talking about how they will make me homeless soon when they kick me out), OCD which would consist of perfectionism and picking all over my body(face, arms, underarms, and privates)

She took everything wrong with me bad. While trying to talk it out with her she walked out on me many times to smoke and said I needed help. She tried to equate what I told her to stuff she went through for a portion of time. When i told her I want to talk about me and the stuff I went through for over 15 years of my life she got pissed at me and let me know that a general physician would fix all this as she knows her kid will not need a therapist or psychologist.

I know she is disappointed in me. I can feel or how she talked to me. So much aggressiveness and she would jump on me when I would physically cringe at her talking. She promised not to tell my dad but I don't know. I know they talk about me behind my back. I wonder how it will be when a general physician sees me and realised who I am as they wont help me but they will join in with the making fun of me. I wish I could set up appointments on my own but all the contacting is daunting. Then again no matter who it is when they see me or my name they will know this boy is the scum of the earth so let's treat him like that and bully him like he deserves. 

By me making this post, I dont want anyone not to talk to there parents. You may be in a different situation. I am just scared to death as I know for a fact my parents will hate me for the rest of my life now that I semi-fully opened up. I wish I had someone I could talk about everything with but unfortunately this life is set for everyone to hate me and want me to feel like dirt.

I dread to sleep as it will fast forward time. If anything I want time to slow it down. Like with my last post, I am sorry that this is long. To the mods I believe I am correctly posting this and I am sorry if I screw up as it isn't uncommon for me.",17Jan2019,1
50,"I (22F) had been depressed since I was 15. I also started taking birth control at 14/15.  

I stopped using birth control in June (2018) in an attempt to see if it was causing my depression, and in September I felt like my depression was gone. I completely 100% blamed birth control for my depression. I have been feeling better than I have in the last 7 years. However, when something goes the wrong way (getting into an argument with a family member for example), I have an episode.

I don’t know what kind of episode. I feel embarrassed saying this, but I punch myself in the leg, throw whatever is in my hand, pull my hair, scream, etc. usually while crying at the same time. My heart beats extremely fast and I can’t catch my breath. I don’t know what’s going on with me, and I am so desperate to know what this is and if other people experience it. 

I also want to mention, I can barely remember what happened after. I have no control over my emotions while it is going on. I have control over my actions to an extent, I wouldn’t throw or punch something if I knew it would cause permanent damage. Afterwards, I feel extremely sad, I want to self harm, and most of all, I feel ashamed and regretful that anyone had to see me act that way.

This is such a big secret of mine, I would be so embarrassed if anyone other than my family and my boyfriend knew I did this. 

One more thing: I do see a therapist, and I used to take medication for bipolar depression (in 2016). But one made it impossible for me to function throughout the day and another made my depression significantly worse, which scared me and I wanted nothing to do with medication after that. 

I guess my overall question is, does anyone know what this is? Thank you in advance for any responses! ",17Jan2019,1
51,"So, my gf and I have been having a lot of issues for awhile. 

She feels that I talk to her like she’s stupid, don’t appreciate her, and that there is no spark. She wants to do couples counseling. I haven’t heard many good things about it and have heard that it ends more relationships than it saves.

I feel stressed out All. The. Time. Feel like I cannot have a serious conversation with her without her taking what I’m trying to say the wrong way. Feel like I’m always chasing something that is just barely out of reach.

I’ve been working 50-60, sometimes 70 hour weeks pretty consistently ever sense we moved out to pay the bills. This has led to a silent resentment towards her because she has basically stayed at home most of the time we’ve been together. She would hold jobs but after 2-3 months something would happen and she would quit, leaving me to be the sole income once again. It doesn’t bother me as much as it used to but it’s still there.

We had a son in June of last year and it feels like everything has turned up to 11. She is over protective over him to the point that it’s like her and him vs the world(including me sometimes, or at least I feel this way.) Take every typically first time parent cliche and then some.. like she barely lets my family hold him when there is more than a couple people around, she won’t let me take him anywhere by myself, yeah.

Today she tells me we have to move because he’s been sick and she thinks it’s black mold under the house even though we have lived here for almost 2 years and had no issues. 

I don’t have $1,500 to get us into a new place despite working 24/7, and missing all the time my son is a baby, sooooo she tells me I should get a title loan on our other car, even though I am barely keeping up on bills now.. then when I said no she said I should sell it and get another car later, effectively pushing the problem back another few months where we will be right back where we are now. No.

Before these options she tells me they’re gonna stay with her mom, and that I should stay with mine so we can save money to get a new place to stay. Her mom hates me because I called her a bad person 5 years ago because honestly, up until a year ago she was.. 

Her mom has a big problem with my family because my mom made one comment a couple years ago when my gf wanted us to move again after we had literally just moved in.. like I spent almost $2000, and my only day off for 2 weeks, moving us in completely by myself becuz she had class, and my mom made a comment about her needing to work a couple hours a week to help me and ever since there has been huge beef. To the point that she will make sneaky comments on facebook that are obviously aimed towards me/them.

I have thought about letting her leave many times. The only thing that keeps me from going through with it is this dream I have of us raising our little boy as a family, waking up with him every day, watching him grow up, going to parks, etc. and the thought of not getting to see him all the time makes me want to die.

I have thoughts all the time, almost to a daily level now about what if I just walked outside and in front of the next car that was coming, or a forklift at work, or even just buying a gun.

Scary thoughts, but calming in a way knowing if I really wanted to it could be done real quick. 

Now to be clear, I would never do it. My dad has always had issues and has been taking lithium as long as I can remember and his brother/my uncle shot himself when I was very young. I’ve seen first hand what that does to children, his daughter is a mess, and I could never do that to my little boy.

I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head for a minute because I am basically alone and just... tired.

54,"So I went to my GP and spoke about *some* not all my issues, mostly because he seemed to cut it short or wanted us gone I dunno. I just feel really awkward talking about this shit.

Moving on; He referred me to a mental health group specialising in Depression and Anxiety. Which is weird because I'm not depressed, or at least I don't ever feel sad or hopeless.

When I spoke for like an hour or not about some of my stuff, I couldn't remember all of them. He immediately forwarded me onto a different group, a group that deals with other things like psychosis.

He told me that they aren't equipped to deal with hallucinations and delusions etc. As far as I'm aware, I'm not delusional but I have been having hallucinations. That's the main reason for asking help.

Now, I went to this new fella. I can't remember if he's a therapist or psychatrist. But, after our 2 hour session he told he's gonna go talk to a psychatrist. He never told me if he's going to call me back or anything.

I don't know if I should expect a call or not. I also don't know if they're the same group or building etc.

I've been moved around talking about the same shit and not getting any answers and it's starting to annoy me.

He asked why I sent there and if I went there for a diagnosis. I didn't really awnser.

I don't know why I went. I feel sick. I'm self aware enough to know something isn't right. I don't feel myself anymore. I know there's something wrong.

But it's it normal for this to happen? To be moved around a lot?

I've told him that I've been told by people that they think I'm schizophrenic, bipolar, depressed, etc literally everything at this point. I told him I haven't self diagnosed and I don't do drugs which he kept asking for some reason.

I was simply saying that's what done have asked if I am. Now I just want a fucking name to whatever is happening to me. I feel like it's been getting a lot worse since I opened up about it.

I feel like I'm out of the loop on my own fucking treatment. Is it normal? ",17Jan2019,1
55,"Hi, I'm Andrew, 20 year old guy in my 3rd year at university in the UK and I really could do with some advice.
The last year has been one of the hardest of my life. My ex broke up with me in April, my relationship with my family has deteriorated to the point where I spent Christmas alone 200 miles away from anyone I care about, and I just don't what to do. I have very few friends - I'm always told that I'm a great person, but it takes me time to relax and open up with someone and i just find that people don't seem to give me a chance. I'm so lonely and for someone who spent 2 years in a beautiful relationship which of course wasn't perfect but was the happiest I've ever been, the lack of any form of physical contact with someone is crushing.
In December I had a day where I was very suicidal and if it wasn't for my ex talking to me and relaxing me then I wouldn't be writing this today. But then when I went to the hospital that night after 4 hours and 4 different appointments I was told that what I was feeling wasn't real.
To make things worse it's now exam season. I remember going through exams in June thinking how by now I'd hopefully be in a better place. But I'm not, I've got an exam in 7 hours time I'm so scared for, another 24 hours from now, and then 3 more in a weeks time. I know I can't keep doing this, but I also don't know how to stop or just get to where I want to be.

56,"I've been in a bad place myself for a long time and the past 4 or so months I've always played with ending it in my mind. I always felt I was ready, but could not get over the consequences to others. Today I learned a distant friend ended his life when I went to settle a debt I was owed (one that was taking a toll on me). The person owing it was the best friend of the departed. I felt and feel like the most rabbid bastard alive right now. I'm seeing first hand what a life lost does to those around them, and even their extended acquaintances. I don't know the family, but seeing what torment is being experienced by people that knew them... It's not good. It's making me realise that no matter what, the end is not the answer and definitely not the end. As much as I stress about disappointing those around me, I now see they'd much rather support my fall than experience me end it all. This is an anonymous post. Maybe I don't have the guts to own up to my issues completely.

But if one person thinking about it sees this from someone else thinking about it. Seeing another so close to breaking point seeing exactly what breaking point is... Don't do it. Our internal respects can't compare to the shock wave that devastates many more.

I drunk a lot to medicate myself due to a disease I have. I was so shell shocked by this I could only ask the bar staff to charge me twice and wish the next customers a happy holiday period.

Life is definitely short, but if there is just one person that made an ounce of effort to comfort, respect themdont do it. We all wish we could do more. We may not realise we slack at it. But ending it... It's not a good legacy. It hurts more when you are gone. ",17Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I am booking an appointment with a licensed therapist near my city which has a good review(at least that's based on google review), I did make a phone call 3 months ago to talk in general and to grasp if I can like the therapist which I do. What prompts me to seek for a face to face session is because on the last internet counselling session, my (licensed)counselor are advising me to seek for a face to face session since the depressed check list he told me to fill in indicate that I might have a very severe depression, so I need to make sure if I'm depressed or not by having a face to face session since filling the check list only may not be 100% accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The problem:

As you have noticed it took me 3 months since the phone call to finally book an appointment because I need to create a time where I could skip work without my parents knowing and makes it all natural (I am a successor of family's business). The reason why I do this is because I do think my parents will either worry and not be supportive of my decision to seek for a psychologist(they think it's only for crazy people). In the length of 3 months I feel terrible mood swings and roller coaster feelings until I found an online friend I could talk to everyday that alleviate my loneliness and sometimes my anxiety because I can keep talking to someone non stop to distract my mind. Because of this, I started to think that maybe I am not depressed and maybe it's just me seeking for attention. My online friend kinda agree on this and agree too on my opinion that I could make my mind healthier myself without going to psychologist since it's kinda a waste of money(it's a bit expensive imo) because honestly I am just curious if I'm depressed or if I am just seeking for attention.

&amp;#x200B;

So I really want to understand how important it is to seek for mental help and how to differentiate if it's depression or not

67,"Hello everyone, hope you're have a great day, 
I don't know whom to ask or how to ask this, I'm really glad I can ask this here without feeling anxious about people judging me..

TLDR at the end if someone wants to skip through the details :)

So.., This started last year, times were bad, nothing was going well, I started feeling low and everything seemed to be over, but then a close friend of mine actually helped me get back up, live life better, talked to me, sympathized with me, Basically giving me hope that things would get better :) 

And it did.. kind of, we both got so into each other that we started dating, it was a great time.. even though my parents really hated my friend, but I still fought to be in the relationship.

Now... I don't know how to say this but I feel I have gotten addicted to this feeling of being sympathized... I now need someone all the time whenever I feel low to give me hope and understanding what I'm going through and tell me it's gonna be all right..

Forward 2 years,
My friend whom I was dating for 2 years.. broke up with me.... (Due to family issues and their caste didn't allow dating my caste),

Now fast forward 1 month, I'm starting to get over the feeling of heartbeat..

But the ONLY thing that's stopping me and making me feel the worst feeling possible, I don't have a word for it but it feels helpless, anxious, hopeless all at the same time.. 
Whenever hard time comes, I don't have anyone to sympathize for me.. to tell me it's all going to be good, and so on.. I really don't know what this is, why I am feeling so desperate for someone to give me hope, and now since I don't have anyone to give hope, I feel suicidal sometimes... (I really have a long history of feeling suicidal,.. terrible feeling..) 

All I want to ask here is what is this feeling of needing someone to show hope to you to say that it'll be fine.. and all that, without that I feel hopeless and very very very sad..... 

If that's a thing, then is there any cure for that? I really tried looking up online but couldn't find anything that matches my feelings exactly...

P.S: can't talk to friends.. don't have many... introvert... Also afraid of people judging me :(


TLDR; I feel the need, a deep need during hard times to have someone show sympathy for me, to tell me that hard times will pass, I feel so weak and give up on life easily.. without someone telling me that hard times will pass.. what's this feeling? What do I feel this? Is there a cure? 

I hope this is the right place to ask.. I really don't know what to do 😭 

Thanks for your time

68,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember, and... it kinda helps to imagine it as a 'person'. For example, i imagine my mental illness as a malicious, four legged demon made up of black, spikey crystals, with a long snout and red, glowing eyes.

And boooy does it help to separate it from myself! I am no longer struggling against myself, i no longer just scramble to hold a loose scaffolding together. I am fighting something, and each success is a victory not for normalcy, but AGAINST the bad things. And when i really think in to depression, i used to have a hard time climbing out, but now, i just close my eyes, imagine the demon and see them as an outside force i was not resisting, so i take up the fight. And it helps me struggle everyday

The thing is... is this a positive approach or will it have consequences later on i am not foreseeing?

69,"Hello, I just want to ask anyone who has ever experienced taking Sertraline/Zoloft since it was my first time being on antidepressants.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder last June 2018. My psychiatrist staryed me on Zoloft 50mg for 9 days, then it went up to 100mg, and now it's currently 150mg. 

I only saw my pschiatrist twice: (1) was when I went for consultation and diagnosis after my family doctor referred me and (2) on August, after 2 months of taking my medication. He asked me how I was and just continued to prescribe me my medication. Until now, I wasn't asked to go for another up-to-date check-up.

When I was taking my medication, the first few days were all nothing but the side effects until my body adpated to it. I've been sleeping too much or too little at random times of the day. I've been taking it consistently and still don't feel any change despite the change of dosage. Therapy, of course, was reccommended for the medication to be more effective. The thing is, I think therapy is a rip-off and I'm not comfortable talking to a therapist.

I stopped taking Zoloft on October when I started working for a late night shift, since my managers were giving comments about me being sleepy and sluggish which slows down my performance at work. I know it's wrong without the go signal from my psychiatrist. I experienced brain zaps for a period of two weeks and I just tried to tolerate whatever I am feeling. I didn't ask my family doctor or my psychiatrist if there's alternative for Zoloft that will make me less sleepy.

Ironically, though, I started overthinking less compared to when I was on medication. Or maybe it was just me who is trying to convince myself that I got better.

71,"Hi im a 22 year old guy from Portugal.

So i've been in depression medication since i was 16/17 and gradually got better but right now im on one of lowest points in life.

Im a freshmen in college and came to the city im studying at with a lot of expectations.

I lived in a super small village 30km away from the nearest city where i studied since my 5th grade. Since i lived so far away i couldnt go out or do stuff with my friends and at 16 i started to isolate myself playing videogames which i believe is what made me depressed. You know at that age you want to go out and meet new people but i couldnt do it.

I've always been really shy and had social anxiety so i decided that coming to this city would be perfect for me to change, open myself to people and meet a lot of new people. Which didnt happen because i kept being shy and having social anxiety and now i only know people from my class.
To make things worse i fell in love for a girl from my class and i think that i had a really really good chance but right now she doesnt care about me(we're still friends but its just a regular classmates friendship) and i think that she stopped trying because i didnt take actions with the fear of rejection.

So right now im thinking that i should ask my psychatrist for benzos or something like that so that i can overcome my social anxiety.
I dont know if its the best thing to do since i read that benzos give you suicidal behavior and i had/have problems with that without even taking benzos.
But on the other side i really feel the need to meet new people, mainly girls because i've never been in a real relationship and that crushes me inside.

I know its a long text and i really appreciate if you read the whole thing.

What is your advice?

72,"Hey,
I met my girlfriend a few years back at work (large company) and as she was a couple of years younger than me, I helped her out quite a bit. We got friendly and had a good friendship.

A year ago I broke up with my ex, and I started a new relationship with this girl from work. It’s been brilliant.

My girlfriend has worked hard and has also been quite fortunate and seems to have had senior management help her out at various stages. As a result, she is now an equivalent paygrade to me.

I shouldn’t be down about my position - I have a good salary, a nice home, a wonderful girlfriend, and good health and fitness.

Unfortunately though, I am feeling lower than ever. This has continued for months. My career has taken a recent dip and everyday I am exposed to seeing my girlfriend attend important meetings, be very busy, and finish late. I recently took up a new role within the company but it’s slow starting.
It’s pathetic I know, but I am terrified by the possibility of her jumping to the next pay grade before me. I am now trying to work extremely hard to make sure I get the promotion first, but it seems very unhealthy to be that competitive.
I really don’t know what to do or how to get out of this. I have spoken with her about it at length. She can’t understand what I am saying. She says she never judges me, would never think she is ‘better than me’ etc. She does not care about work the same way I do (or at least never says that she does), and I feel so jealous of how things have fallen for her.

I continue to lose sleep over this. I am doing awful things like checking her calendar and seeing her meetings and wallowing in self despair. When she checks her work phone I go into a negative spiral.
It’s pathetic to type but it’s the truth and I don’t know how to get out of it.

I am in my second session of CBT and am hopeful it will help but if you can offer any other advice please do.

Thank you.",17Jan2019,1
73,"I am a 37F, wife and mother, who was diagnosed with ADHD at 15yo. I had one glorious high functioning month on Ritalin, and my mother never bothered to refill the prescription. Then, in my 20's in college a doctor put me on Adderrall, which made me feel ""high"" so I quit after two weeks (my therapist now thinks I wasn't ""high"" I was just thinking clearly and probably happy for the first time in my life and didn't realize the difference).

I recently have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and generalized anxiety disorder which she suspects I have had since I was young (I had a v traumatic upbringing). I was shocked as I am high functioning, have a graduate degree and successful career and family life. My therapist explained that I have simply not ""noticed"" because I think it is my ""normal"". 

My ADHD and GAD has started disrupting my life, and my depression has caused me to withdraw from life and family and friends. I just thought I was tired, and didn't notice it until my husband pointed out I am in bed by 7pm every night, and hadn't been out with friends in six months. 

Anyways, I've finally accepted my diagnoses after months of apprehension, and am seeing a psychiatrist to get put on medication. I don't want to go in blindly, and want to be prepared for what she may recommend for me prescription wise? Simple Google searches bring me many results, but I'd like to know some first hand feedback on medications people take for people ""like me"". ",17Jan2019,1
74,"Sorry this is a bit of an essay I've tried to split it into sections if you don't wanna read it all. I'm basically posting here because I'm at the end of my fucking tether and sometimes I feel like the only way i'm going to get any help is if I just try to kill myself. I've never been diagnosed with anything despite seeing the doctors for many years, and my father says I shouldn't pathologise everything but I would really just like to know what I'm working with, you know? I feel like my mood really fluctuates over a month, loosely following my menstrual cycle but i have quite an irregular one so I'm not sure it's just that. For a few weeks I'll feel generally really good, lots of energy and optimistic but with some not great days scattered around, and then for a few weeks I'll be having suicide ideations, sleep for hours and hours, cry a lot. I'm crying a lot these days anyway. I have family history of stuff, my father was a alcoholic most of his life and still struggles mentally but he  was raped when he was a boy at school and I've not had anything really terrible like that happen to me. I saw my parents arguing a lot when I was growing up and my dad drunk though.

 I've had some shit things happen to me recently, I cheated on my boyfriend (was trying to do an open relationship thing but he wasn't happy with it so I was a shit head) and we finally broke up 2 weeks ago after getting back together again for a few months after it happened.  It was not only the cheating, that was the finally nail in the coffin of my relationship really, what helped break it down really was that I would talk about my problems all the time with my boyfriend, I tried not to dump too much on him but it would just come out sometimes and I needed to speak to someone about it, then he wouldn't want to talk to me about his problems because he knew I was not feeling great. 

My cat is dying and I can't afford her treatment so I have to give her up to a shelter. I have absolutely no money, and I'm still trying to find some shitty job to do. I'm waiting to go back to uni in September, but have done no work. I did very badly at uni for second year, I feel like I shouldn't be there but I have to get a degree because I want to get a better job. I feel really shit about the art I make and I can't find the motivation or inspiration to do anything. I hate drawing now, but it's the only thing I can do. My tutor last year was incredibly demoralising and unhelpful.

I have been to several counselors before and have never found them to be much help, just someone to moan at and not have anything fixed, however the last one at my uni suggested to me to get a Dyslexia test and lo and behold I actually do have dyslexia. I don't know how bad because I can't understand my test results really and I need someone to go through them with me, but in bad moments my brain likes to tell me that it's not that bad, also when talking about it with other people they say 'Oh i have that too! i forget things sometimes!', when I'm over here just numbly accepting for the millionth time when I'm half an hour late for a hospital appointment and have shown up at the wrong place. 

I did some online cbt stuff last year for several months and it was somewhat helpful, and I don't feel quite as terrified at the prospect of going back to uni, but it doesn't help the shit feelings day to day. A few months ago when I had to take a bus to work it went by my uni and I had a massive freak out on the bus. I was sobbing and remembering all the shit times I had there, and that I still had to go back and finish it.

I had been taking antidepressants (Citalopram) for the past three years with a break of less than a year, but I came off them because they weren't really doing anything. It seemed they'd work a while at first but just fade. My boyfriend at the time said that I actually seemed happier generally when I cam off them, though that may have been because I came off them after the events in summer.

Should I write out everything that has been happening to me for a GP? I really just don't fucking know what to do anymore. I feel shit about myself and that there isn't any point in doing anything. I just want to be able to do shit and not feel like a piece of crap.  But then there's a voice in my head telling me that i'm just being pathetic, and in any case noone can really help me I have to help myself, but I literally just don't know what to do anymore because nothing seems to be changing, as time goes on it just gets worse.

77,"Hi, just wanted to see if anybody else had experienced something like this before. As a short summary;

* F/22 
* Had a job waitressing, got promoted to manager, got along well with boss &amp; co workers 
* Was good at the job and actively complimented by people higher up, really helped build up self esteem and confidence as well as social interactions 
* Got a job in a professional field through an internship programme as a first step towards getting a career 
* after I got through the initial anxiety of being in a new environment, eventually build up skills and worked my ass off to get noticed, eventually felt well liked and appreciated by team fell like i fit in well came out of my shell and felt comfortable and confident around others 
* A lot of team members left, new people joined and a new manager was introduced 
* manager was a good friend of mine at the time, all of a sudden started treating me like a stranger and speaking down to me referring to me as ""kid"" and just refused to treat me as an equal even in our personal time even though we talked all the time previously (keep in mind i had all the respect for them getting new responsibilities and did not try to take advantage of us being friends previously and spoke to them very politely just like any manager within work) 
* new people joined the team who were more experienced and a lot of my responsibilities were given to them, leaving me with no or very little work
* over time made me feel useless and a bit worthless, reduced all of my opportunities for progression 
* left out of many meetings further made me feel isolated, confidence was dropping now so I was finding it hard to make up the time with anybody else as I was getting nervous and anxious talking to people 
* add another couple of months, at that point my anxiety transferred into personal life, find it hard to talk to people and socialise and constantly criticise myself in my head during a conversations with others for not being funny or engaging enough
* Came back into my demons, fell back into depression started self harming for the first time again since my teens 

Trying to pull myself back together now, with hopefully a new job in the horizon but still confidence levels and self esteem are extremely low. As someone who was previously chatty and enjoyed being social to not be able to do that again because i literally feel as if my speech was taken away from me I can't really get a break even by going out or to bars or clubs. When talking to people the only thing I can think about is how much they are better than me in every way and how much of a piece of shit I am in the comparison. Mental health is very poor and really scared of the new job in case I fuck up or won't fit in.

80,"20M, Ohio, United States 

I'm about to have a therapy session in a few hours that I'm 99% sure will end up with me being hospitalized. There are a few problems with this. 

1) I'm addicted to Kratom. I've been through the withdrawal already once before - I'm absolutely not going to try to get help if I'd have to do that again. 

2) I'm addicted to alcohol. My only withdrawal symptoms at the moment are insomnia and severe cravings. This will make kratom withdrawal that much worse. 

3) I'm prescribed a number of medications which help immensely when I'm not addicted to alcohol: effexor, wellbutrin, and vyvanse. Vyvanse helps with my emotional regulation more than anything, however, if I'm going through withdrawal, itd probably make me even more anxious and intensify my insomnia. Would I be allowed to abstain from it?

I already have lots of people telling me to get therapy. I appreciate where their heart is at. 

But I really just feel like maybe I need some understanding and kindness about this issue. Like maybe so I dont feel like a disgusting monster. Like how can I have the courage to go talk to some doctor about this if I feel like I am so disgusting.

But anyway, here is my real issue. 

I am in love with my mom. I mean in a romantic way.

Like I have grown up in an environment that seems a bit unusual. See my mom dates all these rough characters and has been most of my life. Like she cycles through all these dudes, and I cant even keep track of it. She usually dates more than one guy at a time. Like I have gotten to where I try not even to notice who it is this week, because I know they will be gone soon. Its almost like a blur to me.

My mom has been the only consistent good thing in my whole life. Like she has always been good to me and make big sacrifices to take care of me. 

She usually works two jobs, and its like she almost never get any rest.

I am turning 16 next year and all i want to do is to quit school and get a full time job so i can help take care of her for a change.. Then maybe she wont need to work so much and we can be together more.

I guess the sexual desires come partly from the fact that I have grown up hearing her having sex all the time. Like the place we live right now, her bed is right up against the wall, so like when she is having sex, not only can i hear the whole thing, but like her bed bangs on my wall and i can kind of even feel it in my bed sometimes. But like even without that, she is real loud and yelling and she say like all this stuff i can hear, it leaves not much to the imagination sometimes.

What I really wish for deep inside is i could become the man in her life. 

I know this is all wrong, and i ain't ever going to be that for her.. but its what i feel deep inside and its what i daydream about all the time. 

And some people tell me not to think this way about hell, but i feel like i an going to hell.. like i deserve it, because i know i am messed up but i dont want my feelings to change

i have always been feeling like a sense of doom about my future my whole life. i dont know why that is exactly, but i think everyone else sees me that way too

i guess i just want to be able to say all this and not have someone tell me i am a bad person, even though i know i really am

85,"Hi, I’m new to this subreddit so I thought I would contribute a little bit!

We all know how the conditions of your environment can play a role in mental illness development, now my question is, is there really a LARGE contributing factor to the onset of mental illness?
I’ve heard of cases where people have experienced a traumatic event(s) and then there was a sudden onset of a mental disorder.

I’ve been doing some research and I’ve noticed how many disorders are in DSM 5 (the word “a lot” is not a strong enough description) and I was kind of wondering, while going along with the theory of trauma as the cause of onset, what really determines what disorder that they end up with? I’ve seen people who have experienced great deals of trauma and they’re not phased by it and then there are some people who end up developing personality disorders from that trauma like ASPD, BPD, or even Psychotic disorders. Are there any determining factors to that? Like are they just genetically predisposed to those specific disorders?

I should point out this wasn't enough to keep me from picking my nose or jizzing to a Sears catalogue, I was living a very normal life and it never impeded my day-to-day activities. I did try to say the wittiest lines so I'd at least look clever to whoever was watching, even if I was alone. This habit has stirred many a pot in my marriage, but there's a good chance it'd happen even without this delusion.

This was a constant in my life until my early 20's when I began to travel more and realize the magnitude of such a conspiracy. The Truman Show helped as I realized I wasn't the only one who could imagine such a scenario - but I also worried 'they' used it to throw me off their trail. It took awhile before I was able to let go of the notion and stop living like I was on TV.  Eventually coincidences were just that and I didn't think anyone was reading my mind. I knew it was ludicrous, impossible, nonsensical. 

It's been several years since I've struggled with these thoughts. A few nights ago I watched Bandersnatch. The relevant plot point is (mild spoiler) the protagonist realizes the viewer is controlling his actions. It's not completely related to what I went through but it was enough that these delusions have popped up again. I wonder if my wife is really going to work or she's with a bunch of lab coats watching monitors as I type this. Are they watching my kids too, or will they one day be let in on the secret? And is everything in my life being choreographed to reach some epic conclusion? 

I know it's dumb. I know it's impossible. Yet even as I type this there's a nagging thought I'm pushing through, urging me to not tell anyone about this because they will deceive me and the charade will continue. 

I'd really like to put an end to this. My biggest fear is this getting out of hand; I'll end up so far down a rabbit hole I'll become a recluse or worse. I could easily become a conspiracy nut, though I also have enough rationale to recognize when we're placing patterns on things that don't actually connect to one another. 

Anyways, I feel foolish posting this. I know it's stupid. Yet I can't drop it, and the fact that I haven't thought about it for years and now I can't get it out of my mind again is troublesome.",17Jan2019,1

98,"I love my girlfriend very much. We're coming up on 365 days together, and we're basically joined at the hip. She knows all my habits and flaws, and I know hers, and I'm sure I want a life with her.

Since we started dating, I've known that she suffers from severe anxiety and depression (and I actually got her to stop cutting), both of which she takes medication for.

Or, I should say, she did. She's been off her meds for close to two months, and the effects are starting to show in very ugly ways. Objectively, she's experienced a ton of growth; her grades have improved a ton, she's been drawing and painting a lot more and even gotten some commissions, and she eats a little better and has lost weight since we met.

Despite this, I'll find her in a fantastic mood when we talk in the morning and within the next half a day or so, the next time I see her I could swear she's about two seconds from ending her own life.

Right now we're working on getting her meds back (the process could be expedited if her parents gave a shit) but right now I'm doing my best to keep her stable. It should be noted that I have a genetic predisposition to emotional instability myself and when things get too bad with her it takes its toll on my own mental state.

So backstory, I have severe PTSD driven anxiety that can be triggered by even seemingly small things. I also have depression which isn’t as bad, but lately has been a lot worse. On top of that I have chronic pain that really disrupts my sleeping. 

Problem: I’m am STRUGGLING to get out of bed in the morning. I set several alarms, but I just can’t get out of bed. I have thought about using those apps that force you to do puzzles or math equations before it turns off, but those have loud noises and scare people awake. If I set my phone too far away, I have to use a way louder sound that scares me awake or it doesn’t wake me. I can’t do that or I’m anxious all day. I also can’t have my boyfriend wake me up because my anxiety causes excessive irritability and that would be directed at him every morning. I’m at the end of my rope. I’m exhausted, I’m showing up late to work everyday, and I’m so frustrated with myself because no matter how much I say “I’m going to get out of bed in the morning” I just physically can’t remove myself until it is so late that I panic about being late to work and jump out of bed. Every. Morning. I need help, ideas, solutions, anything. Once I’m out of bed, I’m fine, but getting out of bed is quite literally the hardest thing for me to do each day.

I notice someone walking in with their finger pressed against their mouth and holding back words.

We talk the rest of the night and I love this person. I ask questions “what are somethings you hate people assume?” “how do you wish people acted around you”.

I proceed to tell him I’m here in solidarity not charity. We grew up the same getting abused physically and mentally he then kicked a beer bottle on the floor in anger and I ask if i can give him a hug. He asked for my number so we can talk whenever he needs it.

I was sleeping every moment I could. I wasn’t enjoying any of my favorite things anymore. I felt worthless and numb. I remember when, at my lowest points, I felt lost and unsure of where to turn.

115," I'll try and streamline this a relationship to some key points. I loved my girlfriend, more than I should have. I supported her in every which way I could (She has depression and dyslexia, I myself have ADHD and severe abandonment issues), she was the moon and stars and the entire universe to me. One night she was having a break down which she usually did (Because I didn't show her enough attention or any of the slew of excuses she had), she had been cutting herself in the bathroom as usual and would only talk to me until I apologised to her for her cutting herself or she would threaten me with suicide, grab my pills and try to O/D. One night I chose not to engage, I sat and played my favorite game to ignore the abuse, in an emotional frenzy she came up behind me and pulled me off my chair by my hair, I retaliated out of sheer panic and struck her on the nose once. She went into uncontrollable tears. Fast forward a few months later. She has told everyone; her therapist, family, friends, teachers you name it, that I beat her. I am not an abusive person, I have never had to ever raise a hand to any previous lovers, I know in my heart it is wrong to abuse people. She absolutely could not see that ever and still does not to this day. The next time I came over I wasnt comfortable with her friends as they all hated me, I wanted to leave, she refused to let me go and held onto my belongings so I couldnt get them, I tried to pry her away from them and she started to hit me hard, she pushed me onto the bed and tried to attack me, I then hit her a couple times to get her to just get off me on the side of the leg. She eventually let go. This wasn't the end of it, we paused for a few moments I tried to gain my breath again and retreat to the other end of the room away from her, she came at me flailing her around around and narrowly missing my face, ripping my shirt to pieces and I had to get out of there I was so damn scared I didn't even want to be in this situation, when she missed my face by a hair I had enough and hit her in the face causing her nose to bleed over her jumper. I was mortified, I had never had someone I loved so much try her best to start a fight with me. I'm a big guy and she's 6ft but she legitimately scared me to the point violence was my only option, I still feel immense regret to this day and guilt.

Who doesn't even care if I don't talk to him anymore? Who is blaming me for stuff I didn't do? ''. The day before christmas she told me she wanted to end it and she didn't want to date for a while. I check her twitter, she had been sending flirtatious stuff with the guy she told me not to worry about for about a month and a half. Now here I am a month down the line almost, my confidence completely shattered, overweight, riddled with guilt and generally defeated with life. I'm trying to seek help but they have put me on a waiting list. I honestly loved her more than anything in the world, but after 1 year and 3 months she decided it was better to find something new. I don't blame her, but she put almost all the blame of the relationship on me and even all of her self mutilation to this day she still blames me for it and said that I wouldn't have done that if you just hugged me.. I don't know, I don't know what I'm going to do with my fucked up brain anymore.

119,"Whatever I'm writing following this sentence is a thought that has been generated and evolved over a long period of time. 
Humans, as an individual species, have faced completely new issues to deal with every other century. Issues that seem way off the capabilities of the brain to imagine. The past two centuries saw us humans coming across new diseases that emerged out of nowhere in the human race. These diseases caused widespread fatalities before the humans were able to develop themselves to cure these diseases with the growing field of medicine. However, the more important part of this journey was the change in the thinking of the people of that era, from the day they came across the disease for the first time to the day when they were equipped with enough technology to handle it. This journey was a long period and in some cases even lasted for periods wherein the generations changed. And during this transition period, many people had to face the consequences of the disease because the society wasn't ready enough to help them with it. However insensitive it may sound, but these fatalities were inevitable because bringing about a radical change, both in terms of science and thought process in the mind of society comprising of millions of people, does take a lot of time. This time period was a dark phase where the residents of the period had to face the consequences without any catch. But after this transitional period, things did change and humans altogether were able to overcome the challenge faced by their older generations. Just like any such major issue or disease, the 21st-century humans have come across a new issue, the issue of mental illnesses. It might be wrong to call it new but since a major number of people are coming up and addressing their mental health in the past decade, it seems fairly new. People from all corners of the world have acknowledged these mental health issues but still, the majority of the world population is yet to comprehend the existence of such illnesses in a realistic manner. I personally have met a lot of people who've been facing severe anxiety issues and depression and are trying every other way to deal with it but are unable to heal themselves. People are committing suicides, getting involved in self-harm and other disturbing activities to deal with it because living a life with an unstable mind is really difficult of a task. My point is that I believe we, the current generation, have set up their clocks of the transition period. Mental illnesses are the challenge that our society as a whole has to deal with during this transition period. Every member of the society will have to transform themselves in order to understand the legitimacy of such illnesses and then develop ourselves to cure them. There will be fatalities, people will shatter emotionally and there will be pressure on everyone just like it has been in the past but this transition period will end after a certain time, leaving the human generation capable of overcoming mental illnesses. This doesn't mean that we just cross our arms and wait for time to do the work for us. The point is that every member of the society needs to understand and work for the cause without expecting quick and positive results. We might not even see a positive slope in the mental health charts of the affected community till the end of our lifetime but that shouldn't stop us from working for that bigger goal. I strongly believe that we all together will overcome this challenge in a timescale that might be larger than our lifetime, but we will get better. ",17Jan2019,1

123,"I have always had depression and anxiety, and every so often I compare myself to others. It can get sort of bothersome when I do this though (ever so rarely) with close friends, my SO, or even family members. It's like if the person is getting ahead when it comes to self-improvement where I lack I get anxious or worried that I will be behind them or left behind or something? Not like physically because I know who my lifelong loved ones are, and family will always be family.

An more recent example is how I know multiple people who move up in their jobs. They seem to be more easy-going and even at times timid like me, but they are improving their leadership skills. It feels like to me that it's just to meet society's (and better yet corporate's) expectations. I feel like each person changes in a way that it would make them gravitate away from me, and thus leading to loneliness I can already naturally feel with my depression in the first place.

I know deep down that they won't think less of me, and that I feel supportive more than anything. But when I am going through these phases, how do I cope and improve my feelings? I feel like it's not the sort of thing I can explain to anyone because I feel selfish and that I can't justify feeling this way.

Whenever I look up this subject the key words are always depression, suffering, suicidal, anxiety, dealing with, etc. and I gotta be honest, I can’t relate to this at all. A couple of years ago I derealized and I finally felt free. I’ve never been happier. Sure I have ups and downs in life but on average I’m just happy. 

I’ve always had an interest in science as a child and studied it both professionally and as a hobby. Maybe my understanding of quantum mechanics has influenced and maybe triggered my perception of this unreal world. I don’t know. All I know is that I love this feeling. Knowing the world is a meaningless mess of chaotic fakery has brought meaning to my life, as ironic as that sounds. Like a lucid dream, I am free to do anything I want. 

I’m just not sure I’m understanding what people don’t enjoy about it. An unreal world appears to me more beautiful than a real one.

127,"Hi there. I won’t make this long. About 2 years ago I smoked a joint and had a completely horrific experience. It induced OCD intrusive thoughts, Depersonalization, major anxiety and depression and I had a full blown psychotic episode for about a week or more where I didn’t leave my darkened room for about a week. These mental dilemmas continued for over a year and now I’m pretty much over the intrusive thoughts except for the occasional episode. Anyway I’ve heard how weed can worsen underlying physiological problems like psychosis and schizophrenia and become permanent so I never tried to smoke again. However recently there’s so much talk about this 100% CBD oil and how it doesn’t make you react negatively mentally. It just calms you, and I’m wondering if it would be safe to try it? Anyway any honest advice/opinions would be appreciated! Thanks!  ",17Jan2019,1
128,"So, I've been severely ill with my paranoia, depression, anxiety and psychosis for the past few months after a traumatic breakup and severe amounts of heartbreak. I've tried everything - doing extra hard work in therapy, taking my meds, even tried CBD. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

But (without anyone judging me, I have awful paranoia that scares me sharing my problems with people), I shared a blunt with a close friend, and it's the best I've felt in months - if not years. But this worries me - I'm not a person who takes drugs a lot, I like weed but I've only really just done it properly. It's not really my life style choice, and the fact it's the only thing that makes me feel good is worrying because I don't have access to a medical supply, and nor does my country give it out for anxiety yet - just physical disabilities. So I'm in a shitty pickle right now. I feel so good and free but I can't use the one thing that helps me feel good medicinally everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys do? CBD doesn't do anything for me at all, and I use pure 100% CBD. ",17Jan2019,1
129,"Whenever I do something stupid or embarrassing, I keep thinking about it all day. It's killing me. I can't make the mental switch and focus on something else, even if I try.

130,"No one I've met seems to understand what this is. It started when I was a child, exactly when my childhood abuse ramped up considerably. I'd be doing my thing, and suddenly, I'm hit by this... psychological asteroid. I feel like the ground dropped beneath my feet, I'm in a void. The closest I can describe is this: like being punched in the chest, but mentally. When you're hit with so much physical force that you can't even register the pain, you can't even scream, the wind is knocked out of you, and you're just clawing for breath? It's like that, but mentally.  It goes away after a minute or two but it's the most excruciating minutes of my life. 

I know what it's like to feel suicidal. Joy slowly seeps away from life, everything seems dull and tedious, and the thought of going on is simply exhausting. It's hard to hang onto any memory that still evokes joy in those moments, usually after devastating fights that have killed my self worth. (Is there a name for this feeling btw?) It's similar to how I'd feel every time my mother visited: like walking in a nuclear wasteland, everything turned to white concrete dust, I'm just a husk, a corpse that's already dead, and I just want to lie down and rest. 

But this... mental punch thing I just described, it's different. The nuclear wasteland feeling, or the joy seeping out of life feeling, I can feel that it's bad. But this feeling... I'm not numb, so I know how terrible it is, but it's too much pain to process so I'm gasping for breath. My therapist told me it might be something like dissociation but I'm not sure what that even means. Is this common? 

Also, if I have these kinds of feelings, it feels like depressive states - but I was prescribed Lexapro to help with anxiety attacks (it's diarrhea, cold sweat, shaking, feeling sick, etc. right?) when my mom calls. Wouldn't the lexapro make it worse? 

Thanks for reading my barrage of questions. I'd appreciate any insight.

131,"alright first off i have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADD and ODD but i just think there is more to it. I feel there is so much more wrong with me because my head is just a big jumble of thoughts. Constantly i have suicidal thoughts (which my parents and doctor knows about) but they think it has decreased a little bit and honestly they have but now they are back more often. The suicidal thoughts yeah suck but i wont give into them  because i cannot hurt my family like that and i am too scared to go through with it. I feel like in the future i will though. Like just say whatever and let go. Im turning 18 this year and that makes everything worse. Past that i feel so messed up i DO NOT know myself enough to explain myself. There are times when i feel numb. It is the worst feeling ever but lately i havent been feeling that and been going straight to suicidal thoughts which i wish i felt numb instead. My mind is like always screaming at me i can never focus on anything because im trapped in my head. I never try anymore in school well i have good grades in all but one class but still i cant escape my mind. I can be fine one minute and for no reason want to die or have terrible anxiety. I feel as if i am not connected with the world. Like one time i was walking with my friends in school and i was so deep in my head i forgot where i was. I always feel as if i was someone else for a second and then back to like feeling again. Now i want to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital but i just cant have my parents worry more than they do and also the cost. I also need a therapist but i feel since my parents found like nobody that covered their insurance that they gave up. They ask me randomly if i think i still need to talk to someone and each time i say yes. Because i really do. I feel like it would help a lot talking about what is going on in my head instead of keeping it to myself and trapped inside.",17Jan2019,1
132,"This is my first ever full on post on reddit and I'm only doing it because I'm at my wits end. Apologies if it ends up sounding convoluted.

I'm a fairly outgoing and successful young adult who has been dealing with anxiety for most of my life. When I was younger it really hindered me, and it still does but I've gotten pretty good at the whole ""fake it til you make it"" thing. I've recently gotten back to university after taking a two-year break to take care of my mother. After she passed away I didn't let it affect me much because the rest of my immediate family was already struggling, and I felt like I had to be there for them. Now that I'm back on my own, moving on with my life, I feel like I'm finally falling apart and I don't know what to do about it. I live by myself and struggle sharing my issues with other people, as it makes me feel weak and like a burden. I'm aware I'm a very stubborn person, and know a part of my problem stems from not ever seeking help or sharing my problems with anyone.

A little bit before going back home to take care of my mother I did end up going to a counselling service, but I felt like it didn't do me any good. I'm weary of seeking medical help again, because last time it ended up doing more harm than good and it ended up triggering severe depression and suicidal thought. I'm not at that point right now, but I don't think I've ever been this anxious. I've been sleeping 1-2 hours a night if that. I second-guess everything I do. Every noise I hear startles me. I forget to eat. The semester has barely begun and I already feel it creeping up to affect my academic performance, which just makes me more anxious. Any advice on how to deal with this or how to try and start opening up about it to other people is most welcome.

Again, sorry if this sounds confusing or if this is just not the place for this kind of post. I just didn't know where to post it. Thank you.",17Jan2019,1

134,"Hey everybody, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't post here much. I do have depression and anxiety and I have for some time. It's been a struggle that has affected my ability to build healthy relationships, finish my education and caused issues with jobs that I've held. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last couple of years, I realized I needed professional help and started to see a therapist regularly. In the last year I started taking medication. Throughout all of that, my dad was the one person I could always talk to. About anything. Almost at any time of the day. He didn't always offer the best advice, but I know he listened and cared. And did his best. In November of last year, he passed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't expected. It was abrupt. And nearly two months later, I'm still struggling. I know grief is a process. It takes time and it gets easier over time (or so they say). But it doesn't feel like that to me. Early December, I actually felt like I was doing better. Then the holidays hit and away went that feeling. And now mid January, I'm really struggling with it again. It feels like its happening all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I think of all the times I called him or talked with him when I got home from work. How he would stop by my store and buy something from me and we'd grab lunch together. How I could share something I found interesting with him and he'd listen. I want to work and stay busy with school, but it's hard. I feel like half of me is absent minded from both, thinking about my dad and how I'll never see him, hear him, or hug him again.  I miss him so much and I feel so lost and scared without him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess besides sharing those feelings and how therapeutic that is in and of itself.... is there any advice fellow readers have to help? Anybody who went through something similar and anything you did to help alleviate the pain? The fear? The sense of uncertainty and self doubt? I just hate feeling this way and I just miss him so very much.",17Jan2019,1

136,"So I finally went to a GP after years of struggling with my anxiety/depression. She prescribed me some anti-depressants. Originally I told my parents I was only going cause I just felt sick, but after I hadn’t been getting much sleep the first few nights my Mum asked what the doctor actually said and what she gave me to take, I told her I couldn’t tell her...Dad called later and I finally ended up telling him that they ‘are just for stress’ but he still wants to talk face to face.

What should I say that will make them not see it as such a bad thing, to make them not think I’m actually depressed etc. Although I’ve made it to the stage where I’ve gone to get help, I’m certainly not ready to tell my parents the full extent or for them to treat me differently because of it.",17Jan2019,1
