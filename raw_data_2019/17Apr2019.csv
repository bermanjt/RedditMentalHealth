0,"Hi, this is my first reddit post, but I hope it all works out!
(I'm a 17 year old girl from the UK.)
So right before Christmas, my mum was taken to the hospital in the middle of the night. We later found out she had had a ruptured aneurysm in her brain.
She spent the next month or so in hospital, in ICU and different wards (meaning she was in over Christmas and New Years)
She's now home, and is doing a lot better, with no lasting damage. 

So at the time I missed a lot of school, putting me behind, causing my previously A* grades to fall. This really made me feel down and not good enough.  
Also, I've had a lot of trouble sleeping since, not sleeping until 5 am some nights before school. This has also lead me to be sick quite a lot, when people think it's because I stay up late, when it's not on purpose. 
I find myself doing something random but can't stop thinking about random things that happened while my mum was in hospital, being alone in the house, being at the hospital, the sadness of Christmas Day. I just can't stop thinking or being sad about things while I'm doing something completely different. 
I feel like every day is so hard, and everyone is angry or sad all the time. I just feel like I can't be happy these days and I become easily upset or frustrated. 
My school life, friendships and personal health have all been affected and I don't know how to fix any of it or who to talk to about the way I feel. 
Does anyone have any advice?",17Apr2019,1
1,"Hello all, 

I hope you are all having a great week. 

You are all brilliant! Never forget that. 

I want to try end the stigma of talking about Mental Health and have had the idea of talking to people and recording and perhaps posting it on YouTube (with the person's permission.) 

Before you hate on me, 

I recently uploaded a video where I spoke about my suicide attempt and my mental health and to be honest, it has helped me. 

Sharing it to the world can really help. 

Still trying to work out how to do this. Perhaps I could talk to people on discord and screen record it? 

I really want people to be able to share their story and hopefully learn to love themselves? 

You are all important. 
You are all amazing
Never ever let others bring you down.",17Apr2019,1
2,"School isn’t terribly difficult and my daily routine isn’t even that exhausting, but I want to sleep ALL OF THE TIME.  I do school work as needed and go to the rec center every week, but I have no motivation lately and I am ALWAYS tired.  I try going to bed earlier but I still crash at around 3 or 4 and I have no motivation to do my homework or my workouts.  Today I called in sick from work and I took a nap from 11am to 3:30pm.  I had at least 7 hours of sleep last night, so why am I still tired?  I find it so difficult to function when I’m exhausted and even though I’m falling behind in classwork and everything I still can’t seem to motivate myself.  Does anyone have advice?  I need to start doing my homework and studying more(along with having more motivation to complete my workouts because it has been so difficult lately).",17Apr2019,1
3,"So I’m currently 21 and my girlfriend is 18. She suffers from horrible depression and anxiety and she’s pretty sure she has Borderline Personality Disorder. We’ve been trying to get through things without doctors but she’s been getting worse and she really wants to see a specialist. Only issue is, we’re having a really hard time getting ahold of any of the “specialists” local to us. All I’m asking is maybe there’s people here with similar experiences that know how to point us in the right direction? Where should we start and who do we see?",17Apr2019,1
4,"I need help understanding what is wrong with me and/or if I should see a therapist. This is what is worrying me:

*I am very insecure; I really dont like much about my self
*I can be very impulsive (I came out as bi without any thought)
*I have a hard time loving people. Very few people can cause me to feel love and when they do there is no logical reason. I want to be able to love people it hurts.
*I change my lifestyle and values on a near daily basis
*I sometimes engage in self-destructive behaviours. What I mean is I have and still occasionally cut myself. I also will steal five or six granola bars from the pantry and eat that as well as my entire lunch and a large bag of chips I bought before an hour had passed since I ate cereal for breakfast.
*My emotions don't always make sense. They are really dramatic and sometimes straight up innapropriate for the situation. I dont realize this til later.
*I can have some weird sense of belief that others are out against me and\or talking about me
*I am oftentimes bored or just empty inside. The only times I am happy are when I eat or sleep.
*I want to have friends but I don't do anything about it.

Thank you!",17Apr2019,1

6,"Hello all,

I'm trying to get advice and more importantly help. For the vast majority of my life I've had this problem with myself and other people where I would get increasingly frustrated with others and legitimately feel that they are shoving me around either, physically and then later on life, emotionally. It would get to the point where I would find myself wishing, or imagining harm on others, and sometimes, regrettably losing my cool and lashing out on them because I've felt they have pushed me around or I was tired of people taking advantage of me, and respecting my boundaries when I've repeated stated them. I have never developed the tools to deal with people, especially people who have power over me, like say, my parents, or the bosses son (an old ""friend"" ), in a more nuanced way.  I was either extremely passive to the point where people would take that as a sign to shove me around, or I would erupt in anger and they would temporarily stop and try again some time in the future. I really want to change. I'm tired of being angry with people, I am ashamed of my thoughts and actions. I'm tired of being in situations where people, especially those close to me push me around.  I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. How do I deal with this in a constructive way. I am at my wit's end.",17Apr2019,1
7,I started going to group therapy for changing my thinking from worst case anxiety.

Hello everyone, just a nobody here. Recently I have been really struggling with depression and wanting my life to end. I've had thoughts of suicide but I wished it would just happen by chance. I wish I would go to sleep and just not wake up the next morning. It just hurt. It continues to hurt too much. It hurts to live. A week ago today, my girlfriend and a crisis hotline saved my life. I've been alone many times in my life, and I've had suicidal thoughts many times in my life but if by chance I had them both at the same time last week, I would not be here. I would with certainty had ended my life that night. The next morning I was embarrassed and ashamed, I felt regret. That's something many people don't get the next day....the regret. Because they're gone. They ended it all and didn't give themselves one more day. We all just need that thing that makes us live to see that next morning. Then the next. Then the next.
Not everyone is as lucky as I was to have such an amazing girlfriend who fell on the floor with me and just stroked my back as I laid crying....or that parent, husband, mentor or neighbor, no, we are not all that lucky. Even then we cannot all be there ALL the time, at that very moment when it hits. We can ALL however make use of these crisis hotlines that allow you to communicate through text messages and the suicide hotline that's always there. After using this service I committed 200hrs to help volunteer. This brought me so much joy and just waiting on this kept me going for the week to come. I think I may have actually found my purpose, Reddit! I think I want to help people like me. It brings me joy. I went to my City Hall to ask about starting a support group and my local park or church and I was denier. I guess I need to start a non profit? My city literally has NO resources for people in need / mental health / depression / anxiety / LGBT community. Nothing. As a lesbian woman who lives in a pretty big city it is so fucked up to me that people here have no where to get help! People may take it for granted because it's a service they may never need but, but what if they did one day? I need help. I need help to find how to start a mental health department in my city. Start a support group where we can meet and you can have a friend. Someone you can text and say ""hey, I'm not feeling so well, can we text? Can I call you? Can you listen?"" Please, if you know a non profit organization / foundationon ANYTHING that can help me send me the info. I am in CA. I think we can make it to tomorrow together! 

TL;DR - Sucidal girl has made it another day thanks to the help of crisis hotlines. I am inspired and I need your help to star a meet up, a mental health Dept in my city and a support group to meet weekly. Please help me. I need you. We need you. We all need each other and I am willing to do work! Please provide me any info for any non profit organization or foundation that can help me set this up. I've been running around in circles calling my local city call.",17Apr2019,2

10,"I am the oldest sister (18F) and my younger sister is (16f). She is a sophomore in high school while I am in college. Growing up, she has been selfish, cruel and manipulative to my parents. She would yell, cry and be mean to them at the smallest things. It’s gotten to a point where my parents just take the easy way out and give everything to her. 

In fact, at this moment, she is calling and screaming at my mom for someone taking away her white sugar... (yes, sugar.)

All my relatives and friends have seen her manipulative behavior. We all know she has some sort of mental illness but being in an Asian family, my parents refuse to get her any help because of the stigma. I’ve been told that she will grow out of this for years because she is just a teenager. However, I truly do not believe this will be the case. She will be dependent on my parents and continue to abuse them. She clings onto them back and forth depending on who she’s mad at. She always wants to know where they are and doesn’t want them to leave her alone. 

Over the years, I’ve grown increasingly intolerant of her behavior which has made me stick up for my parents. She has no empathy for others and only cares about herself. She truly turns every situation and makes herself the victim. My relationship is now strained with her as she has grown up because of this. It has gotten to a point where she has made me have anxiety whenever she causes tension and problems in the family. My parents urge me to never yell back at her. I just want them to not be controlled by their own daughter. 

I love my sister but I wish she was different. I wish she got help. And I can’t do anything about it. She is a sociopath. 

What do I do?",17Apr2019,2
11,Been pretty paranoid lately. Go on and off my medz for 5 days at a time. Was able to get to the hospital today for a blood test. Alot of mistakes made by the nurses. Just got back from seeing my psychiatrist. It was ok. I need more sleep. My dad triggers my paranoia.,17Apr2019,1

I feel so ashamed in feeling this way. I feel weak, and very alone. I am scared to talk to anyone in my family, my friends, or my boyfriend because I will just feel like a burden on everyone. They get mad at me when I bring up my depression. They find it ridiculous I could ever possibly feel this way. But right now I feel like nothing I do or will do is worth it. 

If anyone reads this, I am really struggling and do not know what do to. I’m alone and do not know who to talk to.",17Apr2019,1
13,"My (25F) mom (60F) has been addicted to drugs since I was in 4th grade. My parents have always fought for as long as I can remember. But they have no idea how to live without each other. I remember she would inject dilaudid into her thighs and try to lock the door but I knew what she was doing because I’d look throw the lock. I’m not sure how that worked, but it did. She was only sober for her pregnancy with my little brother. She has been in and out of rehab every 3-4 years. When I was in 7th grade she went for the first time. She was gone for about 3 months. I was 13-14, taking care of my 2.5 year old brother. We’ve always been ok financially, never had to really worry. When I was in high school it happened again and she went away for a month and then did a program. It happened again when I first started college. And then she got really sick. Having seizures all the time and it turned out she had an autoimmune disease of her brain. She had to get chemo and has been sick for nearly 5 years now. Last year, around this time, she was caught using heroin. She went into an extensive in patient program, then did out patient. Through the last about 7 years, my mom has said she wants to die more times than I can count. My parents have been fighting worse than ever, they found out they are losing our house (On going battle from when she first got sick with her seizures and she couldn’t work anymore). She’s been planning my graduation party, telling me how proud she is. And then today she couldn’t do it anymore. She told my aunt she wanted to die today. And she snorted 6 bags of heroin. My dad was there. He called 911. And all her sisters... they all came over. And I left. I can’t do it anymore. I don’t know what to do.. or what to say.. how to feel.. I can’t do this. I’ve been told my family is trash and trying so hard to think otherwise. I’m embarrassed. I’m ashamed. I’m humiliated.

16,"Hi, I was diagnosed with major depression when I was 12, when I was 17 they added on anxiety, and just a couple years ago I was also diagnosed with PTSD. 

I’ve been on this medication that has really helped (relative to how I am without it I suppose) and I’ve been on it for about 2 and a half years now. I’m *okay* without it in a sense that my mental illnesses aren’t going to make me lose my shit without them... I just isolate myself and get into this foggy haze where I feel pretty hopeless and can’t get myself out of bed. 
I can’t seem to snap out of it. 

I guess I’m writing this because I’m afraid of going into that state of mind where everything just seems dark. I recently quit drinking alcohol, I quit smoking cigarettes 10 months ago, I quit eating meat 6 months ago... and I’m relatively healthy. I just have problems remembering to take my god damn medication in the morning. 

The problem is that I’m on a pretty high dose of the medication I’m on. If I were to take a double dose in one day it would make me really sick. So if I can’t remember whether or not I’ve taken it, I just don’t take it and I won’t know until about 5-6pm whether I’ve taken it or not because of its half-life and how I feel in relation to the dose I’m on. By then I feel like it’s too late to take it. 

It sucks because then I just spend the rest of my day in a haze. Everyone tells me to use those damn pill boxes but I tried that and I’d still manage to fuck it up somehow. 

I hate being dependent on this shit. I hate pills. I just know I have to take them if I want to feel “normal” but I’m just really sick of it. I wish I wasn’t cursed with this shit.  

I guess I just needed to get that off my chest.",17Apr2019,1

This haunts me througout everything I do and it is honestly starting to take it's toll. I also get angry randomly at the most insignificant things, I never lash out about it though it's always kept inside but I'm seething with rage just because my rommmate spoke as an example.  Occasionally I will spend hours just sitting in my living room not doing anything just sitting motionless on the couch staring into the abyss that is the white wall in front of me. All of this has been compounding onto one another and is quite swiftly starting to deteriarate my mental state to the point where I can't stabd to be around anyone but I fear being alone so it makes it worse. I'm not suicidal to the point where I would actually act on the thoughts I have, but I do have those thoughts usually followed by me shaking in fear after realising what Ive been contemplating.

19,"I (20F) suspect I have anxiety but I can’t get a checkup on that because, surprise surprise, I can’t get medical attention because of my parents’, mainly my dad’s, pride issue. I have to resort to crosschecking what I have with people with anxiety and hope that I’m wrong. 

Recently, I feel like I’ve been getting really anxious for no apparent reason at all. I can be sitting down and doing nothing and I would feel like someone is gonna kidnap me. I can’t go to the kitchen and turn on all the lights at night because the windows are kinda weird and will show your reflection on the window at night when you turn the lights on instead of showing you what’s outside. I get anxious when that happens because I feel like someone somewhere is spying on me. 

There’s a resident dog at the gym I frequent in and I feel really happy playing with the dog. I brought up the issue of getting a dog for the sake of everyone at the house (I also suspect my mom might have anxiety but it could also be because of the constant stress she’s under from her work). My dad countered by saying that he hates dogs and have eaten dogs before but now that he’s dead religious, he can only say that he will shoot the dog with his paintball gun and not do anything more than that. His other counter, when I say that I’ll just have the pupper in my room and that said pupper won’t bother him if he’s there, he says that the caring cost is too much for them to foot, yet he can afford his near expensive hobby no problem. 

My question here is “Are there other solutions that might give off the same effects as playing with a dog?” I’ve read somewhere that playing with a dog helps calm someone down from their anxiety, and I’ve played with dogs before, in secret, so I know that it works for me. I’m just wondering if there’s other temporary alternatives to this.",17Apr2019,1

Or having my little cousins see me in a casket at my funeral. That part makes it seem selfish, but this is my life, and I’m definitely not “living it to the fullest”.

23,"I've been feeling off for a bit now. I was at a low and suicidal late last year but have made improvements. I still however feel like maybe there is an actual issue with me mentally. As far as I know I've never been tested for ADHD, add, aspergers, etc. 

A couple old friends used to joke about how they thought I had undiagnosed Aspergers... I'm very hyper active and my mind works faster than I can keep up. It's as if in a thought I am reminded of something else that elaborates to more wonder and curiosity. I am fairly creative and I find at times this can be a big benefit creatively... But not all the time. 

I did go to the ER end of last year as I was feeling suicidal but I was released once I spoke to a psychiatrist. The whole experience was terrifying as being held against my will and forced out of my clothes and any remaining comfort I had. So, naturally I didn't open up when given the opportunity with a psychiatrist in the ER. Instead I play it off like I was just being dramatic. It's an easy out. People want to believe it. 

My biggest problem is my ability to blend. I have never been tested for anxiety but when in the ER the crisis lady made a comment about the way I reacted to a situation by puking, breathing troubles.. it opened my eyes to maybe one of these feelings I'm getting and having a hard time grasping/ understanding/ controlling is anxiety. Now the first sentence has to tie in or else this paragraph would elaborate my previous possible add claim. (Which it kind of is now as I'm almost procrastinating writing more as maybe this is anxiety happening now? I will leave this here as I think it may help make sense of my points?(maybe?)) I have always been pegged as a social butterfly and outgoing and charismatic and so on... Yet I've always felt sick when in even small groups. I've always seemingly instinctively hidden these feelings and suppressed them for so long. I find  I'm most comfortable in 1 on 1 situations. If I wasn't so good at blending in I feel like maybe I would have gotten help long ago. 

I find I often have small conversations with myself. Consciously. It's almost as if my conscious itself won't rest. It wants to be heard all the time. It wants to be involved in any way possible. It wants to take control. I feel like if somehow I stop trying I will actually lose control of myself.

Now that I'm not suicidal and in a better state than when I was in the ER I've considered making an appointment with a primary doctor to have tests done... But how? How do I ask? What do I ask?",17Apr2019,1

I honestly think I forgot what it feels like to be happy and am only now feeling truly happy for the first time since I was 17 (I am now 21). The thing is, i’m anxious about feeling happy again. It’s almost like I don’t know how to handle it. I also am not really sure who I am without my depression. I’m trying to just relax and enjoy being happy again but it’s really confusing to have to sort out what parts of me were caused by my depression. For the longest time I identified as a depressed person and now that i’m feeling better I don’t really know how to act or who to be. It’s exciting and terrifying all at once.

25,"I posted this on r/advice as well,

This is really stressing me out. I’ve always thought that I’m just childish/weird. And I mean this in a serious way, sometimes I just do things that’s just too cringe when I look back. I would also say some random stuff/talk to myself when I’m walking to my workplace. Even sometimes when there’s people around I cant help but to say weird things. When I realised, I pretend that I was just humming to a song lol.

I can’t stop pacing when I’m at home, and worst of all I feel like I often cut people off mid sentence. It’s also hard for me to focus during meetings at work, briefing from my supervisor, or even simply reading an article. My mind literally wanders from minute to minute.

Until recently, my boss told me that he noticed my short attention span and understands ADHD, since his brother has it. I never thought I had ADHD because I know how easy everyone self-diagnose themselves saying they have ADHD. But after working for a few weeks, I started to think that my inability to focus might really affect my career.

So now I have a couple of questions:
1. How likely is it for me to have ADHD as an adult?
2. If you think I’m just childish/no ADHD, can you recommend me some ways to improve myself?
3. Is there any over the counter medicine that helps focus?

27,"  I've posted on here a couple times before. My dad just got out of a mental hospital about four days ago, for the second time in two months. I think he has type 1 bipolar and the type where he believes he's superhuman and enlightened spiritually. They diagnosed him with bipolar 3 times in his life, but I don't know the specifics right now. I don't have the energy to explain all the things he's done but I'll just really quickly summarize it. He went into a mental hospital 2 months ago doing similar things but didn't seem as dangerous that time, this episode 3 weeks ago was significantly worse because in Jan they didn't put him on anti psychotics.

&amp;#x200B;

Before things got really bad 3 weeks ago my mom was trying to get him put into a mental hospital again desperately but they didn't think he was violent or a danger so they wouldn't put him back in

Things dad did 3 weeks ago

* Take dog off leash again and began running thru traffic and into horse farms and other things, and my mom had to go track him down again
* Bring home dead snakes, bricks
* Started buying things manically and spent about $2000 in about three days

Some backstory with this one, my mom has been having gallbladder issues, and he began thinking there was some sort of demon making her sick. Last episode in Jan my mom's ex-husband took the seven guns that my dad had in our house. 

* At some point early in the morning he decided that he needed to kill my mom because he thought there was a demon inside her, and didn't know the guns had been removed, because he went into the gun closet, and unlocked it and it was left open. What I believe happened at this point is that, during all this, he felt everything was a sign and I assume he probably felt like it was a sign that because there were no guns in the gun closet that he shouldn't kill her. He got a wooden stick he had shaved into a blunt sword for our next door neighbors kids to play with and woke her up at 8 am and told her he was divorcing her and that she had to leave. 
* He was hitting the stick on his hand and had been smoking and, stood over her and flicked ashes into her face and told her she was a horrible person and the cause of all his problems and that he hated her and that they were getting a divorce and that she had to leave the house. (the house is wholly in my mom's name), but she cooperated and told him she was calling the police, and he followed her downstairs and she sat down because she was feeling awful and they waited for the police to arrive. He told her she either had a demon in her or was a lizard person and as the cops arrived, within about 3 minutes apparently he was arrested and sent to our local hospital to find a bed
* In that hospital, he had to be sedated because he was running around asking nurses to kiss him and walking into other patients rooms and poking them and talking to them and apparently got violent and started attacking male nurses and it took 8 men to sedate him. He apparently was also laughing and talking about the fact that my mom had a demon inside her and that as soon as he got out he was going to go kill her.

  After being taken to a mental hospital and getting anti psychotics he apparently didn't want to get a divorce because then he'd be homeless as soon as he was kicked out of the mental hospital, and didn't want to kill her. He got sent home about a week ago and has to do a day program thing for 2 weeks, which is good I guess

  He's blaming this all on my mom and me and saying that it's her fault that he has to be on meds and that he was put into a hospital and bragging about how many people it took to sedate him. He is entirely resistant to treatment and the only reason hes taking his anti psychotics medicine is because it's a shot and he can't not take it. The day he got out of the hospital he had to go to court because of the incident in January where he walked onto an elementary school and screamed at the owners of the school and refused to leave, and all of this is my mom's and my fault.

  Ever since he came home he's been very bitter and refuses to take responsibility for any of his actions and I just feel entirely fed up with him. I'm fifteen currently and I got Lyme disease when I was five, and ever since then I've had really bad health issues and was taken out of school about three years ago because I wasn't healthy enough to attend. 

  I feel intense anger and I just want him out of the house and to never see him again. He says a lot of really hurtful things but I would say the worst is him just telling me to kill myself because I'm useless and don't matter and that I'm a brat. I just don't want to deal with this kind of stuff anymore and I don't think he's worth trying for. I don't have any power in this situation and I can't leave. I hate that he'll scream at me that I'm faking being sick until I just give in and say I'm a liar to just not be yelled at anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy and I just feel like breaking everything in the house. I just want him to leave but my mom doesn't want to get divorced because she doesn't know if we'd have to sell everything to give him half of everything. She's told me that the only time he's been ""stable"" was before I was born and when I was a baby, then apparently I became too much work and he just started resenting me. I don't know how to let go of my anger and hatred and I just wish he'd never be in the house and be homeless and rot and die somewhere. I don't care about him or his well being in anyway because I don't feel like he cares about mine and, maybe that's not accurate but I feel like if he cared about me he wouldn't purposely say these things to me and then just laugh at me when I start crying or say that it really hurts my feelings. How do other people deal with stuff like this? I feel like I'm breaking under the stress and anger I feel and I can't express that because my mom is busy with being the only person working and recovering from her gallbladder issue and dealing with taking care of my dad. I would really love advice if anyone could give it. I really have no idea how to accept this and not just be livid

I've got thing going my way lately but i don't feel like i have the right to feel joy.

 Right now the only reason i didn't blow my head up is because of my girlfriend. Her and my car payment were the only thing that kept me from ending it i had planned to kill myself by getting into an accident with my car on my 21 birthday 2 weeks after my last car payment. 

So my dad wouldn't have to pay for it nor my tombstone. Now my car is gone, i still got 2ks to repay and my girlfriend has her own mental issues. Which makes her question if she's good enough for me. I'm young and my panic attacks, my temper failure are back stronger then ever.

I feel like shit. I let people walk over me. I cry to sleep every night. People don't help me because all they see is a behemoth of a human being. I'm fucking done i'm crying like pussy right now. I need to open up. But i feel jammed.

I'm done i can't take it any longer i regret moving away. I don't have any friend, people don't have the same mentality from the rural areas i feel so weak. I want to punch my face into oblivion right now. I'm dirt poor, 300 miles away from home, i moved out expecting irrealistic things and it's eating my will to live the more i live there but i don't want to leave because my girlfriend is adament about finiahing her school in the capital. I've got nowhere to go.

And to add to the stress her dad is actively hating on me telling her that i am a piece of shit and so much other beautiful thing that i won't translate. I fear that if she leave me i won't have anything to hold to i've got a nephew but he's 300 miles away and is not 4 months i've only hold him for like 15 min i'm such a fucking looser. I'm not good i need help but i'm too proud to reach out nobody knows of my failed tentative of taking my life

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been going through some of a rough time recently and was wondering if anyone had any tips and tricks to help.

&amp;#x200B;

**BACK STORY:** Recently I got diagnosed with extreme anxiety which has led to a large increase of a small physical problem. This is in combination to my initial diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Originally I used to be on atenolol for anxiety when I needed it to prevent/stop a panic attack, Im also on 90mg of Duloxetine for depression and 10mg melatonin for depression and insomnia. But with my recent diagnosis the doctors have changed it so I take 50mg of Atenolol daily. Now this has caused some problems which I was wondering if anyone had tips for/

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Atenolol has caused me to lose all filters both physical and verbal/mental. I used to be a perfect employe at work and never got in trouble and ever since the increase of my atenolol I started saying my mind to customers and am now on my last warning before being fired. On the physical side I now start to get really sexual with my gf in public which she hates since its not the right time or place and sadly I don't have control and its making my depression worse. To add to this with out the ability to stop anything I have ended up attempting suicide multiple times and failing. The last major thing my atenolol is doing is causing me to not care anymore. I had a friend almost frame me for plagiarism at uni, I've studied my life away to get where I am and I almost lost it all and I didnt care, my girlfriend threatened to leave me, I didn't care, work threatened to fire me, I didn't care. I had a knife to my carotid artery... I didn't care (i'm a med student so I know human anatomy to well).

&amp;#x200B;

41,"My partner is experiencing something which I personally have a good deal of experience with. We both have depression, and he complains of an inability to release or express his emotions in any way because he feels like he can’t even bring it to that level of emotion where he could cry or let it out. I used to have the same problem, so bad that I couldn’t even talk about emotional things. I would clam up and it wouldn’t come out. However, over years of therapy, I became better and better at getting past this road block that he is unfortunately still having problems with. Sadly, I don’t have any valuable insights on how to actively work towards getting him past this, because it was mostly something which happened in the background of my therapy without noticing. 

How can I help him? Does anyone know of any good techniques, or anything which I can further read to grasp this problem so we can work through this together?

42,"TL;DR:  
I was diagnosed with benign rolandic epilepsy as a child but grew out of it. I've been taking bupropion for depression and I'm paranoid about it. Do you think this is safe?  


Hey /r/mentalhealth, 

When I was a child I had two seizures where I lost my ability to speak / move but never lost consciousness. After the second seizure I was diagnosed with benign rolandic epilepsy, and started taking tegratol. After a few years I was taken off of the tegratol and have been seizure free since. I ""grew out of"" the epilepsy, which is common with the type I had.

A year or so ago I started taking bupropion for depression. I was really worried about this as everyone says not to take this medication if you have a history of epilepsy, but my psychologist insisted that since I grew out of my benign rolandic epilepsy I should be okay. The doses started as 150mg XR and titrated up to 300mg XR. 

This worked great and I never had a seizure during the 6 months I used the medication, but then I slipped up and forgot to take the medication for a few days. When I realized I forgot to take the medication I was worried that it had been too long since the last time I took it, and taking a 300mg XR dose would be too much. I kept putting off taking the dose because I was nervous, but I was also embarrassed to ask my psychologist for more 150mg pills so I could re-titrate back up.

Months passed without me taking bupropion, and I started to think I no longer needed it. However eventually I started to feel the way I did before the medication. I talked to my psychologist and they said that if I wanted to I could restart the medication, going straight back to 300mg XR with no titration. They said since I handled it well the first time I should be fine.  


This is my second day after restarting the medication, and during lecture I had a really strong deja vu feeling. Then, I thought about how I have deja vu quite often lately, maybe twice a month. I decided to look up ""frequent deja vu"" and found that it can be caused by partial seizures. I already felt really weird at this point but after I read that I felt a buzzing in my head and a tingling sensation in my mouth / on my lips. It reminded my of what it was like to not be able to speak during a seizure as a child, but not as intense (I could talk just fine, with some stumbling). This continued for about 20 minutes, I was zoning out during lecture, focussing / testing different areas of my forehead / mouth, and feeling extremely buzzy (I'm sure that doesn't make sense, but idk what else to describe the feeling with).  


I can't tell if I was just panicking because I was anxious, or if I was experiencing the effects of a partial seizure and the panic was justified.  


After lecture I had a really hard time working on problems with a study group for another 10 minutes or so, but once I got into the problems all of the feelings I've been describing went away and I've been fine since (it's been about 7 hours since then).  


My main issue is what I should do tomorrow.  
Do you think this medication is safe for people with a history of benign rolandic epilepsy?  
Is it safe for me to stop taking the medication tomorrow?  
If it is safe, should I do that?

Obviously I will contact my psychologist about all of this, but I'd like a group of people to talk about this with as well.  


Thanks",17Apr2019,1
43,I was broken up with like idk how long anymore and I don’t care but I feel very Suicidal. I’m only 14. But I don’t care anymore.

Now that they broke up with me it destroyed me. I’m good at hiding my emotions around my parents but when I’m alone I’m so sad. Always crying. I have self harmed before. My mom saw the scar. She told me to stop. I said I will. But I kept doing it. I wanted to go to therapy. But I didn’t want to talk about it with her. I have social anxiety and that adds to the problems.

I don’t want to live anymore. If I die tomorrow I wouldn’t care. Can anyone give me advice?,17Apr2019,0

I CAN NOT get rid of them. the thought causes anxiety. I want to get rid of them because they take up space but I can't.

45,"I am wondering if there have been any professional scientific studies relating to the specific experience of being part of the generation (born between 1980-1990ish) that can say that their formative years occurred before the advent of the internet? I am personally struggling with the wealth and bombardment of information I have to process on a daily basis now vs the large swath of my life that was spent with relatively little exposure to this kind of influx and I would like to know if there are any mental health professionals that have done studies on or specialize in ways of dealing with this. Sometimes I feel as though it's more than I can bear, being exposed to so much constantly. I know the appropriate course of action would be to disconnect and not engage for a while (and ultimately not at all) but unfortunately in my line of work I can't remain relevant unless I do.

Only people who were with me during this time know that I really had a bad time handling things. To the outside world, there was nothing wrong with my life! But in reality, I was panicking over the smallest thing, getting angry for no reason, crying every second day, feeling claustrophobic, completely detaching myself from things that used to interest me, sleeping more than usual, feeling tired and acting like nothing is wrong with me. I had been constantly putting on weight and that added to the depression.  


In the end, I ended up burning bridges in my professional and personal life trying to save myself from falling further into depression. Moving away from what made me panic has helped me improve my mental health. I still have a long way to go but I am happier than before.",17Apr2019,9

Names have been changed 

Hebosexual is for men and women attracted to boys or girls aged 11-18 


Writing is slightly out of order and maybe needs some corrections but that’s because of my learning disabilities 


Hey guys it’s Luke here sorry about the long post today 


And I just wanted to make this a regular series that I will make just so I can use this as a way to vent and talk about my feelings and desires rather than unhealthy bottling it up inside. Where do I begin? Oh yes my attraction to girls aged 11-18 and why I don’t think it’s necessarily a problem. Honestly I think a lot more people are attracted to young boys or girls that are in there teenage years as they have adult features (sexually) however they are young and uncorrupted by years of sex and drugs. For me I always thought about it as a freshness thing, these girls haven’t been with like 10+ guys and so in turn they aren’t super gross and they’re bodies aren’t heavily used. I have always been attracted to the mindset and personality of teenaged girls as yes they are crazy and moody at times they are just easier to talk to and I enjoy they’re company in most cases, and I never feel immature around them like how I do with some adult women. I also cannot stand most adult women as they are selfish especially those who are in their twenties and only care about themselves and their needs. Teenage girls on the other hand are free spirited and often a lot of fun to talk to or just to chill with. My girlfriend who is 16 at the time of this writing ( I am 21 almost 22 and the age of consent in Canada is 16 ) is very sweet and she is a lot of fun to hang out with, and mentally I feel as if we are the same in maturity so it does not bother me at all. My girlfriend and I are very much in love however we face some backlash from friends and her family as I think they think I’m perverted but I do love the sex I get with her I do have strong feelings for her. Now I have also have had this problem with girls that have had more than three sexual partners as I see the vagina after that being not as fresh and used while for example the last two girls I dated were both virgins and I didn’t have to have a vagina that was previously heavily used by other males. I have met older girls that wanted to date me and they have been quiet sexually open with me and they have been with 10 or more guys and it grosses me out every time to a point no matter of how good looking they are or how nice they are I loose attraction out of grossness. I’m weird honestly I like girls who are dirty and kinda freaky but only if they are like that with me, I generally try to avoid slutty women as again I don’t like high mileage pussy. Now your probably asking about the term hebosexuality and I know it sounds dumb and I am conservative on this whole gender issue however I feel this one needs it’s own special identity as it is a straight attraction to the opposite sex however your just attracted to the teenage or pre teen version of the opposite sex. I also feel ( as I have stated before ) that I feel like that this is a sexual identity and or preference as I am mostly attracted to teenaged girls and when I picture the perfect woman or I am talking about sex with my guy friends I think of a 15 or 16 year old girl  not  some big busty 40 something milf. However like being gay before it was more widely accepted by society I must hide this part of me, not because I am personally ashamed or guilted by it, rather it’s because of the backlash I could face from peers and people in my community and I could potentially loose friends and it could affect my career. I think it’s horrible that I have to hide almost like a vampire in the shadows with this part of me, it’s terrible that I have to worry about what people think about my attraction in life, and honestly I have made personal peace with it I just have to try to change the minds of people around me because as I have stated I am not a bad person, most of you reading this would probably really like me but again you just really don’t like what I am attracted to. Again what made me realize also this was a sexuality as I stated before in the previous post, was that I never realized anything was wrong with my sexuality and my attraction until it was pointed out when I was late 18 or 19 by freinds who thought it was weird that I was still attracted to grade 9 girls in my school. Now here’s a question for anybody who disagrees with me, what am I supposed to do about this attraction I have? Just try to ignore it? force my self to live a life I can’t truly like? Be with women I feel no desire or attraction to? Or would you rather me be alone and miserable? I would prefer to live this life as it’s completely consensual as I have stated I have never and I will never force girls into sex and honestly at times they are more horny than I am, and I don’t think I will change just because you think it’s wrong, this is my life, these are my choices and your gonna just have to respect it. Now to anybody reading this who has similar feelings to me , you are not alone there is many of us out there however too many people hide it and force themselves into lives they don’t want or without proper care or support turn to drugs and alcohol and may even commit sexual crimes ( which I am against ) I always felt so alone on this until I met another and just know to take care of yourself but don’t do anything bad to yourself or others I wish you the best. I think people in my life hav esoteric suspicions about my attraction to teenaged girls but honestly it doesn’t bother me even though they pick fun at me a bit I just ignore it or I deny it which might stop pretty soon. 


Stay tuned for part three I wish you all the very best until next time. 

Feel free to send me messages and constructive criticisms.

49,"A year ago I moved from my hometown to a different state (WI to AZ) with my mom. And it's been really hard. Right before we moved I was diagnosed with T1 Diabetes (it runs in my family and we didn't realize that till I got diagnosed), which messed with me a lot and made me feel like I didn't want to live. I was admitted to the psych ward of my local hospital (in WI) and spent several days there.

Since moving to AZ I've seen two people romantically, one I dated and the other was more casual dating. We didn't call each other bf/gf, but we didn't see anyone else during our time together. I ended things with him a few days ago because I've been really sick since the start of 2019--in the ICU twice for multiple days, lots of ER visits, etc--and it's been very taxing on me mentally. I feel unsafe with myself and like I have to constantly pretend that I'm okay. My mother is also having a very rough time mentally, and I don't wanna put this on her. But the guy I was seeing flat out said that I either choose him or he's gone. And my response was ""I choose me""--which he didn't like at all and hung up on me instantly. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a recommendation for psychologists near Phoenix, AZ? My med doctor is in Wisconsin, and while he's amazing, I can't go up there as often as he wants to see me. And I become an anxious mess on the phone and start crying nearly every time I answer it, so calling him isn't a great option. I guess I would also like some input on where to go from here. I feel like I need to be hospitalized, but every time I'm admitted I panic and become mute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever taken a social media break? Did that help you? How do you manage to stay off of your platforms? I feel like it might help to stop looking at Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, but I don't know. I wish I could just lock down those apps for a week so I can't look at them, but still use my phone in case of an emergency.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thank you.",17Apr2019,3
50,"Hi, my name is Alexandra, I am 19. 

So I feel like this is a silly question to ask although  I don't want to waste a professionals time with my stupid problems when they could be saving someones life.

Now let me give you some of my past. During my school years I was bullied all through and haven't had any real friends or if I did I am too toxic to keep them long term.

Now this is the start of my problems. I feel like my personality is really toxic in which i take things way too far and people can't stand me and yeah. I feel like when I try and change I always go back to that toxic girl, it is like a circle and no matter what I do I cannot win.

Next, I often get suicidal thourghts but i think i'd never act on them, although I do cut every now and then. I always get negative thourghts at wotk about how no one is there for me and how i am worthless then I get thourghts of cutting. As I work in a warehouse this is easy to get away with as i can say i cut myself on a box. People say i do it for attention but idk. 

You can say that I need help because I cut, although I feel like i would waste there time.

This I have no issues with, but what I do have issues with is that we never really got into how I fake my feelings. If I'm supposed to be happy, I pretend to be happy. If something sad happens, I pretend to be sad. Someone dies? Pretend to be sad. I've done this since I was about 5, I noticed first at my bday party where I literally got everything i wanted. My mom busted her ass off, having my cake,all the toys I liked and my friends and cousins all at the party. I feel nothing, like wtf. And my mom ask me if I was alright, I knew right there and then I didn't want to disappoint her. So I proceeded to pretend to be happy the rest of the party. I know then something was up and didn't want anyone to know something was wrong with me. So I've pretty much have faked feelings my whole life. Pretty sure it ruined my first marriage. Didn't feel a thing or miss beat when my ex left me. I've never thought about her since. Didn't get help from a dr until after the divorce.

54," I met my bf through an ex and we immediately connected on a friend level. He told me about his mental health before we got together ( he has paranoid schizophrenia) with was never an issue for me obviously I don't judge people based on anything other than the way they treat me. I am his first girlfriend and things were hard at the beginning he accused me of wanting to be with other guys and he didn't really trust me when he wasn't feeling good. When he was OK he told me he really did love me and he was just going through phsycosis. When we got together I knew nothing about scizophrenia so when he told me he was manic and going through phsycosis I didn't really know what that meant I just knew he was going through a hard time. I chose to deal with the pain of being accused because he is such a good person and I know that he wouldn't lie to me. We fell for each other really quickly and I moved in with him. I was always there to support him and we went through some hard times I think he was in full phsycosis but he told me had been worse. He often thought people were coming to kill him and he said he couldn't deal with the voices and told me they tried to get him to kill himself. I just tried my best to comfort him and he was taking a lot of drugs at the time he told this was because he was manic and because he needed to try and cope with the voices and escape somehow. At the moment things are so much better I have helped him get to a point were we never drink or do drugs and he's taking his medication (I know he doesn't want to be). He doesn't say paranoid things about me or accuse me of anything because I have really proved to him that I am trustworthy.I just find it really hard to help him because I have no idea what it's like. He said he hears malicing voices in his all the time he can never be alone and there always putting paranoid thoughts in his mind. I just can't imagine what that's like. I love him so much he's just the sweetest most honest guy I've ever met his family are lovely and they have all said how much better he's doing since he met me. I just don't know how to give him the proper support and wondered if anyone on here knew anything about this particular mental illness. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

6. I become **sad** or sometimes **mad** because I realize that I didn't do that much - **because I was tired the whole day**
7. While trying to fall asleep, I start to **""Overthink""** about my **low** productivity during the day, in addition to **""Overthink"" about the past and future**

They're fucking *idiots*. Every game they blame the refs for *everything*.

After a while it gets annoying.



But I shouldn't care. These are miserable 20-somethings with a propensity to waste their time engaged in aggressive dominance-games with other random losers on the internet. Why do I care so much? The more I care, the more I become one of those losers.


Why just now the Lightning subreddit is full of crying pissbabies bawling about how they're the biggest embarrasment in the history of sports.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 13. So basically for the past 6 months or so I've been experiencing some bad symptoms. I get overwhelmed with little things really easy, I can't concentrate and I feel kind of sad/empty (a bit hard to describe). These symptoms came after a pretty stressful last year. I used to wake at 5 am everyday, clean and pack school lunches and stuff until 7 am, go to school, come back and clean until around 7 pm at which my dad would come back. We would have dinner, I would do the dishes and then I would do homework, work on activities like language learning and programming (as self improvement) and sleep at around 11 pm - 1 am. Repeat everyday. I kept this up until around September last year, when I was unable to get up early anymore and I started experiencing the symptoms I mentioned before.

I kind of narrowed down my symptoms to either burnout or depression but it seems more like burnout to me? It also seems to have gotten quite a bit better. Any suggestions as to what it is. I'm not really looking for a professional diagnosis just your opinion or a pointer in the right direction.

Love, companionship, fun and that youthful sense of expIoration I'll never get to experience. People I'll never get to know. Memories I'll never get to have. The very thought of missing out has been eating me from the inside. I'm so behind the others that holy fuck it's embarrassing. I don't give a flying fuck if things get better in 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, I want what the others have NOW. I don't want to cope with the fact that I've had a worse life than my peers. I don't want to have a *""just okay""* life at best. It's an uphill battle that I just can't win.

I am my worst enemy, and the only way I can get rid of that enemy is to kill it and make sure that it can never hurt me ever again.

I’m unmedicated, but currently searching for a therapist, so no worries- that’s not the point of my story! 


I work at a hospital on a higher intensity care unit, and about once a week I will have to sit with a patient that is at risk for suicide or self harm. One of the most life changing people I sat with was a girl close to my age that had intended to OD the night before, and she woke up so happy to be alive. While she did some very extreme damage to her organs, she was crying because she was so thankful that she lived to see the next day. She didn’t leave behind her husband, or her friends, or her mom. That was a hard wake up call for me, and made me understand that suicide is not an okay exit for me. To have known that girl was in a place just as or even more so desperate than I have been, and actually went through with that tragic decision. Seeing her so happy to be alive made me realize how important it is to talk to someone when you’re not feeling okay. My job can be stressful, but moments like that remind me that the future is bright, no matter how dark the road you’re currently on.

Not to be melodramatic but I feel like it really will be the end for me if this happens. I'm so scared of killing myself if it turns out this way.

I can't do something I don't want to do in life, it's my greatest fear and it's slowly materialising. Since literally being a little kid I've had a handful of careers I could see myself being happy in or making a difference doing or finding some sort of meaning from and there is zero chance of doing any of them if I fail or get a third. Academia, media work, writing, politics or the civil service. Suppose it's all champagne tastes with beer bottle pockets for me.

I don't want any spiel about ""call the Samaritans"" or ""tell your doctor"". Fighting depression is hard enough as it is without all of my chances in life disappearing in front of me.

And no superficial ""there's still hope!"" unless you really have something to add please, you've no idea how many times you get fed clichés and soundbites when you try and open up for some responses about things like this.

77,"Just wanted some advice on a very sensitive situation. 

I’ve always seen my dad, as most of us do, as a strong well together man.

His dad died 20 yrs ago and his mother around 8, she never got over her husbands death and became lonely isolated and ended up with Alzheimer’s. We had to go and ID her and I held his hand through it. 

Since then he’s been rocky, he drinks every night but I’ve never know any different. He has mood swings but won’t ever admit it. You ask him “hey, alright? Good day?” As general chat, he will be on the defence straight away and ask why am I asking and of course everything is alright. He is very sensitive. He moved from Australia as a kid and hated England when he got here. He was quickly married to my mum at a very young age, however they are an incredible couple. 
When he’s drunk he will reminisce about his old times, he will play lots of old songs which make him very sad. 

He forgets it all in the morning, he is self employed and constantly stresses about money. He has told me about ending it all before but I am not sure if this was him just drunk or what. 
He has a lot of financial pressure, he is constantly worried about getting sick/cancer/dementia. 
He will forget where he has put his phone (daily occurrence) and become very angry with himself and convince himself he has dementia. It is clearly stress more than anything. 

My mum is amazing with him but she too loses patience. He is very insecure but will never admit it. 
He hates going out and spending time with her at social events, however when he is at work he is the most approachable person you’ll ever meet.

I see him going down hill recently and I try to talk to him but he’s always on the defence, no matter what approach or time of day, sober or drunk.

He’s so kind and laid back, he’s the nicest person you’ll meet and would do anything for anyone.

So if you have flashbacks or intrusive anxious thoughts, playing Tetris can be beneficial for symptom relief! I thought about posting an article to back up this claim but I don’t think I need to because you can do a web search and come up with years of research.

Personally, I have begun to experience shorter periods of dissociative episodes daily after I began to play games like Sudoku, Solitaire or Spider, and nonograms or tangrams. My mind stays engaged for long periods after spending 20-30 minutes playing on my phone.

I wasn’t entirely sure how to ask this question as it can be extremely broad, I’m going to do my best to provide you guys with some background to give you a better understanding. (please excuse my punctuation) I understand that the answer to the question at the top is depression but I’m looking for something a little deeper than depression and possibly a way to get over this large obstacle life has put in front of me. 

I’m gonna be straight up I’m not very interesting at all. I never had a whole lot going for me, anxiety runs in my family I’m extremely shy, reserved and introverted I tend to keep to myself. Which you can imagine gets very lonely. I’m not much of a talker either, I’m horrible at small talk and tend to feel awkward talking to someone I don’t know very well/don’t know at all. I’m obsessed with this idea of being different from most people in my generation which I would say I am in some ways. Throughout middle school and most of high school I wasn’t much of a problem people have told me I was mature for my age and I agree with that very strongly in some ways. I’d just like to add that drugs have played a role into who I am today as I started smoking weed in the 7th grade. As of today I’d say I don’t have very many friends people don’t really have much to say about me it seems like, I’m not hated by most people but neither am I liked by most people it seems. I feel as if I’m just here that’s it. I’m not saying I never had friends but most of them I don’t see anymore/don’t talk.

I still haven’t got over that whole situation it hurts me deeply I’ll admit I had serious thoughts about ending my life. I’ve always had thoughts like that. They weren’t as serious as they are now. but I believe that losing this person is what triggered this downward spiral I have gotten myself into. After this break up I turned to drugs mostly weed but later on I ended up turning to other things such as alcohol, xanax, acid, and cocaine. Obviously not all at the same time. I like to look for the best in people I try to be the person you can rely on I try to be real to people, I like to show the female friends that I have/had that not all guys are the same. I’ve made a few friends in the past that originally had thoughts about who I am as a person and they were extremely surprised it seemed like. I’ve been told that I have a good heart and that im lucky to have the people I do around me but I don’t always feel so lucky i spend most of my days in my room cause there seems to be nothing to do(I don’t have a hobby or play sports because I’m just not interested.) I do my best not to judge people i think before I speak most of the time. I like to try and understand others viewpoints on different situations and I’ve even helped others relationship problems I like to think I’m good at giving advice because I have a good understanding on a lot of things along with what I’ve been through but what I don’t understand is how I can help others with things like that but not myself. I like to be the person people don’t feel judged around and are comfortable around I like to be the person that’s there for people as it seems no ones there for me. I say that because that is the way I feel. I care more about others than I do myself. I’ve learned that talking about my problems with a particular close friend who’s been around since middle school doesn’t solve anything for me. Neither does talking to my parents I just don’t see how they are relevant cause they can’t relate to this type thing in my opinion I’ve already tried opening up to them that’s also out of the question. I’ve tried depression medication I’m just gonna say it’s not for me. Neither is any sort of therapy. So here I am.

She had plans to get wasted and slit her wrists a few weeks ago but luckily I blocked her access to the alcohol. This is a very temporary fix, however. I could get authorities involved and probably should but I'm worried that her parents will lash out at her.

And they never ask how I am... it's like my condition is Voldemort, the condition we never name. I feel so isolated and lonely and depressed.

There is one exception though, my wife. But it's become so much like she is my full-time caretaker that our relationship has changed. I need other people to lean on for the sake of our marriage so that my wife and I can get back to being equal partners again.

We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Jake – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.",17Apr2019,4

I am 24 living in the US. I dropped out of college a year ago because I couldn't handle the stress of 3000+ level classes, due to said stress coupled with depression I had to retake classes in my undergrad degree and I was enrolled for 6 years before dropping out. I now have ~$40k in loans, no degree. I am still struggling with my mental health issues at my current job, and I barely make enough money to pay my loan minimums. I have had breakdowns in the past due to my issues and I am afraid that if I have another one I am completely fucked, my work is already suffering and I don't know how I can keep this up. I have seen a doctor for my issues before and I was prescribed antidepressants but all they did was give me an idgaf attitude which helped the depression and anxiety but I was still getting behind on work and ignoring obligations. I think I should go to another doctor but my insurance through work is a joke (literally paid $0.75 from my last doctor visit.

98,"Throwaway here. I am recently married about six months and for the most part it’s been fine. 

But my husband occasionally goes through periods of depression and it’s been difficult for me to navigate and provide support to someone who says he does not need or want my support. 

It may be triggered by one small thing, say a tough day at work, but it often spirals and spreads to all aspects of his life. He will say things like he hates everything, he is just going through the motions of life, doesn’t know who he is or what he is doing on earth, he thinks he sucks at his job, he thinks he is fat but doesn’t have the energy to work out or have sex, doesn’t think he is doing anything right, he isn’t satisfying me, and says he is failing me as husband. 

I don’t think any of this is true, and I tell him so, but it only seems to matter how he feels about himself and his own contributions to our marriage and to his own life. 

I try to support him and encourage him to talk through his issues with me, but he gets really defensive during these times and says he doesn’t want anything from me and to let him work his own shit out. 

I’ve encouraged him to get professional help or just talk to someone but he says therapy is for women or “that won’t work for me” and it’s just the “same old positive-thinking crap” and he doesn’t want to be medicated. Sometimes he says mental health isn’t real and the concept of therapy is fake, and it’s very clearly a defense mechanism. 

It breaks my heart to watch this and feel like nothing I say or do is helping. Eventually he’ll pull himself out of it and we’ll be back to normal. But I feel like I’m losing a lot of time with him and during these periods I feel like I am just his roommate and not his wife.  

How can I support my husband and help him combat this negative self-talk? or should I just give him space?",17Apr2019,2

I'm 14M and for the past three years, I've been obsessed with finding the meaning of life. It started when I read a book about demons and became afraid I was possessed and would go to hell. I made my first suicide attempt and was diagnosed with OCD and MDD. After talking to a doctor, I started reading 'Religion vs. Science' material and became an atheist, but without religion I'm very depressed about life being meaningless.

I'm worried now that I may be psychotic.

I'm socially isolated. I had a few best friends who stopped talking to me after the second time I started threatening suicide. I have several imaginary friends who I just sit and think about in place of real friends.

I'm paranoid. When people are laughing in public, I think they're laughing at me. I see people on their phones and think they might be taking my picture or talking about me. I think my sexually abusive step mom might be watching me with hidden cameras or taking my picture while I'm asleep. I'm very careful of what websites I go on knowing that she could be watching, or the police could have me on some list and arrest me after getting the wrong idea about things I'm interested in. This is all irrational, but I still think it randomly and get scared in the moment.

I feel detached and hyper aware of where other people are around me and what they are doing. It's like there's a compass in my mind that points to them. I get scared if I know where someone is and then they're not where I expect them to be when I turn to face them.

My brain shuts off when I get anxious, and I can't speak. I have a lot of confidence and think I'm okay at verbalizing my thoughts when I'm alone. But when I'm in a stressful situation, I become a completely different person. I become taciturn and detached, and I give a lot of one word answers or try to explain things and fail. I can relate to the schizophrenia symptoms of 'flat affect,' 'poverty of speech,' and 'word salad.' I don't make any sense and people respond to me in condescending ways, which leads to further social isolation.

Also if you have no advice to offer please at least upvote so those who have advice to offer advice do? Sorry if I seem desperate, I just am and really need some advice to deal with this.",17Apr2019,3
113,"not exactly sure where to start with this post but here goes. when i was 18 yrs old i was diagnosed as major depressive paranoid schizophrenia. i did cognitive therapy and meds for few months,i tried work through issues but stopped, not exactly sure why. now i am 39 yrs old and tired of running from my problems, i would like to get help but dont know how.

im so tired of seeing/hearing things that isnt there,being paranoid of everyone/thing,feeling lost,being homeless, depressed, trying to off myself(not feeling this way atm),being jobless,reclusive, failure to myself and family,and many more problems. i did self medicate with drugs/booze for yrs, but last few yrs i stopped it for most part.

sept 2018 i came back to home state to live and mom wanted me with her, she too has mental illness along with other health issues. she was on disability and it was cut off. shes trying get it back but it takes forever. the owners kicked us out of the house she rented for last 4 yrs cause no money to pay. currently we live at her aunts property in a camper only electricity we have is off a drop cord. since 2017 i been bottomed out and it gets deeper. normally i can deal with the voices and stuff normally but couple nights ago it got bad. i heard 1 guy laughing at me and sometimes whistling along with the band, another was playing same 4 notes on guitar, another playing drums just handful of notes. i know cause of dealing with this for many yrs and therapy from past its not real. but its harder to convince myself. i been really bottomed out, anxiety been bad, nerves are shot. when i get like that its a trigger for an episode.

im tired of everything,and want help but not sure how/where to get it. 25 miles away is nearest mental health place(mountain lakes behavioral) i dont have money to pay them for visits or phone service to call them. i been a recluse and hard to be around people to find work. another problem i have is, my mom still thinks of me as i were 20 yrs ago as a drug addict/boozer but i grown a lot since then. even though i only drank a couple times since i been back and she acknowledges im not like i was,she thinks im not trying get help that im trying to find a way to get drugs. other people in family has either been weirded out by actions in past or hurt so they dont want me around them. so only support system i have is mom and her aunt both of who also have mental illness and i dont trust. i dont trust many these days,hard to do.

enough rambling i guess, sorry for wall of text, just a lot going on and dont know how to deal anymore. any suggestions be greatly appreciated. i wish you all the best in all your dealing with.",17Apr2019,2
114,"I don't feel like it's helping seeing him anymore. I've had two instances where I felt worse than before the therapy. It was fine until he had my mother sit there with me, because ""you need to have someone to watch over the progress of your symptoms"". That sounds reasonable, but here's the thing: I'm pretty sure my mother is a narcissist. Every time thereafter, I feel like the focus of the session is about her, not me, since he always take her side. She's always going on about how my depression affects her, about how can she help, how expensive the medication was, how useless my father is, how she's the only one bringing the money to the house; in short how hard it is for her. Those are valid reasons, but I'm the one in therapy not her. Is it wrong to think like that? He even chastises me about how cruel I am to my mother and how I don't care about her feelings, and how I don't take the therapy seriously because everytime my mother rants, I would keep myself busy by fiddling with the nearby blinders coz I do not want to hear the same song and dance from her. I want to have a therapist that would not make me have a family member with me. But I don't know how to change therapists. I'm thinking of just ditching him, fond a new therapist and start fresh. I've never felt he really cared anyway; it's always professional between us, and I did not feel any emotional connection at all.",17Apr2019,3
115,"Hi guys. 

TL;DR: In the space of a few months, my dad died quite suddenly, my girlfriend lost her job, i have no savings, I'm in a lot of debt. I've been pretending to everything that I'm fine so they don't have to worry, but I'm not. I'm struggling with my professional and personal life and I'm in such an incredible amount of stress and I can't see a way out.

Posting this on a throwaway account because to be honest, I'm scared of my partner seeing this and being angry with me for not talking to her about all this. I also apologise in advance for any formatting/spelling issues. I've no idea how long this post might be. i just feel like i need to get everything off my chest so it's probably going to be more like a rambling post. I'm a 28 year old male living in the UK. I don't have a history of mental health issues. i have never had any experience with depression, anxiety or any other mental health issues, but I have also never sought professional help. I've never felt like I needed it before.

I'll just start from the beginning. My stepdad (who I'll just call dad from now on) came into my life 20+ years ago when my family was in a bad way. We lived in a council house and my biological dad had abandoned us and we were about to lose the house and end up homeless. My dad stepped in after only knowing my mom for about 6 months, paid off all the debts and bought the house, moved in and then we were happy families. He wasn't rich by any means. He was working class doing leather work for a car factory. he was just smart with his money and always saved no matter what so he had a good chunk of money in savings. Of course it wasn't always great. We had our arguments just as any family does, but he was genuinely the best thing that ever happened to us.

In late 2018 he was getting the shakes in his arm to the point where he was spilling his coffee when he was picking it up due to his hands shaking so much, and was getting forgetful. The moment we knew he had to go to the doctors was when he drove to the shops, got out of his car and was looking around, only to later find out that he had left his car in the middle of the car park (not in a space) with the engine still running and the door wide open. He had just stopped, got out and went shopping without realising anything was wrong. When he had his doctors appointment, he was sitting in the waiting area and had passed out in his chair and was completely unresponsive. An emergency ambulance was called from the GP's office and he was taken straight into hospital. After a bunch of tests and scans it was revealed that he had Glioblastoma (aka - Brain Cancer) which was really fast growing. This was in late October of 2018. During this time, my dad is admitted to hospital multiple times for at least a week at a time for various reasons due to his cancer. He had been losing the function of his left arm and his left leg. He had described it as being the same as waking up after sleeping on your arm funny and it's gone dead. After just a couple of weeks he couldn't walk on his own any more and needed to use one of those mobility walker frame things, and by Christmas he was completely bed bound. We had converted the downstairs dining room of my moms house into a bedroom for him so he could come home and we ate our last christmas dinner with him all sat on the edge of his bed or on the floor. but I wouldn't change that day for the world.

At around the same time in early December, my girlfriend was let go from her job with no notice. I can go into more details about why that happened if you want, but it's not necessarily relevant here. My immediate panic was that we did not have any savings and I had already been using my credit card to help my mother with things like shopping etc, and to bring my dad a newspaper and some snacks every morning. They didn't NEED me to do any of that as they had plenty of money of their own, I just wanted them to be able to focus on the treatment and not have to worry about anything else. After working out a few things, and cutting back on some unnecessary luxuries like Spotify, Netflix and my personal mobile phone (my boss gave me approval to use my company phone as a personal phone) I was able to make my own salary cover all of our bills and still have just enough money left over for our own shopping. We did end up having to sell a few items to cover us up until my girlfriend found a new job, but the point is that things were tight and the stress of my dads illness, and the stress of my own finances, and the stress of not being able to provide for my mother during this time were all building up. I decided to bottle it up and keep all of this to myself, because at that time there were bigger things to worry about.

In February 2019, my girlfriend was offered a new job. One that paid a bit more than her previous job and she could start straight away. I was so relieved. My first thoughts were ""Great! Now I can start to help my family more once she starts getting paid and can take over some of the bills again"" - We had rushed over to see my dad that evening to tell him the good news. He was so proud of my girlfriend, and didn't hesitate to tell her as much. ""You'll do wonderful things in life"" he would say. ""Didn't I tell you there was nothing to worry about?"" and other things like that. I wish i had his strength. because 12 hours after that conversation, my dad had passed away. It had been just 4 months since his diagnosis, but 4 months was all it took to take him from us. those 4 months were such a roller coaster that I wasn't able to stop and think. We were always so busy with everything that we just didn't have the time for that, and now that it's all over and things have settled down I have nothing but time. I'm struggling to keep busy now. I'm struggling with work, and I'm struggling with home and I'm struggling with debt.

I've tried multiple things to keep myself occupied, from going back to my old hobbies, which i just can't bare to do any more because it feels like I'm wasting my time, so making sure my house is nice and decorated, which feels pointless because it's a rented property. I'm even struggling at work because I can't focus. The moment i have a minute to myself is when the carnival in my head starts. Thoughts of ""you should have done this"", ""you should have said that"", ""what if XYZ"" etc whirling around and around and around in my head. I'm sleeping properly at night, but I'm still constantly tired. I'm getting my normal 8-9 hours, but after getting home from work I feel so drained that I've been falling asleep at random times of the day, but still managing to sleep at night. I've had a constant feeling of empty dread in the put of my stomach for weeks now, and I don't know how to start climbing out of this pit.

I've been wanting to talk to my girlfriend about all of this, but I feel so ridiculously stupid for bringing it all up now. I played it off for that entire time as if it was all fine, and she, and my family relied on me so much to be strong that i don't want to break that image of me for them. I also only see my girlfriend twice a week due to our conflicting work schedules, and i don't want to ruin that short amount of time we have together.

116,"So it's my easter break and I've decided that I'll use the first week for homework, exam preparation and projects and the second week to relax and do nothing. 

When I was younger I always avoided to do anything in the first week because I said 'I'll do  it next week I  have plenty of time' spoiler, I never did anything in those holidays. Procrastinated for 2 weeks straight and regretted it a lot. 
So this year I've decided to turn it around and finish all of my stuff early. 

But despite working (with breaks of course I'm not sitting there for 13 hours straight) I still feel like I'm not getting anything done even though I am????

my main question is why does my brain not acknowledge my work?? 
If anyone relates, what do you do against this feeling?",17Apr2019,2
117,"So backstory, I was in a mentally abusive and financial abusive relationship for almost a year until he decided to break up with me after I called him entitled while he cheated on me, never got a good paying job that forced me to pay for almost all of our dates (even ones he decided to take me out too) and everything else and would talk to girls behind my back.
It left me devastated and so depressed.

Than a month or so later I met a guy who was really sweat and we started dating. It was super rocky, but we made it work until up until now I called it off cus he wanted to talk to his therapist to me cus I just wasn't about wanting to be a big part in his friends life and make an effort (to be fair I know that's not good, but he knew from the beginning. I just lost a lost of interest in trying to meet new people.) 
And when he called me after his therapist apt saying that his therapist said we shouldn't have a serious relationship and that he still wants me to be in his life, I just lost it? I was so mean, I deleted all his photos, called him names to his face and and on fb posts, and just freaked out. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop.

After all that I started cutting again after not doing it for 6ish years.

To make matters worse we planned a trip together to go to Tokyo and Vietnam for 3 weeks and I bought my return ticket to Austin cus that's where he lives, but I live in Oklahoma City. We have to talk about what we are even going to do, but I can stand to look at him with out breaking down crying and getting incredibly angry with myself.

Now I also have my friend who has PTSD and depression texting me that he is going to buy a gun and kill himself.

I have no emotions anymore, I just go through my day, i fake pretend at work, but it's taking a toll on my school/work. I cry a lot.

Today I just removed myself from social media, but no one knows me on here (I hope) and I just don't know any more. I don't know what I'm doing.

I see a therapist tomorrow, I started new medication a week ago for my depressions all of this is happening in a span of like 3 days apart. It will be a week tomorrow when this all happened.

I just wanted to get this off my chest, did I feel like I have no support, my family is no help since they don't understand, I don't want to burden my friends so I haven't really told anyone, I just don't know what to do? I want to throw my phone away and just let everything fix it's self, but I know it won't.",17Apr2019,2

120,"I’m a 16 year old boy and I’ve been feeling very depressed on and off for about 2 years. The other day, my parents found out that I had been smoking weed and it forced me to open up about how I’ve been feeling because my dad said he would call the police on me. I told them about how I’ve been feeling suicidal and struggling with my work (my GCSEs are just weeks away now) and motivation for life in general. I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping and I’m writing this on about 4 hours sleep. In the few days since I told my parents about everything, my dad has really been on my back about work and revision. He’s been trying to wake me up early to do exercise etc. and is doing his best to help me be positive. But he’s also being really unhelpful and causing arguments and a general bad atmosphere in the house as he nags me to revise and forces me by taking my phone and anything else that might distract me even when I’m really struggling. I’m getting good grades at the moment and I didn’t revise for my mock exams and still got 7s,8s and 9s (equivalent to A, A* and A**). My mum, on the other hand, is just upset all the time and treats me like a junkie, when I told them I had only smoked weed like twice. I have smoked it more in order to deal with my constant anxiety and insomnia (as well as just an escape from reality) but I can’t get the courage to tell them the truth after how they reacted. I feel so so guilty for what I’ve put the family through, as there was a similar situation this time last year when I opened up about going through a tough time. Last year I said I was struggling and they were crying and everything and just made me  feel awful about myself, which isn’t really their fault but still hard for me. For this reason, I never told them about how I was feeling until I was forced to with the police threat from dad. I just need some advice on how to deal with all of this as everything feels like 100x worse since I opened up to them.

Edit: also, another thing making me feel guilty is that my dad’s 2 best and closest friends are not doing well medically. One has a couple of months left. So right now, I’m the worst thing for my dad to have to deal with.",17Apr2019,2
121,"Sometimes I just look at others and realize they are either really good at acting normal or really don't have a lot on their mental plate. Even when I was a kid, I've been told ""why can't you just be normal"" by so called ""friends"" and never fit in, people always treat me differently from other peers and I painfully feel how I stick out even when I try my hardest to be as normal and adaptive as possible. But that aside, having to basically come to terms that my mental state won't get better on its own and that meds only make me drugged but distanced from myself, I often wonder if i'll ever know what a life where your biggest worries are your yoga course being cancelled again this month is like. I'd like to be able to be myself and feel somewhat okay, have actual ambitions and just a general sense of ""well theres always some people who may not like me but overall I feel good and loved and confident in my abilities"" which seems like a distant idea as time goes on. When I first had to deal with mental stuff I was like ""oh ok its statistically super likely to just be an episode I'm sure i'll be over soon"" and now its almost been a decade. Whenever I'm around normal people (read: not mental patients) I feel so out of place, but when I'm around people who have mental problems as well it only feels like I'm just hiding from reality. I barely hang onto life as is and I have a strong feeling if I were only hit by a few blows of fate it'd completely sewer any strings attached I have left. I'm in a nirvana right now where I get gov aid for some more time because I'm barel Capable of living let alone working and while trying to occasionally get appointments to find ojt if theres an organic cause. I'm not very hopeful. once the gov aids run out I don't know what ill do. I might lose my sanity fully byhaving to work and be overwhelmed by everything. I never really felt like I was made for life, even as a kid. I doubt it will change at this point. part of me hopes to be hit by as many blows as possible so there will be a substancial contrast and reason for me to rest my mind at ease. I'm just too much of a chicken. at times like these I'm reminded of a quote from an entry in SH2, ""if I'm only better when I'm drugged, then who am I anyway?"" I don't even know what I'm doing here. all these things in our world, none of them can fill the hole. only briefly they take my mind off it at best but in the long run, there isn't anything I'd truly miss. and the things I used to miss are long gone and ripped a part of me away along with it",17Apr2019,3

124,"If you think about it it’s crazy to think that death seems to be the answer when you’re feeling down and depressed. It’s such a crazy concept that something that permanent seems to be the logical choice. I think I am so right when I say it’s an impulsive decision and typically your down to that level (the absolute bottom) when that decision seems logical and correct. When you’re there, literally all you’re thinking about is how do I make this pain and suffering stop? Not thinking about your wife, baby boy, family or friends, all of that is not even in scope of what’s going through your head at that point. I wish I could say it was different but realistically it’s just not. I know for a fact anyone that has committed suicide has thought long and hard about it but ended up taking that next permanent step and went through with it. If you have that decision made it’s hard to turn back when you get to that point and make an immediate impulsive decision, it’s just hard to explain. I knew Paul (a good friend) knew what he was doing but he decided it was the answer to end the unbearable pain he was feeling. Making that decision is the hardest decision anyone can ever make and whenever I hear that word I instantly think what can I do to help. Even though I still struggle with that decision sometimes taking a step back and realizing your being impulsive and look up and think about people in your life and think of just one thing your grateful for. Some of the hardest concepts to grasp and comprehend. Keeping the conversation going and not brushing it under the rug is so incredibly important. Suicide should not be a bad word, it should be something to learn and understand because it’s such a prominent part of many people’s lives. Talking openly about it may save many lives.

Also, the way I speak about suicide today may be different than let’s say tomorrow. When those suicidal thoughts are currently in your head nothing seems clear. All the coping techniques, things that loved ones, friends have said that are supposed to help are out the window. All that’s occupying my head is what can I do to feel better, hence the problems with drugs, use them as a way to escape. One thing that stood out to me from the last Smart group (addiction recovery group) is that someone used drugs to escape the depression because they were to scared to commit suicide. I can totally relate, luckily I didn’t really have access to drugs but when I felt depressed I always thought about Percocet/ Aderoll or Vyvanse and how that could make me feel better. The only problem is what do you do when the high is gone, back to square one. It’s just hard to accept where depression has taken me and my life and everyone associated with me, especially my family. The guilt is something that will never ever go away and is unbearable at times, especially when I’m feeling down and depressed.

Depressed mind and stable mind or two completely different things and have to be addressed in two completely different ways. It’s easy to tell a stable person to not kill themself but saying that to someone depressed takes on a whole different meaning.",17Apr2019,2
125,"Hi guys! This is my first post here. I've booked a therapist appointment for Friday. I've wanted to go for quite a while(a few years maybe), because I had pretty bad panic attacks and was feeling quite depressed. I just couldn't afford it. 

The thing is, I am okay right now. I feel pretty good about my life, but I know I won't have the time or money in the future to go. I still feel like I have some unresolved issues, but I'm sort of coping. Something I would definitely like to discuss about is cigarettes, since I've been a smoker for a while. I've successfully stopped a few times for months, but I feel some emotional attachment does not let me give them up completely. There are definitely things I would like to talk about, but I'm pretty much handling everything right now quite good.

This seems like a weird one and something people may think they want but I feel like it's getting worse. Over a decade ago my cat died when I was around 10 years old, she wasn't even one year old yet, I was devestated and wouldn't eat for days. Ever since then I have been unable to get sad, or at least as sad as I should be. A couple of years later my grandmother got put into a home for dementia and this did make me sad, but not very. Follow on a few years later and she passed away, I hate myself for saying this but it didn't make me sad at all, I pretened to be for my family because they would think I was a horrible person if I didn't. A couple of more years down the line another one of my cats die, I wasn't very sad, I put this down to the fact the cat wouldn't really come near me or my sister as it was scared of people from it's life before we adopted it. Now for the reason I posted this, my personal cat; the brother of the cat that died a decade ago, has just been given a couple of weeks to live. He has been my best friend, he loves people and I couldn't think of a better friend. And I felt nothing. What is wrong with me? It had been like this since my firest cat died.",17Apr2019,4

137,"Gonna start of by saying that I'm in the UK and blessed to have the NHS pay for all my therapy. I'm so grateful for this but confused at the process?

I went to my doctor about intrusive thoughts, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, nightmares and severe depressive episodes... among other things. I was quickly reffered to a counsellor who is going to start me on either CBT or person-centered talking therapy. But they won't diagnose me with anything. Ever.

I'm actually studying mental health now at University and it has brought up my own demons, I can't help but see the correlation between my symptoms and PTSD or cPTSD. I am the kind of person who feels better with ""labels"" as to me personally it feels more real &amp; therefore justifies the feelings. I know this isn't the case for everyone. 

Does anyone with more knowledge or experience in this area know why I won't ever get a diagnosis? Should I push for one, and if so how?",17Apr2019,1
138,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I decided it is enough. I need to tell about my problems to a psychologist. I have been holding in for 10 years. But I feel ashamed and deep down embarrassed. And it won't make it easier I  have been holding it in for 10 years. ANd on top of that just tell a random person about it. Any tips for the first meeting regarding this?",17Apr2019,1
139,"I wasn't sure if I should post here or not, but right now I'm at my worst, and can't take this mental state anymore.  
I'm 15, and have been depressed for a few good years now. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, thought it was just some kind of emotional teen phase, but it started getting worse in the past months.  
I lost motivation in doing things, barely get out of the house (Although I'm trying to change that in the best way I can), I'm scared to start new connections with people, and when I do have a strong connection with someone, I get really attached to them and scared of hurting them or letting them go. I stopped doing certain things out of a fear of being judged or hated.  
I'm scared of talking about it with friends because I'm afraid of putting them down or making them sad, and I can't talk to my family about it in depth because I don't trust them as much as I used to.  
I'm heavily considering to reach out and get a therapist soon, but I'm not sure if it'll be enough.",17Apr2019,3
140,"I don't really want to get sober right now. I am under age and I definitely want to have my first legal drink one day. I also think it seems very boring to never get drunk again. I just quit trying anyway. 

Plus how will I deal with bad feelings without it? I don't think it's necessary to get sober at the moment. My parents are just overreacting. Im supposed to go to a group thing. I quit going. My parents think I still go. Im 18. They should not be so concerned. They drop me off there and I go in. But then I leave and go to a park nearby so that I can read my book. I tell them fake things when I get home. 

I already quit seeing my counsellor. I do not want to talk to them anymore. I just purposefully forget the meetings or stay in class instead of going. I get a sticky note telling me to go but I throw it out. I have not been going for about a week. The meetings just were not helping. Also going to see my counsellor takes up class time. I do not want to miss class time anymore. I keep on getting reminded to go. I do not  want any more damn reminders. They should just put another person in my spot. Im supposed to see them every tuesday.",17Apr2019,2
141,"Rather not sound ungrateful for the life I had, but I feel it's quite unfullfillling at times...Long as I could recollect, I had a ""blunted emotional response""...To clarify, imagine this: it's almost Christmas and so you beg your parents to purchase the gift that you are so eager to get.  They are hesitent but comply...Hence, you unwrap it on Christmas Day, play with it for 10 mins, then get bored.

You feel guilt for being ungrateful...for wasting their money. All you wanted was to have some fun; why are you bored already!? You grew and matured, less and less stimulates you...You lose interest in previous activities that gave you an inkling of joy. Now you only do the necessities: wake up, go to school, act happy, home, rinse and repeat with the ocasional short bursts of fun you can salvage, like dating. 

Is this normal? If not, what can I do to cope, thank you.",17Apr2019,1
142,I saw and heard things that defied reality when I was very little. All throughout my life these symptoms have come and gone. They were gone for a very long time. Two years ago I started hearing and seeing things that aren't there. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly after? Can schizophrenia go away and come back or just psychosis? I'm very confused as to what is going on.,17Apr2019,1

I'm researching the effect of urban exercise vs green exercise on mental health as I believe that these are underrated tools for helping people with mental health problems.

Obviously due to the subject matter you have to participate in some sport to be relevant to the research.

But I am somewhat terrified of being okay. I have lived my whole life with the problems I have and I feel as if they have become a big part of my identity.

148,"16M here

I'm learning in psychology class about delusions, and I think I might have some. I've kept it to myself because I know they are unusual and socially unacceptable. I actually believe all this and I don't know what evidence could convince me otherwise.

I saw Chinese lanterns when I was 8 and believed my neighbor who acted scared and said they were aliens. I've obsessively gone through a lot of books and websites about people who were abducted, and I have for what to do if they come.

To me, the worst thing I've found out is that there could be a type of alien that can move as invisible gas and enter people's minds. I feel strange at times like I'm detached from my body and start hyperventilating thinking an alien is taking control of me.

I read about things like the Notre Dame fire and immediately get suspicious it was the Greys.

As far as demons go, it's similar to aliens. Hell is a force that could take over my body at any moment. I have to pray repeatedly in my head when I think about something sinful. When I have the feeling of detachment that I mentioned before, I sometimes have a demon inside my head screaming that I should renounce God and commit the unpardonable sin. Unlike the other delusions, I know this part is my imagination, and I don't do it, but it takes a lot of deep breaths and prayer to get the voice to go away, and then I feel exhausted.

I promise I'm not trolling. I know the rules of logic, and people are going to say there's no proof of demons, but I can't just stop believing in it with a snap of the fingers. I feel the moment I let my guard down, they'll take over my body and use it to commit atrocities. And if I deny God's existence, I'll die and go straight to hell.",17Apr2019,1

151,"...it was pretty good. I told her right off the bat that I didn't want medicine, I wanted cognitive-behavioral therapy, which was fine, but she was so surprised I knew that term! which sparked a whole conversation about how smart I am.

Her psychoanalysis of me wasn't bad at all; she realized that I have trouble filtering my speech and thoughts because of my autism, as well as my talking fast, and she also realized that our moving around a lot didn't help my need for predictability and routine.

I don't want to talk to any of my friends because I feel like they're over it or won't care because they don't think it's a big deal. I recently spiraled downwards and did a few compulsive things that I probably shouldn't have, and I'm worried that next time it might be worse.

153,"For starters, I'm 22, male, and live in the United States.

I can't recall the last time I have ever been genuinely happy. I attempted suicide last year and was prescribed Zoloft 100mg (1/day) but I still feel as miserable as ever. I stopped going to my therapist and psychiatrist appointments and any attempts I make to schedule an appointment (which is saying something, because I usually don't like going to therapy) is saying something.

I find I'm always pushing people away, and while I don't like thinking of myself as being sensitive, I find that even the slightest thing can destroy my mood. After my suicide attempt I ended up ghosting everyone I ever talked to (with the exception of one person), and when they attempted to get back into contact with me I bluntly told them to ""fuck out of my life"".

Moving on, after that event, nothing really changed in my life beyond the fact I began to self medication with more drugs - primarily marijuana and alcohol (although I wouldn't consider myself dependent on either substance). I also came to the realization that I am gay after years of lying to myself. The issue is, I don't want to be gay - I genuinely don't, and I don't know what to do.

I find that I am increasingly watching gay porn, and with every passing day I find there's less and less to appreciate about the female body. I find I'm (almost) giving into my urges by talking to other gay guys on gay-oriented dating apps and it disturbs me. I feel like I should be straight, and I want to be straight. However, I let my dick think for me and began chatting with a guy my age, and he was constantly showering me with compliments of how I look ""cute"", ""hot"", etc. I automatically jumped to the conclusion that he was lying to me - especially since I spent 30 minutes taking photos of myself and there was only one I was satisfied with  - where the angling and lighting accented my non-existent facial aesthetics enough so I wouldn't look like an ugly piece of shit. Anyway, we continue talking, and he asks for more pictures of my face, so I sent another one - a lot less flattering then the one on my profile. After he doesn't respond for five minutes I began crying like a little bitch, with me thinking he thought I was ugly with him ultimately ghosting me. I repeatedly checked the messages and came to the realization that he didn't open it yet. After a while I got tired and went to bed - however, I woke up a couple hours later and checked the messages again, and realized this time he did read the message and never responded. In the classic fashion of my mom, I texted him ""I guess you think I'm ugly"" and ""I won't waste your time since it's obvious you think I'm hideous"" - which followed by a borderline mental breakdown. I wanted to cry but I just felt empty inside, so I ended up drinking a third a bottle of fireball despite the fact it was 6:30 AM and I last to leave for work in an hour.

I was in a shitty mood all day, and later on checked my texts again and realized he responded (I muted his messages) and he said he didn't think I was ugly, that he just opened it and went to sleep. I called him a ""fucking liar"" and said ""it's obvious your think I'm ugly, or else you would've said otherwise"". He then stated he still ""wanted to meet up"". I haven't responded since, and I find myself thinking that he's only saying that because we're realistically the best either of us can do - I didn't tell him that however.

I was in a shit mood the entire day, to the point where my coworkers were asking me what was wrong. I find myself getting upset to the point where I was crying a bit, but I would quickly regain my composure. Normally, I would keep this bottled up, but the thought popped in my head today to begin cutting myself, primarily my face because in my mind I rationalized ""I'm going to show the world how ugly I truly am, that way no one will want to be with me and I don't have to deal with shit like this anymore"".

I don't get what's wrong with my brain and why I can't be normal. I feel I have no purpose of life and I genuinely don't do anything, I feel like I merely exist and waste oxygen. I have been crying all day and I don't know what to do. I didn't intend this to be a blog post, but I needed to get this off my chest since idk who to speak to about this. I feel like such a piece of shit, I can't explain why I do things like this. Sorry if this post comes off as rambling and whiny.",17Apr2019,1
154,"I watched a video not so long ago about this skater/bmxer going on about he has mental healthy issues and what hit me the most is what he said.. he said in the video that when he was a kid he would say to himself if he doesn’t do this trick he wouldn’t get something, for example; if I do this backflip I’ll get scouted by a bmx team.

I used to do that when I played football in my garden, if I hit this top corner I will play for Man Utd etc, but sometimes I will say on PS4 if I don’t win this fifa game I’m going to die, so I’ll play my best.


I don’t know if this means anything but would it be best to get checked out?

I have anxiety but it’s not that bad only had few panic attacks and went and seen a doctor and my hearts all good etc etc
