0,"Over the past week I have been rather anxious because of various small things, I normally have really bad anxiety but it is especially bad right now.
When I start to shake it just keeps getting worse unless I actively fight back and calm myself, when it gets bad my entire body just tenses up and shakes uncontrollably, my arms pull inward towards my chest and until I getting myself calm I just can't control my arm or legs.

Maybe this isn't very uncommon and I'm just freaking out because, of course, I'm a very anxious person. and if it is something other people with anxiety have trouble with then what are some things I can do to prevent myself from getting this anxious?",23Jan2019,1
1,"I'm trying my absolute hardest.

I'm slowly losing weight, I'm doing more exercise. I'm practising self care regularly, doing face masks, shaving, keeping my nails cut and painted, having long showers/baths, washing/conditioning/making my hair look nice. I've got into a skin care routine, I'm taking my makeup off before bed. I'm keeping a journal, I'm writing, I'm blogging. 

(All things I didn't bother with last year; in trying to improve myself).

I'm doing all I can to be good enough and to better myself but I still don't feel I will ever be enough?

I wonder what I need to do in order to feel good enough.",23Jan2019,1
2,"It’s almost like two versions of me are in an eternal death match which each other. One being and edgy, self-hating, hedonistic asshole and the other a generally content person. Usually one will stay “on top” (higher priority/presence) for an extended period of time. I’ll call them edgy/sad and normal/happy. Edgy/sad is usually how I am for a week to a month, where I’m normal/happy for multiple months. 

I love my family, but there are times when I just want to shut them out completely, and I start to, only to come back around again. I also actively want to do things that are super self-destructive like drugs and general self-harm. I’ve never gone past that point of thinking/wanting to do those things, but idk what’ll happen. 
On the contrary, normal/happy is fairly generic and I can’t describe myself like that in any other way than normal. It’s just what a human should.
I take 3 different meds, and they all fuck with how I act so I’m almost inclined to chalk it up to them, but once again, idk.

4," I (25M) have depression and anxiety and I want to get treated for it. I am about to start counseling (without insurance for privacy reasons) but I would also like to inquire about diagnosis and medication. This is something I have dealt with for a long time and I am finally trying to take a step forward and address it. I do not know exactly what I want or need but I know I would like insurance, so any advice would be very helpful, thanks. \[Florida\] ",23Jan2019,1
5,"So I'm writing this to hopefully get pointed in a few different directions of what could possibly be happening, not really an internet diagnosis.

**Background**
The only relevant thing I could think of from my history is that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and loaded up with heavy doses of Adderall and Vyvanse through my school years, I stopped taking it around the age of 17-18.  I picked it back up when I was trying to go to University, but this time I was abusing it as a study drug.  I quit at 22, I'm 26 now.  The only other previous diagnosis I had was mild depression.  

There was a weird one where I had a single night terror and I went to a psychiatrist who told me demons are real and prescribed me zyprexa on the first time he saw me.  Not saying I don't believe in professionals, but yeah I took that medicine once and stopped when I found out what night terrors are and I've been fine since.

All that was in the US, I live in the UK now.

**The Problem**
When people are talking to me, I zone out after maybe the first 4-9 sentences.  I really hate it.  What I can describe from my perspective is that they will say 'A' and I will think of something that relates to 'A' and almost unconsciously start thinking of something that relates to that, and on, and on this thought tangent until I wake up out of it and realize I've missed 2-3 minutes of this person talking.  Then it happens again.

The worst is my wife, not because it happens any more with her, but because I love her and I hate how it effects her.  Especially when she's telling me something important when she needs someone to listen.  I want to be with her, but sheer willpower and determination isn't getting me places because I always revert back to my standard shit attention span.

She's said to me its because I'm selfish and I don't care, and I'm open to criticism.  But at the same time, I know that if she wrote it all down for me in a long email, I'd read every single word maybe twice over.  I have no issue reading people's comments or Whatsapp messages.  I'll read every word.  Its just when I'm listening.



What are some possibilities that I might be suffering from?  Other than a therapist, do you have any resources you'd recommend?  I first thought it might be narcissism, and if it is I'm willing to own it and get help, but my wife really doesn't think I match the description for it.",23Jan2019,1
6,"I’m in high school in Indiana, USA and I was wondering if anyone could help me? I’ve been diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety and school is a major factor into it. I only have two more required classes to take for graduation. Is it possible to do half or partial days at my high school? Some students I know have talked about 504 plans with their counselor but my mom said absolutely not to that because she doesn’t think I need it. I am struggling really badly. You guys know that, that’s why I’m here. Anyways, it’s time to schedule my senior year classes, anyone know if it’s possible to relax my schedule or calmly explain to my mom what a 504 plan is? They seem to just allow breaks and such but I really just need to go home and not sit in a classroom for seven hours. Any help is greatly appreciated!",23Jan2019,1
7,"Does anyone else feel like emotional pain is the only thing that is real? It's hard for me to explain, but I feel like, at moments of inner torment I find myself crying but unable to make a sound, to sob or to scream. It's just me and my pain, so much that I can't breathe and my very soul just breaks. 

And it hurts. It hurts so bad but at the same time, it's feels like nothing else is as real and authentic as the pain that I'm feeling. 

",23Jan2019,1
8,"Im just gonna be completely honest here because I need help. I need a second opinion, a view from an unbiased stranger. This is going to be very unorganized as you could probably guess.

I have never excelled in school. Im smart enough to do so, and generally need to pay minimal attention in class to complete my work, yet my grades have been poor all my life. Its something that makes me very upset because my ability is not holding me back.

Lately however I have felt like shit and my grades have dropped into mostly failing range. My entire family expects me to go to college, and at this point im not sure if id even be accepted to any.

Here is my actual problem though, recently my brain had just felt off. Ive always had some anxiety but never to the point where my I worry about everything, overthink everything, EVERYTHING. My head has also just felt foggy and down. In the past few months Ive had a really bad habit with weed. Im not dependent on it, but very regularly use it, and im starting to realize how much its affecting me.

In the morning, i have recently struggled to get out of bed to go to school. Frequently I would skip days after not doing an assignment to try to do it at home to get it done 'on time' but I never end up doing anything. I have no discipline or motivation nor no how to build it effectively.

My dad divorced my mom a while ago, and their relationship is poor but could be worse. I have little to no relationship with my dad, often we dont speak more than hello to each other. He has some undisclosed mental problem that he has never talked to me about. (It could be nothing, but he is very antisocial, and has said to me that he has ""something wrong with him"")

My mom and I are much closer, but with all this stress I have been taking my anger out on her. She isnt very strict at all, and doesnt beat my ass like she should if I get frustrated and raise my voice or something. I feel really bad about treating her like this, but I continue to do it. Its not something she seems to care much about but I worry about our relationship in the future.

Im in high school, dont do shit with my life, so any advice given will probably be taken. Thank you if you bothered to read this. Im just lost and need a point in whatever direction is right. Mabye this is just snowball anxiety and im fine and normal, or mabye my brains just fried.

She gets out if school at 3, goes to sleep,  wakes up at midnight and repeats.  She will not cook if anyone is in the house because there breath germs will taint her food.  She won't use the same bathroom as the males in our house because they are disgusting.  She wraps the toilet behind my mom and I.  She seems to hate everyone but me,  and she is hardly open with me. She slams the door 30 times when she goes in her room to make sure it's closed.  She is vegan.  A class she wanted to go to I took with her,  today she didn't want to go.... I don't know why,  but she never leaves the house and has no friends.... So I was hoping she'd actually go even though I hated the class (never told her that).... I'm very worried she won't go seek help.  I can't talk about it or she'll shut me out like she did everyone else in the family.  She's so smart,  and artistic and pretty.

10,"I've (25 F)  been battling depression, anxiety, and paranoia for the last decade and two months ago it got really bad. I made an attempt on my life, had everything planned out and ready to go. But I'm the middle of it, i stopped before i could do any real damage. I had thought about my husband (at this point we were only married for 5 months) and it was like i snapped out of some spell. 
Anyway, my husband found out about my attempt and made me 201. He was infuriated, hurt, betrayed. He says it felt to him like i had tried to end our marriage, I've broken all trust he had for me, and equated my attempt to that of cheating. 
It's been two months. I've thrown myself into my work, going to therapy, being on top of my medications, talking through my emotions work loved ones, utilizing coping skills. 
But it seems I'm not doing enough for him. I almost feel hopeless, like he's never going to love me the same way again; like he's never going to forgive me; that's he's going to hold this over me for the rest of our lives together. When i ask how to get us back on track, he responds only with ""fix yourself first"". 
I've been fighting so hard and honestly feel like I'm doing this alone -without his help, love, or support. 
I have no idea what more i can do. I feel helpless. 
I could really go for some advice..

Right now I'm writing this from my room because I can't stand to be in the same room as the puppy. Is this just an added stress on top of everything else that I have to stress about?

15,"Like the title says, I'm worried about my boyfriend/significant other because over the past month and half he's become increasingly depressed to the point where he's extremely suicidal. He says he won't follow through with it because he's too much of a coward, but I don't think that's going to be the case for much longer.  I live in the US.

For some background, before he dated me he was with someone who he describes as being pretty much perfect for him. They dated for a few months, and he was happy, then the person he was dating came out as trans. He didn't know how to voice the things he was feeling, and if he did, was too scared to. That relationship ended because of it and it crushed him. He became severely depressed and was having suicidal thoughts. 

Several months later we go on a date, and start a relationship. Things were good for about a month. He relies on his parents because he's still in school working on an engineering degree. His mom doesn't like me, and when he told her about us being in a relationship she blew up on him and he was forced to break things off. This triggered a very bad downward spiral for him. His mom would continue to make remarks about me to him, and it kept messing with his head and making him doubt himself. 

Then, it led to him thinking about his ex again. Once he started, he couldn't stop, and still hasn't. He's angry at himself for not being able to talk to them, and breaking things off the way he did. He goes between wanting to rant to them over the whole thing, to going on his knees and begging for another chance. He'll have some good days where he's not focused on that failed relationship and his mistakes, but those are getting fewer and further between. 

I didn't know most of this until after he asked if I'd be willing to give a relationship with him another shot. Since then, a lot of this has come to light and I'm really worried about him. I don't have the ability or knowledge to help him in the way that he needs. Today was particularly bad because he and his ex go to the same school, and they ended up parking right by him, which didn't help him at all and only triggered more compulsive and suicidal thoughts.  


I don't know what to do to help him, besides telling his parents or calling 911. Telling his parents would very likely end badly because of how they've handled past issues and make his depression and self-loathing worse. I've tried getting him to see a therapist or councilor, but he keeps refusing saying that talking about his problems won't help him solve them. I'd appreciate any advice",23Jan2019,1

After three losses of consciousness of which I recall only two (my brother observed the third), I feel weakened and low on energy and have a deep gut feeling that going outside would end with my remains on the sidewalk. Today I've spent about half of my waking time lying down because I suddenly feel like I have to lie down. I'm also having trouble sleeping even though just lying in bed awake is restful.

But the real problem is that I'm now entirely dependent on my elderly father to buy groceries, check the mail, pick up my medication at the pharmacy, and eventually do laundry. I'm even worried about showering because I'd have to remain standing long enough to shower.

Dr. Pūras, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health, has previously called for a radical shift in global mental health treatment approaches and policies. In this new commentary, Pūras and Gooding demand action and resources to address coercion and human rights violations in psychiatry and mental health treatment.

“Coercion in psychiatry and broader mental health services is rising worldwide,” they write. “This fact demands not merely discussion but action.”

I loved spending time with her; it was a second home. My mom was really annoyed with it. It made no sense to me though because she was always complaining i wasnt at home, then complaining I was always home. It's sometimes overwhelming at my house. The last house i lived in, it was a 2 bedroom and one bath. I shared a room with my two younger siblings and my older brother, his girlfriend, and their three kids stayed out in the living room. I love my niece and nephews but man it got so chaotic in there sometimes. So, I'd escape to my best friends house. It seemed to really work out, most of the time anyway. My family and I moved the summer of 2017. We moved from California to North Carolina. It was just my mom, step dad, me, and two younger siblings. It was a difficult move. Especially leaving everything behind. I'm the oldest as of right now since my older siblings still live in California. I share a room with my younger sister and my younger brother gets his own room.

Especially since its not a very healthy environment. My step dad is a dick and my mom blames us for how he behaves. If he yells at her for something so little, its our fault because we didn't clean the dishes. My mom was so sure this move would be good for us, but it was the complete opposite. I feel things gotte worse. I feel so overwhelmed here sometimes and i have no where to just leave to. I hang out in my bathroom most of the time because i feel it's the only place where i can have some time to myself. I feel selfish? But at the same time i just need to get away.

IMPORTANT: I am not currently in danger of hurting myself and i have the suicide prevention number in my phone. I AM however always contemplating killing myself to free myself from this constant health related anxiety. 

I am a 26 year old american guy, no health insurance. 

For the past 8 years now Ive been battling some absolutely crippling health anxiety. After almost dying doing some drugs in college I really shouldnt have (K2/spice), I have been in constant fear that I am dying for one reason or another ever since.

 Ive convinced myself I had heart failure and had multiple echos, EKGs, ultrasounds, etc of my heart done, all clear. The stress from all of that caused me to develop migraines really badly within the first year. Those migraines caused me to convince myself I had an aneurysm or meningitis, so I had CT Scans, MRIs, angeograms, a spinal tap, all came back clear and I was told it is just migraines. This has been going on for years and this past summer I spent a month in an inpatient facility for actually trying to kill myself over it.

Now, after recently reading about a brain eating amoeba killing a woman in seattle for using a neti pot, ive been sleepless and at a 12/10 on the anxiety scale convinced Ive got only a week left to live. 

I'm at the end of my rope, I dont know how to stop feeling this way all the time. I have constant panic attacks, I spend a lot of my days crying and I am just so paralyzing AFRAID that I'm dying I can hardly function.

Please, what should I do? ",23Jan2019,1
25,"Hey,everyone, I’ve been on this page for a few days now and would like to tell my story. My reason for this is that if I do, maybe it can help some one else out their.  I’ll be honest, I am super nervous about it, but I hope someone may find some help in it. When I was about 7 years old, I had a great uncle, who was “the fun uncle” get hospitalized. This is believed to be where my anxiety had begun. I was put on medication at the age of 9 and shortly after I turned 10, he passed away. This being my first real loss, I didn’t know how to react, especially when I was taught that the men of the house weren’t supposed to cry or get emotional. (I had misinterpreted what was meant as a be a big boy situation.) My 6th grade school year things got so bad that the school had released me for threatening my own life. As the years went by I continued to try and cope on my own. (I had stopped seeing my psychiatrist in the summer between 5th and 6th grades.) In the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I finally met my Grandfather on my mom’s side of the family and around Christmas time my 10th grade year, he passed away. I remember the last phone call I ever had with him. He had called me while I was at Lunch, and he was drunk. (That was common for him,unfortunately). I told him that when I got home I would call him back, he passed away a few hours after that phone call. I still regret it, but at least I got to tell him I loved him. The rest of my school years would pass, I would graduate, and get a job at a local grocery store. I would pour a lot into this job. So now I lived with my Mom, My dad, and my Grandma on my dad’s side. She was in bad health when we moved her in in February 2017, and I loved her to death, but like with anyone who you live with, we butted heads. So one day at work, I get a call that she had been put in the hospital after collapsing. In the mindset I was in, I thought I would go visit on one of my days off, the next one being that upcoming Tuesday. I got a call at 9:48 that Sunday night telling me she had passed away. So in April of 2018, as a result of her passing , I had a major panic attack. I also contemplated suicide that night as well. About 6 hours after that attack, I went into work on Monday. Things were different though. I felt nothing and I Chalked it up to the grieving process, however we got to July and I dealt with these Anxiety attacks and Depressive times even though the grieving process had ended. In late July, I went back to my old psychiatrist and was diagnosed with GAD and Severe Depression. I thought my life was basically over. I took the meds I was prescribed,and for a good little while, they helped. Then my psychiatrist retired in October. So I was left in a bad place mentally, where would I go from here? So I went to a therapist and since I started seeing him, things have been very back and forth with this battle, but then about a few nights ago, when things were getting pretty bad,I found this place, I found a place where my experiences in dealing with what I have dealt with for a majority of my life can be used to try and make someone feel better and help them in their times of need. 

All of this to say, I love each and every one of you. I hope all goes well for you all, I will keep all you in my thoughts and I hope that maybe, if we keep pushing forward through everything we each have to face, that we can all see a brighter tomorrow. Take care of yourselves and keep on fighting. I love all of you. ",23Jan2019,1

About two weeks ago we were evicted from our house.  We had 20 minutes to grab what we could. Thankfully we got all the critters out. But I wasn't able to grab any of my Art/Crafts supplies.  All my coloring stuff,  polymer clay stuff, MP soap stuff,  Candle making stuff, Painting stuff... nothing. 

These things keep me going and some what grounded. We now live in a Extended Stay in a not so good neighborhood and I'm losing my freaking mind. All I can think about is Hurting Myself one way or another. 

We are so tight money wise that I have no idea when I'll be able to get even a 8th of my craft stuff back. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I thought about getting a kitten to help since someone donated so much cat food. I'd want to adopt one from a shelter but we don't have the money for that.

In order to verify the authenticity of the letter, they need to have a board member physically go and get a copy from the clinic.

I was given a ton of coping mechs, but my guardian refused to let me take medication. She was scared I'd end up like my mother, in that it'd make me worse and permanently ill. She's a private person so I was only allowed therapy for less than a year.

But it's gotten worse. I get terrible shakes, my bones and muscles always ache. I always get morbid thoughts at the weirdest times, and I can't help but pace the floor when they come. It's gotten to the point I can barely do my homework anymore. It's hard and the only time I can is at 3 am after a two hour nap.

42,"Hey folks. Anonymous for reasons, on mobile, yadda yadda. 

I've struggled with this feeling of not fitting in anywhere for basically my entire life. As a kid, surrounded by loving family, I felt wrong. Like I wasn't supposed to be with this family. Like they were a bunch of happy ducks and I was a happy chicken. Among friends I feel like the odd one out. Even when we're having fun I tend to ruminate on  why they would spend time with me. At work or school, I feel entirely out of place. The most messed up part, in my mind, is that I feel the very same about my twin. Like I don't even belong with the one person who has shared every step of life with me, is my closest ally and loves me to death. Even with her I feel this sense of ""wrongness"". My husband is in the same category as everyone else. Not even with him do I gain a sense of true belonging, and he knows me very well. 

I don't know why I feel this way but it makes everything so incredibly difficult. Life is just painful. Always has been. When I was young, I used to stare up at the night sky and just have this sense of knowing that I didn't even belong on this planet. I wondered where ""my people"" were and if I even had any. Were they coming to get me one day? Would I fit in with them there and gain a sense of belonging? Would I feel the same there as here? I had childhood fantasies about how great it would be when they finally came, when I would feel like I clicked in with society. Like I belonged somewhere, truly. 

Does this pattern of thinking have a name or a cause? I want to fix it, so I can stop thinking so much and just enjoy life. I often wonder about death and why I didn't just die as an infant. My sister and I were preemie babies and technically died after birth and had many, many years of intense medical care. I wish I had just simply ceased existing at birth. 

Anwyays, these are very intense, lingering and intrusive emotions and thoughts. Been there for as long as I can I remember and I'm not sure why. I'm afraid they'll escalate to the point where I'd rather be dead than here. I don't want to hurt myself in the future. Am I fucked? Do I need a professional or can I fix this myself? ",23Jan2019,1
43," I have made the initial appointment for therapy, but as I review the patient privacy contract/guidelines, it looks like my information can be shared for literally any reason. I understand if there is an actual legal reason such as a court order or for the physical safety of others or myself. Even sharing info between other health practitioners or insurance companies, etc. But some of these instances just seem excessive. More than that, the overall language used in the contract indicates that basically if for any reason the therapist feels it's appropriate to share my information, he/she may do so. Here are a few examples where disclosure of my information does not require my authorization:

""For research purposes, including studying and comparing the mental health of patients who received one form of therapy versus those who received another form of therapy for the same condition.""

""Specialized government functions, including, ensuring the proper execution of military missions; protecting the President of the United States; conducting intelligence or counter-intelligence operations; or, helping to ensure the safety of those working within or housed in correctional institutions.""

""For workers’ compensation purposes.""

""For my use in training or supervising mental health practitioners to help them improve their skills in group, joint, family, or individual counseling or therapy. ""

46,"Cross posting this from r/helpmecope 

Using a throwaway account, so here goes nothing.

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I am 18, a senior in an extremely small high school, and I can tell that the light at the end of the tunnel is almost there, but I just don’t know how to keep going.

Growing up my parents would fight for hours and my two siblings were fairly older than me so we didn’t really talk about it much, leading to me locking myself in my room a lot. I never really socialized until freshman year, and I feel that my social skills have taken MAJOR hits from that. For example, I am in my school’s One Act Play, and I am in a scene where I have to act like I’m romantically holding this girl, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I don’t know why, but the thought of touching someone else gets me super anxious. So when I get anxious from not touching someone or saying the wrong thing I take it super hard and feel bad, thus repeating the loop. Sometimes I feel like I’m not even human, or I should even try.

My dream at the beginning of this year was to attend my dream college (won’t name it), which requires a fitness test. I trained all summer, but now that my heart murmur is being questioned I can’t stop thinking they will reject me. This has also caused stress and (I’m pretty sure) caused high blood pressure.

Financially I know my family can’t pay for college, so this dream school is about the only way to make it work. I scored a 33 on the ACT, but physically I am weak. I’m afraid of failing my family. I held three jobs at once during the summer to support myself and not use my family’s money, but now due to the amount of school activities I’m in I had to quit. My dad splits some of his income into a private account so we have issues paying bills with what’s left, and my mother has medical issues that make me scared to leave her alone for fear of her passing out or falling. 
My family has also had extreme bad luck with cars, as my first car died within a year of being bought. I have since gone through 4 cars in the course of roughly 8 months.

School ends in 4 months, but with baseball, 5 academic events, 2 artistic events and no job I feel burnt out, sad, and basically worthless. I have to do all these activities to look good for the dream school, but also have to drain what precious money we have left because I don’t have a job. 

I don’t have any close friends I can talk to, don’t have any romantic feelings for anyone, and just feel like I shouldn’t really exist. I feel like I am floating, unable to change anything even though I HAVE to change something to get to that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not suicidal or anything, I’m just tired, sad, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like what constitutes “me” is a bunch of actions, not a real personality. 

TL;DR
I feel like a major fuckup because I can’t do basic human interaction right, probably overburdened myself (but can’t escape it), worry constantly about my parents, whether it be their health or spending money, and I’m just tired. My brain is numb and I don’t know why I act the way I do. Maybe I’ve got a mental illness or need some therapy.  I just don’t know.",23Jan2019,1

Also what happens is that I would wake up one day and tell myself I would take a shower at 12pm , but that would turn into 1pm, 3pm, and so on and never take a shower because I would focus on other stuff and the weird part is I would have taken my ADD focus medication that day. This also happens I'm school (I'm in college), I would miss a day of class and then go the next day, but sometimes I miss a day of class and then it would be two weeks later and I would suddenly realize that I've been missing class and then I would be anxious to go to the next class.

I know I have mental health issues. My patience has always been limited, and I’m finding I’m now destroying my children due to my temper and outbursts. I’m becoming the monster I swore I wouldn’t be. My parents were this way to me, and I hated it. Now I’m doing it to my kids and husband, too. 

I want one on one help. Not group help. I want to get it all out but it being a private thing. But I want insurance to help pay - because isn’t mental health just as important as physical? What am I paying them for? I’m covered - but why are my choices all coming up as hospitals where I have to stay? Or be in a group? My thing is intimate. I want to make sure the focus is on me as I can get rambling to get my story out. There’s a lot of messed up stuff in my head. 

There is history of mental illness in my family. I was hoping I could dominate it as I did for so long, but something switched in me many years ago and some feelings have amplified to worse. I’m sad all the time. I feel like a failure. Feel like I’m always judged. Tied down. I don’t feel cared for. I’m stressed. I’m lazy. I rarely get good sleep. I’m always on the defensive. I’ll get spurts of energy or excitement and someone has to pop my balloon and it crushes my soul. 

And I’m taking it out on my kids and husband. I shouldn’t be yelling or snapping at my kids over the things they do. I go too far. I know I do. But I never feel satisfied they understand me. I’m miles better than my parents as I give my kids chances, but they PRESS. Constantly reminding myself they’re 4 and 1, for God’s sake. Like they freaking know! And it shows in my eldest. And it’s killing me to see what I’m doing to her. 

I don’t know where to start. Who do I even see? How long will it take to get me right? I don’t want anyone to know. But I don’t know when I *can* go. I’m a stay at home mom. My husband can’t watch the kids during the day and I have no one else. Everything costs too much. And we’re so far away that even if I could find somewhere to go, I’m looking at LEAST a hours drive ONE FUCKING WAY.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist of over a year. The reason for this diagnosis stems from my early childhood and young adult experiences with my mother. My mother left my father almost sporadically days before my eighth birthday around 2am. She grabbed my dog and I and left in the middle of the night for her mother’s house (my grandma). Shortly after arriving, a man entered my grandmother’s house and introduced himself to eight year old me. This man would turn out to be my mother’s future husband (keep in mind that he arrived at my grandmothers house at 3am the night of my mother leaving with me). Flashing forward an unknown amount later, my dog was put on antidepressant medication, which seemed to stem from the dramatic way my mother dragged us out of the house (with a police officer outside and in a hurry). In my later elementary, middle, and high school years my mother took her husband to every school event that I was in, which i did not want to happen. I did not want this to happen because I already have a dad. Also, my dad lost tens of thousands of dollars in divorce court with my mother, just to get half custody with me, and had his name besmirched around town which made finding clients for work nearly impossible, reducing him to half of what he earned prior. Additionally, my family found a hidden journal from my mother detailing her plans to take the house my dad made for us and move in with her new husband, which I think hurt my dad deeply causing even greater anger towards my mother and her husband. With this in mind, I did not want my mother’s husband to attend my school functions, mainly choir, because of what seemed like too many shady things piling up to give any glimpse of credibility towards the accusations my mother always threw at me about my dad. In high school, my mother would take me to school and pick me up on assigned custody dates. In the morning she would be almost to happy, but depressive level sad or angry when picking me up. During my sophomore year, I reached a breaking point. My mother leaned over to me in the car and told me “I don’t care what you think, I’m taking my husband to you’re school events and graduation.” When at home I grabbed all my things and threw them in a big plastic bag to take to my dads. He told me that I should give my mother another chance so I don’t regret it for the rest of my life. So I did. She seemed to change for a while, but ultimately reverted back to her old attitudes. I left a second time for a separate reason involving nasty communication between the three, but my mother called me and said that if I didn’t come back she would call the cops and get me back. To save my dad the possibilities of court for this reason, I went back home to my mother’s. I actually walked out about six months after my eighteenth birthday when I became a legal adult since my dad was stuck paying for everything, while my mother and her husband barely contributed, even though they made $200,000 annually. The last straw came when she refused to help contribute to my college education, leaving my dad to accrue all the debt and hardships associated. I talked to her on and off after leaving and tried to get her to help with school, but she hung up on me on the phone, angered that I would discuss that topic. I told her that I didn’t want to see her and chose to live with my dad permanently. She called one day through a no caller ID, and her first words to me were of anger. Additionally, she did not seem to wince at all when I told her that I was having heart surgery for a condition that I had no prior idea I was born with. Instead she just replied, “oh yeah, well I may have cancer,” without acknowledging anything I said about my surgery. I ran into my mother’s husband’s daughter one day at the mall and said hello to be civil, but she acted like I was not there and shunned me. Within this whole nightmare, I felt stuck trying to keep the peace between my mother and father, since I had the naive attitude that parents deserve undying respect.

I worked through the anxiety that was caused by trying to maintain the peace, but I am still deeply affected with persistent thoughts. Of these thoughts, I feel like a terrible son because I left my mother and the idea is constantly in my mind that she is suffering and could die alone without me. It’s a double edged sword, where I’m damned if I go back and damned if I hold my ground.

I’m a pretty strong guy so I know I will ultimately be fine, but if any of you have experienced something similar or have any words of advice, it would be of great utility to me and I would appreciate it. 

Thank you.",23Jan2019,1

54,"I've been working through a lot of traumatic memories that I've spent years repressing, so I've just been a complete mess mentally and emotionally. The amount of stress I've experienced from confronting my past trauma has been draining, and has made it so much harder to manage the symptoms of my borderline personality disorder. The emotional agony from the borderline is making it almost impossible for me to function. The intensity of the emotional pain makes my entire body ache, but then I'll go to feeling like I'm on top of the world, and then back to the emotional agony within a few hours. This has been driving me insane, because of how exhausted I am from going from one extreme to the other multiple times a day. 

I'm going through so much stuff right now, that I don't even give a shit about school. Honestly it feels like just another thing thats stressing me out that I wish I could avoid. I don't know what I'll do if I take a semester off but I feel like I'm going to flunk this semester considering I'm 3 weeks in and haven't done any of the homework because I have zero motivation, and I  can't even think straight for enough time to actually get anything done. I feel completely lost right now, just being alive is painful.

58,"I have Asperger’s. When anything gets me even mildly upset, I scream. At the top of my lungs, sometimes slamming items on the floor including my phone.

When I was a kid I would scream involuntary every time I cried, and my parents actually thought that I was faking it for attention (because their sons didn’t make the kinds of wailing noises I did). So I stopped crying and just got mad instead. I now often find it irritating when others cry because I associate it with being a “drama queen.” 

Then I get even angrier when people comfort upset crying people while asking me “WTF is your problem!?” when I’m distressed because I scream instead of cry. In the moment I never understand why people don’t come to comfort ME as well. I guess me screaming scares them and makes me feel worse.

I’m so tired of feeling unstable when I’m sad. How do I teach myself to cry instead of yell?

59,"I think I may have borderline personality disorder &amp; want to see a therapist but my parents aren’t very accepting of therapy. I don’t want them to see charge of the session on their insurance bill &amp; start questioning me. 

I’m a student in a mental health counseling program which makes me feel even more useless that I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

My possible symptoms:

I assume everyone hates me/don’t want me around so I don’t even try to make friends. I generally do things alone &amp; only have one really close friend, my best friend of 3 years. I get along well with coworkers but I’m always afraid they secretly hate me &amp; sometimes I will detach myself from emotionally if I feel that way.

I get random mood swings from time to time so one second I’ll be fine &amp; the next I’ll feel really down about myself. I thought it was depression for a while but my symptoms to last long enough for it to be that.

I can get incredibly irritable &amp; angry at the tiniest things like a customer leaving their dirty cups at the table instead of throwing them away.

I have a very tumultuous relationship with my mom, who I suspect has a personality disorder. She lashes out at me a lot &amp; calls me names only to cry &amp; play the victim when I call her out.

I have anxiety that I take medication (hydroxyzine 25 mg) for.

I dissociate from time to time. It mainly happens when I’m driving (which is terrifying) or when I’m about to take a picture of myself. It occurs randomly sometimes too, most times when I’m class.

I feel like I don’t deserve any kind of happiness in my life. If something bad happens, it’s because I deserve it.

61,"I’ve been trying to update a log of my journey lately with my mental health. I have two other posts if anybody is interested in week 1 &amp; 2. Each week has been really eye-opening and, thankfully, they’ve also been going in the right direction... I think this week has been the most intense, hands-down.

I didn’t have any of my groups or appointments because the office I visit closed for a week, but after doing some very major self reflecting I realized what a lot of my problem is. Turns out; I’m an asshole. No way around it, that’s just the honest truth of it and it took me 29 years to really figure it out — ha! Not what I was expecting but it sure does explain a lot. 

I’ve fought with depressive issues for as long as I can think back to, except maybe when I was a young kid. Otherwise, I remember always being so combative, headstrong, ready to stand up for myself and fight anyone who seemed like they wanted to fight with me. I have my reasons; I mean, *I have so many reasons...* Brothers and sisters, I have a list as long as my arm that I’ve been adding to, editing, and defending for years now. **It’s become who I am.**

I’ve always been *this* girl: the one who suffers, the one who’s plagued by life, the one who’s sad, who’s the victim of abuse, so lost and so lonely... I believed it. I subscribed to it. I stayed so stuck and petrified by it... but I also said it on day 2 of week 1 of this new journey: I *will* take my damn life back from all of this, and to really open my eyes to how I’ve been living my life so far really shook me. I can’t think of a single excuse for why I should have ever let myself get this far down when, all along, I thought I had all of them.

This is why: *I’m* the girl who was raped. *I’m* the girl who was abandoned by an alcoholic father. *I’m* the girl who was let down by an emotionally abused mother and later abandoned. *I’m* the girl who was suicidal, who picked abusive relationship after abusive relationship. I’m the girl whose breakup was so tragic it made the newspaper in every major city in Oregon. *I’m* the girl who has this list of 5 different diagnoses that nobody can seem to sort out... I have so many tragic, stupid stories about being homeless, losing my whole family over circumstances I *still* don’t understand. That’s me, this hot freaking mess that screwed away my 20s on nothing but depressing, heartbreaking crap and never stopped to wonder why it kept happening to me.

Now I see it. There were so many things in my life that, yes, were out of my control. There were so many more things that were. There were so many times I could have prevented my life from going the way it did and now the only options I’ve let myself (allowed myself) to have were destructive, inexcusable, and so far below what I deserved. **I have been so stuck in this rhythm of believing that life is only out to destroy me that I never thought for a second that I could change it and watch it grow into something better.**

In the meantime, anyone who’s gotten close to me has been pushed away. I’ve tested them, held them away at arm’s length because *god forbid I let them love me*, and I’ve cut them off the first time they do anything even remotely human because **I’m afraid.** I’m afraid of the world and I’m afraid of myself. 

On top of this, all I think about and talk about is the negative crap. *”When I was only X years old, this happened... then guess what? *This* happened too! You think you have it bad? You don’t know anything about *this*!” Who in their right mind wants to replay all of this with me, nonstop, like a 2 year old watches their favorite Disney movie 5x a day? Better yet, **why the hell would I let myself live that way??**

This is tragic. This has turned me into somebody who is always angry. This has made me somebody who is always sad. I’ve done abusive things to my loved ones and validated every second of it. I do have legitimate issues with the way my brain is able to operate day to day, but it’s not 90% imbalances and 10% me. It’s more 30-40% depression or PTSD or AD(H?)D and the rest is all yours-truly. *I’m* the girl who refused to get real with herself. 

After I started to open up to this new, radical idea (about Wed or Thurs of last week), things intensified a lot. Depression got worse, anxiety got worse. I kept replaying every asshole thing I’d done but hadn’t seen before the same way. It was like I was on a bad trip. 

Then it hit me: I *am* that damn girl. I freaking survived. I survived all of it. I still stand straight. I still have a massive, loving heart. I educated myself, I beat the freaking odds, I created a family of my own, I did things in my very short 29 years that almost *nobody* I know has been able to relate to, whether for better or worse. I survived divorce. I survived an eating disorder. I survived addiction and holding a sign up on the street, asking strangers for change (then started asking *myself* for change). I did it without my mom, without my dad, without my brother. I’ve been lied to, betrayed, literally spit on, and **I am still here, still trying, getting better every day.** 

Nobody will *ever* be able to love me the way that I love me. Not because I don’t deserve that love from others and not because they aren’t capable of giving it to me. Because I am the *only* one who has seen my story, from start to finish, and has seen every single step of the way that I fought to **live** even when I felt there was no point. I am so proud of myself. I love the mother that I am, I love the partner that I am. I love the strong ass woman that **I am**. 

Shenriyu Suzuki has a quote: “You are perfect just the way you are, and there is still room for improvement.” 

I will become a better person every day. If today I can look at my mistakes and see them for what they are, and tomorrow I can make a life I deserve and love, then I’m just fine. My legs still work, my heart still works, my head is kinda funny but it’s filled with thoughts and ideas that are truly worthwhile and unique to me. 

I **am** taking my damn life back. For what it’s worth, the answer has been right in front of me and I never believed it. I deserve happiness and I deserve rest. I deserve answers. I deserve to believe that I’m beautiful and strong, caring, compassionate, and one fine cook if I do say so myself. I deserve love, and I really owe it to myself **to love myself**.  This is my life — my one, precious life. **I will continue to survive, and I’ll do it with a smile on my face because I deserve it.**

I am currently doing research with a psychiatrist at my medical school, and we are trying to determine if there is any association between an individual's history or an individual's family history of cardiometabolic factors (ie: high blood pressure, cholesterol) and schizophrenia.

64,"As the title states, I'm in a bit of a pickle. I used to be close friends with a fellow class clown in high school, this guy was honestly one of the most likeable, charming, funny guys I knew. Let's call him Clay. Many people from our friend group drifted off across the province and we ended up unintentionally losing a lot of connection with one another. I always wanted to maintain a friendship with Clay and so I tried to message him 2 to 3 times a year, but he slowly stopped using any social media, got rid of his cellphone and basically became unreachable over the years. If we ever hung out together he seemed like he had been slowly regressing and was becoming a more insecure person who no longer enjoyed to joke around very much. He took things very seriously, in a way that made me personally feel like I could hurt his feelings fairly easily if I did joke around too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I Just turned 27, I haven't seen him for about 3 years.  I was chatting with another old friend that I speak to once or twice a year, let's call this friend Bill, who I know **occasionally** hangs out with Clay still. Clay was always one of the main things Bill and I talked about when we did connect over the years because he also noticed Clay's regressive and isolating behaviour. We always felt that Clay just had his sh\*t together and was confidently doing his own thing (he was so confident before that it seemed to add up..). We figured that he just didn't want to hang out with most people and didn't want to hang out with us most of the time. We were wrong and Clay recently had a huge nervous breakdown. He ended up in the psych ward and has been there for 6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the first thing I did was call Clay's home to see if he was around to try and talk to him. His mom said he wasn't around but she took my number and said she'd leave a message for him. I didn't hear from him for 3 days, so I called back again to see if maybe when I called before, it was bad timing for Clay or his family due to what's been going on with him. His mom answered and didn't mention what was going on, but that he could be reached at \[insert phone number\]. I called and it was the psychiatric ward, I asked for Clay, I got through and Clay sounded heavily medicated and quite emotionless. I think after that, something primal triggered in me and I became very nervous. Clay was honestly one of the most well rounded people in high school (we were all lunatics and teenagers and doofus' I know!), but he was super sincere, cared a ton about people, made everyone laugh and was always a very vibrant person. So hearing him sound ""hollow"" like this.... made me feel **really** **scared*****.*** I was freaked right out. Our conversation was very uncomfortable, I did my best to try and be supportive, trying to talk to him like I would regularly. But I knew I wasn't. And I suspect he felt the same way. It ended really abruptly and I felt like I failed to support him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I decided to do the thing that I thought would be the most helpful, I called Clay and after he said ""hello?"" I just let him have it. I said ""Clay I just wanted to say that I love you and I do not judge you at all for any of this. I don't think less of you, you can come stay with me and my girlfriend (a short trip away from where he is) if you want to take a break from anything. I can relate with going through 'stuff' because I had my own manic episode (that he wasn't aware about) when I was 19 and I just really wanted to say that I love you dude! We can chat every week or everyday if you want to. I won't mention anything that you're going through with anyone or anything if you don't want, you've got full control over this. I really don't want you to feel alone like I did when I went through my manic episode."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Clay replied sounding very medicated and tired ""That's very kind of you. I'll keep in touch."" And then basically ended the conversation. Fast forward a week and a couple days (today). I haven't heard from Clay. I decided to give him a call today, he wasn't around in the facility, called him again in an hour like I was told to, he was busy, and then I called once more asking the head dr. there asking if they had any advice because I didn't want to overwhelm or stress him out, but I also want to be supportive and sensitive. They told me to just be a friend and that they'll pass the message on to him and we can leave the ball in his court. Well sure enough, he hasn't responded so far and I keep wondering if I f\*cked up somehow. I know he's mentally unstable, I just have always felt like I've had a knack for consoling people and he seems like he wants nothing to do with me/our interactions. Plus I feel like I'm super nervous and saying things in a very jumbled way and am just insecure about the idea that I might not be saying what he wants to hear. 

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO I didn't mention earlier, he doesn't seem like he wants to talk about himself. He seems to nervously + quickly ask questions about me and flips my questions really quick back at me.

Ok so when I say that I don't mean I never ever get sad but when I do it is normally caused by verbal abuse (this might be important idk) but aside from that I don't really get sad and I haven't for a very long time. I know that I got sad when i was little but I don't remember being really sad past that. Sad things have happened to me ( nothing big like the death of a loved one though) but when they happen I kinda just go ""oh, ok, what now"" and continue on. I don't want to state my exact age but I am in the teens though this has been something I have noted for a long time (pre-teenage years) and I have been wanting to know if it is abnormal in any way.

As a side note (though it may be useful) I don't really react when others hurt themselves. In primary school I would see people, especially younger people, get hurt all the time and while everyone else fussed over them I would simply watch it and not really get what all the fuss really is.

I told him that the worst of it was about 10 years ago, when I spent almost a year being completely unable to function.  I couldn't sleep until I'd exhausted myself by crying for hours each night, and I couldn't get out of bed until lunch time most days.  I hate admitting that to anyone, and he was the first person I'd told who hadn't known me at that time.

He said that how I described it sounds like possible PTSD, which is something I had actually thought myself a number of months ago.  I know what the trauma was; he doesn't.  For someone to say that, who doesn't know what the trauma could have been, makes me think there is something to it.  It actually really surprised me that he so quickly came to that conclusion.

I'm not sure what to do now.  The thought of trying to find a counsellor - the thought of sitting in front of a stranger and having to tell them about my life - that's not something I can do, but I can't expect to be able to rely on friends either - friends are for support, but they are not for ultimate dependence.

73,"My parents divorced when I was very young because my dad is severely bipolar. I started noticing last year (I was 13) that something might be wrong with me when I would stay up late at night to get homework done and either have crazy fever dreams in short bursts of sleep or just sit in my bed and think I hear or see things that aren't there. I wasn't using any drugs at this point, not even weed or alcohol. I specifically remember doing this thing where I would lay in my bed and think I can see my phone through my closed eyes, only to get a notification or something and find out nothing happened. I wasn't dreaming or anything, I guess I was just tired and stressed out from all the homework I wasn't doing. I did have some really upsetting dreams though, I remember one time I got home from school and took a nap to see literally the most terrifying thing I have ever seen, which was really just my dog's face in a dream. I don't remember why it scared me so much but I immediately woke up, my heart beating fast and me almost hyperventilating.

80,"I've been dealing with anxious anger for probably as long as I can remember. I have anxiety and a sprinkling of depression so whenever this comes up the after effects are usually pretty severe too. I feel as if this comes from having your sense of pride and superiority challenged by others. I've seen this in myself quite frequently where someone will show me something that they are proud of but is also part of something I myself have pride in (which is very rare that I do). This leads to a slew of critical feedback and nitpicking which can make the other person feel bad and that in turn makes me feel worse. It's not something I can control, easily anyways, and it feels like I just blurt it out without really thinking about the other person. Say for example, a friend shows me an art piece that they are really proud of and challenges my perception of superiority. I would begin to unrelentingly critique and point out what's wrong with it and what could be better. Now that can be seen as a good thing but in the end it just leads to the other person feeling sad or offended. The reason I call this anger is because it deeply irks me internally when it happens like someone just insulted me and my brain processes it by trying to make itself perceive it as worse than it actually is. This ends up making me seem to look rather egotistical which is not the case. In fact, I would say that being as such would be a marginal improvement over my current mental state. I feel as if this is some sort of defense mechanism to protect myself from lowering my self-esteem anymore than it already is. Learning to accept that people are not out to hurt me is definitely a trial in it of itself and a difficult but necessary step towards better mental health. Hopefully I was able to shed some light on the situation for those who might be struggling with something similar and are confused as to why they feel that way. I would also like to know if anyone else has or is experiencing this same kind of reaction.

Now my problem is, I am 99.99% sure there's something ""wrong"" with how I'm wired. I just function very differently from everyone around me, and I've had difficulties ""living"" since I was very young (4-5yo). And lately it's just all come to a head, some symptoms are flaring up and I'm just drowning. After many debates, I decided to take an appointment with a psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, honestly, I'm afraid that the doc will tell me that nothing is specifically wrong with me, and I just need to continue trying to be better. I feel like that would destroy me, because it just can't be, there has to be a name for what I am, and I so badly need to know it so I can finally understand why I am the way I am and finally have a ""frame"" for everything. I need to be able to ""frame"" my issues just to be able to stop diving into every ramification of every thought all the time. I need a diagnosis, and my fear before going in is that he'll just say ""you have no mental disorder/illness, its just how you are"". I feel like it would condemn me to just more of the same, without relief.

I went to a few therapy sessions within my University, and was put on different SSRI's. The therapy was great, the medication not so much. I ended up dropping out of University and getting an apprenticeship in a field that I am passionate about and have made a massive improvement from this time last year.

That being said, I am still suffering from a lot of anxiety / depression on a day to day basis and really struggle to manage my emotions in a normal way. I snap way too quickly, and the smallest of things can ruin my day. This can really affect the relationships with the people around me who mean the most.

I am now stuck on what to do, I can go back to the doctors but will more than likely be prescribed another SSRI and be told the waiting time for therapy is 2 years (UK). I understand that my GP isn't going to be the miracle that changes my life around. That is down to me, but I don't know how.

This place is bigger and on the phone yesterday they said ""assessments are from 8:30 to 11 but you won't see a doctor the same day."" Idc because same day assessment = better than what I've had so far.
Well I showed up about 9. Was told it's a 3 hour wait 1 hour assessment. I tried not to cry and to not be a jerk, told the lady ""uh I kinda had somewhere to be"" and slunk back on the elevator.
I have work at 1:30 and I'm terrified of not being perfect, so even being less than 3 minutes early makes me feel awful. Perfectionism has set in heavily. My eating disorder has gotten bad again too.

98,"I have all this energy to do my schoolwork and be productive but every time I try to get started I just.... can’t. I have no clue as to why. But then when I change to something else, like reading a book or watching YouTube, I can’t pay attention to the content and just end up sitting there. My brain isn’t switching from one thing to another for stimulus, it’s just like it doesn’t want to do anything. So I just sit there, thinking about all the work I could get done if I’d actually work but I just can’t start. 

It sounds so lazy when I write it out like this but it’s a real problem that I just can’t solve or talk to anyone about. 

I don’t want to sleep, but I don’t want to be awake, or go to school, or eat, or watch tv, or do anything in general. 

But to add, I can’t stop re thinking about everything I or someone else does. If I offer someone a book they need or a ride somewhere and they accept, do they really want it or are they feeling pressured by me to do so, in which case makes me feel awful. I then have to ask so many questions to ensure I’m not forcing them to do anything at which point they just get pissed at me for not just giving it to them. Then I know I’ve messed up and it consumes me for the rest of the day. 

If I have such a negative effect on everyone, why do I try to make friends or be involved in the first place because it seems that every time I try to make a relationship with anyone it turns to shit. Maybe I should just let go of the few people I have in the first place? I’m obviously just causing more issues than I am solutions. 

My few friends are starting to get worried about me but what can I tell them? That I’m being a lazy pos?

I have a boyfriend, our relationship is great, but that makes me uncomfortable. I don’t understand why he likes/loves me because I haven’t added anything positive or negative to his life and honestly everywhere I go I seem to find someone that has a fiery hate towards me when I don’t know what I’ve done. He’s so sweet and honestly amazing but I can’t understand why he sticks around with me. He’s said that this is more than a short thing (when I asked him) and he is even making ideas 5-7 months in the future (like “oo do you want to see this movie that comes out in may”) when there’s no guarantee we will still be together. 

I am terrified that he will begin to resent me just like everyone else. How does he know his feelings won’t change like he’s said? Wouldn’t he just be better without me? How does he know he has feelings for me in general? Why, even?

I want to be “normal” and believe in “love” and that it’s possible for someone to have those feelings for me but I don’t even like myself that much so how can someone else?

I’m not sure how coherent this post is or if I’ve gotten my point across. Re-reading it it just sounds like I’m lazy and complaining for no reason but these things are slowly overtaking any functionality and I don’t know what to do and I have no one that I can talk to without fear of ruining the relationship. 

I also don’t like to talk about any of this head stuff because there’s always someone out there having more issues than me so I don’t really have a place to say anything about my trivial issues.

101,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 24 and I have been experiencing musical hallucinations for 3 years now. It is not the case of having songs stucked in your head. I hear songs constantly. I faced severe depression and thought of killing myself 3 times because of domestic violence, misunderstandings within my family and other factors in social life. In 2016, I had chronic pharyngitis due to acid reflux. Without knowing clearly, I was in great depression for the feeling of having something stuck in my throat and making me hard to breath sometimes. I would have a non-stop anxiety vibe running through my veins. In addition, I suffered terrible headaches while taking antibiotics for the stomach problems as a side effect. Again, without knowing, I went to a hospital and asked for painkiller. The painkiller I took led me to racing thoughts. The first time ever I experienced something like that, and I could not make it stop, even if I shouted out ""Stop!"". After 6 days of taking the painkiller, I did not think it was a side effect from it at all and went to the hospital stating outright this racing thoughts symptom I had. The doctor asked me a bunch of question and diagnosed me with repeated depression disorder. She gave me Sertraline to drink. That is the first SSRI I have encountered. The racing thoughts disappeared within 48 hours. And this SSRI gave me panic attack as well as insomnia. I could not sleep for the next 48 hours. In my panic mode, I went to the hospital again to confront the doctor and got prescribed Paroxetine and Xanax. Boom, I started to hear songs, LOUDLY. 

I postponed my thesis which I was supposed to do in my 4th year in university. The doctor told me simply put on music to not hear the music in my head. She told me it might be a side effect that would go away soon. It did not. It stayed with me ever since. I went to many different places for treatment later but I was never in good hands. I was diagnosed in early 2018 again with bipolar disorder, and stayed on antipsychotics for more than 8 months. Nothing changes. Fast forward, that idiotic doctor ditched me and left me with withdrawal effects. I had severe headaches along with my musical hallucinations. I finally found a place near my place to treat this. The doctor this time did not tell me the meds' names. Or he thought I could not look them up online. It was SSRI again... However, I have been feeling a bit better for the last 3 months. Maybe I got used to the condition. I still hate it and hate it more when someone says something like ""I wish I were like you. People buy Ipods to listen to music. You are a radiohead on your own! How awesome!"". I can sleep better now. But it seems to be incurable. I could not focus on work. By the way, I managed to graduate in November 2018 (finally!). But since then I have switched 2-3 jobs already. My family is pushing me, putting pressure on my incurable disorder. My mom is a believer. She said that I must have done something bad in the past lives to deserve this. And my dad cannot tolerate with me being unemployed and unable to pay the meds by myself. I am tired.

Thanks for reading this, this isn't about me it is about one of my roommates. I just don't know what I should do about it.  If i should report him or just leave him alone. Backstory. I am in college and couldn't pick my roommates this year. I have two. One of them is ok, but the other is just a little off.  Let me describe what I mean by off.  He has mood swings. If something doesn't go well, then he gets caught up in depression like really bad depression. He says he feels sad, and rambles on tangents about his family and how he wants to make them proud and stuff when he is down. But then literally an hour later he gets a good grade on an assignment and he is leaping through the roof with excitement and saying how awesome he is and how he is one of the best students here, even though he hadn't read the book or studied or anything.  I think he has bipolar disorder. I have tried to ignore this part of him, but has he other things that make me worry. He smokes, juuls and dips like crazy. He went through an entire pack of juul pods in one day once. Since I do not using tobacco I don't know what that means, but my other roommate who does says it is to much. All he does is sleep, eat, goes to class (we are forced to) and uses tobacco products and plays a crazy amount of video games.  My other roommate is not as concerned about him because they play the same type of games. I am not a huge gamer.  Other things he does. He gets worked up about the smallest things. He couldn't get the teacher he wanted and he flipped out for a week, ranting on and on about everything that has happened to him until he got the class he wanted and then he acted totally normal and like he wasn't ranting to us about the class. He sleep talks, stays up until 2 or 3am playing video games and then freaking out the next day when he has homework due. He never checks his emails and relies on us to tell him when we have something we have to do or somewhere to be. He goes around bumming juul pods off people when he is out and when we tell him he should go to the store (which is a 10m walk away) to get some because its cheaper.  (he pays 45 dollars for juul pods here when he could get them for 30 at the store)  he flips out and rants.  We All do rotc, different Rotcs but still rotc, he tells us how he wants to have all these leadership positions and how everyone loves him and how he is the most intense person in his platoon. He wants to have a spot that involves a lot of planning, teaching and spending alot of time with the first year students next year, and supposedly he says that others have told him he would be good at it. When all I see is that he lays around in his bed and sleeps and plays video games and never works out and despite him saying he is good at planning how is it that he can't seem to submit his assignments on time? He also switches his story around constantly.  We ask how our grades are all the time earlier in the morning he said he had Cs but then he said he had Bs and As later that day.  I ask him about this and he said aww no I never said that I had C's, even though my other roommate was there and heard him as well. Whats more concerning about this is that we have an honor code and lying could get him kicked out of school.  I try to listen to him and his point of view and what he thinks but he just has screwed logic and doesn't seem to understand simple things. he says he doesn't believe in politics but he is an is major. We asked why he is an IS major then and he said so he could proof other people wrong.  he is enlisted in the national guard, which i don't get how, unless he puts on a show of being smart for other people.  He believes in aliens, and angels coming down to earth as aliens.  He thinks one of our instructors is an angel because he told him that God believes in him, even though my other roommate said he does that stuff all the time. But this roommate refuses to believe him.  We are a smallish school and we are really supportive of our other classmates. For example this roommate (who is on the poorer side) wasn't going top be able to come back this semester because of money. All of us chipped in and helped pay for his way to get back here. He takes that to mean everyone loves him.  However, he didn't help another one of our classmates with the same issue because he didn't have enough money, even though he spends money on pizza every night and juul pods.  Which the fundraiser wasn't asking for much, like $5 a person.  He also continually says he is going to quite juuling and he stops for a day and then goes right back too it. Which i wouldn't mind  but he then says that he quit. He also says that he does stuff and accomplished it when he just signed up for it. We ran a 5k and he says he completed in even though he just signed up for the race and stayed in bed.  He also says he has heart attacks from drinking to much coffee. I think he says this just for attention because i am a lifeguard and know the signs of a heart attack.  All he said he felt was tingling in his foot and dizzy. Which isn't a sign of a heart attack, I told him this and he started yelling at me.  He has done this twice.  He also believes in conspiracy theories, he goes on about the big triangle (No clue what that is) and the illuminati. He said he was joining the illuminati by applying on a website, which looked like a scam.  Both my roommates told him this because you had to pay money to join but he totally ignored our reasoning.  And then gets pissed off when he doesn't have money to buy stuff. I just don't know what to do. And how he got into stuff like the army without people realizing all these issues he has. Is he just really good at hiding things? Is he playing stupid? What? I try to get to know him but he never likes talking about himself or what he wants to do. He is very anti social except for with the people that no one really likes. He doesn't care about anything (even though he says he does) and I am starting to get fed up with it. I can't stay up every night until 2 ( I am a light sleeper) to him playing video games, and I have asked him to stop and he says he is going to stop certain things but he never does.  He has said his mother was put in an asylum, even though he says she isn't crazy. even though he believes he is the product of some super soldier program with the CIA. and that is mother tried to rat the program out and that is why she was put in the asylum.  He hasn't talked about killing himself yet. What should I do?   Thank you so much.",23Jan2019,1

However I can't seem to grow up and do adult things. For example, any thing about sex, relationship, attraction and seduction feels like I'm being 'a naughty child', as though I'm always too young to be exposed to such material, despite the fact that I'm 25.

I like to play with children's toys such as Lego, especially stuff like princess castles or plush toys. I talk to my pillows for emotional support like teddy bears.

I tried to purchase a dildo (it is quite realistic) just to see how things would pan out and I found myself holding on to it for comfort when I feel sad or depressed at night, like a symbol of strength and warmth.

Everytime I think of myself being in a relationship, this voice comes up to say 'who do you think you are, you're too young to talk about stuff like this'. But yet my domestic helper is always teasing me about why I'm so old and still hasn't been in a relationship.

118,"I'll try to make this brief. 

Last August, my best friend of a decade suddenly messaged me, telling me that he was thinking of killing himself. We live about 3 hours away from each other, so after sobbing on the phone together for about half an hour, I made a panicked call to his parents (who live in my city) to tell them what was happening. They made the drive to him that afternoon, and took him straight to the doctor. He started taking medication to help him sleep, and some for depression; he was also seeing a councilor regularly.   

This all came along quite suddenly. For our entire friendship before and after high school, he was a wonderfully happy-go-lucky guy. He was in great shape and loved the outdoors... always a hard worker, and immensly talented in his chosen field. He went to festivals and socialized, always the deepest thinker in the room. 

In the past 6 months since that message, he's lost a lot of weight and his posture has deteriorated noticeably. We all convinced him to quit his job, as it was extremely obvious that it was a large part of the problem because of how resentful he was towards the line of work. He has been unemployed since (not a bad thing, he needed the time to recover), but I know things are getting to the point where he needs to go back to work. His parents offered to help him out so he could take the time he needed, but I'm not sure how long that has lasted. 

Yesterday, we chatted online while he was getting ready for an interview, and then afterwards. He looked great, and I told him to stand up straight and kick some ass. He was in relatively good spirits when he got back, and I was asking him how the interview went; he said he hit it off with the interviewer! He seemed a little confused about what the interview was for, as he had responded to an ad for a labourer. When it dawned on him that he had interviewed for a recruitment agency, I watched him go from 10-0 in a matter of minutes... not because recruitment agencies are bad, but because he didn't realise what it had been for. He started becoming super self-deprecating, and abruptly ended the conversation later because he was ""in a hole."" I told him he was doing a good job, and let him go. 

This whole thing has me wondering, am I coming across as superficial? We talk nearly every day, and I try to maintain a positive attitude. I let him talk when he wants to talk. I talk when he doesn't. I often try to remind him that his feelings are coming from an inbalance upstairs, and that his depression doesn't own him; but being someone who has never experienced depression before, am I even helping, or am I just part of the problem at this point? 

Bottom line is, I want to help him recover from this, and I'm at a loss for what to do on my end. I'd give him the world if I could.. but I'm just another young person trying to make my way. Do you have any recommendations for small things I can do to help lift him out of this?  Things I can avoid saying that could potentially make me a source of unhappiness and anxiety? Any and all guidance is welcome here. 

Thanks for your time. ",23Jan2019,1

121,"Background: Had a psychotic break about 3 5 years ago. Have lived with depression and intermittent bouts of awful anxiety.

After my worst episode years back I did what I had to do to get my life together. I moved to a state with a good support system, ate much better, exercised, practiced mindfulness and other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques.

It helps tremendously to the point where I thought I'd never have to deal with a serious episode again. I knew how to tackle it if it ever came back.

I've been employed for over a year in an extremely stressful environment where I've done pretty damn well. I thought I was a success story.

I can't stop throwing up from an anxious belly. I'm starting to think bad bad things again. I'm hearing things again. I'm using ghe same tools I've used before and it's helped... but just enough to not absolutely freak out.

I actually kicked a hole in the wall the other day. I'm NOT a violent or aggressive person in any way - but the internal pressure within me is resulting in very poor impulse control 

I deleted all social network besides this and am basically shutting myself in right now.

I had a meltdown/panic attack at work the other day and haven't been back since. I'm afraid for my job. My livelihood. I only have enough $ to get me by for a little if that goes south. I can't control how they handle my employment.

Good morning, everyone!

First off, if I'm posting in the wrong place then please let me know, I'd be glad to remove this post for any reason.

Secondly, thank you for taking the time to read this.

My name is Austin, and I'm a 19-going-on-20-year-old on the west coast. Growing up, I never felt like there was anything wrong with me in terms of my mental health, I just felt what I felt was normal. My mother her entire life has struggled with severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. My father, on the other hand, has only dealt with major social anxiety for as long as he can remember though he refuses to admit it. My brother and I both deal with our own forms of anxiety and depression, though he was the only one in the family that refused to be diagnosed or seen by anyone.

In October of 2016, I was diagnosed with ""major"" depression, and major social anxiety (I don't feel like my depression is major at all, but the social anxiety oh boy yeah). I was forced to undergo treatment after going through drug therapy for bringing a fat bag of weed to my high school right at the start of my junior year (so I *think* that was 2016). I talked to my appointed counselor at the weekly meetings (interestingly enough, I got put into AA classes because the teen marijuana group was full I guess) and after maybe 4 or 5 sessions she referred me to a mental health counselor barely down the road from my house at the time. I signed up and made my first appointment.

My first appointment, my mother had to be present. We sat down and talked about the normal first-day things (the uncomfortably personal questions) then he asked my mother to leave the room at my discretion. Afterward, my counselor and I spoke about my personal life and who was in it. I spoke a lot about my s/o who I was with for a little under 2 years at the time. I don't remember specifically how it went, but I remember my counselor asking me how often I masturbated in one day. To this day, I'm not sure if that's a normal question but whatever, it was so long ago.

At the next session, he diagnosed me with a couple things and explained what they were to me. I knew all that stuff because this was around when everyone wanted to have depression so I knew quite a bit about it though I didn't agree with his diagnosis of ""major depression"".

As the months went on we saw each other every Tuesday before I left to my GED classes, and we continued to talk about my personal life, as you would. He frequently told me to leave my girlfriend and cut certain people out of my life. I never agreed with any of these statements, and usually just stormed out.

My girlfriend knew I was undergoing treatment, and by the time I finished my drug counseling, I was still going to mental health counseling at my preference. She frequently told me what I was feeling was in my head, and they're just filling me with lies. I knew her intention was to help, she was just really, really bad at it. She would ***never*** do anything to intentionally hurt me without justified reasons to do so, but this still hurt. I **needed** her support and love throughout this process, and the absence of it made the whole thing that much harder.

My parents wanted to be supportive, but I was such a little rat bastard, I made it extremely hard on them to enjoy my presence. They frequently fought, and tried to divorce a couple of times throughout the 20+ years they've been together, and I've always blamed myself for their issues. I'll get back to that later.

I was considering ending treatment as I felt worse than I ever have after. I was prescribed something for the depression, anxiety, and something else (started with a C) for sleep issues. I attempted overdosing on the depression/anxiety pills, but I instead just threw up and passed out. A few weeks later, I swallowed a handful of the sleeping pills and collapsed. My brother supposedly found me and I woke up handcuffed to a bed in a hospital with my parents very angrily glaring at me. I can't even explain how disappointing it was to wake up like that after a failed attempt. I'm not sure what happened in between, but I felt fine besides a stomach ache for a few days. They took away all my pills, which I was all for. Then made me sign that paper that says I legally cannot harm myself or I can go to jail or something.

Alright, now just after I turned 18, I finally opted out of treatment and was home-free. I said I no longer need mental health assistance, and I'm ""cured"" or ""better"" or some bs I could say to get out of that place. I left, and never looked back.

Since then, I've tried offing myself a few times by going ""down the road, not across the street"", hanging myself (instead I just crushed my trachea and couldn't talk for three weeks), and almost leaping off one of our local bridges before being stopped by a good friend of mine. These were all in horrible moments, and I was incredibly happy none of them worked.

I have bad days, and I have better days. It's been a while since I had a good day, but some are better than others

But my issue is, I no longer have *days* or *moments* where I want to leave this life, it's been a constant thought in my head for months. Every day is the same, I'm no longer happy unless I'm alone, and I can't stand the presence of anybody, and it's taken a huge toll on my girlfriend. Ever since leaving my parent's house, they've been thriving and happier than I've seen them for as long as I can remember. I *knew* they would be as soon as I left, and I'm so happy I was right about that. I'm toxic, and I infect anybody close to me, and nothing I'm doing can change that, believe me, I've tried.

I have considered leaving a note explaining I'm running away and giving my car away to a stranger so I can off myself without leaving my family or s/o in grief, rather they'd be angry I left without explanation. Every day is the same, some days are harder now, but usually, it's the same feeling. I've been working out more to try and motivate myself to not only quit smoking but stay alive, though it's not helping.

I only find happiness in cigarettes, and music whether it be destroying my drum set or trying to play guitar.

I forgot where I was going with this, so I guess I'll end it here. Thanks for reading, if you did.",23Jan2019,1
126,"Hi, all -- my name's Eddie Kim and I'm a writer with MEL Magazine in Los Angeles.

&amp;#x200B;

The story is about people who end up in the emergency room thinking they're having a physical emergency when they're actually having a mental health issue (like a panic/anxiety attack, psychosis, etc.) I've spoken to some ER directors and senior doctors who say this is a frequent occurrence, especially with men. The underlying issue seems to be the lack of access to preventative mental health measures, as well as the ways we downplay mental health symptoms in American health culture. 

I'm reaching out here for stories about how you ended up in the ER because of an unexpected mental health emergency, perhaps one you had no clue was related to mental health (this is different than going to the ER because you self-harmed, for example). Did you think you were having a heart attack? Or that you were going blind? Or just felt internal pain?

It's not something I can just go and *do*. Yaknow? It's a competitive field where cuts can be made at any moment at the digression of the professors in charge, so that's neat I guess. I haven't been cut yet, but the worry still strikes me every so often that it will. Sleeping is hard, very very hard. I haven't gotten a full 6-8 hours of sleep in the past 4 days. I really don't like myself. Like, as a person. I never really have. Not many others have liked me either, and those who do choose to stick close to me always wind up getting burnt out because of my shit personality. The people I care about most I try my best to cling on to, but again, they get burnt out. I genuinely don't think anyone really likes me. And I know for a fact that no one really knows me past the front I put on. I do have a girlfriend, we're going on our second year right now. She's sweet and wonderful and everything I could ever ask for. But even now, it feels like she only stays with me because of familiarity. Because I'm part of the routine. I love her to death, but I know she's going to get burnt out sometime sooner or later and leave. And then I'll truly be alone. What's worse is that I don't think anyone will really care. I've tried to kill myself a few times in the past, but I'm too much of a pussy to really follow through in any way. A guy like me, I really don't believe I deserve anything. I'm not a valuable member to any society/group/anything. At times it feels like maybe I will be valued, or maybe I'll make a new friend, or maybe I'll be able to finally get some fucking sleep, but none of it ever happens. I like to think that someday things will get better. That I'll eventually have a wife and kids, have a good house doing the work I have a passion for. But then reality comes crashing back down on me, reminding me that I'm nothing special. That I'm just another human being out of 7 billion on this earth. It's really hard for me to come to terms with a lot of things going on in my life, and I really needed to get this out before I did anything stupid. Or maybe this was the something stupid I did.

I think I just had a panic attack a few minutes ago or something, because I had shortness of breath, was very worried about her and I, and out of nowhere started crying for a minute, and after that, I feel fine. Is there something wrong with me? I've never really felt this way before, but for the past couple months, it keeps happening to me, getting very nervous about us. The crying was a first, though. She's given me no actual reasons to suspect that things are going wrong, and that's why I know I shouldn't be feeling scared about us. can someone explain what's going on in my head?

136,"Ok so I know I am. To be more specific I am wondering if this situation would devastate anyone. 

I have been hanging out with a friend I met about 2 months ago for almost every day. He is going places in life and well-liked by just about everyone. His brother is popular as well and he has a solid friend group. We are all 25, 26. 

When he first started bringing me around a lot his brother told him he could do better. His bro is considered to be the “better looking” one and gets a lot of hot females. The last time my friend brought a girl he liked around, his bro slept with her. So there is that. It stung when I met her and saw what he meant in him doing better. 

Last night my friend wants me to come over. 
I say he should ask his bro (they are living together) because I have been there a lot and want to be respectful. He asks and his bro says that I don’t really match the group aesthetic or fit in basically. He doesn’t really want me around. 

I have tried being nice, offered the group a place to stay for free for Coachella, my cabin in the mountains, etc. Everyone else seems fine with me, except for the “ring leader”. 

I don’t know why this hurts so bad. He also doesn’t like how quiet I am, but that is just my personality. ",23Jan2019,1
137,"I know people say there is no sense in knowing a diagnosis because it will label you and make you feel bad, but I’d like to know to have an idea of why all of this is happening. I’m not comfortable with asking my therapist directly, but she hasn’t given me a straightforward diagnosis. I would like her to talk to me about it but I don’t want to bring it up. I just have so many of the symptoms and would like a little clarity. Is there someway to ask about it without being direct?",23Jan2019,1
138,"I am going to do this as a single discussion instead of two. 

I am dealing with severe anxiety around work mostly but even every day tasks. It’s bad. I have a real hard time getting started on work and making it more than a couple hours per day before I feel absolutely exhausted. It all started after my divorce and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, just worse. There is something about it that gives me a highly irrational “fear”. I put it in quotes because I don’t know the right word for it. Best we could describe it in therapy is a fear of failure...maybe. But I have absolute confidence in myself to do the work. It’s usually quite easy, I’ve been doing it for over 15 years. But now, when it comes time to sit at my computer, something just hits me and makes me run far, far away from it. (I work from home, self employed doing freelance work which gives me the ability to avoid work). Once I somehow do start it’s not too bad and I get stuff done. 

I came up with an analogy: Something is after me (clients, need for money, bills to pay), I don’t want to but I have to dive under water (go to work) in order to escape it but I can only swim and hold my breath for so long until I feel desperate to climb back to the surface (stop working) to gasp for air. I can make it maybe 2-3 hours at a time and usually never more than one work period per day. 

I have absolutely no idea how to get myself going to do that initial dive into the water. Once I do, I do fairly well and I know the more practice I have at it the longer I will be able to stay under water each time... but it’s late afternoon today and I still have not yet been able to dive in. I know it feels great to get something done but I still can’t get myself to do it. It took me 2 weeks to do a mobile deposit of a good sized check that was just sitting on my counter because I felt “afraid” of it. 

As for memories, I learned something new yesterday in therapy that I just didn’t know was not normal: When I recall memories I cannot recall the emotion of it. I *know* how I *likely* felt, but the actual emotion doesn’t come back with the memory. The visual memory of my daughter’s death is relatively ingrained in my head - I can *see* the hospital room, my now ex wife, the nurse, the machines, the shrill scream of my ex mother in law when they pronounced her, etc. but I have no emotional feeling in my body when I recall the memory. My therapist essentially just didn’t know how to respond. We were trying to do some EMDR around some other traumatic event (not my daughter’s death) and she kept asking me to relive my emotions and I just stared blankly at her saying I can’t do it and she stared blankly at me not understanding why not (and not in a mean way, my therapist is amazing and I credit her with me even being alive today). She asked me how far back I can recall an event with emotional feeling and I told her never - for me this is my normal and all I know. I kind of knew that people could feel the emotions from a memory but I never have been able to, it’s just how life is for me. I know I feel emotions... sometimes. I will cry at a random TV commercial for who knows what reason. But I also know I don’t have emotions during a lot of events as they happen as well though - I know I go through it in a completely logical manner just to get through it. Like the hospitalization and eventual death of my daughter I remember solely thinking about my wife at the time, doing whatever I could to console her and not thinking about myself in any way. It may be why I have a detached feeling about the whole thing or a lack of emotional memory because I was so wrapped up in someone else’s emotions I didn’t leave room/energy for my own. 

I don’t know what to make of this emotionless memory thing. I already feel overwhelmed with life as it is now and the thought of reliving past traumas and actually feeling it all sounds horrendous. ",23Jan2019,1

140,"I would get up each morning and turn on some upbeat music while I quickly get ready for school. I'd be out in 20 minutes, walking fast enough and be there some 7-9 minutes before my bus would arrive, while all that time checking an important for me feed, while also listening to some music. I get to the bus stop and first thing, I greet the couple people that are my friends.. 3 of us start chatting. We're talking all the time, even in the bus. We're laughing. It is effortless, it is fun. I offer them some salty biscuits from yesterday and 2 of us laugh that the 3rd one is always on a diet. That continues till we get to school. I'm talking moderately in the group, I'm not the soul of the party but I'm not the one that never talks. In school i know and greet about half the people from my class. I am a little bit shy, but everyone knows I'm outspoken and enjoy talking to people and doing things with them, like go to the store in the big break or asking them in the break about their French vocabulary. I wear comfortable clothes, the colours are mostly purples, pinks, yellows and blacks, that'd be my pants.. I wear snickers.. In class I raise my hand about 3 times on average. I can comfortably go to the board and explain a concept I have learned to the class. 
It's just so weird because.. all these things I've described.. they sound so normal, so natural..for everyone... sure, some are a bit more shy than others, some raise their hands 2 times every lesson.. 
Somehow I just realised what I wanted, and what I truly feel like being inside. What I've described above that is. If I didn't have these limitations and then the thoughts that resulted from them.. what a wonderful person I'd have been..
I don't know if to post this.. I don't know.. 
I don't know I don't need someone to contradict me.. or to tell me neurotypicals have problems too.. or to tell me to accept my situation already.. or to say they're sorry??? Don't need anyone to tell me this is just the life I have.. cos I know all of that",23Jan2019,1
141,"Every now and again, for maybe 30 seconds max, I'll have a moment of just genuinely considering how much longer I can keep going before I end up killing myself despite the fact I am not mentally ill in anyway.

I know we can all male edgy jokes like ""oh I'll just kill myself"", but this is different; It's like my mood changes and I become deadly serious for the short time I'm thinking about it. 

And then I'll just go about my day like these thoughts never even happened; It's so weird. 
As of now I think it may be a side affect of my edgy sense of humour and past history of mild depression. But to be honest I think even that is far fetched. 

I'm just looking for an outside perspective based on this to be honest.",23Jan2019,1

143,"I am an 18yo female and my parents won’t let me go to therapy. I have been through a lot of stuff they don’t know about and I simply cannot tell them. Because of everything that has happened and my nearly-abusive parents, I believe I may have developed Borderline Personality Disorder over the past few years, and it continues to manifest itself. It has caused me so many problems and my boyfriend is urging me to get help ASAP. Problem is, I don’t have the money and neither does he. I have talked to my parents multiple times, begging them to let me go to therapy. It always ends up in me crying, and my parents frustrated at me for even asking. They say I’m just being a teenager and I just *want* to have something wrong with me so I can be special. I literally showed them the list of symptoms and why I’m so concerned and they laughed. I need to approach them again because it’s geting out of hand but I’m terrified. Also, may I mention, they let my sister get therapy a while back for depression but they won’t help me. I just can’t help but think that if they knew who I am and what I’ve been through, they’d understand. Unfortunately I have no close relationship with them. What do I do, or what do I say?

TL;DR: My parents are dismissing my mental health issues for just being a moody teenager and will not let me see a therapist. ",23Jan2019,1

Its probably selfish of me to think this but I absolutely love being that friend that no one wants to talk to. Along side my dysfunctional family and me still not accepting my fathers death, I have to deal with this fucking gender dysphoria. I dont know how much of this shit I can handle anymore. I can't even come out and transition because of my family and religion. Let's not fucking mention the fact that I will probably also never find love because no girl fucking loves stupid ugly dykes likes me. I hate living as a female and even tho I told my mom, alongside the fact that I wanted to kill myself she didnt care and pretend like I said nothing. She absolutely does not care about me and no one does. The faster I come to that realization the faster I can move on in life and even possibly to the next one with no regrets. I'm so sick of my life. Everyone says it's going to get better but it isnt. It's been like this for years and the more I live the worse it gets. I'm tired of getting my Hopes up for no reason.

I try not to think about you, because it hurts too much. It hurts so bad and so deeply. You have hurt me in ways that no one should ever experience. You’re my mother. You should be my safe place, my protector, my teacher but instead you made it so I never feel safe, so I am always vigilant to protect myself. You taught me that I was unworthy of love and I still feel that if I’m being honest with myself. How can I be loveable when my own mother let her boyfriend put his filthy lips on a place on my body that should only be touched with permission. Now I view sex like it's disgusting, the complete opposite of what that experience should be. I hide my body because at such a young age it was on display without my consent. Hiding myself makes me feel in control which is something I didn’t feel at all for the first 20 years of my life. You taught me that the world is filled with horrible people so never trust anyone. Friends aren’t really your friends, they just want what you have. Men? They just want sex and if you don’t give it to them well then they’ll find it elsewhere. Family, family is there to lend you money when you’ve spent everything you had on things you don’t need, so now family steps in to pay your bills for you. How can I possibly unlearn all of this? I have not followed in your footsteps but I hear your voice daily. I fight it, constantly. It’s exhausting. I have friends but I hear you whisper don’t get too close. I trust my husband and he has never broken that but I hear you tell me it’s only a matter of time. Family? I got a new one and I love them dearly and never take advantage of what they’re willing to do for me. But I hear you whisper, they’ll do anything for you, let them. I wish you would get the fuck out of my head.  I have these thoughts that aren’t my own. You put them there and I will never act on them but sometimes they’re so loud all I can do is isolate myself and wait for your voice to quiet but I need help. A little weed and alcohol to numb the pain. Your voice never quiets in my sober mind. You haunt me like a ghost though you’re still around. A reminder of how my life could’ve been and I guess for that part I’m thankful. I am incredibly thankful that I am nothing like you. ",23Jan2019,1

151," One of the more looked over groups of people with mental health issues I feel is those of us who suffer in silence. Typically regarded as the strong/helpful/thoughtful/happy person in the group/family. Check on your happy friends/family members. Just because we always seem happy or something along those lines, doesn't that we are ok. But it goes both ways. We may think we're strong and can handle it ourselves, but we are wrong. So if any of you who are like me ate reading this with doubts towards seeking help because you think you can fix yourself, read my story. Hopefully you will realize sooner than I did that we are weaker that we could imagine since we've built our ""strong"" foundation on the premise of helping others out. 

 
 I have always been the person that's always there for others when needed. Wether it's mentally/physically/spiritually/emotionally, I'm always the supporting brace for everyone. Luckily, I have great group of friends that have had their fair share of issues and could spot something wrong with me through a happy and confident demeanor that I always wear. They reached in and pulled me up from the relentlessly consuming pit that I had fallen into. 


 I spent 17 years walking the edge of ""the pit"", skirting my own issues and insecurities by helping others and building upon the feeling that I'd get from doing so. When it all finally caught up to me, the foundation I had built was so brittle, and I had no idea how hard it was going to crash down on me. It hit me like a wrecking ball and destroyed the confidence I thought I had built myself up on. I was lost in the swirling void of depression and suicide. Even today as I sit here after seeking professional help, my mind delves into the darkest corner and my stomach sinks. But I'm learning to turn that negative energy into positive force. 


 I don't mean to ramble on, but I just wanted to say to keep an eye on your happy friends. We aren't as happy as we lead on. If you sense that something is off with us, it's most likely because something is. ",23Jan2019,1
