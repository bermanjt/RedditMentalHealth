0,"I feel like in all of my relationships, I put more effort into sustaining/entertaining and continuing it than the other person and I am tired. I did a social experiment to see ""ok, I'm not going to text anyone first. I'm not going to reach out first"". And guess what happened? NO ONE reached out to me. I felt sick. I started blocking ""friends"" on my phone and social media. I bend over backward for people and no one does the same. I have even experienced one-sided relationships where I thought we were BFFs but turns out, they didn't even feel we were friends, as they didn't invite me to their wedding and completely ignore me to this day. I feel lonely. I am single, never been in a real relationship and again, I feel like I never had a true friend group. I feel like I have not found that friend group that truly understands + gets me. Sorry for the rant, I just don't know what to do. I went to a therapist last week and they made me feel like ""I have everything going for me, why am I so anxious/worried"". But it does not feel like that at all.",02Jul2019,0
1,"Male 20. I've always had really bad mental health but within the last year I feel like it's gotten way worse. I constantly have anxiety attacks and I think about suicide multiple times a day. I genuinely don't think I'm going anywhere in life.. I'm confident that I have a mixture of autism, intellectual retardation, and expressive language disorder. I recently found out that I had not dreamt up some childhood abuse (sexual, physical, and mental). I have 0 desire to do anything with my life because I know for damn sure that I'm going to fail. A few months ago I got dumped and the girl suddenly didn't seem to give a fuck whether I live or die. I know I'm not an interesting person but I feel like I was always so kind to her. And she seemed very invested. I don't really understand how she could just drop me and act like I don't exist??? I've tried making friends and doing the online dating thing but I always get unmatched. I literally have nothing going for me. I really want to just die but Im too lazy to follow through with it. I'm ugly beyond repair and despite trying to put on weight I've been rapidly losing it. I have a therapist, and I know he's probably the best i could find but I don't really believe he's going to help.

I literally spend every day inside my house sitting on my phone, playing rocket league or watching porn/anime. Some mornings I can somehow get myself to go on a run and work out but that's becoming very rare. I eat decently healthy, but I feel like those two things don't really help.

I'm sorry to complain a ton but I really can't figure this out. Sorry for my poor formatting/grammar.",02Jul2019,1
2,"This morning I tried to do something I enjoy: watch the sunrise and just be in the moment. But, I came to a harsh realization while sitting and watching the sunrise: I will always be alone and I am not worth a lot and that, at the end of the day, I don't know where I am going in life. I constantly feel like I am drowning in work, finances, family, friends, fears, anxieties and I know turning to anyone would lead them to leave me . 

 I am so afraid to open up to anyone out of fear of sounding like I am complaining and that I am a loser. The last person I opened up to ended up leaving me and made it clear through so many conversations that he would rather help his ex than me, that he had so much to deal with and I should not be in it (I can't even blame him or hate him for it because at the end of the day I deserve it- I was not easy to deal with and he has so much in his life and I was just adding to everything even though I tried so hard to offer support). Every time I open up, I do something that make people let me go and make me forgettable. 

I  only look forward to working out and that is it now. Even when I know I should not go to the gym, that is the only place where I can prove myself and I find myself there.  

I am tired of falling asleep with so much worry and such fear of talking about it. 

I know what I am saying is a broken record, that I am a broken record. I am tired of hiding and fearing alone. I am tired of letting everyone down and disappointing everyone.

4,"I read that it's possible to be addicted to emotional pain, but at what point do you know that you've become somewhat reliant on it?

I'm not involved in an abusive relationship or anything, but I've realized that I might enjoy being in pain emotionally? Idk it's crazy, but as much as it hurts at the same time, there's this sick pleasure or contentment I feel when my heart constricts painfully in my chest. When it feels like I'm being squeezed to death inside. Is this normal? – well, I guess it's not, but is it that easy to slip into this?

I'm reading a lot of fanfiction and books and whenever a character is hurt in any way, I immediately emphazise but it's like as if I'm feeling their pain and I don't mind. 

This sounds so weird but is it really that abnormal  to feel this kind of enjoyment out of emotional pain or suffering. (Don't worry, it's not like that with real people!) Though it's weird that I hate it sometimes and other times I crave it.",02Jul2019,0
5,"For the past couple years, I've felt like I have multiple different personalities. Like, two different people in my head telling me what to do. For a long time I was easily swayed and gullible, and because of that, its hard for me to make decisions. I have mood swings, one minute I could be nice to my grandmother, the next I could be cold. I always feel like people are disappointed in me and always stare at me, so I try to raise high expectations, though I honestly dont mean to.

The only time I feel any true emotional feeling, it’s when I feel really sad and go into multi-day phases where I cant find a reason to even fake being happy. I’ve lost my true will and I’ve never understood y. I have never been through anything traumatic or scarring to lead me down this. I woke up one day and realized how I had no driving force and that any emotions I show in public is faked. I would even often find myself mimicking my peer’s laughs and adopting them as my own. Even now when I’m about to start 12th grade I still lack a true sense of joy or any self happiness. When I first smoked weed... the emotions starting coming back, but they aren’t permanent.

8,"I came upon a reddit post that has received over a hundred and fifty views/comments and is growing about marijuana use and its relation to causing psychosis.  My sons's college educated friends said it had nothing to do with his death.  I know he was having an psychotic episode and was not in control of reality.  He had been smoking frequently and then ate an edible.  The marijuana was built up in his body.  He told a friend he was feeling anxious, and then he was gone.  I first wrote what this has done to my son to 6 months after his death.  Six months after that, new findings were published about the daily marijuana and use and highly potent weed linking to psychosis.

11,"     Ever since I was younger I’ve always felt there is a person watching me.  Maybe not a person.  No way they could be a stalker gone this long without being caught.  They may not be visible or contactable, but I definitely feel them near.  I’ve felt them around me since age 7.  I’ve been living in fear of something that may not even be real. 

     When I was 7 my life took a turn for the worst.  I went through a few traumatic experiences as a young child. I didn’t have many friends and I didn’t trust many people.  That caused me to create an imaginary friend.  Yes, imaginary friends are absolutely normal as a young child, but this one was not a normal friend.  I created this one to go on adventures with me.  I wanted a friend I could tell everything to and play games with.  He was just that.  Until he came to life.  One morning I had awoken before everyone in my home.  I heard a knocking at my window.  There was a boy who looked exactly like my imaginary friend.  I was a child, so of course I thought nothing of it.  I ran out into the front yard.  We went on adventures, or at least in my mind we did.   In reality we just walked around the house a couple of time.  Around the 4th trip around he stopped and said “mother is calling me” I asked him to stay and he said “mother is coming”.  He took my hand and we ran to the front porch he said “close your eyes and open the front door.” I did as he asked.  He told me not to open my eyes until I was inside with the doors closed or mother would take my eyes.  I failed to do just that.  Before closing the door all the way I opened my eyes.  I looked outside and he was gone.  I felt a very large gust of wind.  The door slammed and I screamed.  Everyone in my house was still asleep.  I sat in the couch and watched cartoons.  Until everyone had woken.  My brother was first to leave his room.  I told him my story, but being 5 years older, he did not believe me.  I then told my parents and they told me it was just my imagination, but I should never go outside without them.  I never went outside without my parents.  My parents rarely went outside long enough for me to play.  I stayed inside and my imaginary friend oddly enough never came back. 

     There was were a few incidents when I was 9.  There was one night where I was left alone in my living room while my father was in his room, and my mother was in my brothers room with him.  All on the other side of the room.  While sitting on the couch I played a few games on my iPod touch.  None of which had sound because I was kept the sound off at all times.  At one point I began to hear strange noises around me.  I then heard someone whisper my name.  I screamed and cried until my mother came into the room.  I told her what had happened and it ended with my having to sleep in my brother room because I was too scared to sleep in my own.  
     
     Another incident that took place when I was 9 did not actually happen to me.  My brother was asleep in his bed one night.  All of the sudden he woke up to someone dragging him by his legs.  He had fallen back asleep while being dragged.  The next morning I found him under the coffee table.  He had scratches all over his back. They looked like nails.  As if someone or something had been clawing at his back.  

     When I was 10 my brother decided he would move out.  Missing him dearly, i moved into his room.  Oddly enough I felt more comfortable in his room than I ever did in my own.  Now any time I go into my old room, which is now the spare room, I’m overwhelmed with the feeling of being watched and I feel very uncomfortable and unsafe.  Although I was more comfortable in my new room, I still got senses of being watched.  

     When I was 11 I was up late watching YouTube to try and ease my mind.  It was around 2am when I began hearing a music box from an old toy playing in my closet. That, obviously scared me.  I tried to ignore it.  I continued watching YouTube.  I looked up and saw blood dripping from my ceiling.  I cried for my parents.  When they came in my room everything stopped.  I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night.  

     When I was 14 my brother and his wife came to live with my parents and I temporarily.  One night I was very sick and around 9:30pm I fell asleep.  Only 15 minutes I heard a crash.  I woke up and began screaming.  My brother and parents ran into my room and found me balled up in a corner with my (6ft tall) lamp under my bed.  My fan (which was broken and I never turned on) was violently shaking as it was spinning.  There was no possible way of my lamp getting underneath my bed as far as it did without something pulling it by the bottom from underneath my bed.  I was restless for the rest of the night.  I kept seeing shadow-like hands grabbing from under my bed.  I then left my room and sat in the hallway.  The doorknob of my front door began shaking.  I didn’t sleep until sunrise. 

     At the age of 15 (my current age as of now) at the beginning of January (2019) I was on a call with a friend on discord.  Him and I were having a fun time.  We watched videos together through a website and we just had a fun time talking.  Around 3am I heard objects in my room begin collapsing.  He knew about my past experiences with these things and how badly they scared me.  He heard my breathing begin to get heavier and much more rapid.  I have LED lights that hang over my bed.  During all of that my LED lights fell down.  I closed my eyes and rocked back in forth with my ears covered.  I began to hear shrieking.  I cried and I tried to block it out but it wouldn’t go away.  The sound wasn’t muffled no matter how hard I tried.  It went on for maybe 2 minutes before everything finally stopped.  I asked my friend if he heard all of that.  He didn’t know what I was talking about.  He just knew he kept saying my name and I wasn’t responding.  

     There were many restless nights during my childhood and I still struggle with that now.  It was never an issue with watching tv, playing games, or talking to people.  It was always me being too scared to sleep. I was too scared to leave my bed or the couch.  Too scared to leave a room or open a door.  I’ve always felt like there’s someone watching me.  I feel like that’s “mother”, as my old imaginary friend called her.  I’m too afraid to close my eyes because I’m afraid if I open them she may be there and she may take them.  I don’t get much sleep.  It is mostly at night or when I am home alone I am afraid of her.  Afraid she may appear at any moment and hurt me.  I had to start taking melatonin to make me tired so I would sleep.  Fear kept me from being tired.  

         Throughout the years I hear a lot of strange noises such as, footsteps, tapping, clicking, objects falling, music boxes playing, and muffled talking.  Even when completely home alone or late at night when everyone would be asleep.  I fear if something that doesn’t exist..",02Jul2019,2

 I am oblivious to the outside world, in a job that requires me to be present, have a hard time understanding people when they speak to me. I need detailed directions, but then I am unable to understand them, and/or get frustrated by oll the details necessary. 

Sometimes it sounds like ""hey, ponyboi, could you dhsuajansikn?"" 

""Can I what?""

""Can you diajdhskskkwis?""

""Sure."" (I have no idea what youve said but ive asked 5 times already).

 Im quitting my job because im not interested in the work (the only thing that made it bearable were the customers, and that's saying something). My coworkers tell me im stupid and wont listen to orders. I don't feel completely safe at work. Im not allowed to try new ideas. 
Also, its hard on my legs and knees, and the hours stress me out. I need out.

The other day I drew two art peices, went to the gym, went to work, started writing a song, composed it on piano, then tried my hand at baking (god i suck at baking, set the whole thing aflame). I still felt unchallenged and unproductive.
I tried reading, but i have a hard time reading for too long. Since thats hard for me, thats what im working on right now. I need a challenge. I miss college im studying enviornmental science. 

 Im scared to quit my job, but im tired of feeling anxious all the time at work. Its a frantic scramble of building things up that I think matter, only to be knocked down becauser they dont actually. 

im worried ill fall into depression again. if im not working and being creative, i begin to die a little more each passing hour.

I decided talk therapy was doing nothing for me, as my anxiety has been getting steadily more debilitating and I've been realizing the extent to which I'm extremely limited by it compared to my peers, especially in my relationship. So I checked out a counsellor who referred me to a CBT group.

I want to be pro-active, but I have ZERO context for speaking in front of other people about my anxieties. I have no idea what to expect except movies about psychiatric wards, which I know isn't the same. I am SHY. I am AWKWARD. I am ANXIOUS. This is a very strange situation. But I also want to make sure I make the most of it and don't just hide.

16,"Hi Reddit. I'm posting because today I had to call 911 because my wife seemed to be having a psychotic breakdown. She's been battling depression and anxiety for years, but this seemed to come out of nowhere. She's been unable to sleep at all the last few days, and she would have really chaotic and interrupted thoughts. She'd ask me if vaccines cause autism, then before I could answer, act like she had an epiphany about how to save the world from social media, then immediately move on to something else. She called her parents at 2:00AM to ask where our dog was, she would wake me up in the middle of the night to talk about how she feels like her and a celebrity are emotionally connected. I finally called 911 today because she called me while I was at work crying and unable to communicate why. While I was on my way home she would alternate between crying and saying she needed my help, and threatening to stab and kill me if I came home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called the police and they came by and decided to take her to a crisis intervention facility, and now she's being kept there for at least 72 hours. I'm worried sick, I can't focus on anything and I'm worried she's going to leave there in a few days and hate me, feeling like I betrayed her. I don't know what the next few days hold, but I don't even know what to expect.

anyway it builds and builds and i just start to feel like i rlly just hate everything and everyone and then all of a sudden i hate myself and i start thinking rlly hard about the easiest and closest way to kill myself in that moment.

I’ve always thought this level of depression was exaggerated but now I’m experiencing myself.

20,"Not trying to self diagnose or anything but just noticing a really concerning pattern in my behavior and wanted to know if others experience a similar thing or can comment on it. I have anxiety, which was very extreme when I was a teenager I am now 21. Had a full depressive episode last year on my birthday refused to go to my own party and decided to drive to LA by myself with no cell phone ...which looking back now definitely sounds somewhat manic. Anyways I’ve realized recently that because of very unhealthy codependency on my partners, I often times break down completely after a relationship is over. The beginning stage is extreme grief inability to even function and then eventually leads to anger. When it reaches that stage I go into a mindset of feeling so invincible and I start saying outrageous hurtful things to my exes that are absolutely not okay. And it makes me feel so good. Feel so powerful. Even though clearly they broke up with me and I’m reeling from the pain. The more extreme and wild the things I say the higher I get. Usually this is over text which makes it a lot easier. And I’m just swinging from “I love you so much please don’t ever leave me” to “you meant nothing to me and I’m gonna attack every one of your insecurities”. It’s fucked up and once I realize what I had done I feel like a piece of shit. My most recent relationship was very different than the previous ones described. Usually, my relationships are characterized by extreme highs and lows. While this one was much more calm as my infatuation was not as deep. I was really trying to monitor myself with my behavior because I don’t want to hurt people I actually love. When he ended up breaking up with me, and I was deep in the grief phase, I was drinking at 11 am passing out till 8 pm going to work on the verge of tears. And then eventually it turned into anger and hatred. Even though I told myself I would never tear someone down in this situation again, I ended up doing it. It felt so fucking amazing I was on top of the world. And I feel so disgusting saying that now. After I sent a long essay of a text to my ex with the most sarcastic passive aggressive ridiculous shit, I felt so good that I didn’t even care what he had to say. And then it was getting drunk one night and fucking some random person off a dating app that I maybe had 3 words with. When shit like this happens the adrenaline is crazy. I would show someone I’m close with the texts I had sent and they’d be in disbelief that I could even say things like that. It doesn’t even sound like me.

22,"A little less than a year ago I met a guy on a dating app. We chatted a bit and seemed to click well. We discovered we were practically neighbors and started dating very briefly. I would say from the time we matched on the app to the end was 3 months max. My mental health was deteriorating and the pressure to constantly put on a brave face (lie) and spend time together was just way too difficult. In his defense, I was not transparent in my reasoning for wanting to end things or about my struggles. About a month ago he reached out to me again to see how things were. I noticed on Facebook that in the 7 or 8 months since we split ways he had clearly dated and recently ended things with someone else. We chatted a bit via text and I suspected I knew what he wanted (a neighborhood rebound) so I decided to be totally honest. I told him that I was sick and had been hospitalized and was struggling greatly to just basically survive. I was kind of hoping it would scare him away. Instead, it did the opposite, he seems to have made it his passion project to “fix me”. He constantly asks to do things because he thinks it might make me feel better but it doesn’t. It puts me in a situation where I am reminded that I am not able to do basic things like a normal person. He also constantly asks me how I’m doing, if I’m feeling better, etc. I’m getting really annoyed that every single day I have to report back that no, I don’t feel good, I did not have a good day, this isn’t going to get better (in the sense that mental health will always be something I struggle with, I know that there are waves of good times and bad times). He is just being a genuinely nice person it turns out but his good intentions make me feel horrible. I’ve tried to explain this to him delicately but I’m sure it is difficult for him to understand because he hadn’t experienced it, which I’m glad because it sucks! But in the meantime I feel like my only out is to just ghost him because he is just not getting it and I quite honestly don’t have the energy to be a decent person. Unfortunately, like I previously mentioned, he is my neighbor so I feel totally trapped. I feel, well actually, I objectively know that either option (asking him to stop trying to fix me or ghosting him), I am the jerk because I’m frustrated by his kind gestures but I am just treading water here and like I said, simply do not have the energy to be delicate about this.",02Jul2019,2

\-I cry in my room for hours or (intermittently) for days, listening to music loudly and sometimes locking the door so nobody hears or sees me, because I don't want to look like a self pitying piece of shit (grandma's words, but pretty accurate)

\-I vow to change myself, start cleaning up my room, usually lasts about a week.

\-repeat

&amp;#x200B;

For brief background info as to why i may have gotten to this point:

Up until about 4 years ago, I lived in a shitty trailer in the middle of nowhere. my family smoked indoors, I didn't have my own room, spider infested, everything always looked dirty. When I was 12 or 13, we moved to where we live now. A modest house in the middle of a pretty average suburb. When we moved, I finally had my own room. Along with the age at which we moved, this meant I suddenly went from my parents babying me all of the time, to having all these new responsibilities to adjust to. The problem is, I didn't. I can follow orders just fine, but I'm absolutely shit at following long term orders. Lifestyle changes, taking care of myself, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

As for grandma, yes I've been told by friends that they think she's emotionally abusive. While that may be true, it doesn't change the fact that I NEED to make these changes. So, does anyone know even the smallest way I might could head in the right direction with this? It's such an easy change, I really hate how my family says that I ""don't care"" about anyone because I (allegedly) make the conscious choice not to do these things. I just, I really don't know what the root of this issue is.",02Jul2019,4
24,"Hi, friends,

I'm turning 21 this month, and I've been going through this since I was 14. I constantly feel disconnected from reality, myself, and the people around me, and I have for 7 years without it letting up except for once recently. It all began when I was hospitalized for my first suicide attempt and a self harm addiction. I was put on Zoloft, and ever since then, I've been like this. At first it was so fucking neat to feel so disconnected from everything. I wasn't afraid. I was really happy that I was able to feel something other than the crippling depression I had felt since I was 8 or 9. I've been on several different antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications since, but it just never goes away. Over the years I continued to attempt suicide and continued self harming in any way I could. I feel like I'm in this constant dream-like state, and it is so tempting to go back to my old ways so that I can actually feel alive every once in a while.

It let up recently when I was put on a steroid pack to see if it would help unrelated symptoms and possibly help get me closer to an autoimmune diagnosis. It was wild. I felt so awake and alive for the first time in 7 years. (Though, they still haven't admitted I have an autoimmune disorder yet.) Ever since then, I've been having a much harder time coping with this. I got to experience what I've been missing out on for so long and what it really feels like to be alive and to FEEL. It was panic inducing having to let that go. I knew I would be hard. I just didn't know it would be this hard. It's now really affecting my relationship with my partner, myself, and everyone around me. My partner and I haven't even had sex but once in the past two months (it's usually almost every day), and I hardly give him any attention anymore. I know this is hurting him too. He feels so unwanted. I just can't focus on sex or affection right now. There's too much going on in my head at any given time. It doesn't help that I'm 3 years into recovery from Anorexia Nervosa with Bulimic tendencies, and I've really been struggling to fight off a relapse and all of the horrible thoughts my EDs put in my head. The only thing I can focus on is studying. I've taken to borrowing old text books from when the doctors I work under were in med school. I read a new one every week or so and take notes for each one then study my notes and take practice tests online for whatever course. Really all I can focus on is learning as much as I possibly can so that I can just take the final exams for certain courses instead of taking the whole class. That way I can start working on my M.D. sooner. Learning just seems to be the only thing I have any control over anymore.

All of this has my anxiety on full blast. I think I'm starting to experience delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations again, but I can't tell if any of it is real or if it's just my brain's shenanigans. I have a hunch that some of it isn't real, but what if it's not? What if I'm wrong? I don't think I was ever diagnosed correctly either. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder plus my eating disorders, but I just don't think that's right anymore. I feel like this more than MDD now.

I don't know. I just feel so alone in this right now. I feel like my support system can empathize with me, but they'll never know how miserable I am right now.

I'd really love to hear if anyone has some advice for a struggling youngin like me or if anyone would mind sharing their similar experiences with me.

Thanks for reading, folks.",02Jul2019,1

Then 3 days ago I remember just feeling manic, I wanted to buy plane tickets to meet my friends across the country I was geeking out.  Then I wake up in the morning with a full night sleep and I feel awful, super anxious and super depressed.  I’ve felt pretty bad since that day and now I’m sitting in my bed wanting to kill myself so bad, I don’t even know why I am alive.

31,"TLDR: I have psychosis and think I might be on the Truman Show. Pls help.

Hi, I've never been to this sub before, and I don't know where else to post. For some background, I am bipolar (2 I think). I didn't know this until I was diagnosed at the beginning of this year. It has not helped my lifestyle, and my lifestyle has not helped my disorder. That lifestyle includes being (literally) nocturnal, eating unhealthy foods whenever I'm hungry, not doing laundry, not cleaning my room, and using too much weed and sometimes too much alcohol.

I often experience psychosis, which of course is not unordinary. I am aware that many of my lifestyle choices make my symptoms worse, and I try to think accordingly when they arise. Normally, things don't get too out of hand, but lately my ""delusions"" have felt far too real. The delusions in question usually center around surviellance. I *hate* feeling as though I'm being watched, so cameras and microphones freak me out. I also get paranoid when I speak with people. Somebody will say something that sounds specific to me, and I will assume they are talking about me. Sometimes I think I hear compliments, sometimes I think I hear criticism. It is super distracting, and I avoid (too) many interactions to avoid feeling this way.

I am currently experiencing a combination of these symptoms:  I have been watching Twitch live streams, and the paranoia kicks in. I thought that a guitarist was criticizing my guitar recordings, that a pianist was criticizing my piano technique, or that a chat streamer was criticizing my lifestyle. The ""criticism"" is usually pretty specific and accurate. A lot of people have also started giving advice about depression when I've joined their streams, but that's a pretty common subject.

Now, the obvious response: *They're on my computer, they can't be talking to me!*

And the other response: *They dont even know me, they can't be talking about me!*

I have been saying that over and over, but every time I get back on the internet, I notice stuff that only reinforces this feeling. So, I currently have three scenarios in my mind, ordered from most to least likely:

1)  I'm manic and reading into mundane patterns of body language and speech. I see a coincidence and it freaks me out.
2)  My life is being filmed for the entertainment of others, and it is being kept from me. Maybe they kill me off as the show's finale, who knows? :)
3)  This is all a simulation and I am the only ""sentient"" being, if you call it that. I mostly entertain this idea for fun.

Option #1 is the only one that I consider logical, but I have seen enough to make me scared. As I mentioned earlier, I hate the feeling of being watched. If I'm just having delusions, how do I get rid of them?",02Jul2019,1

41,"Dear Reddit,

Please help me and give advice. I don’t know what disorder I have, or what’s going on with me. I’m looking for a therapist and psychiatrist currently, but would like to connect with people who may feel similarly to me and can help me determine what mental condition I could be suffering from. I realize not everyone here is a certified professional, but if anyone has had similar feelings and could guide me towards a potential explanation in the form of a label, I’d be truly grateful. I haven’t been compliant in the past as I thought I was beyond help/in denial over having something wrong with me.

When I’m alone, I feel intense loneliness — the kind that feels like physical pain. It interferes with my daily life, as I drink alcohol and over-consume marijuana most nights of the week to numb the pain. I come off as extremely needy, sometimes texting girls way too much, so I’m perpetually single, even though I’m objectively good looking. 

When in relationships with people I really care about, I lash out in anger and frustration in response to situations beyond my control. For example, I lashed out at a girl with whom I had a great friendship with for not wanting to hang out with me as much anymore or respond as often since we would text every day before that. I texted her way too much to even count, it’s something I’m very ashamed of. It feels like I have a compulsion to text when I’m upset. I don’t know why. I don’t curse, threaten, or hurt them; however, I’m told that I’m aggressive, but when I am supposedly aggressive, I don’t feel frustrated, but in hindsight, I can objectively view myself as having been aggressive. Maybe the frustration comes from anxiety, which I’ve suffered from most my life.

I feel very anxious most days, and I have lost interest in things that I’ve used to care about. It feels as if there’s a pressure in my brain, almost like a golf ball being lodged beneath my skull.

I can’t remember the last time I’ve felt joy, wonder, or awe from events that should elicit such feelings. I feel disconnected from others, always feeling like I’m on edge. I’m jumpy. I can get over-talkative when with friends and can’t stop my motor mouth. I feel like I’ve lost control.

I’m tired of destroying friendships. I really want to turn my life around. There’s something wrong with me and I don’t know what it is. I want to change so badly to live a happier life. It pains me more than anything that there are ex friends out there in the world whom I can’t ever contact again because of being blocked. When I was younger, I was the complete opposite: calm, collected, rational. Now, it’s the opposite.

TLDR; anxious, angry, drinking and smoking to numb pain, can’t focus on work because while working I’m lonely since I can’t speak to others. I can’t feel anything except anxiety, rage, and a type of happiness that feels hollow. I’m tired of losing friends. Does anyone have similar experiences where it’s gotten better? What did you do? What were you diagnosed? 

It’s hard trying to look from the outside in, when you’re in it.

Thank you all so much.",02Jul2019,2
42,"tw- depression, self harm, suicide

I'm 23 and feel guilty for feeling the same depression I did during my high school years and feel guilty for feeling compelled to go back to my self harming tendencies. I have a hard time picturing myself making it to 25. I just don't feel that I can ever find a comfortable feeling of contentment and that this numbness I feel everyday is just supposed to be a norm. I don't know how to reach out as I am no longer a student or dependent and do not have any health benefits to try and offset the cost of therapy and do not have a family doctor. Living in Ontario I do have OHIP but that doesn't cover psych visits.

I figured I would improve as I moved through adulthood but now I feel more depressed than I have before. As a teenager I knew what options I had for help but I'm lost as to what to do as an adult. I don't know how to mend my job around this and maintain my expenses as I've been missing work due to my depression. 

I don't know if this post is more of a cry for help or just a general frustration as to not knowing how to cope with this illness as an adult and feeling as if everything else is against me.

49,"I've wanted to die since I was a child, and I tried to understand why I should or should not. It feels like many people assume that depression is always this BIG negative thing, a huge monster, or pain that runs on a rampage in your mind that you need to fight. But for me there's no monster. There's just silence. A sterile white room with a clock ticking on the wall. That's what people don't understand. The dials move painfully slowly and you don't know how long you have to wait. Each hour you hope that the next one will be the last. It's not a dramatic event so it doesn't get better or worse, but you get more and more annoyed and hopeless.

They also assume that there is this scale with the pro's and the con's of life. They assume that you put your positive life experiences and memories against the negative ones. Yeah, I had good and bad things happen in life, and they mattered a lot to my parents and family, but they never held much weight for me, outside of the fact that they made my parents happy. In any other aspect this was enough. But many things don't hold as much weight for me as others think they do. I don't even know what makes me happy because it never seemed to matter. I didn't want to confront anyone with my own opinions so I accepted theirs.

Therapy and suicide prevention is like an extension of this stupid game. It's like, okay, okay, fucking okay, I'll do everything you want. I'll be what you want me to be, again, another day, another hour. Then I stare at the clock and ask myself how long do I have to do this. At some point it becomes just an annoyance.",02Jul2019,1
50,"So this is a less serious problem then a lot of other people on this sub but I just feel like I’m becoming an awful, unlikeable person. I feel like I’m much more sensitive and more likely to blow up at my friends and loved ones over the most minute things and sometimes I’ll just have an underserved bias against someone close to me who I like. For example, anything they do is much more likely to annoy me and get me angry for no particular reason. I always look back on these moments when I’m alone and I hate myself for it and regret it but it’s like I have no control in the moment. I just wish I could have control over myself again.",02Jul2019,2
51,"After a stint in the hospital for mental health related issues, I was prescribed lexapro. I’ve been on lexapro 20mg daily dose for 3 months now. 

For the most part it helps round out my highs and lows and I’ve had a pretty good response. Except for my libido. I have none. It’s miserable! And it’s starting to seriously weigh on my marriage. Without going in to too much detail, my wife and I were very active before this medication. Now, I have zero interest. No drive what so ever.

53,"After using five of my ten weeks of medical leave I had to speak with my doctor. I explained to him that the soonest the psychiatrist could see me for intake was 6-8 weeks, that's just how the system is though. We discussed my options, and both knew I was going to have to return to work sooner then either of us found ideal. I'm told I need antipsychotics, and despite my therapists advice it's out of my doctors knowledge and he had referred me to the psychiatrist. So we decided the fourth would be an ideal return week, as I'm in the plastic injection molding field for automotive parts.

Meaning; when all the ford and Chevy plants close for the holidays we do too. So a short three day week would be my best shot at re-entry. I saw my therapist today and she asked me how I felt about my return and I told her I'm trying not to. I knew if I succumbed to my anxiety the boat was sunk and I was out of a job, I had all the equipment I could manage to brace myself for this war but the process is ongoing. I've been on 20mg of lexapro for anxiety (a symptom of my overall illness) for over a month and he wrote me a script for 30 xanax to be taken as needed as a crutch until I get the meds I do need from the psychiatrist.

Leading into my day at work my anxiety started to play tricks on me. I went in to ""what could go wrong?"" mode, I had to check the stove. I hadn't used it all morning, but i couldn't leave it on so i had to check. I had to check multiple times to make sure I had everything. I had a social encounter at the front door of my apartments and I had to flee, I didn't want to deal with people as something could go wrong. My therapist told me that I had won some battles and should feel good, but I gave her a metaphor. It's hard to feel positive about a few small battles when Gettysburg is on the horizon.

45 minutes before work I downed my first xanax, that way it would kick in and give me 15 minutes to relax before I left for work in a safe environment. I contacted the only other person I knew like me, as they think I have schizophrenia but it's up to the psychiatrist to diagnose and prescribe. Their little help was invaluable in the form of well wishes. The first two hours were shaky, because my last two experiences in work were terrible, the first resulting in my leaving an hour in (nausea, light headedness, dizziness, and feelings of fleeting conciousness) and prompting me to begin my mental health journey. The second time was a week into lexapro and the side effects hit me like a brick wall, I had a panic attack and hit a pulse of 152 and no one took me seriously and brushed me off several times until I demanded their attention.

So needless to say I was worried about today, but a xanax in I just focused on the idea of the medicine helping to keep my disassociation at bay, and admittedly I had four times of sheer mounting panic. Times where I thought ""I need to take a walk. I need to get out of here."" But I've come to learn that at the end of that walk comes the dread of going back and resubjecting myself to the experience so I stayed put and fought it with every coping mechanism I knew. About mid shift I really felt the first xanax wearing off, and my anxiety went wild. I popped a second, which is entirely appropriate to what me and the doctor spoke of. That mellowed me out and the rest of the night went smoothly.

But I did it, I managed my first ten hour shift back at work and it feels good to be somewhat normal again. I'm wary of celebration as I know all to well a good day today doesnt mean a bad day cant happen tomorrow. After about a week or so at the least I'll start to have a sense of normalcy in my life again. Nonetheless, I'm prideful of managing it even if it is admittedly the smallest of tasks to most people.

If you read my post, I just want to say thank you for both your time and effort its invaluable to me. And in doing so you shared an experience with me, and in a sense supported me. So, to end the post I just wanted to say that I care for each and every one of you who took the time out of their day to reach this sentence. Well wishes, and much love.",02Jul2019,10

57,"So, my girlfriend has been suffering from anxiety for a while now. For years even. We've been together 8 years but it's never been as bad as it has the past half a year or so. It's been a hard time for her having to finish her final year at university and I know it has really been a huge amount of stress on her. 

All of this began to really to a strain on our relationship and we have sort of almost split up a few times now. I never knew how bad it was until I finally had the courage to talk about my best friend about it, who went through a similar thing, although he was in my girlfriends position and not mine. 

When he began explaining about anxiety leading to depression and depersonalization disorder it all clicked, everything he was saying was how my girlfriend had been acting. It really upset me that I was unable to understand this before, I've always supported her and I've always stressed how important it is to talk about things but she seems unable to talk about it as I don't think she knows herself what is going on with her.

Last night I told her about depersonalization and about the experience my best friend had, she says she will read up on it today, we had a few heartfelt moments of understanding and we are planning on seeing each other tomorrow. I just want to be able to go into that with a better understanding a situation so if anyone has been through a similar situation please help me.

The hardest thing is sometimes I feel like she doesn't love me and sometimes I do. There's huge differences in our intimacy and I struggled, feeling more like a friend than a partner, my best friend told me that although he loved his girlfriend he also began to be less intimate with her which led to her feeling the exact way I do.

Thank you in advance for any help you can offer.",02Jul2019,1
58,"Hi all, so firstly in October 2017 I had my first bad stage with anxiety, stomach felt in knots, head spinning and constant ruminating thoughts. After searching the internet so find it what it could possibly be I came across schizophrenia and honestly ever since then I have been panicking looking it up in the internet, trying to reassure myself I don’t have it and then I question myself when I see they symptoms of it “ what if someone did poison my food” or “ what if no one really is loyal to each other” silly thoughts like this which cause great anxiety but I don’t believe these thoughts do not get me wrong sometimes It feels like the anxiety makes it more powerful but then I came across ocd which I’ve had symptoms of since I was 6/7. Has anyone at all had the same worries or thoughts or even just worries about having another mental disorder?

I told him 3 months prior before my coming departure  August BTW. For about a month and a half of this time, he offered me more money and a promotion. That's not the bad part, he kept bringing up to me every day I saw him. He said things like: I can help pay your bills, I want you to be my guy, and I want you to be my right hand. He just kept reminding me everyday of my money situation and how staying will solve alot of those problems. Asked me everyday ""have you decided to stay?"" He would bring it up to me while I'm cooking in the middle of my shift, coming over awkwardly close and whispering about the things he wants from me if I stayed. I finally told him I managed to solve most of it at least and that I was firmly leaving and he seemed to drop it for the most part.

Since I've moved to Peru, i've been in 3 different relationships. I really liked all three, but all of them went to shit the moment that we were starting to transform our relation from friends to something else. They would invite me on a date and i'll just put excuses for no reason, until they just vanished from my life. One of them, went into tears when I explained them for the third time why I thought that most of the things I said to her were all lies. When I say something like ""you're pretty"", ""I like you"" or ""you make me happy"" I really mean it. But when it comes to ""I want to be with you"" or ""we should go on a date"" I'm just lying to her to make her stay with me a bit longer.

I'm slowly pushing away my family from me, I haven't talked to my best friends in 6 months, I haven't talked to my grandparents since christmas and my parents don't even know what is going on with me, i'm having this image of ""everything is cool"" with them and i'm affraid of suddenly telling them ""i think i'm depressed, i want to go to a psychologist"" because it would ruin my relation with them

62,"Ultimately ""terrified"" probably is an understatement, or just the wrong words here. Today I got 3 wisdom teeth removed. Leading up to it, I've pretty consistently discovered new highs of anxiety and stress every time I thought about it. About 12 hours after surgery, it's only gotten worse. I feel like I'm in the middle of a minefield full of ways I can accidentally make everything worse than it already is, and I'm still paranoid something went wrong. I have some pretty major trust issues and knowing I was in a room completely under anesthetic surrounded by who knows how many people terrifies me. I could barely even feel the anesthetic, the doctor just said ""I started putting the anesthetic in"" and then it was 2 hours later and I was somewhere else. I really, really don't like that and I have no idea why. I feel scared, I don't know why but I'm crying for the first time in awhile. 
What makes things worse is that in a few weeks I'll have to get about 3 cavities filled. On one hand I really want to see if going completely out again is an option because I feel sick to my stomach at just the thought of having to listen to the sounds of my teeth being ground away, but on the other hand I know I'll get the same paranoia as this time.

I push myself. I enjoy pushing myself. It satisfies me to see how far I can walk with eating and drinking as little as possible. Even when I collapse during gym class. Even when my body is a mess of aches and pain. I push myself. 

I find satisfaction in burning myself out by coming home from school and studying until my brain is fried. It keeps the guilt and worries and stress away. And when school is out, I miss it, and I push my body even harder to compensate for not being able to push myself academically.

66,"Feels weird to write about something so trivial, compared to what appears on the front page but I figure that's the best place I can think of to ask about something, since I am fairly sure it's a mental thing rather than physical, despite how it feels.

Ever since I can remember I had this thing, when doing some repetitive and precise physical task a frustration would build up in me, but I am not sure how to describe how this frustration feels. It's a bit like being extremely stressed by something, but it's strongest in the muscles used. To release it I need to violently move my body and preferably do something audible. 

An example of such a task would be pouring water when making coffee in a drip, which requires pouring it over a minute or two, in circular motion. Or when cutting the ends of green beans, when my workflow is optimized it starts to get frustrating. 

It also happens with less physically demanding tasks, like when I am programming and have a situation where I have to repeat something on multiple lines, a sequence of keys. Like `arrow down, end, arrow left, backspace, Q, repeat`. I start to get in the flow of repeating this sequence and the frustration builds up again. The same when playing a video game which requires a repeated sequence.

It's not something that's really affecting my life negatively, I can always take a break and release the tension, but it's annoying enough that I'd like to know what it is, if it has a name or if it's a symptom of something else.

I never noticed how much I need it untill I started sleeping with random people to feel a bit loved and wanted. 
I felt that going to strangers and asking for a hug would not only be weird but it wouldn’t be honest, I wanted that loving and affectionate hug, you know? So I thought that sex would help, I mean it’s just another form of physical contact after all.

I know I bring more trouble than I am worth but there has to be smth (idk what it is though) about me that’s nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep it short but answer anything someone asks and put my reason for posting towards the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been off work for a significant period of time and I am struggling with returning. I was appointed a Consultant psychiatrist maybe after three months of being off work (long time but was unpaid). First report stated to return to work on a casual basis with the recommendation being 2 half days a week for the first three weeks and regular doctor's visits.

I went in literally a handful of days but have been attending doctors appointments throughout except for twice and those two times costs me about 5 days worth of medical evidence which was marked down to unauthorized absences.

&amp;#x200B;

I was scheduled another appointment with a Consultant psychiatrist a few days ago and received my report today from my doctor is said it was pretty brutal.

&amp;#x200B;

So my reason for posting is, i feel kind of shit and confused about my character after what he said. I am willing to discuss how I felt during the appointment but anything I want to say seems beneficial to my own case and I'm hoping someone can just look at it and maybe give me examples of similar cases in their own lives, or give me some sort of advice.

&amp;#x200B;

The report said multiple things but here is some of the things that has me feeling a bit like an idiot

""Although Mr HorHam reports that he is unconfident, depressed and anxious, his presenation is inconsistent with these allegations and there is evidence of feigning of impaired memory and exaggeration of memory impairments.  Accordingly, I do not consider the he can be diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnosis and as opposed to abnormal illness behavior in the context of low conscientiousness.""  


""In my opinion, no further treatment will improve his capacity as his problem is motivational rather than related to illness.""

They did some tests and said I was physically fine, and then gave me a benzo to calm down.

Now it’s Tuesday, and I’m about to go to work. Last night I had some moments where I felt normal again, but I’m still generally shaken up- still kinda jittery and still having to put intention into my breathing.

I’m basically wondering- how long do y’all think it will be until I’m back to baseline? I want the jitteriness and anxiety to go away. I want to feel 100% fine again but idk how.

I live in nyc and I wish I had a friend to stay with or a safe place to go or somethin. Anyone got any tips in general to get through this? This shits hard lol.

Thanks all!! :)",02Jul2019,2
81,"Hi all, I have a question for you. Title says it all. Here's the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I am in year 12, have no motivation to work or do well at school. I was always that kid who did well at school got dux and all that in yr 8. My parents have expectations of me to do well - to try and do my best. Don't really give a shit about doing well though anymore. I don't always have motivation to do any other stuff either. I am preparing to study classical music in uni next year, need like a 60 ATAR (on an 90 rn). Sometimes that's all I want to do, sometimes I don't care about anything. 

I feel very unstable in my moods, see above. Sometimes I'll spend days feeling crap with no explanation then days feeling like the best bloke ever. Doesn't make sense. Maybe that's just how people work. Maybe it's just teenage mood swings.

I lose my temper really bad, like total dangerously pure rage. Maybe I'm just a dickhead who doesn't have any self control.

I self harm, but maybe it's only for attention.

I never eat properly. Maybe that's just because I'm too much of a pussy to be a normal fucking human and eat like everyone else.

I am a liar. Maybe i'm just a shit person

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone else seems to have worse problems than me. Maybe I'm just weak and being an attention seeker. Mental health is important, but it's not a justification for a shit personality. What do you think? SHould I get help or shut the fuck up and grow up.",02Jul2019,1

87,"After 7 or so months of debating about whether I just get checked by a doctor or not, I finally did it a few weeks ago. I was always under the impression that there was something wrong with me, but after months of this worsening condition, I realized that I'll never know if it's true if I don't get myself checked out.

  


I was told that I was being too hard on myself, and that they don't see any sign of mental health issue. This result was rather unexpected, but I do believe that I was at fault here. I told the doctor all my past insecurities which may have molded me on what I am today, and though I think of it from time to time, I realized that I do not care about it. Most of the stuff I told the doctor was about how things happened and what I believe was the result of it, not how I am actually thinking right now. I was clearly at a loss to find out that I was just being too hard on myself and I was at a stage where I'm finding my individuality, when all the other arrows of my life are pointing to something bigger. Being a ""yes man"" did not help, as I just answered some of their questions with bullshit I never did care about.

  


I'm not judging their conclusion, but I do know there's something more within me that I never told them. Weeks have past, and I've been following their advice on ""enjoying life"" as I will regret this in the future. But still, there's this lingering emptiness that I feel from before that will not subside by spending time with friends and doing random stuff. The constant hate somehow diminished, but will return otherwise. Trying to reconnect with friends just causes more isolation. My dreams are just not fucking possible. This job and life feels more lethargic than ever, as I realized that I really do not care about anything than being Thanos snapped out of existence.

  


Why do I still feel this way? Why doesn't anything seem so interesting? Why can't I think straight? Why is the world still gray? I look at the future, and I don't see anything that will make me feel better. My actions and thoughts seem so oddly similar to BoJack Horseman, only without the abusive and traumatizing past. I'm wasting my life, and I'm starting not to give a shit about it. I'm trying, but I just fucking suck.

  


I have made a decision to give myself a few months to see where the doctor's advice brings me, and if it brings me nowhere, I might as well see another one. It's honestly good to know that there's nothing wrong with me, but this shit that's going on will kill me, I know.

  


If I'm overreacting, then people here have it worse. I feel like shit already, how do the others fare in this world? Hope you guys are doing good.",02Jul2019,1
88,"I had some things on my mind that I did not feel I could accurately articulate on Twitter (ya know, where the depressed people reside). I am 23 years old. Enjoy! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR How I became depressed over two years. I am doing better now. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past two years, I have been going THROUGH it mentally. In the beginning of my spiral into depression, I was the healthiest that I had ever been. I had developed healthy habits in the form of exercising and dieting and lost a bunch of weight. My body fat percentage was around 15-17% while weighing 215 pounds. I looked great and felt great which made me feel even more confident than I naturally was. My grades were good, and during this time I was able to earn a lot of playing time on my college baseball team, eventually leading to being our opening day starter the following year ( I was a pitcher, and there are 20 pitchers on any given college team, innings are not easy to come by). Furthermore, my girlfriend and I had a happy, healthy relationship which was still kicking after 4 years together. I got a really nice car and was making all my payments. I lived with four of my good friends. I adopted one of my moms dogs. Shit was going good. 

&amp;#x200B;

When our lease was up, I moved in with my older sister because she lived right by my school. Having a dog was an issue not only for me (which I didn't even realize), but my brother-in-law too. For me, I underestimated how much responsibility having a dog was. Just being at the house to feed her at regular times was difficult. Being a college athlete meant my day usually started at 7am and I would get home around 6pm or even later. Me and my weimaraner were not good for each other but I loved her to death. After about two months of living with my sister and her husband, they asked me to get rid of the dog or move out. With no where to go, I told them I would leave. My mom (to which I was a dependent) had moved to San Antonio so living with her was not an option. My dad was going through his own shit and didn't have room at his house anyways. Luckily for me, my uncle stepped up and offered me a spot at his shop about 30 mins from school. He owns a small business and outfitted part his shop to be like a little apartment by adding a kitchen, bathroom, and shower. My ""room"" was a 10x10ft office with tiled floor, no insulation, and it was winter. I had an air mattress, my dog, and my PS4. It was not ideal, but beggars can't be choosers. I was just glad that I didn't have to move in with my girlfriends family because that was my last resort. I lived in this office for about three months until my uncle needed the office space for work, so he bought a tiny, dingy camper for a couple hundred dollars and parked it in the yard of the shop. This was my new home for the next five months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after moving into the shop, I lost my main source of income. I was working three part time jobs, and I lost the one that paid the same amount (about $240, basically my car payment) every two weeks with minimal time put in. When this happened, I remember having a panic attack at work. I called my mom and explained what was going on, crying and honestly trippin'. I have always been a ""cool, calm, and collected"" person and never got too high or too low, so a panic attack was something new for me. God bless my mother because I know she could barely afford it, but she offered to send me at least $100 (usually more) out of her checks to help with my car payment and insurance (which was $260, fuck) while I'll tried to work more. The rest of that school year was fucking hard. M/W/F I had team weights in the AM, class all day, practice from 2-6pm, then a shift at the YMCA at least one of those days. Tuesdays and Thursdays I would work for my uncle for 4-5 hours in the morning, then go to practice. The weekends I would work at the YMCA. I was basically making just enough to pay for my car payment and insurance, then I lived off of what my mom would send me. All of that plus taking 16 credit hours, baseball responsibilities, and dog responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a lot on my plate and I didn't handle it well. I stopped working out on my own regularly and stopped paying attention to what and how much I was eating. I knew I was gaining weight, but I didn't want to know what the scale said so I just didn't look. I started to feel sad all the time, pretty much whenever I was by myself. As a coping mechanism, I spent all my free time smoking weed and playing Fortnite, isolating myself and not giving my girlfriend attention or ever hanging out with my friends outside of practice. I'd always been a pothead, but for the time I was living in the camper, it was different. I wasn't smoking just to enjoy the high and relax, I was smoking to \*forget\* why I was so sad. I became addicted Fortnite. Besides smoking, it was literally the only thing that I wanted to do. That semester, I got my first ever F in Probability and Stats, along with two C's and two B's. I had always got good grades with minimal effort, it was just who I was. But that semester (spring), I couldn't even find the motivation to turn in homework. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once our actual season started, I had to give my dog back to my mom. This is because we play about five games a week, and if they are out of state, then we would be gone for at least 3 days, sometimes more. My year had not quite unfolded the way I thought when I got her. Like I said earlier, my performance in the previous season allowed me a lot of opportunities for playing time. I could not find a way to be a consistently effective pitcher and my stats were dogshit that season. I knew I had gained at least 30 lbs but I still didn't want to look. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come summer time (last summer), my uncle was telling me to pay rent or move out of the camper so that he could get someone else to pay rent. There was no AC and I didn't want to pay rent on a shitty camper, so I moved in with my girlfriend and her family (even further from school, but they had always said that it was okay for me to live with them). I never wanted to move in with them because it made me feel like my parents weren't good enough. Having someone else's parents provide for you when your own parents are still in your life is weird. I was grateful however, and knew that I had a stable food and shelter. I had to enroll and pass two online classes in order to be eligible the next semester due to the fact that I had failed Prob &amp; Stats and the NCAA's stupid eligibility rules (spoiler, I didn't pass). A month into summer, the engine in my expensive car that I was barely keeping up with blew. It was an $8,000 fix. I had no idea what to do. I made a couple more payments then I called the bank and told them where they could pick it up (obviously, this ends up in a civil lawsuit). After that happened, I had to share my girlfriend's car. Moving in and sharing a room and car had a negative effect on our relationship (over five years at that point), but we persisted through it. There had never been an obstacle that her and I couldn't work through. The rest of the summer, my addiction to Fortnite only got worse, I was high all the time, and I further isolated myself. I had gained so much weight that I knew I was fat again, but I still did not want to check. My online classes made me anxious, so I would put it off only to make my anxiety worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Entering into the Fall 2018 semester (my 5th year) I was ineligible for competition (just for the semester) and really not sure if I was going to graduate. Just to make matters worse, I had to be at weights before 7am three times a week which meant that my girlfriend had to drop me off two hours before she had to work, and we lived too far away to drive back home. By the time of our six year anniversary (December), we were fighting on a weekly basis. By February, we were fighting every single morning, and then we would argue about something different in the evening when she picked me up after practice. I honestly thought that if we just made it to graduation, we could make things right again. Things would be better. In late April, we decided to take a break and we agreed we were not seeing other people. I was still living at her house, and the intention was to get back together after month or two of space. We were still talking and seeing each other every day, sometimes we even kissed. It was a weird situation, but we were not sharing a car any more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hit rock bottom in May. It was a Saturday night, and I didn't have the energy to play video games so I was just laying down on my phone sad as fuck. My 'girlfriend' (for sake of conversation) was out doing her thing with her friends. Now, I had always had thoughts about suicide. Not thoughts of killing myself, but the idea of suicide in general. That night, I couldn't get suicide out of my mind. I was actually contemplating it. I was just sitting there crying for an hour needing help and not knowing who to call. I went for a drive and ended up buying a pack of Marlboro reds. I drove around for an hour smoking and crying off and on. When I got home, I sat in the driveway for another hour and a half finishing the pack and still crying every 20 minutes. I was still out in the driveway when my 'girlfriend' got home and I startled her causing her to drop my MacBook Pro, which promptly made me angry and I said something along the lines of ""are you fucking kidding me? That's a $1400 laptop."" She could tell I had been crying but it was hard for her to give a shit. She went inside and I stayed in my car and cried and cried and begged her to come outside and sit with me and help me calm down. I told her I needed her more than ever and that I couldn't stop thinking about suicide. She refused to come outside and be with me, she just kept telling me to come inside and she would talk. I refused to come inside. That night, I knew that she wouldn't be the person I would marry. Even though I probably didn't deserve any of her time, to me, her not coming to my side when I was at my lowest of lows was a huge red flag. It truly broke my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

I promised her that I would seek help. I knew that my school paid for six therapy sessions per student, per year at a mental health hospital. Just to fucking pile it on, the same day that I made an appointment with a therapist, I found out that I had failed one of the two classes that I had to take to graduate. I explained with my professor and pleaded with her to work with me and she agreed to an extension to turn in late work if I went to a therapist and confirmed that I was not lying about my mental health. I was on the phone with her and she told me that she didn't have an opening for a couple weeks. The therapist could clearly hear the desperation in my voice, because she paused after she said that and told me that she could see me at 6pm that day (they close at 6, she was staying late.)

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely felt better after talking to her that day and I set up another appointment. I kinda explained what I just typed on here and she told me I likely had depression and gave me a few tips to try and help with it like exercising and spending time with close friends. I took her advise and began riding my bike and hanging out with my friends. A few weeks past and I went back for my second session which was okay, but not as effective as the first one. Nonetheless, I signed up for a third session. 

&amp;#x200B;

In between that second and third session, I found out that my 'girlfriend' had fooled around with an old friend of mine at the end of May and again in the beginning of June. She lied to me about it after I questioned her. I was still living with at her parents house when I found out, so I left work early and packed all my shit into my car without a plan on where to go and told her we were done forever. I got ahold of my grandma and she told me I could stay for as long as I needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what it was, but us breaking up flipped a switch in my head. It felt like someone just woke me up from my two-year sleep walk. The next day I was back on my bullshit of going to the gym and eating right, and for real this time. It felt different; I had motivation. I finally weighed myself and I had ballooned up to 298.6 lbs. I was not discouraged, I just got to work. That was three weeks ago. Yesterday, I was down to 282 lbs, which seems ridiculous, but I have a lot of bad weight that is easy to lose. I feel like myself again, I feel funny again, I feel creative again, I just feel better. Hell, this is my second long ass Reddit post recently. Last Tuesday, I had my third therapy session and told my therapist that me and my girlfriend had broke up and that I was feeling great ever since. I was curious if it would just be a delayed reaction to splitting up, but she seems to think that I have pulled myself out of this hole. I went ahead and signed up for another session, but with a longer time in between. I hope that this feeling last forever, but I know it won't. My therapist helped me identify certain behaviors and circumstances that I need to be aware in the future in order to not let myself get as low as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the past two years, I fell to the depths of myself. I enabled my own toxic behavior and forgot how to love myself first. I wrote this chronologically in an attempt to better understand how this happened to me. Writing is therapy and I really needed to find an emotional . Also, seek help. One therapy session could change how you see yourself and the world around you. It could save your life.

I initially wrote this on June 15th or something and for whatever reason, I was hesitant to click ""post."" I might have been waiting for that initial feeling of freedom and rejuvenated spirit to regress and be replaced by negative energy. Perhaps it was something else, I'm not sure.

89,"I turned 47 last week. Someone made a passing comment that it was great that I bicycle so much “at my age”

Now I am obsessed with thought of my aging and where the time has gone. It has left me quite depressed daily. I can’t shake the gloom and am practically walking around in a daze. I am having actual nightmares where I am elderly and alone. (My wife is 9 years younger than me so odds are that I won’t be alone). I keep doing math in my head to determine how much approximate time I have left. 

I am currently on Remeron and klonopin as needed for my depression and GAD. Normally I am anxious about other things. This is new. I have increased my therapist appointments from every other week to every week. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to snap myself out of this particular obsession?",02Jul2019,2
90,"Lately, I feel like I’ve been falling into a deep, dark black hole. It’s the only way I can describe it. Sometimes I feel like I’m falling so fast I feel physically dizzy, and other times I feel like I’ve grabbed a ledge or something and I’m momentarily okay, but I know it’s not going to last long. 

I’ve suffered with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and what a counsellor referred to as ‘episodic’ depression. Now it doesn’t feel like episodes. Over the past few years I’ve made note of my mood changes, at times I feel like I can do literally anything and nothing can stop me. It usually doesn’t last long but I go through bouts of making and doing these lists of achievements, starting things like learning a language, getting a personal trainer or buying a keyboard and being super excited to commit my time and energy. Then, it just all stops. I have no motivation. I realise I’m useless and here’s no point in me even trying because what’s the point? I’ll never be fluent, I’ll never play the piano, I’ll never be as fit as those Instagram models. I just fall back into sadness, emptiness and lack of motivation. This can go on for months on end and has been doing so for the past 7/8 years. I also have a terrible case of what I’ve called ‘comparison syndrome’ and I sometimes feel good about myself until I see someone else and decide that I should stop trying because I’ll never be as good. 

My panic attacks have gotten more severe and frequent, and even now I get this strange sensation of choking on food when I’m eating. It’s uncomfortable and as someone who struggles with being underweight it can be difficult to eat solid foods and stay healthy. 

I just finished university and will graduate in two weeks. I should be proud and happy, but I feel lost. I’m sure this is common, but when trying to find a job my lack of motivation is killing me. It’s like when you’re so hungry but every option someone gives you sounds unappetising and unsatisfying. I even recently left a job I only had for two weeks because I hated it so much and left in the middle of the day saying I felt ill because I just could not stop crying which turned into a crazy panic attack. I cried for two days straight before explaining to my supervisor that I can’t come back. My chronic pain due to scoliosis also doesn’t help and neither does the fact that the job was no where near what i was told it would be, and included being stood for 9 hours a day. 

I hate to admit it, but I’m at breaking point. Sometimes I just cry and hold my head, begging for it to stop. At least once a day for the past few months I just feel nothing, an emptiness. And the rest of the time it’s just kind of a general sadness. I haven’t self harmed since I was 15 but recently I think about my options for suicide every day. I see a train, and my brain automatically thinks about how quick and easy it would be to jump in front of it. Then I’d never have to feel so shitty again. I have people that I love, and I basically just don’t hurt myself out of my love and respect for them as well as guilt because I could never hurt them like that.  I know hurting myself wouldn’t just be hurting myself. 

I can’t afford professional private help and the waiting list for NHS treatment is 6 months to 1 year.

92,"This is for myself, so here’s some background. 

Since I was a small child (I’m 24 now), even my mother realized something was off, but my father was adamant nothing was wrong, so I never saw a psychiatrist till I went on my own somewhat recently. 

Diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD. Still on trial and error on the BPD meds, but I’m stable on my ADHD meds. My current doctor had said when I first came in I had exhibited some textbook sociopathic/psychopathic tendencies (which I know isn’t indicative that I actually am). 

Upon some reading myself, at first if I had to be categorized it was sociopathic as I was still all over the place and disorganized. 

Since I’ve been on ADHD meds I’m a lot more stable. Me being more clear-headed has also caused me to feel emotional pain more, although I’m good at suppressing it. I carry some of the other staple traits, such as an overall lack of remorse and empathy (the emotional pain is from my own past, but the lack of remorse and empathy is in how I treat others.  Manipulate, charismatic when needed and when it’s beneficial to me. 

So yea, I’m trying to figure out what key differences exist between the two topics in the title. It’s probably gonna be a follow up talk with my doctor. 

Bonus question: if I stopped taking my Adderall (yea I know. It’s not advised), would I go back to how I used to be?  Or something else ?

I’m a load of garbage that’s filled with anxiety and depression who can’t consistently take care of himself.

95,"Hello, the purpose of this post is to see other people’s opinions about my own mental well-being based off some symptoms I experience that I am worried about. This is in no way a self diagnosis or an attention seeking post. I am hoping someone could perhaps identify if I actually do suffer from mental illness, as I feel that I might.

These are some ‘symptoms’ if you will, that I often feel or experience. 

- Cheek and lip biting

- self consciousness when around people

- Feelings of being detached from my body

- oversleeping often

- feelings of emptiness, but not all of the time

- lack of motivation, but again not all of the time

- lack of concentration but not all of the time

-inability to be confident when speaking 

The list goes on but these are the ones I mostly feel. Can anyone shed some light on why I could possibly be feeling all of this? It would be most appreciated.

96,"So, I'm sitting here in my parent's office library against my will trying to study but can't study.

For 2 years I've been failing some courses and repeating them at school. I don't know whether to blame it on procrastination or just an uncomprehendable inability to study. I seem to quit when I go a certain distance into studying  a topic. And I can't stay for long.

My parents have gotten even more strict and annoying over my academic performance. They are also extremely religious (not helpful as I'm secretly nonreligious). In a bid to ""help"" they've pushed me to a library forcefully to use my summer  holidays for studying the courses I'm going to repeat next semester. They've also forced me to enrol courses I didn't want to register for precautionary reasons (I'm on an academic warning. So, if I don't meet a certain minimum this session, I'll be kicked out. Hence my choice to enrol less course load to allow me push up my performance. Normally I do that with summer sessions, but I was also forced to come home for summer). 

They've failed to listen to my opinions about taking less course work to ensure good performance to continue and instead they just claim it's a lack of confidence and if I can't ""build"" up this confidence then I don't deserve to return to school. So, I must take the course load they've decided.

Just for context, they forced me to change the profile of my personal WhatsApp profile because they didn't like the hair look (even after friends and other adult Christians in their \[my parent's\] own fucking church admired it).

I do imagine dying off somehow. Maybe drinking a poisonous pesticide my parents usually store at home or just being killed by something else (sickness, unhealthy feeding, accidents, etc). Afterall, my parents have lost a child before and my mum once said to me that my attitude will lead to depression and I'll commit suicide and ""end up in hell"" *\[I don't believe in hells. That's her quote\]* and that'll be my problem. So, clearly they won't be hurt.

97,"I have mild bipolar disorder and take lamictal and wellbutrin. For awhile it was doing really great for me and really helped, but I stopped taking it for two weeks (terrible I know) and my moods started cycling again. I’ve been back on it for a couple weeks now (started at a lower dose and then worked up) and since then have been at a really low point. Debilitatingly depressed, crying all the time, insecure, panic attacks you name it. It’s making my relationships with my friends and my partner suffer too. I’ve always had depressive episodes but not this bad in years, and it all hit me at once. I’m not at all concerned for my safety I would never harm myself but it’s still really scary. I don’t know whether to stay on my medication or stop taking them. I feel much more stable without them. I’m uninsured and pay for my psychiatrist out of pocket and really can’t afford to go again until August. Otherwise I would not be taking to reddit for advice LOL

TLDR; Stopped taking my meds and since I’ve got back on them I’ve been having a severe depressive episode. Can’t afford to speak with my psychiatrist yet. What do I do?",02Jul2019,2

However, I have become obsessed with the idea that I have either one of these disorders. I find myself constantly monitoring my thoughts and seeing all of them as somewhat worrisome and scary. Constantly finding myself fearing that I am on the brink of a psychotic breakdown. I continuously google my symptoms and take mental health quizzes. I have been to a counselor and he conducted an extensive mental evaluation and assured me that I had neither disorder.

104," 

Last summer was the worst months of anxiety. Last summer, I couldn’t stop anxiety and I kept checking and rechecking with my boyfriend. It was our 1st year anniversary and I was basically grilling him with questions for hours and he kinda just...snapped. Not angry, but his normally very patient self got very somber and just went: “I just wanted to have a nice anniversary”

Fast forward a year later, my anxiety is 10x better than what it was. I rarely get panic attacks, and when I do, they’re short.

Yesterday was our 2nd anniversary. BF want to have the day together to just chill. It’s an awesome, chill day, but we have to go to a rehearsal (I’m in a play, he’s doing lights). This irks him a bit because he really just wanted an “us” day (I did too), but the ppl there are fun so his annoyance doesn’t last long. We decide that after, we will go home to cuddle some more to finish off the day on an intimate note.

Anyway, my friend (who is also in the play) tells me her husband is away and is afraid of being by herself in the house. That gives HER anxiety (she also has BAD anxiety). She also can’t drive (due to anxiety as well). She asks me between scenes if she can sleep over at my house. I say sure because I know what panic feels like, and honestly, we are about to go on stage and I’m not even really thinking.

(A note: my bf and I live separately still; still living with parents to save money).

Fast forward to the end of rehearsal. I quickly tell my bf what’s going on (I honestly forgot I didn’t tell him; again it happened so quick). And I drop him off then take my friend to her place so she can get her stuff. We realize we can’t sleep over tonight (family stuff, long story) and so I drive back home. It’s too late at this point to go to his house (I’m exhausted) and again, I can’t sleep over with him tonight.

When I call my bf, he sounds not too happy. Just kinda short. I ask him what’s wrong, and he says he was looking forward to ending the day with just us, that it would have been different if I had talked to him about the change of plans first, but that it’s our anniversary and he feels abandoned. I at first get defensive, but then listen when he says he feels like his frustrations are sometimes fought against.

So that right there started getting me anxious, “I’m a bad partner, oh no oh no oh no”

So I listen to his frustrations, then I kinda just say, “I feel like there’s a trend of bad anniversaries, last year was bad and this year was too”

And he says “yeah last year was really bad. And this year...yeah it ended on a bad note”

My stomach dropped.

He is usually VERY understanding. Very sweet, always there when I am anxious. Always very patient, kind, supportive.

But apparently I just can’t stop fudging up anniversaries. I stayed up for three hours fighting against the urge to run or scream or break something or hurt myself (very characteristic of my panic).

I literally felt like my world was ending, just repeating in my head what a mess up I am.

I still feel anxious today. It was a struggle going to sleep :(

Idk what to do. I can’t go back and change it.

I don’t know :(",02Jul2019,1

Age:20 height/weight: 5'10 140, race: American (white) duration of complaint: 5+ years

I've had a vertigo problem for a long time now. When looking straight up or tilting my head back I get extremely bad vertigo, to the point that I can only stand it for a second or two, moving my head back to any other position makes the vertigo go away. I've been to a neurologist (who did several MRI's) and an ENT (who did a VNG test), besides a subarachnoid cyst that they don't believe is causing anything they found nothing.

Recently I've needed a root canal on my furthest back left molar, obviously couldn't have that done because I can't lay back far enough for 5 seconds let alone 3 hours. They gave me triazolam and it took forever to take effect but when it finally did I was able to lean back/look up entirely without feeling any vertigo. My ability to do this lasted until I got home but after I fell asleep for a couple hours I was back to normal and can no longer look up without the vertigo.

I have absolutely no idea why I have this. I have a history of anxiety (from a very young age, far more than 5 years) and depression as well as some stomach issues, but I can't think of any specific ""event"" after which this issue started. I don't even remember exactly when it started. What are my next steps here? This vertigo problem makes it difficult to do things like rock climbing and stargazing which I really enjoy, and I can't do any major dental work without sedation.",02Jul2019,1
107,"Hey all,I’ll try to keep it short and to the point. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts and depressive moods for five years. Yesterday I feel as if my thoughts and ideation took a dark turn. I had one attempt a number of years ago and I felt very similarly to how I did yesterday. I don’t want to go down that path again, i want and am in desperate need of help. My problem is this, I live in a fairly small town where healthcare services are abysmal, mental health services being the worst. I frequented many different doctors, therapists and psychiatrists in the beginning stages of my depression. All but two of the people I saw actively made the situation much worse. Most of my therapists came off as disinterested and a few were outright rude. I was put on many different medications that made my suicidal thoughts much worse and I gained over a hundred pounds and had a few other nasty side effects. I eventually decided that I was better off on my own, and I was for quite sometime. I lost the weight, and my more severe symptoms partially subsided after a year or so on my own. Slowly the symptoms returned, and now they feel as bad as they ever have.

It is not working anymore, I have done all that I can for myself. I want to live and I am scared. I am willing to do just about anything at this point but I don’t know where to start. I find myself extremely apprehensive to seek professional help due to my past experiences and don’t know where I would even start. How do I know which doctors to trust? What are my options? I was never officially diagnosed so I am worried I will be forced to take a number of trial medications like last time. I don’t have many people to talk to about this so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Am bipolar, and don't know if any other bipolar peeps think like that, but mania brings much more of my self harming behaviors than depression. With depression I just don't care enough. I feil like I am much more harmful and dangerous during mania. Like right now someone saddened me and this sadness almost immediately turned to anger, and the only way I can get out my anger is through pain. I have just a lung. My left side of my lung is missing, and so I swim. And it's painful. Really damn painful. Try swimming but with even less oxygen. And I gave my best to hurt myself like that. Because you know, p told me better to be active than to harm.. No, I really want to see myself bleed. Or something else, but you know, hurting people is bad and we really shouldn't do it. I tried cleaning... But everything is clean and I don't get that satisfaction from a clean towel. I tried eating, not doing it anymore. And you know what, surprise surprise to any self harmer, painting my arm in red doesn't do the trick. And no punching a pillow doesn't as well. I want the pain. And the consequences from hurting myself. Will I drink my prescribed sleeping pills along with my anxiety ones to make me fall asleep because guess what manic insomnia is a thing, yes I will right now. Will I harm myself?

It happens a lot at work, and I fear that my coworkers are going to start thinking I'm crazy.its gotten to the point where I was talking to my self the entire car ride home after having a huge anxiety attack ( I thought the self check outs were speaking to me) thankfully my friend promised she wouldn't speak of the incident.
I've been getting better at ""controlling myself"" when this stuff happens. I try not to respond to people so quickly until I figure out if they're actually speaking to me. Most times I end up awkwardly staring at them, or ignore them until they speak again. OR I respond quietly and if they comment on how they can't hear me then I know they actually said something.

125,"I have been going through anxiety and depression since my teen years, suffered several episodes of self harming and suicide thinking until I started practicing martial arts (kung fu in special) and meditation. I am pretty new to reddit and it was very concerning to me to know about the incredible amount of people who suffer emotional pain and are lost in the not knowing how to deal with it, so I want to share with you the tools I am using in order to feel better. 

For me,  finding about meditation and THIS practice specifically has helped me a lot with dealing with it. Teachers are incredibly supportive, this teacher used to be deeply depressed and had a lot of anger and drug usage issues until he started practicing hardcore with his teacher. He is now sharing the teachings and helping a lot of us.

This practice of meditation is not the stereotypical meditation about sitting down on a cushion and putting your mind blank and picture nice things so you can be in a 'peaceful state of mind'. This is about, how we say it, ""taking the bull from its horns"". It gives you a new perspective on how to look at the emotions and to learn from them in order to prevent them to arise in the future. It is a meditation of constant observation backed up with right information and attitude in the mind so we can eventually suffer less from negative emotions and cultivate wholesome emotions at the same time.

We are not striving for peaceful states, we are striving for wisdom and understanding, peacefulness is a product of such understanding, not a goal.

Here is the teacher's webpage: [https://ashintejaniya.org/](https://ashintejaniya.org/), there you can find the practice books (some of them are in different languages and you can download them free of charge) and for me the right order to read them and to get into this practice is next:

· Don't look down on defilements: [https://ashintejaniya.org/books-dont-look-down-on-the-defilements](https://ashintejaniya.org/books-dont-look-down-on-the-defilements) 

This book is the 101 lesson to start with this practice, take it easy, don't read it as a book per se, contemplate it and read it as many times necessary for you to grasp the real meaning of what is written.

· Dhamma everywhere: [https://ashintejaniya.org/books-dhamma-everywhere](https://ashintejaniya.org/books-dhamma-everywhere) 

Very similar to the first one but more complete and goes deeper into some subjects and explains some things in more in detail.

· Awareness alone is not enough [https://ashintejaniya.org/books-awareness-is-not-enough](https://ashintejaniya.org/books-awareness-is-not-enough) 

This book is complimentary knowledge to help you out with your practice in case you have certain doubts about different experiences or subjects.

The rest of the books are very good with different Q&amp;a that yogis have had with the teacher during retreats, so approach them if you want to know different experiences and what the teacher suggests on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to explore the webpage, if you are interested in retreats you can find information in there. Also, you are free to send me a PM if you have any extra questions, I am more than happy to help out, because we are in this together and we should support each other.

128,How do I get over feeling like my life has been stolen from me? My mental illness started when I was -8 and im 22 now. I feel like its just been all down hill since then and anything I try just makes it worse. I cant go to school or keep a job. Im really good at doing nothing because when I try to do something I tend to fuck it up either due to my incompetence or mental health. Im medicated and trying and just want to feel like a normal human who can go to work and get my degree. I understand life isnt easy for everyone and of course there is hardship but I cant seem to do anything at all. Please help me Im at my wits end tbh,02Jul2019,2

I am trying to write myself a daily routine to follow but I honestly do not know where to start. I do not know what a normal day should look like, where I do neither too much nor too little. As it is now I end up with days on either of the extremes, which seems quite natural since one triggers the other for me. Some days I can be totally incapacitated because I am caught up with a million ideas that I wish I was doing but do not do because ""I am not good at it"".

Outwardly I look like I’m okay, but whenever I start to feel happy, I’m scared that it’ll all come crashing back down. I also just start to think of all the stress in my life, I get a bit of a nostalgia feeling. Happy and sad at the same time.

133,"Please read this. I don’t know what’s going on with me these days. I have a very solid diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder with ptsd and “many features of BPD”. All the therapists and psychiatrists and professionals say my mastery of communication and my articulation and my blaring awareness of my own condition effectively mask the true severity of my issues until they have a few real good sessions with me. I believe it’s possibly because my IQ tested in the mid 150’s from a professionally administered test my mom has done on me when I was real young? It’s really bad guys. I’m 29, only had one full blown psychotic break. I hear voices all the time nonstop or music or other nonsensical noises that are not really there. This mental illness is becoming too overwhelming. To the point I feel physical effects from it all the time. Massive palpitations, tingling in the arms and legs and lips, fits of crying I don’t really know the root of, it became very bad last month when I reached the point of borderline catatonia. The only functioning I can seem to do is take care of my dogs anymore. It’s auto pilot guys honestly I could be half consciouses and psychotic and will remember to feed and care for my babies and let them have some outdoor time. 

Shit I’m babbling. This is the hardest part guys is effectively communicating this. See we all know its easy to say “I hear voices” or “I have panic attacks” or “I’m paranoid”. I can’t put what I experience to words. Sometimes I feel strange sensations throughout my body as if the shape of me is contorting or half of my body isn’t attached and I can’t feel it. 

Some things you learn to adapt too, somethings I can’t seem to get right. Shit I’m tingling right now. It’s like there’s this dark entity right now rubik cubing my brain like “don’t you dare fucking tell”...


I guess I’m just basically like guys I don’t know what the hell to do anymore to feel ok or happy or normal. I am totally medication compliant and have tried many meds to no avail, which is why my psychiatrist of ten years is saying we need to start playing with the idea of BPD as well. 

I’ve lost my train of thought here guys. I just want to be able to live and feel normal and not get mad.............",02Jul2019,1
134,"My hubby and I were talking. It was sweet and then the convo segued into him sweetly asking me to stop apologizing all the time for small things. I chuckled and said I'd work on it. That segued into him saying he doesn't have any regrets/remorse. I was confused, and mentioned a painful (unaddressed) recent issue and wondered if he had remorse...(him wanting to divorce me 3 months ago cause I put off (scared) going to a psychologist, that getting mental help wont make him 'in love' with me again) he said ""No, I don't regret anything. I look forward &amp; don't look back"". I get not living in regret, but this is different..I told him that and he said ""no, I don't live in regret. That's not how I live my life"" and ""I also can't regret something I don't remember saying shrug but if I did, u can't change the past so what's the point of regret?""

I remembered 3 mths ago him saying (when we reconciled) ""If we were going to break up, the biggest REGRET I had was not apologizing to Lea for the bad things I said"" (Lea is a old W.O.W penpal crush who he met 1 time, had an unhealthy fixation w/ her, she friendzoned him, he was butthurt but they continued to flirt...er.. 'talk'. He once paypal'd 3k for her dental work and yrs later, when me and him were together, she talked about taking him to Hawaii as a 'repayment'. I was fumed. so I made a brainless mistake. I made a fake acct in her name, msged me, showed him, and he scolded and blocked her. I was sick with myself for weeks after. I felt like a bad person who made a irreparable mistake. I told him ALL of it, knowing he might leave me, he said ""it's okay. I had no desire to talk to her anyway"" and that was it..)

...until 4 yrs (3 mths ago) later. He wanted a divorce cause of my health anxiety, re-added &amp; msged her the NEXT DAY resurfacing how horrible I was for the old incident, how he wanted to apologize sooner, he made the bad decision to marry me, her saying how batshit I am, him agreeing &amp; reassuring her we're over. 2 days later I went to a psych. who (later) diagnosed me w/ complex PTSD. When I came home, he wanted to 'make up' cause I got help, and then said ""Oh, me &amp; Lea are talking again"". He tossed me his phone and encouraged I read that shit..as if to get 'real'. Since THE DAY we reconciled, he hasn't talked to her once. he said he ""just wanted to apologize"" and had no desire to talk to her.

Am I supposed to be ok that he has no regrets 'because' these were past events? The only time he said he had a regret (while with me) was in regards to LEA. And cause I fucked up (despite admitting it), I dont deserve any remorse for any wrongdoing towards me. I don't ever ACTUALLY get absolution.

Am I the ass here or ?

ALSO: Realize that for the past few months since our fight, I have overly apologizing (which he is really annoyed with) or have been asking him when I sense something is up, what's wrong babe? Often, after he tells me it's work, or something else that seems 'downplayed' I get paranoid it's about me and he isn't telling me. He has a history of avoiding telling people things that will hurt them..so he just sits on it, and pretends everything is OK..and did it to me the day before the divorce shpeel. So I actually go ""okay what's 'really' wrong?"" and he gets annoyed (understandably). He tells me not to do that. To have some self-confidence and ""everything will fall into place"". That I am causing this marital distress, and I have to face the reality that it's my mess to clean up, and that all the things he did wrong/said was an eye-for-an-eye. I told him I thought that the whole ""if you go back to how you were, we are done"" thinking was going away. That there was more breathing room, unconditional love, and tolerance when it comes to what lines need to be crossed to contemplate divorce (deceptive things like cheating, beating, disrespect). He just sat there trying find times I have deceived him based on my examples of deceit as if to further prove I was deserving of being left. The act of him rummaging for it made me more depressed than him actually finding instances, cause the point I was trying to make was lost.

​

He said ""I can't ever call you a CUNT or you are done, I can't HIT you, or you are done. But you're a hypocrite cause you SAY mean things to me, and you 'DID' hit me."" and used the example of a few months ago when he made me waste a high dollar coupon and unintentionally embarrassed me in the store, and i got mad and called him a dumb asshole. I apologized minutes after the incident, saying I was irrational and angry, he accepted..but he hasn't let me live that down since. He's brought it up at least 8 times. I told him 1: I DO occasionally say things when I am angry, sometimes with reason, sometimes irrationally..but I always apologize for it. 2: I NEVER hit you. I NEVER punched you, slapped you, kicked you, stabbed you, etc. I may have 'pushed' you away when we had a heated argument, but that's it"" and he agreed.

All I wanted was some reassurance of stability. That he is here with me, through the tough, because it would take something severely deceptive to want us to never see eachother again... and his response to that is ""well, you're going to have to earn that"".. as if the past 3 months of me spending THOUSANDS of dollars on things he loves to do, massaging him, cuddling him or kissing him at random, dancing, camping, buying luxurious meals, tending to his needs, tending to his pains, listening, laughing, joking, bathing, rock hunting, horse rides, it's not enough yet to change his half in half out stance. He says he has both feet in, but it's more like, entrusting me that he can put both feet in and always observing me..but moving forward and 'living in the moment'.

""I want you to be happy self confident and sufficient. I can't fix YOU only YOU can fix YOU. This is your problem, not mine, not anyone elses..but I will be there every step of the way to learn and help you"" he says things like that that are inspiring, and that throws me off and makes me think...maybe he is 100% and I am unstable.",02Jul2019,1

137,"Today I rode to the beach. I bought a hotdog and a seagull swooped from the sky and nipped it and dropped it on the floor. I quickly picked it up and in my fury said ""fucking bullshit"" and ""I will not allow this seagull to get the better of me and stop me enjoying this hotdog I paid for"" and quickly ate it anyway. Gross I know but it was a very quick nip and it was on the ground for less than a second. Anyway after I ate it I started getting anxious about ""what if I contract bird flu and die"" and started to overthink a lot about what diseases I could get and so on. I started to think about if I died how much I'd miss my friends, my family and how there's so much I still want to do like meet my future wife, have a family, help people, build a career, play xbox, play with my dog and enjoy surfing etc. And because of this I realised how much I actually want to be here and how much I love being alive and don't want to leave. 

A few months ago I was in a really dark place and I was getting scared I'd never see the light and it would just keep going downhill, and today a seagull stole my hotdog and I realised how happy I am and how far I've come, and I'm really proud of myself for improving my mental health and look forward to all the beautiful and exciting things to come in future. Hopefully you had a laugh at this situation like I did, and maybe find something in it if you're struggling. And watch out for those airborne demons next time you get a hotdog.

I live a pretty happy, fun, active life despite that grocery list of mental problems and honestly a big part of that has been professional treatment, but also choosing to focus on being healthy. I'm 20, so a lot of my friends don't give a hoot about their health, but to me it's instrumental in not becoming depressed again. Here are some things I prioritize for the sake of my mental health:

1) Sleeping properly. I don't go out partying if I have to wake up early the next day, much to my friends' annoyance, but even getting less than 6 hours of sleep one night can totally screw me over.  Sleep hygiene is everything to me. 

2) Not procrastinating and keeping an up to date to-do list at all times. Being stressed is the devil and hard to avoid when you have school, work, and multiple anxiety disorders. I schedule EVERYTHING.

3) No stimulants or other illegal substances. I like to party so I get offered stuff but in this house we protect ourselves from getting manic/nuts at all times

Ever since that day i havent had a conversation with my parents that didnt involve screaming and they calling me a disappointment and thats really summarizing it.  
i wanna dye it again but my abusive mother ( who calls me gay and fag all the time for literally no reason) is heavily against it and my dad whos just trying to appease her just goes with the flow and screams at me as well.

155,"I live in another state now, but my Father recently reached out to me about the increasing severity of my mother's (what we think is) delusional disorder (persecutory).  (update: I am back home now for a few weeks.)

She ( F, 59, Hispanic) 
has for a while, felt that people (government or likewise) are using technology to track and watch her. She started a few years ago with turning out the lights when she showers or uses the restroom because people are watching her through the lights. More recently people are watching her through her phone, cameras are covered by stickers and turned off when she is not using it. She is worried at the store or out that people in charge are talking about her or watching her to wait til she does something wrong. 

The turning point, during holidays she thought family was spying on her and talking about her because they were on their phones. This followed the death of her mother.
 
Currently, she believes this man is following her from the store or to a garage sale or at the neighbor's home. She thinks the neighbors can somehow track her or spy on her.

She thinks the doctor or therapists are going to contact 'them' and same with her priest. 

How do you approach treatment? Do you? She lives most of life normally outside of the stress of these situations and doesn't show signs of other mental illnesses.

Update: Delusions are getting progressively worse. She is having trouble sleeping. We have an appointment set up for her next week but she says she has no psychological problems because what is happening to her is true and we just can't believe it. She says she will not go, that she doesn't need help. We have been listening, asking her about how she feels and trying to encourage her to get help for the stress or for sleep at least and see the psychiatrist.

At a loss because she pretty much said the other night that people who take pills are crazy and she knows we think she is crazy. We have denied this and told her we are concerned for her well being and want her to feel less anxious or stressed so she can rest and not live in fear.
