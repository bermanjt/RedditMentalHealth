1,"Hey, I never thought that I would post on this sub but here we go. To be real, I feel ashamed to post here because of all the people that have greater problems than me but I'm posting it here anyway because I think there is no better fitting subreddit that I know. (M20yo)

I would say I'm a decent looking guy and I don't have a problem with talking to girls. I'm still a virgin. I had/have many options when it comes to sex (sorry for sounding like an asshole) but I always wanted it to be with a special women. But there always was this girl. I like her personality, the way she looks and her humour. But she has a boyfriend now and I know him well. 

When I have a conversation with her alone (mostly when we are drunk) it seems like she likes me too. But when her boyfriend is near she is really defensive, understandably.

My problem is:

1) I'm always feeling depressed (when I'm drunk) because I don't find a girl that I like who likes me back
2) I don't know how I can stop falling in love with a girl that is taken especially with her because I think we would fit perfect together.

What should I do? If you need more details just ask.",22Sep2019,2
2,"Tdlr Having panick attacks because of school. Wondering if anyone knows coping methods. 

I'm in in highschool in grade 11. I currently have a English teacher who is the toughest marker ever. She finds problems with every work I submit. This has caused me alot of stress and I've been having mental breakdowns almost everyday. I have small bursts of panic where my heart races and I can't breathe. 

My mark has dropped about 20 percent since last year. I asked her how to get a higher mark but she said I was way far off from getting my desired mark. I am really worried about university and scholarships since grade 11 matters for that. Does anyone have good coping methods for small panick attacks?",22Sep2019,1
3,"No matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how I present myself, no matter what personality I display, I am never seen as a human being with worth by anyone except my parents, which is conditional upon my constant submission to their orders. I have been almost entirely alone for all 20 years of my life. I was home schooled as a child and my social development was severely stunted because of it, but even after extensive re-calibration over the course of high school and college, nothing I do earns me the most basic level of respect. I am nothing but an object. Any time I express disappointment or dissatisfaction, I'm called entitled and told to man up. Any time I display self-confidence or even observe my own talent or intelligence, I am called arrogant and told to humble myself. Any time I feel love (whether platonic or romantic) for another person, I am called overbearing/creepy and told to know my place. The problem is that I have no place in this world. It has never wanted me despite how desperately I wanted it. I am worthless. How do I accept this? Can I find some sort of happiness in spite of it?",22Sep2019,1
4,"Ever since I was eight, I've been sent to a psychologist for my ADHD, OCD, and now for my ""mild depression."" Lately, ever since I've gotten into an academy, I've been having thoughts of feeling like I'm being forgotten and abandoned. Recently, I've even tried joining a friend group, and that kinda helps, but other than that, I only have a couple of friends. I've also lost interest in many things, such as going outside or swimming. However, I've tried to create a person in my mind whose always been there for me. This person I've created is my imaginary boyfriend. I've never told my therapist about this because I feel much safer under the anonymity that Reddit creates for me. I know there's something wrong with me, and I really want to find out what it is. I've also tried typing stories on my phone, and that helps me create a storyboard and a whole place where I can put my feelings out, and also helps me create stories of my imaginary boyfriend.

When I heard about Spinel from Steven Universe and people relating her struggles with those who have BPD, it made me think about myself and her struggles related with my struggles, because I also feel really insecure and feel extremely misunderstood. I would also punch holes in my walls when I was young because I felt that no one could understand me, and my explosions would sometimes, on rare occasions, even make my mother cry.

The thought of seeing my mother cry still brings me to tears. People have also taken their anger out on me ever since middle school, so I've always tried not to do that, because I don't want people to feel the same way that I've felt. I've even had a girl tell me we were best friends then hang out with a girl who had threatened to beat me up numerous times because a girl who thought I still had a crush on her boyfriend told her to. I've had multiple people treat me this way, and it turns you into a much different person. My Psychologist keeps saying I don't have Bipolar Disorder or that I may not be anywhere on the Autism Spectrum, and I'm wondering if I should speak to another therapist if she doesn't think I have it. I'm not trying to self diagnose myself, but I think something is seriously wrong with me, because I keep losing my temper and getting in trouble, even as a teenager. I have also had anxiety attacks.",22Sep2019,1

Considering how the first 39 years of your life started, it is normal and indeed to expected to struggle as you do.  
It may be that you'll have the same struggles for the rest of your life -- and that's okay too, but you can change your responses to them, as you already have.  
Remember to give yourself credit.  
You have come a long way in the past year, further, really, than you expected.  
Harness that stubbornness in your that makes you strive harder when someone questions your ability, even when you are the person constantly questioning.  
Prove these negative voices wrong, but don't beat yourself up if you falter, because everyone falters, even perfectly functioning people who haven't been through five percent of what you have.

And time stops. And you think about offering your hand to anyone passing by, or raising your voice in the hopes someone will stop and see.  
You keep hoping to see yourself there, huddled near you, holding your hand, and keeping the stronger emotions at bay, so when it comes, it is a gentle rainfall and not a tidal wave threatening to overwhelm you into catatonia, where the darkness lives, the kind of darkness that you have no control over, the kind that cackles in the corner, stoking the fires of your worst fears and ugly truths so that beautiful orange flame turns black and green and infected.  
You cry on the sidewalk for a while longer. You eventually realize no one is coming. You have to stand up. You have to walk home. You have to make sure you're fed, that you've taken your meds, that you can begin the ritual of finding the ground again, knowing your safe, but knowing that safety is only temporary.  
You feel ashamed at your loneliness. It turns into desperation.  
You keep trying to remember. You went out. For a purpose. But where you ended up wasn't where you were trying to go.  
And the falling. And the cry for help muffled. And the intense beating of tribal drums vibrates throughout your entire body. The hunt. You remain still. Silent. Just tears, tears you wish to see as rain. So you can eventually stand up, and make your way home. If that's what this is, if that's what this is called...

9,"Hello reddit, this is my first ever post. I’m currently 17 years old in my last year of high school. My mental health issues started appearing around the 8th grade when a hole load of things happened at once: A friend from school committed suicide from bullying, we lost our family pet(dog), and my mom and step-dad who has been in my life since I was a baby divorced. I slowly started to do worse and worse in school. Freshman year of high school I was already failing multiple classes and had to retake a few by sophomore year. Started smoking weed and drinking freshman year also. Sophomore year I got into a relationship that I thought was going to be good for me. Neither of us were ready and we both had our problems and we broke up within a short 4 months. Made me even more depressed at the time. I started taking harder drugs, drinking more, smoking more. Eventually I had my first suicide attempt. I took a bunch of painkillers and after about 10 minutes started to panic and threw them up, went and layed in my bed and spent the night unable to move except to lean over and vomiting my guts out. Honestly don’t know how I had survived that one. Acted like nothings happened the next day. FF a little while later I take a bunch more pills and this time I get sent to the hospital because my parents found me. They clean me out and send me home. No sort of advice or treatment plan for me. Parents rip on me and I’m in trouble for months. None of it helps. Last year(Junior year) I get into a relationship with an amazing girl but I’m just not there mentally around her. One night out of the blue and without much thinking. I call her and tell her that I need to be done with this relationship. I loved her and I still think I love her but I can’t forgive myself for what I did. I’ve recently stopped taking my medication and started smoking and drinking again.",22Sep2019,1

14,"I am a guy currently in his third year of university in an engineering program. Over the past several years I really think my mental health has tanked. School has been tough. Really tough. Everyday I'm worried about failing and pessimistic about things outside of school like getting into a relationship(which I never have) and just society in general. Everyday it seems i'm behind. Sure I've made it to my third year(which is actually my official second year since i spread my first and second year or another middle year to relax my schedule), but what happens if I don't make it through? Schooling aside, my whole life I felt mediocre and that whenever I genuinely try at something productive, I always give up. 

""You can't do it"", ""you're so pathetic for feeling like this"", ""your just being emotional"", ""you're useless"". These are the type of things I can't help but tell myself.  I know they're not productive. I know they shouldn't be true. But they repeat and repeat and repeat over and over again. Its gotten to the point that I sometimes begin to think about death. I won't kill myself now as I know that would hurt my parents and my little brother, but when i'm in my 30s or 40s, who knows maybe I'll snap and give up entirely. The main thing that's keeping me going is my little brother. I gotta be there to protect him, help him and just be there for him. 

The most frustrating part is that my parents(who are usually extremely level headed people) are extremely adamant about me being fine and that I don't need to go to a psychologist who will just give me drugs.  I understand their side as well but i'm just really desperate to stop feeling this way. What hurt the most is when my dad and I were having an argument about this he basically said ""to be grateful and get with the program"". After this I just felt a little colder toward them both sometimes. I adore my dad and mom and I know I'm thankful for everything I have. My dad works really hard to make sure there's enough money for me to go to school and support the family. Which just makes me feel worse when I can't even do something simple like go to school. I don't know if I got depression, anxiety, bipolar, adult adhd, or its all in my head, but what I do know is that nearly everyday I end up having lots of negative thoughts that give me great pain.  There are periods when I can be happy when I'm hanging out with close friends or watching Youtube or playing a game but I sometimes feel that's just me being distracted. 

I'm not sure what this post is, whether its to ask for advice, express my feelings in writing or just to vent to anybody, but if you've taken the time to read this; thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it. Even just writing this all out, its made me feel a little better for now.",22Sep2019,1
15,"I feel like I keep so much of myself and my thoughts hidden from others. Today I was thinking about how proud I am of my self confidence growth and how I genuinely really like (dare I say love...idk) who I am. I’ve been pondering relationship troubles recently because I’m at a pretty good spot mentally aside from anxiety, but I still don’t feel mentally/emotionally ready for a relationship. Thinking about myself had me wondering if I could love myself if I was another person and then seriously questioning how another person could ever be in love with me. It’s not that I think that I’m too repulsive to be loved, I’m just a bit disgusted by the thought of somebody being capable to love the same parts of me that I love about myself because I don’t share those parts with others very often. It led to this final conclusion that I wrote down to tell a counselor once I actually make that appointment “The reason why I can’t picture somebody ever loving me even when I don’t have low self-esteem is because I can’t fathom letting somebody get to know me well enough to be in love with me” Are there any topics related to this?

I'm 25, male.

About a month - month and a bit ago, I got sick, with throwing up after eating food, but only at night, and it got to the point where I had to go to hospital, where I was diagnosed with gastritis, hypoglycemia, and dehydration (I hadn't eaten anything or drunk a lot of water that day), and stayed at a friend's house (I asked him if he could take me to hospital, and stayed at his for a couple of nights). Mum knew that I was sick, but didn't ask how I was, yet thinks she can fix what went wrong (I know that she can't, and I know that I can't, as I don't know what went wrong). While I was at my friends, they treated me as a human, like family, which I'm not used too (I'm usually left alone...).
I'm fighting some of my anxieties due to being sick (I keep throwing up, I don't know why), depression (because I didn't want to go to mums, she wouldn't accept my saying no to go to hers, and more or less implied that I'm unable to take care of myself...), Mum hates the friends who took me to hospital.

I'm not sure if I can live on my own atm, with getting as sick as I am, as well as my mental health. I'm living in a share house, but I don't get along with a housemates, nor the land Lord (they don't agree with my life and lifestyle, the choices I make and what I do), but I'm looking to move out as soon as possible, but don't know where to go (I could live at my sisters again, but I'm pretty sure shell say no; could live at mums, but I care about my mental health, and friendships...; My Nannas', but I'm not sure if I want to do that; or rent a unit on my own, but I'm not sure if I can be on my own). 

My mum keeps saying that if I move again, I'm moving to hers; I don't get a say, and it's not my idea. I'm unfortunately, considering it, even if it's for the rest of this year, and some of next year...
My mums partner also hates my friends, who took me to hospital. I apparently did a shit thing by going to my friends and asking for help from them, going to hospital, instead of asking for help from mum. I was not in the mood to deal with mums BS that day, and just wanted to be with friends. Ironically, was always taught to do the right thing, but have gotten yelled at for doing the right thing...

I'm scared because of whatever has gone wrong and why I keep being sick, as I want to eat normally again, I've never been this sick before, so don't have a coping mechanism.

I'm unsure what to do, whether to move to mums, sisters, nannas, or go on my own again; I just don't know what to do.

I also don't know why I keep being sick and why I have been, if it's related to mental health, or catching a bug and general bad luck.

I do nothing except drugs (on sunny days) and sleeping, have no purpose, can't enjoy anything, not even my friends, and I still am not convinced I even want to change that, because life is just void of meaning and happiness is no more than pretending to be okay with yourself or it can be bought with money (which I do not have).

I'm at the point in my college career where i have to decide on a major. I don't want to decide i just want to study everything. I love sociology, and psychology. I love theatre, film, graphic design. I love biology, math, and computer science.  I love everything, and i never want to leave, i want to be a professor when I grow up, just like all my role models have been. 

Lastly, i don't fit in with the other guys. I look like a guy 100% and I do MMA, I lift weights, i go longboarding, play video games. These are all pretty stereotypically masculine, but as a person, im generally too ""feminine""  to hang out with the other guys my age. I'm polite, and everyone just thinks im pretty gay. The other guys are (for the most part) mostly into bragging about sex and how badass they are and I'm still a virgin. I feel bad about it, but i don't want to rush anything, honestly. I dont even think ive ever felt romantic love. Im just... emotionally tired? 

They keep bragging about all the women they can seduce, and having lived as one, the talk repulses me.

Ive been thinking about death in a more personal way every night since turning 20 four days ago.  I keep thinking about what death is going to feel like, and im horrified i wont get all my ideas out in time. Im worried im stalling too much i suppose. 

Ive been grinding non stop for the past 6 years (conversion therapy, religion achool, bullies etc.) and now that i can take it easier, im panicking. 

I don't know what i need to do to get out of this funk. Ive been working on a vision board and ive just realized how truly stuck i feel.",22Sep2019,1
29,"Very long story. I've been through a lot. I just feel stuck and felt like letting it all out. I know no one is going to read this so whatever.

I have social anxiety because in school I was extremely bullied. I had even teachers bullying me with the class. Everyone knew me as the biggest loser in school. Because of this, I went to school and never said a single word to anyone. I was completely mute. I was afraid to say anything. I knew I was just going to get bullied again. I didn't have a single friend. I never got to socialize in school or hang out with anyone. It was completely foreign to me. To make it worse, I begin having epilepsy seizures and I also had asthma. I was put on steroids and couldn't exercise much due to my asthma of the fact that I was in the hospital on the ICU every 2 weeks because of my seizures. This made me obese and influenced my sedentary lifestyle. This made the bullying much worse. I was cured from epilepsy when I was 12 in 2010 by brain surgery and my asthma is very well under control now, I think I'm growing out of it. The bullying stopped in 9th grade after I got into a big fight. The effects still remain to this day though.

Right before 11th grade, my parents sent me on a 16 day student trip to Europe. This is when I first noticed my anxiety. At home, I always had a very loving and supportive family thankfully. I am completely fine around them and never, ever feel anxiety at home. But on this trip, I was living with complete strangers for 2 weeks straight, on the other side of the world. I tried to talk, but it was extremely difficult. I just remained silent for most of the trip. We were told to never walk alone, but I did for the most part because I felt a weird sensation around others. I felt like an alien to all of them. After the trip, while it was amazing getting to experience the scenery and culture of 7 countries there, I was very happy to finally be home with my family again.

That year in high school I decided to change. I decided to try to talk to people and make friends. I tried to talking to everyone in class. But I noticed I was still struggling. Words just wouldn't come out. I started worrying about everything. I started worrying about what I was going to say and how others would judge me for it. I started to carefully plan out entire conversations and practice and remember them, even days ahead, just so that I would be confident enough not to mess up and get embarrassed. I still never got the strength to talk. I remained silent, observing others and wondering how they all spoke so freely. I was also confused because I spoke fine at home, only struggled at school. That is, when I was on my own. Around my little brother at school, I was completely fine, unless I had to talk to others. Although in band class I did do a little better. I was able to talk to a few and made a few friends with some freshmen. Maybe I just felt better around new people that had nothing yet to judge me on. Although, my voice was still affected. It was much deeper than usual.

That same year, when was 16, I decided to get my first job. It was at Burger King. It turned out to be the worst experience of my life. When at work, I could almost never talk. This made it very difficult to work. My coworkers almost all started bullying me. My managers started hating and bullying me too. I tried my hardest but I just couldn't communicate with others and it made the job almost impossible for me. Soon I was fired. I felt horrible and wanted to quit anyways. Two years later, I got another job and did okay. I still felt anxiety but I had great managers and coworkers that trained me properly, unlike at my first job, and I did most of the work on my own and didn't have to talk much.

While I struggle in school, I still got to go home and feel better every day. College was a completely different experience. I started having depression for the first time. I couldn't talk to anyone. I tried making friends but didn't know how. I always wondered how they all talk to each other just fine. I always wondered how they stayed connected with other, they always contacted and hung out with each other. I wondered why no one seemed to want to do anything with me. I did make one friend though and he's my best friend now. But I struggled to talk even around him and didn't get to see him all the time. My depression got bad and I failed a few classes. I couldn't live being alone every day in my bedroom.

Then one day it hit me. I almost commited suicide. I thought there was nothing I could do. I didn't feel like living such a painful life anymore. So one night I laid in bed with a knife, multiple bottles of pills and some water. It's obvious what I was thinking. I didn't do it though. I felt like I didn't have the ""courage""(which I know doesn't make sense) to do it. I fell asleep crying and woke up the next day with the knife right underneath my belly. Somehow I didn't get hurt. I begin thinking about my family at that moment. There's no way I could do it because I love my family very much and they love me too. I didn't want to put them through any pain. I'm also extremely lucky to be alive considering that I almost died from epilepsy.

A weeks after that the semester was over I finally came out and told my mom about my problem. I didn't mention the close suicide attempt, I still haven't to this day told anyone until now. But I told her about my anxiety. She didn't understand at first. She has general anxiety but didn't understand my social anxiety. But she tried to help me that summer. She found me a counselor. The counselor tried helping expose me to my fears gradually but it was hard because it was during the summer out of school and I didn't have any friends(best friend from college was away at home) and didn't know how to meet up with people.

The second year of college was amazing. My brother started college and I'm completely fine around him. He's like one of my ""best friends"". When he was around, I spoke fine. I felt very uncomfortable starting to be myself around my best friend and others. I got used to it eventually though, and now for the first time ever, I feel no anxiety around someone outside my family, and that is my best friend. Now even when it just me and him alone I'm completely fine with him. I started doing better in college. I started to hang out with others too. I felt more like a typical college student for better or worse. I went to parties and we did some crazy things, like on Halloween, me, my brother and a friend went and knocked on every door in student housing and scared everyone. Being able to be with others and have a good time was a completely new experience for me. I also started another job and while I struggled to talk a little I managed to get by and do my job fine, the only problem I really had was a very irresponsible manager.

Well I graduated from that college and transferred to the university I'm at now now. My first year(last academic year) at this university, Georgia Southern University, was the worst. I was now 2.5 hours away from home. My brother was still at home. My best friend was still at the same college. I was alone here. I felt a lot of anxiety on the first day. I started experiencing loneliness all over again but this time because if the distance I wasn't able to go home every week. My first semester I struggled academically. I stopped going to all of my classes except for band class, which I did miss a few times, was late a lot and I even missed a concert and got in trouble. I started basically going to just one class per week. I felt very little energy and couldn't get up out of bed. I spent most of the time in bed sleeping all day to the point that I felt very dizzy getting up just to go to the bathroom. I had a very poor diet, if I managed to get up and eat anything at all. While I am cured from epilepsy seizures, I still have simple partial seizures, and for me I found out that they are triggered mainly by irregular sleeping patterns. I was sleeping way more than I should and this triggered my seizures. I got really scared. I started going to a doctor on campus and she gave me some anti depressants. They didn't seem to help though. I also started taking seizure medication again. My second semester of college wasn't much better. I stopped sleeping so much but I still failed to go to class most of the time. I dropped two classes and failed one. I was placed on academic probation. I was also seeing a counselor for free on campus but it didn't really help. I found out that he specializes in family and relationship therapy, so that's probably why. I stayed home over the summer and took two classes. I passed both of them with a B somehow and got out of academic probation.

Now I'm at my second, or you can just consider first, year at the same university. I am taking 18 hours of classes. I am also in marching band. I have been able to go to all classes but I'm struggling to keep up with my work. My depression has been coming and going even on the same day. My anxiety has been the same. I still struggle to talk to people greatly. To make it worse, even though I worked very hard in marching band, I was chosen as an alternate. That made me instantly lose all my confidence. For the first 2 weeks of rehearsal, I almost started crying during practice in front of everyone multiple times. I've gotten used to it now but I still feel depressed after every rehearsal. I am still experiencing depression off and on for the same reasons I already mentioned too. I've had some good experiences though. I've gone to all classes and made a few friends, I think. Because of my experience, it's hard for me to know if they're really friends or not. I've also talked more than ever even in class. I've been out to eat with other multiple times and even spoke up to the teacher in class, I actually volunteered to discuss my essay.

Im still struggling though. This weekend I've done little even though I have a lot of work to do. My grades aren't looking good so far and mid term exams are only 3 weeks away. I know the reason why I'm struggling. Because of the bullying, I developed a great fear of everyone away from home. Everyone became like monsters to me. I've struggled to the extreme for the past 5 years to try to overcome this fear on my own. I never tell anyone including my family because it's extremely embarrassing. It would be very weird to fell my family because around them I'm very talkative with a loud voice, with is the complete opposite of the shy, mute person I am around others. I fear how others would react to me starting to act normal too. I do talk to my mom occasionally about my problems, but she still doesn't fully understand. She barely understands what depression is at all. Also, another reason I am quiet about my problems is the stigma of mental health in America. I am a young male, which makes the stigma even worse. Men are heavily expected to be very confident and hide their emotions, especially in the southeastern part of America where I live. I feel very weak and ashamed.

If only I could speak up like normal, all of my problems would go away. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't do it. I've been trying for 5 years now and have seen little progress. I feel like just giving up already. All my hopes and dreams are also shattered because of this problem. It's my dream to graduate in 2 years and head straight to law school. I planned on being a lawyer and running for public office in my poor hometown and working to make the town better for everyone. I wanted to help everyone live a better and happier life. I have a dream, and it seems like that dream will always remain just a dream.

My mom kept trying to encorauge me to apply for disability but I was very reluctant. I finally did this year but was denied. My mom told me to repeal but I never did. I felt very embarrassing applying for it. I'm stuck with no job, parents who can't afford therapy for me. I have an appointment with a counselor on campus next week but my problem is so bad that I think I will need a professional therapist to see every week. At my university I can only see a counselor every two weeks. They said they'll help me with anything I need, even seeking external help, but again I wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm just stuck like this forever I guess.

I can not sleep, eat or function knowing that one of my windows is open or uncovered, I have multiple curtains on each window, and every 30ish minutes I go though my house and make sure they are all properly covered.

I work from home, so I really never have to leave, but its not going outside that scares me. Im afraid of the people, if there are any to begin with, trying to come into my home, into my safe space, knocking on my windows, breaking them, watching me. Watching me, and I have no other option but to watch back, how do I react back? What do I do when people are watching me? Im sure there are people who want in just to torment me, they knock on my windows and they laugh at me. I know it may just be that im paranoid but is there any hope for me?

34,"I am concerned about my dad. He doesn't seem to have any friends really outside of work. The first thing he does when he comes home is nap and he doesn't really socialize with us. He is quite the hoarder and has an issue with having excessive sets of tools in the basement for work, at least 5 cars in the garage that don't work, and two other sheds filled with junk. He likes going for long runs whenever he has a lot on his mind, one time he tried to do a 100 mile race but ran only 100 km which is still pretty good. The thing is the times he runs, he usually does it in bare feet because he thinks it's beneficial somehow. He also goes through seasons where he fasts food and sometimes even water. Most of the time it isn't even for a religious purpose. For example, one time he fasted because he had a knee injury and he believed that fasting food and water would help it heal faster somehow. He was so convinced that he could not have water. We were on a camping trip that required a lot of kayaking to get to our site. We were exhausted after all that kayaking, and he said he was ""tempted"" to have water. So what he did was he gurgled water and spat it back out, he kept doing this our entire camping trip and I couldn't even look at him most of the time. He was denying a basic human need. Does anyone know what mental health issues he might have. I know that hoarding disorder is definitely one, but with the running barefoot and excessive fasting it's hard to know what else he might have.",22Sep2019,4

37,"I have gone through a mountain of stress, emotional distress, and self-realization over the past year and recently I have found myself growing very aggressive and apathetic. This has been a huge shift from my old calm overly empathetic self. I lost one of the only people I loved this year, learned my best friend for the longest time just used me to validate their awful behaviors, a lot of other friends just used me, got into a relationship that ended horribly, leaving me feeling alone and betrayed. As a result, I cut out a ton of friends and have partially isolated myself from my old group to be with new people. An in the process I have become very self-destructive and very suicidal. Although I managed to push back my suicidal thoughts, but in the process, I have found I crave behaviors that are inherently destructive. I have a need to just be a horrible person which I refuse to delve into. But it's just really fucking me up cause I have never felt this way before. 


Can anyone give me some advice on this, I really hate feeling this way but for some reason, part of me just wants to give in and be an ass. Just fall into a hedonistic lifestyle and way of thinking and say fuck it to everything else. Just live with no limit to my actions and keep it up till I can't anymore either cause I don't have money or I die in the process.",22Sep2019,1
38,"Hello, dear squanderer, you've stumbled across my post please help me. I'm going to try my best not to retype anything as I want to be as much of myself as possible so I can receive some real indicators as to what's going on. Therefore, all cringe-worthy jokes will remain. Prepare for wall of text.

About 8 months ago I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was spotted at a hospital trying to kill myself after jumping the fence at Coast Guard Bootcamp in Cape May New Jersey. Long story short, I attempted to get into the military because I thought they could fix me but 6 weeks into training I realized not even they could fix my mindset from wanting to commit suicide. I've always had a plan to kill myself at the age of 20 (im 21 now almost 22) and there's been multiple attempts over the years. Any who, I was in a mental hospital for 3 weeks where I was diagnosed with major depression and given 150mg of Zoloft daily which I felt helped but I wasn't quite sure. After I was discharged, I drove back to my home state (Washington state) across the country and lived with my parents for a few months before landing a job at an airport and moved out about 45 minutes away. While I was living with my parents, I struck up a conversation with an ex girlfriend who seemed very fond of my advances. We struck it off, we had a lot of fun and she told me everything. Unfortunately, another ex boyfriend of hers (not me) ended up raping her a few months ago. I was extremely shocked and saddened by the news. It broke my heart that something so awful could happen to such a good person. And it showed in her. There was so much sadness behind her eyes and whenever we tried to have sex, she sometimes would start crying because something I was doing would remind her of her of what he did. I felt terrible about it. One night I did something so incredibly stupid and I will regret it for the rest of my life. Im not sure what came over me, but I shouldn't make any excuses as I still did it. I called her and told her that I wanted to break up because there wasn't any sex. I feel like a monster for saying it but I fucking did it anyways. That really hurt her and I knew it but for some reason I didn't care... **that was the beginning of it all.** After that I stopped taking zoloft and suffered for few weeks from the withdrawls. For whatever reason I had zero suicidal thoughts during the transition period from taking it everyday to not taking it at all. Now I have them all the time. While I was waiting for my job to start I did nothing but play video games with my friends online. All day everyday and while I was happy, I realized I wasn't getting anywhere and then I did something that was really out of character for me, I blocked all my friends, sold my gaming PC and told them nothing. I hate to admit it but those were some of my best friends, in fact I disowned the best friends I've ever had. They meant everything to me and I threw them all away. But I just couldn't resist doing it again so just recently I blocked the only real-life friend I had without warning him. I stopped messaging him and got rid of him. Theres a common theme between all of these. Every-time I'd do it, Id make the excuse that they're all toxic people and I had to cut them off when really they just wanted to have fun with me. While all that was going on I changed jobs 3 times  because I believed that there were better opportunities on the horizon. Instead of putting in my two weeks, Id just stop showing up to work and switch over to the new job. Im now completely alone in my new apartment and craving for some kind of affection... but I keep deleting it from my life whenever I have it and I can't fucking figure out why? Im now considering changing my name and last name and ditching my family all together... it wasn't much of a family to begin with anyways. I realize now that I'm the only toxic person in my life, I feel like a snake but I don't care, I want the world to fold around me. I apologized to my now ex ex GF but to no avail and I haven't had a real conversation with somebody for weeks. Whats going on?",22Sep2019,1
39,"This will probably be a long post with an overview of my mental health state over the past years. I have an appointment with a psychologist tommorow and this will also help to have an effective appointment. My english might be a bit off and a lot of things can be connected with each other.

**I will start with my time at school**

It all started at a really young age. My mother told me multiple times how I was running away when I was 2/3 years old. They had to lock the door as I would be running if they didn't lock it. They even had to do this when we went to my grandmother. It didn't happen when I got older (4/5 years).

My family said to me that I would probably go to the lowest level of education after elementary school, but all of this changed. I was mainly focused on the lessons and had good grades. Eventually, I got registered for the highest level of education (high school). 

But my time at elementary school wasn't good, but it also wasn't extremely bad. I talked a bit slow and people started to copy this (within my class and family). They also copied my behavior at school for one time. This is all I can remember.

My first 1,5 years of high school was really bad. I had no friends and went to school with pain in my stomach. I decided to change my behavior to fit in and my reputation increased for the better (last 0,5 years of the second year). This decision was one of the worst decision in my life. 

I had to change school (my school didn't offer the last 4 years of my education level) and I was extremely scared as I never had many friends or any social contact at school. This transition was the start of me dropping out of high school.

I became friends with one of my class mates. The first year of this friendship wasn't bad, but we didn't make appointments to do something else. It was mainly talking at school and sitting next to each other. 

In the next year, he got a girlfriend and I was put to the side in my view. He wasn't talking to me and I was sitting alone once again. They broke up at the start of the fifth year and our friendship also got ruined. His ex-girlfriend talked to me about the things that happened and I never heard the other side of the story. After that moment, he would ignore us and turn around when he had to pass her or me. He also started to act weird during the classes.

I started chatting a lot with my new friend (the ex-girlfriend of my old friend) and a new person who entered our class in the fifth year. We mainly talked about work, school and other events. It was something that I really needed and I got addicted to the chatting. I also started to like her, but I never decided to talk to her about this. I didn't want to ruin our friendship over that.

But things started to go wrong and I became extremely sad, started to portray myself death when cycling. I had no concrete plans regarding suicide, but I had thoughts about it. This was the first time that I had suicidal thoughts, but I happily went to my doctor the same week.

I got more frustrated and angry about the smallest things and I had multiple fights with my only two friends. I said and did things that resulted in them crying. This is something I am ashamed for and it's really a thing that shouldn't have happened. It got worse after that and the chatting declined a lot and my frustration increased. At the end of that year, I wanted clarity and I send her some messages that resulted in her crying and blocking me for the second or third time.

I started my last year with ambition, but I couldn't get myself up in the morning to leave for school. I did a lot during of work during that time to recover, but my brain eventually blocked. I couldn't focus or concentrate at my homework and I decided to drop out. I've looked multiple times at starting a home study, but I'm not in the right state at the moment.

**This is my school time and I will now continue with my work career (started at 15 years).**

I started working in 2015 and it was something I really enjoyed. I could pour my mind into this and it was my way of escaping reality. I took one week of holiday leave in the 4 years I worked and always went to work (even when I wasn't feeling great).

But my frustration levels increased (same period as the start of the suicidal thoughts) and I got angry about the smallest things. I was also forgetting things and my concentration levels went down a lot. I never let these things get in my way and got promoted multiple times. I wasn't happy, but I had a way to escape. It only worked for so long before I couldn't escape my reality anymore.

So I decided to work at another store in another city, so I was obliged to move out. It didn't go that way. My stomach hurt a lot during the last week at my old job and the first week of my new job. I kept working and I eventually went home on the last day of my old job. I started working at my new job and threw up multiple times, but I kept working and went home on the fourth day. 

The pain stopped after a week and I started working again with success, but I got sick again at the start of 2019. I've never worked there again and my contract didn't get extended. 


**This is a quick look into my work career and I will now continue with my family**

My father had a daughter who did drugs. She got a kid and she left her with my mother and father when she was 9 months old. She was normal at first, but this changed when she was around 6 years (Will refer as foster care sister).

She started stealing stuff from my room and she started to act weird against my mother. I started to hate her more and more. She was throwing stuff at my mother and started to steal more. It was extremely bad as my school time wasn't great either.

My sister, grandfather, uncle and 2 aunts died in the span of 3 years and this had a big impact on my father and mother. My father started drinking a lot and my mother was only home to clean and cook. I basically had no parents during a period of 3/4 years. 

My foster care sister started to used their deaths in a way to hurt my mother. She also said that I should die and I should get cancer. She eventually got taken away at the funeral of my uncle. 

But the aftermath was huge. My father and mother broke up and I started living with my mother. It was freeing at first, but that changed after a while.

I said to my mother that I wasn't ready for my foster care sister to sleep her. She slept at my mother's home the next day. My mood changed and I started walking for about 3 hours and had to force myself to go home. I had a panic attack later that week and I decided to sleep at a hotel for the night. I felt more home at that hotel.

I wasn't talking to anyone at my home for a month before starting to talk with my mother again. I didn't trust her at that moment, but it changed after that. 

But my relationship with my sister is bad and I don't talk with my brother and he doesn't talk to me. We do live together, so that's really bad and will probably not be solved if the situation doesn't change. I had zero contact with my father, but I had a good talk with him about two weeks ago.

My niece committed suicide in January 2019 and this was something that really touched me as I have the same thoughts (not as bad), but these thoughts really impact me.

**I can go on about this, but a lot of it is repetitive. I will now continue about the development of my complaints**

I had multiple mood swings during the last 1,5 years. I also had suicidal thoughts during this period and didn't eat for a week. 

My thoughts regarding suicide got worse and worse after time. One of the times was last year when I had my first panic attack. I went to the store thinking it was my last time. I decided to contact the suicide hotline and got in contact with a therapist. I had one appointment before the contact stopped. 

I registered for betterhelp two times and one of the therapist said that he couldn't help me. I needed face to face counseling. So I contacted my doctor and got in touch with a therapist. I had face to face counseling, but my all time low happened several weeks after that.

My suicidal thoughts took control over me and I stopped eating. I started to idealise how I could do it and I made concrete plans. I started cleaning my room and looked at my death insurance, finances (I have debts) to prepare for it. But I contacted the suicide hotline again and showed these messages at my therapist the next day. I was transfered to crisis help.

My mood increased slightly during that period and I'm now waiting for my first appointment at a psychologist. 

**Other things**

- I had around 6500 euros of debt; currently my debt is 2700 euros;

- I'm currently not working and I'm currently getting my money from the government (feeling really bad about this, but there is not much I can do at the moment);

- I had multiple panic attacks;

- I have frequent pains in my stomach (most likely caused by the things I eat);

- I think that I don't really have anything and that I'm faking everything (Imposter Syndrome?);

- I'm scared in social situations (even with family members): at birthdays, school (feeling that people laugh at me);

- I'm not confident about the way I talk because of the events at a young age;

40,"Hi everyone, i would like to talk about me for a bit before diving into my problem, please excuse my english as i lived most of my life outside the united states, im a 20 year old male, my parents used to live in the united states however they decided to go back to their home country when i was just a year old, i stayed with my family untill i became old enough, here i decided to go back and start working on myself to have a stable life here in america (in Maryland), i talked with someone i know quite well and he decided to help me out in my first few months, he found me a room to live in in a 4 bedroom house, i met a bunch of people who live in the house till now everything seemed great, in a month or so i started applying for jobs (once i got internet and a sim card) and getting all my important stuff done (id, bank account, driver license)

I met someone who lives in the room beside mine, he was a foreigner who's been living in the united states for 2.5 years he is in his 30's, we became friends and he actually helped me out with a lot of things, one day i was asking him about how i want to go and apply for a driver license and he told me how hard it will be and that i will need alot of paper and work, (at the time i had no car and i was low in budget, MVA was a bit far), then he offered to take me there and help me out, that he would talk with some employees to speed the process. I totally agreed and we went, once we got there he told me to sit down so it doesnt look suspicious and asked for all the papers (i was like what would look suspicious? We arent doing anything illegal are we? He was like no but we dont want all the other people see us skip the line as they will start complaining) i handed him all the papers and decided to sit somewhere close to him, he started making phone calls and slowly moving away from my chair. No he didn't run, but i felt like he was trying to take pics of my documents including my SSN, we waited then i decided to go stand close to him, he didn't like it and asked me to sit. But i didn't listen. After a long wait we finally finished, but i was shocked, THE PROCESS WAS REALLY EASY, once we got out and he drove the car i said the process wasn't hard like you told me, it was pretty easy and we waited almost like any other customer, he started saying no sense, here i started fearing this guy (I never knew what a SSN was back then, no one ever told me how important it is).
He also told me that i will need to go to a driving school and do a bunch of other things to get my driver license, and said that he knew a guy who will skip all this tasks for a 1000 dollars, i immediately refused as i believe its totally illegal and thinking about the first lie he told me made me slowly cut my relationship with the guy 

I started hearing lies and lies and when i asked about him, no one knew who he was, his full name or what he do. You never know what he is up to, if he is married, or if he is staying legally in the united states.

One time i was outside doing some stuff, when i got back to my room it wasnt the same i felt like someone got in and was searching for something, all my documents are kept in my bag which is accessible to anyone in the room. I wasn't sure if someone got in as i have my room locked all the time and continued normally just to find out few days later that the same guy has a copy of my lock keys which made me really scared, when i asked him why he has a copy of my keys he was like ""just in case you left without notice"", what?? This guy just lies and answer with no sense.

I decided to change the lock, stopped talking to him and asked the guy who brought me to the house to find me a new place far from this, and it happened, in less than a month i moved out.

I met some people in the new house and they used to bring up subjects about SSN, work, tax, etc... and only then i knew how important my SSN was, i started asking more and learning, but i felt like it was too late, i could never sleep at night thinking about how stupid i was, not having my documents secured in a safe place since then all i feel is fear , I'm afraid that he have my SSN and that he might use it one day.

This guy is different from anyone else i met, and after hearing stories i found out that people like him would stay several years in he united states just waiting for the right moment to steal, take loans, do crimes and run to their home countries.

I had no idea what to do, i had no evidence, it was just a feeling with a high chance that he is actually planning to use it big in few years. I never felt like this before and i can't live feeling this way.

I started thinking of what i can do, never found a true solution, i went to a Social security office and explained a bit about how i feel unsecure they gave me a number to call when something happen, but i don't want to sit waiting for something to happen and if the guy ever did anything he would leave the country immediately, i want to feel safe, i don't know what to do and i can't stop thinking about it, overthinking every day changed me, i used to be happy no matter what, now nothing cheer me up, to a point where my psychological condition is really bad.

45,"It’s an awful thing to be and I’m aware of that. But I’ve had two friends who’ve had EDs and came out gorgeous. I hate my body. I hate my face. But I have a boyfriend and friends and family around me who say otherwise. I still don’t believe them. I have a shitty need for more validation. Even from strangers. I look at these “successful” people who struggled with EDs and think,”I can be like them. I can be pretty.” I just binged after eating less than 1000 calories today. Well, not really a binge just a weird meal. About 10 chicken nuggets, rice and seaweed, with these almond, cheese, and cranberry snack mixes. I feel bad for eating. This does feel like r/eatingdisorders territory but I don’t have one yet. I’ve had experience of starving myself for a week after a break up with my ex because he cheated on me with a skinnier girl who I thought was my friend. Ever since I only feel anger and jealousy towards those I deem prettier than me, even friends. I struggle with this toxic mindset and I hate myself for thinking this way. I tried becoming more body positive of myself. I tried loving how look. I’ve been called pretty so much. I’ve even had a friend jealous of me for my looks. But I still feel like shit about myself. My pretty friend who had an ED talked about how she was treated better and people became more attracted to her, treated her nicer, approached her, and flirted with her more. Exactly what I want. I can’t make friends well and work better when others approach me. Otherwise I think,”What’s the point in trying to be friends with them. They don’t want you as a friend. They’re just being nice. They have other friends much better and who they’ll always be much closer with than you.” I crave close relationships and friendships. I used to have that group until it fell apart after middle school. My support group is gone. I have some good/closeish friends but there’s a mental distance between me and my friend who survived the ED. I feel guilty for wanting to suffer through her illness. I feel guilty that I get jealous when she gets unwanted attention from boys and men at her job. I asked my mom for a therapist again but she questions why I have these issues. She says I have everything. It makes me want to hit her because I’m suffering in my mind with my conflicting thoughts about my friend, thoughts about my body, and considerations for and ED. I don’t know how to conclude this post other than. If anyone can give me help to make me skinny, stop being jealous of my friend, or accept and love myself. That’d be appreciated.",22Sep2019,1
46,"My main question is, do you really come out of depression? I've had a couple depressive episodes during my life, even though I've had a really big one (around 4 year long), some times I feel I'm going to fall down again into that hole.

Quick notes. This is going to be the WHOLE story of my life without details. Also it's my first post and I don't know the format. Also English is not my native language.

Some background, when I was 8 my dad got a promotion from the company he worked in, this promotion also involved in him moving our whole family to another country. This change of, well everything caused major problems in my family. My older sister was affected harshly as she was around 2 years into college when we moved, but I don't really know how much it affected her. My parent's relationship was not in the best it could be, but they managed to remain together, what I can say about that is that their constant fighting really did affect me as a child, before we moved out of the country we lived in a house and they would manage to isolate me of their fights, but once we moved to the new country we had to learn to live in an apartment, and apartments are horrible to isolate problems and shouting so I had to suck up their discussions and cry because they where fighting.

Now, being in a new country the culture difference was shocking for all of us, in all the time from arriving to this country to this moment right now I had to pass through 3 different schools, all this change was caused by bullying done not only by students at each school, but even staff, it is a story for another time, but this problem was inter-scholar, and it got some high ranking staff members fired and their licences to  work in a children field revoked. 

All this caused me to start self-harming, and I had 3 suicide attempts in my adolescence. Mainly the self-harming was discovered by school administration and was reported, instantly sending me to having therapy. First therapy I had was with the school's psychologist, who she made me see that every problem that happened was my fault and I should change and stop whining (As said above school staff also bullied me and it backfired really bad), after my mom receiving this news, she was also told that I was to be put into therapy with an outside psychologist of her choosing, I was a really aggressive child and stubborn one. The first psychologist I went my mom did not like his methods and removed me from his therapy. Second therapist I went, mom approved her method, but I became overly aggressive (on a quick note, I broke her door and a couple of large pots, and chairs in her office building. Third psychologist, I'll be honest, I lied my way out of therapy, or so I think.

After all this, I think that it is enough background, other small depressive episodes are small crappy teenage things that made me feel bad and I think it would be too much stuff put up here. 

Now in 2016 my father passed because cancer.  Too long of a story, but it really affected all of us. I do not rally know if it belongs to the main story but it's really hard to lose a parent to cancer. 

Now to the main story.

I am currently 4 days away from my 21st birthday. Since my 19th birthday I have been having this nostalgic feeling that makes me cry, every time I think about becoming a year older I feel bad, I miss my childhood, I start to cry when I am alone. I like seeing the things from my childhood, like pictures or music. I miss being a child, no responsibilities, no nothing, just happiness. I miss everything about . my childhood in my other country, I would love to go back in time and remain there. I have gone back to my home country 3 times,  the times I went back I felt like a tourist. I miss being a kid, everything got fixed right away,  problems did not last long, for me it was pure happiness compared to adulthood. Some times I want to end my life, I do not want to grow up. Also a lot of problems I have right now I blame on growing up. I don't know how to explain it, but it just feels wrong to grow up, I miss being a child. 

After getting out of therapy about 6 years ago I have had 3 depressive episodes, but I do not know if you really get out of it and move on. These 3 episodes have lasted more than 2 months and they have really affected me. I do not know if anyone needs any more information, if it is needed I do not mind typing more about these episodes.",22Sep2019,3

50,"I seriously hate how even today nobody talks about suicide. 

I study law and recently went back to uni. Two years ago a really well-regarded and sort of famous professor committed suicide. This whole thing was not talked about by anyone. No newspaper articles, no letter on our school website. Just the obituary that hints towards suicide. People lower their voices when they mention her. They whisper the word ‘suicide’. 

I wish we’d taken this tragic event as an opportunity to discuss mental health and suicidal thoughts. Because people have to understand that it doesn’t matter how ‘successful’ or highly regarded you are. You can still be suicidal. 

I had a - to me - particularly shocking experience the other day. I was walking to the train station with two of my uni friends. I’ve known them for a year so we are close but there’s lots of stuff we don’t know about each other. Like they don’t know about my mental health issues yet. So I once more brought up how our uni and the press never cared to even acknowledge the way this professor died. 

My one friend replied that it does make sense though because more people would follow her and kill themselves too. My other friend totally agreed with him and said this would have triggered so many students to kill themselves. This is just not true? I told them not speaking about a subject will never make it better and they sort of thought it over and agreed with me a little bit. I didn’t want to start a huge discussion because we were just about to say goodbye. 

What do you think? Would this be triggering for any of you? Just an article about someone committing suicide? Personally even in my darkest moments this could not send me over the edge.",22Sep2019,3

52,"Today, I opened my laptop and finally wrote something about my mental health. I wanted to share it and see if anyone could help me or relate or offer advice and that's how I found Reddit. Here's what I wrote, it's only short but maybe I can keep writing (does that help?) and try to talk to someone about my mental health to build up to the real thing.

""It is Sunday 22nd September 2019. I have hit rock bottom. Ok, so not “Rock Bottom” rock bottom, I’m still functioning, or at least on the surface – I have a job and a partner and a home. As yet, I’ve managed to maintain that and I recognise my blessings, I really do. I'm in a much better place than I have been in the past when things have been really down and out - but I recognise that this is a rock bottom in how I feel, mostly about myself.

For around 20 years, I’ve been aware that I have mental health problems. Depression looms large in my family and close family members have committed suicide. I know that many others are on anti-depressants but we don’t talk about it, or anything really. I just know that and can't bring myself to ask. I never sought help and I always wanted to handle this myself. I thought I was different, that I could fix it myself. I’ve always just sort of… carried on. I thought I could handle it and have kidded myself that the days, weeks and sometimes even months of my life where I can’t get out of bed or function are just a part of life. I’d like to say that I was strong enough to talk about this in the past, but I wasn’t. At least now I can say the word depression, I couldn’t even say it out loud for most of my life.

I’m feeling mentally stronger at the moment, but I know I'm a mess. I've got almost no motivation and things don't seem that fun, I have to keep deleting all my social media to not sink and even basic tasks seem impossible sometimes. My diet and drinking is out of control. I was drinking and eating to fill a void, just like everything else I’ve gotten hooked on on-and-off over the years; drugs, cigarettes, gambling, spending money, computer games, sex. Short-term relief that always had long-term consequences.

I don’t exercise and that’s mostly because I try not to leave the house. I work from home, and that means I can just about never see anyone if I want to, and that only feeds my anxiety. I’m 182cm, weigh 12st 12lbs and now have a 40” waist and a 38” chest, which I think shows how much I have ballooned when my lower half is bigger. I’ve got that classic beer belly loo and the worse I look, the worse I feel and I just want to do more self-destructive things.

Like I said, I feel a lot stronger emotionally at the moment (hey, I’m writing this and starting to want to talk about things and even feeling like I want to seems like a big step) but it’s been a slow, gradual decision. I had a lousy summer and seriously considered suicide back in July. That was the first time in a long time. On the verge of jumping off a building, I managed to come back from the edge (literally and figuratively) and just sort of, give it another go. I came back and I guess, I’ve slowly inched each day towards this. A new resolve. 

This is it. I need to start eating right, living healthy and getting out of my house. I need to start looking after myself and feeling good about who I am, instead of hating myself. I know that I need to fix myself, but I also need help. I think I finally need to see a professional and finally talk to someone about this. Maybe I can get a diagnosis instead of stabbing in the dark, I don’t know. The idea of talking to someone I don’t know about any of this just feels so overwhelming. I think I know that I have to try.""

Probably a lot of stuff that may be a bit sensitive for those that read.

Also everything may be a little all over the place sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

So today is my birthday, I'm turning 19 and actually have a pretty nice life, I have a farther who can help support me financially even when I have a job and a mother who cares about me deeply but rarely speaks, a girlfriend who takes care of me and always does everything for me and showers me with affection and I feel guilty for how great she is. Yet I feel so lacklustre and my life just feels diminished as a whole for no reason. Horrible truths about my families past have all come flocking to me as I find out small things about them which turn out to be a lot bigger issue than they present it themselves. But my only instinct is I can't trust on anyone I know at all and simply want to run away. My mother recently had gone through psychosis for the 2nd time as she re-lapsed and I found a document which listed certain symptoms to tell when she is in danger of herself, and the details contained a lot of details about myself being safe and I feel completely lied to. While my farther has had his many partners that I couldn't keep up with and my brain got to confused with where I am. I feel emotionally cut off, yet I continue to be scared about every single thing someone thinks of me, my brain feels like something is off consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

Chances are if someone who knows me finds this they will be able to pinpoint it back to me, but by doing so thats what I want, a form of attention indirectly. I overly apologise and feel like a burden, I'm scared to ask people for rides and instead of asking directly I suggest that I dont have a ride to a event or venue due, so that they feel obliged to have to give me one and I feel terrible about it consistently. Each word that I say feels like it has lost all meaning  and my emotional sense is a 2nd shadow of who I really am. Im usually a very positive energy myself and continue to be loud and happy and dance everywhere I go, yet I feel so flat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont know a lot has happened and I can't explain it at all, and in the end I know that I don't even have the worst of it all and I know deep down that those who suffer much more than I do deserve a position that I have myself in right now.

(New to Reddit so here goes)

Today I woke up with extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Just like I did for years now.

My chest just keep s on hurting, my head is always humming with accusations of how dysfunctional I am.

I'm 26, currently a student and I'm failing my studies. I barely work at my job so I can work on my project, yet I'm still behind..

Even though I was supported financially by my Grandfather I'm failing him..

I go to college almost everyday, even when there's no one in class, to work but no matter what I do it's not enough..

I come from a poor background (even now I support my mom and baby sister when I can as my mom is going through an ugly divorce, she barely takes care of herself and looks 52 at the age of 43 which freaks me out), so succeeding in my studies is important.

My mom is no help herself, she's struggling so I can't turn to her..

My grandfather doesn't understand the concept of depression . I once made the mistake of telling him about my suicidal thoughts..He honestly asked me is I'm insane..

I went to the psychiatrist and took anti depressants for about 3 years and suffered terribly from side effects. (Now I'm off after 1.5 years of trying to quit).

I'm seeing a therapist for 4 years now but when I sink in the suicide rut she seems helpless and unable to guide me out. She does a lot for me, checking in on me asking me to call her if I have thought but I can't burden her with myself on a daily basis beyond our meetings...

Even my boyfriend of 8 years is at a loss..he honestly doesn't know what to do with me anymore so he just goes through the motions. He, like the rest of the world have no time to pause for those who are frozen in place by pain and fear.

(He does try but he's not listening. Not really).

I can't turn to ER with my suicidal thought in my country in fear of being mistreated, admitted against my will and later stigmatized while looking for a job. (My therapist advised me against it for those reasons).

At college and work everyone avoids 'negative talk' and I always have to smile and mask myself. To the question ""How are you"" there is only one valid answer and it's always positive. Honestly, will people please stop asking if the don't wish to know? It's not as polite as our culture teaches.

I've been battling with this since age 8. I'm very tired. I really can't go on like this! this has to stop one way or another.

I need a guide. An actual guide. I don't want people to ""be there for me"" while passively holding my hand and feeling sorry for me.

I need someone to tell me how to get OUT of this black hole! Instructions!

I cannot keep self harming just to get by day by day!

If someone were to die I can't consciously care anymore, but I will still cry and what not even though it goes against my thoughts. What's worse is that sometimes I don't know what's hurting me unconsciously. Like if school or work gets overwelhming my body will start to get weak and I can't focus or concentrate on anything. Consciously it seems out if the blue because I couldn't give less of a shit about anything, but unconsciously I must be fucking dying. So it leaves me guessing what's wrong with me today, and it's honestly not fun. Anyone relate or explain? An I just next level acting or am I still feeling stuff unconsciously?",22Sep2019,13

63,"I was wondering if anyone else has the same reaction I do to antipsychotics.

Every single time I'm on them I turn into a giant ball of anger. It's like every little thing will set me off. 

I'm currently on Geodon for bipolar 2. I've been on most of the Risperidol family(again made me very aggressive) , and I'm allergic to Abilify. 

I hate feeling like this, over my 17yrs of therapy, medications, and inpatient visits I have very few coping skills that work for anger and none of them are super healthy. All of my coping skills are directed towards my anxiety and depression because I usually have pristine control over my anger (that took 3 solid years of work in my teens) 

As of right now I have no control and I hate it. I can't stand the feeling of being pissed off for no reason which is making me angrier. 

I just got off inpatient on Friday, I don't have an intake until Wednesday so I'm stuck taking it for now to help me stay stable. (Was out of treatment and unmedicated for about 3 years! But somehow built a stable life while ""unhinged"" emotionally)",22Sep2019,2
64,"My thoughts are just fucked at this point. I think it's because I used to be proper depressed and think of all the shit wrong in the world and in my life, and when I was forced to pretend everything was fine my mind just made sure I never thought about bad things, even if that meant I just can't think. It used to just be a massive fucking headache when I even tried to proper think. Like, imagine an apple in your mind. Or solve an equation by imaging the numbers. Anything like that split my head, so I had to just kind of unconsciously do things. Any equations in math I just had to do half mindedly, all memories I couldn't think back on, trying to remember something was a no-no, couldn't read stories, etc. My entire life was forced into unconscious actions, there were no thoughts or decisions behind them. It was dull and robotic, but I couldn't care, because that would require thought. I couldn't even try and fix it because if I wanted to I had to diagnose it and that ended up in excruciating pain. Over time it died down and I can now think. I'm now at least part human. But it has so many side effects now. Headaches still occur at times, either randomly or when thinking to hard or too long. I have what I can only explain as split voices in my head. They're my voices but they all want different things and hate each other. Like I want some food, four voices start up one wanting food, another telling him his a fat fuck that deserves to die in hell, one that just wants to commit suicide and one that believes I'm faking all my issues. They yell over each other and will fight using my own body. Like to get at another they'll slam a fork onto my hand. Or sometimes my hand will randomly grab a table or my feet refuse to move and I have to force them to move with brute force. I have to keep myself stimulated in my free time, other wise I'll have a mental break down. Music or videos help, but it means I can't do things like study or sleep since they require peace. It also means I won't lose my mind if I'm around people as that's enough to stray off madness. I always have suicidal thoughts, though I don't think that's a mental issue anymore but just reasonable thinking. No sane person wants to deal with an insane mind.",22Sep2019,2

69,"Hi.

I'm a guy in his mid-twenties, who, at the moment, is really really scared of developing schizophrenia.

To add a little bit of backstory, ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of the dark, of ghosts, and the like. Now that I'm an adult, I don't believe in that sort of stuff anymore. But I'm still afraid of the same thing, basically: seeing and hearing scary things that other people can't.

I'm writing this because I'm feeling really stressed at the moment and just need to talk. Last time I had an anxiety attack like this was about thre years ago, feel free to check those posts in my history.

Anyway, right now I'm feeling so anxious because I keep hearing ""phone sounds"" even when they're not there. A whatsapp web message sounds, the buzz you hear wheb you're waiting for someone to pickup. I hear these sound from the environment, maybe the apartment next door, maybe a car passing by, maybe my headphones laying on the sofa. And I'm really afraid that these are hallucinations, and signs of worse to come.

But, another thought crossed my mindmin. I have some compulsive tendencies. You know, checking the shower curtain, the oven, that my door is locked, that everything is as I left it in my apartment. So maybe, just maybe what I'm experiencing is just hypochondria, or something of the like. I keep googling my symptoms, checking reddit, think about calling a medical professional, I've talked about this with my girlfriend and sisters. I don't think that I have schizophrenia. I'm just really afraid of having it, and keep feeling like I'm experiencing symptoms.

Now, if you look at my post history, you'll notice that I've posted on many different subs, like insomnia, migraine, anxiety etc. And I've had other fears as well, however schizophrenia is the main one and keeps coming back.

Some notes: I'm a musician and have tinnitus. I have migraines, and occasional mild sleep paralysis. My friends, family and GF see nothing wrong with me. I have occasional feelings of relief, as well as worse moments. Even writing this already makes me feel more relieved. I don't shy from social activities, instead seek them and they give me comfort. My musicianship isn't affected yet, just had duo practice and had a lot of fun. Haven't really lost my sense of humor, but I do have a lack of appetite, lack of concentration and heavy stress occasionally. Also, I've noticed that these symptoms have a lot to do with phones: three years ago it was visual (thinking i saw my phone screen light up when it didn't), and now auditory with the ringing and buzzing. However, it's not tinnitus right now, as the sound seem to have a source in the environment, they just actually don't. 

So, what I'm basically asking is: is it possible I have a schizophrenia prodrome? Should I worry? The thing is, that I really do think I'm hearing these sounds. I'm aware they don't have a real source, or a source I can't really see, and that stresses me out a lot.

Sorry for the rambly post. I hope I mentioned everything. Not even sure why I posted this, just wanted to went and discuss.",22Sep2019,1

I am living and traveling with a loving boyfriend who I adore so much, but sometimes when he is gone and I am alone for a few hours, I start feeling ""wrong"" if I'm not keeping myself distracted.

Its wonderful, yet I still feel lonely. I panic a lot about whether it will always be this way. I decided last night that no matter what happens, I will treat myself. Today I went out, explored an art gallery, had lunch out. And all the things I'm usually scared of doing on my own.

84,"Hi, I’m a 19 year old female who has a lot going on. It’s always been this way all my life. I live a somewhat normal life for a young adult, I have a job, and I have a boyfriend, and I live in a stable but not supportive household. I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 14 years old. I lived a harsh childhood with drugs, sexual abuse, physical abuse, etc. The people I live with now which includes my biological father don’t get mental health at all. My mother is out of the picture due to excessive drug abuse and addiction, she’s homeless and lives in a halfway house. I choose not to see her due to how much I dislike her for the things that she’s done to me in my past. She put me in a lot of danger, surrounded me with a lot of dangerous people. I’ve only been to a psychiatrist once and I went to therapy but realized how much I hated it. This was years ago and now that I’m 19, I feel like I have something more than just depression. More specifically, I feel like I have borderline personality disorder. Reason why I say this is because I’ve experienced a lot of the symptoms of borderline personality disorder and today I dissociated for the first time I think ever. I was so infuriated at my step brother that I stabbed my make up palette and broke the mirror in the inside because I was so angry. While texting my boyfriend about the anger I was experiencing I said something that I would’ve never said if I was OK in the moment. I said I had a knife and it was either him or me that was going. Now I’ve never been to a mental hospital except for the times I had visited my older sister who doesn’t live with us anymore. I am OK as of right now. I have a long history of self harm and I still struggle with it to this day. My mood swings are extremely intense to the point where I’m scared that i’ll harm myself or someone else, I’m not prescribed on any meds because my father didn’t want me on meds. I usually smoke marijuana to kind of cope with anything that I’m feeling. And when I am not high off marijuana I usually take CBD. I’m trying to find ways to actively help myself because my parents don’t understand and the disheartening thing about it is my step brother goes to therapy for autism or some sort of selective mutism. They don’t really see anything wrong with me or they choose not to see it. When I’m home, I lock myself in my room. I live in constant fear because of my step brother because he has peeped at me inappropriately multiple times and has requested that I have sex with him which I don’t want. I changed my locks because of him and I have a key to my room that I always have on me. I have an intense anger and hatred towards myself because I fucked up a lot of relationships with people including my current relationship with my boyfriend. He’s my main support system and he’s the one that always tells me that he worries for me and wants to support me in anyway possible but I always feel like a burden toward him or my family. I don’t feel loved by anybody and I feel like people don’t care for me. Now that I think about it, I’ve dissociated another time where I thought I was going to take my own life about a few months ago maybe a month ago. I don’t want people to worry for me because I am a person and I know I’m OK until something happens. I’m horrible with money, I binge eat, and I’ve expressed to my boyfriend that I only feel stable with him, what I mean by this is financially and emotionally. When I’m with him, I’m at my best. But once something happens, I don’t feel myself anymore and I deal with an intense conflict between myself and others towards myself and others. I don’t know what this is, I don’t know how to go about it. I’m just rambling because I feel as if I need to get this off my chest to people who care.

So, I'm 15 years old and was left by my dad when I was 7, and so was my big sister (11 at the time).

It wasn't a problem for me that they were going to divorce, but the problem was that I knew why.

My mom was a victim of domestic violence and there was one time when I saw my dad beat my mom with no remorse and no reason at all. The thing that traumatizes me to this very day is how he saw me and my sister peaking through a crack on their bedroom door while he was beating her and proceeding to beat my mom senseless while we were watching. And that's what scarred me.

There were a couple of accidents after that, but I would not like to tell them for the sake of myself. I think those accidents were why I have these problems to this day.

Nowadays, I get angry about the smallest things and I'm not really the most stable when it comes to mentality. I would get really pissed off at anything. Even small jokes from schoolmates or friends. And since I got a little 5-year-old sister now, from my mom's boyfriend of a couple of years, at which house we live at the moment. Anyways, because of the ""silent mental breakdowns"", as I would like to call them, and the mixed emotions of mine, I'm scared that I can harm somebody of my family, friends, schoolmates or teachers.

91,"Sup Reddit. I'm a 17 year-old girl, currently doing my last year in sixth form. The reason for my post, is to get a little bit of advice on how to set better boundaries at work in order for it not impacting my mental health as much. I'll start with a brief overview of my job, and why it affects my mental health as much:

\- Selfishness. I work as a waitress in a Chinese buffet. It can get pretty busy at times. The job isn't particularly difficult, BUT I get the impression that the owner of the restaurant doesn't care about his staff, and uses them as much as he can to his own benefit. The majority of the employees are girls in education, below the age of 18, being paid the minimum wage, of course. We do not get paid extra overtime, our breaks also aren't paid, and if we get a break, which by law we need, we have to stay longer at work. Pretty much, authority doing everything to get as much out of us, not looking at how it affects the workers.

\- Unsafe environment. I am quite sensitive to shouting, aggressive or drunk customers etc. There is no actual policy on how to deal with difficult customers, because of which I have often been victim to racism and verbal abuse, only to find myself having a panic attack at work while hysterically crying in the toilets.

\- Beforehand, I would work very long hours on a Saturday, after a whole week of school. I would often have to work +8 hour shifts, leaving me exhausted. I noticed that working long hours has a negative impact on my wellbeing and worsens my anxiety and depression. Forgot to add, I am two and a half months after a suicide attempt, meaning that I am still quite vulnerable to some things, with the toxic environment at work not helping.

My question is, how can I set firm boundaries at work and effectively re-enforce them when they are violated? Work are not happy with the fact that I told them I cannot work weekends because of my parents not allowing me and because I need to concentrate on my studies. Yet, work are still trying to get me to work long weekends sometimes, which sucks because I am just terrified on enforcing my boundaries with them. But after all, why should I care about the fact that they are short of staff, when my health is more important? They don't care about me and I know that they will continue pressing until they get their way. 

I would appreciate any advice or words of wisdom which I could receive. Thanks",22Sep2019,1

94,"So a little background

My (24m) parents were divorced for as long as I can remember. My mom had a rough time raising me and my sister alone. 

She tried to overdose with pills twice when I was a kid, my dad commited suicide 5 or 6 years ago, my sister couldn't get over it. She had multiple severe panic attacks and recently had been diagnosed (finally). She's taking antidepression pills now and she's scheduled to see a therapist.

I once had a suicidal thoughts when I was a teenager, it was stopped with one random song that I needed to hear. There was over 700 songs in my library and the random playback hit that one. I would say highly unlikely but pretty cool.

From then I had no severe psychological problems. Yes I'm sad from time to time but that's about it. But I also have no strong feelings. No strong joy, no strong sadness. My father died and I was sad for a week or two. That was it, I moved on.

Is this normal? Like my family's history of mental health is fucked up and I'm here surviving with being sad when I'm alone and bored. I feel like I should be a mess but I'm not. Not complaining, just mildly surprised.",22Sep2019,3

I have not been myself for at least 5 months Because I worked my ass off during the summer to save up money for the school year and then the school year comes around and I’m feeling the same if not worse than I did over the summer. I did have a toxic relationship with my sister for awhile but we did make amends and have a great relationship now. I do have a great group of friends and roommates at school and they’re feeling somewhat down about what’s going on too but I don’t think they’re taking this as hard as I am. In addition to the controversy going on, which I don’t want to explain too much about, I lost my good fake ID at a bar, so I pretty much can’t go out as much as I used to, and I and my roommates had to defend ourselves on our own property when some people tried to attack one of our roommates over a past incident so I was a little traumatized by that even though I wasn’t that injured overall. But to get to the point, I feel the worst I’ve ever felt in awhile about anything, and while there are silver linings, got a nice internship and there’s some fun times, I just am wondering if I should find help or something. I’ve always felt like I’ve had anxiety/depression but thought I exhumed it from my life when I was in middle school but it seems like I’m feeling worse than I have ever felt in awhile.

101,"Hi,

I'm 19, and a few years ago, some pretty bad stuff happened. Someone that I really trusted decided that if I wouldn't date him, he would make my life a living hell. He spread lies about me all throughout my school and within a month, almost everybody hated me. When everyone hates you, more people jump in and start the antagonizing too. I was being broken down my dozens of my peers who just weeks before, liked me very much. Then, the boy who started it all managed to get one of my best friends to turn on me too. 

When I went to my school counselors, they told me that it was all my fault, and didn't do anything to help.

THEN, the only two people that still stuck by me got into a huge fight. M accused K of bullying her, even though that wasn't true at all. From then, every single time I said anything at all about K in front of M, she would flip out on me. She'd make a big, embarrassing scene, and have her sister, a psychology major, send me berating text messages that twisted my mind around until *I* ended up apologizing to *them.*

Eventually, I reflected on my friendship with her and realized that since the day I met her, she'd been manipulating me. She made fun of interests that she didn't share until I stopped talking about them, put me down every single time I wrote or drew something that I was proud of, and had problems with every single one of my friends. I stopped talking to her.

Now, I have this ungodly fear of losing my friends. It's so severe that I distance myself from new people. That way, I won't get close enough to anybody for them to be able to turn around and hurt me. Every time I see or hear anything that reminds me of senior year, I get intrusive thoughts about it. I can't get the memories to go away and leave me alone. They just stick in my mind, taunting me. I barely ever look at my yearbook. Instead of happy memories, all I see in it are people that stabbed me in the back and drove me to the brink of depression.

As for the friends that I DO have, I always fear that they secretly hate me. That they keep me around just so they can have something to laugh at. I over analyze every interaction, beating myself up all of the time over things that don't matter or just aren't there.

I do have generalized anxiety, but this is different. I don't really know what to call it.

In your opinion, does it sound like I could be experiencing PTSD or C-PTSD? Or is it just my GAD being heightened?",22Sep2019,2
102,"https://imgur.com/a/a7Fvnkz pictures of me as a child when the bullying and abuse started


Girls used to say I was ugly back then and everyone made fun of me. I now see they were clearly jealous, but that torment along with other things like abuse from my father when he expected nothing less than perfection clearly fucked up my psychological state. Fuck bullying. I became a pothead by the time I was 13, an alcoholic by the time I was 16, quit smoking pot at 18, but then knocked up three different girls with no real plans of going to college from the time I was 18-23, and just didn’t give a shit about anything. I then became a heroin addict at 25 after having been super fit from the time I was 21-24, but quit exercising and got hooked until I was 28. I have been clean for 2 and a half years, married to a very nice girl who helped me through the addiction, we own our first house together and I am close graduating as a network engineer, cyber security specialist, and programmer, and also working at my school. But there were times in my life where I was suicidal, and reckless. I have no clue why people called me ugly or were so mean to me, but it sucked. I think I was adorable and many other people agree now, and I am still decent looking. And now people from my home town justify the fact that they always bullied me or still currently hate me off of the messed up things I have done, that they drove me to do.",22Sep2019,3

114,"Recently I went through something very emotionally traumatic. I've been slightly paranoid of the people around me ever since. I started to rely on them for emotional support but slowly started realizing the emotional toll it was taking on the people around me. I became further paranoid with people's intent. I've also noticed I've been losing sleep, ruminating on things that happened during the day trying to make sense of what has happened. What I've noticed, however, is that during the night, my mind will ""invent"" things that happened, things I noticed during the day, conversations I've had with people throughout the day. I will then have an ""aha"" moment as though I finally figured out that person's true intent. They're almost always negative and very powerful i.e. ""That person never loved me"" or ""They think I'm stupid"" or ""They're using me."" I have these fake experiences that seem ultra real that have been validating my deepest insecurities, so much so that I have to reason with myself that they didn't actually happen.

I have made another post in r/survivorsofabuse explaining a part of what's happening to me. Even though nothing has changed about that, lately I get idk if that's anxiety attacks or whatever but remember something that happened or think about something uncomfortable/embarassing/sad/whatever (incl. But not limited to what I said on my other post) and I suddenly start replaying it to my mind in detail over and over again, when I try to repress it my brain still wants to replay the same thing again. Sometimes I just sit there with my eyes open staring at.. nothing, start breathing heavily, start screaming or shouting alone, start moving, and shout that I need antidepressants.

I am only 14 and I like.. how do I say this.. I still get boners but like... I'm not as hard as I used to be and they get off more easily? (Still for some reason boners come when I don't want them to). This may not only be happening to older dudes but I doubt being 14y/o and experiencing that frequently are positive either. 

I have suicidal thoughts and yesterday I entered a 14 story building, went to the highest floor and was trying to decide if I would jump or not. I obviously was a pussy for any of that so ofc I went back home and regretted not having jumped. They had forgotten the front door opened so if anything that seemed like a perfect chance.

Who would my death hurt? Probably a few people but they'd get over it. The only people I'd probably seriously hurt are my parents but I've repeatedly asked them for help, antidepressants, a psychiatrist, and told them what's happening to me and they degrade it blaming everything on puberty and my obsessions. Maybe if I actually did that they'd realize something was indeed not right. They'll still have two more children.

I have trouble falling asleep and wake up much earlier than I usually would because once I wake up I'm too sad to fall asleep again. Last year I had 100+ absent hours from school, and a good portion were because I was sleeping and now I put my alarm at 7:30AM and I'm usually still awake before the alarm even rings. That may sound like a good thing but this shouldn't be the reason I get up in time.

I feel like crying (tho I don't do so really often), and immense sadness pretty much all the time. Even when I laugh, am in a group or make people laugh, I don't do it 'to hide the pain' but like I still feel sad (maybe a little less but still). DK why but I still make jokes. And the second I stop the sadness returns to its 100% again. Sometimes the sadness is just deeper.

I can't concentrate on anything. My parents, counselors and every adult behind me wants me to study 2 hours a day and say it's possible for me. Fuck, even reading a Reddit post has become a challenge.

I didn't go out much during the summer and I stayed at home exploring the Internet, watching Spanish TV series and overall teaching me Spanish (I achieved that, but I started not seeing much and then not seeing at all at a point cause I didn't feel okay psychologically anymore not even for something as simple as watching Netflix). My cousin lent me her Spanish language learning books and I haven't gone far for that same reason. 

School started and I sometimes have anxiety attacks (not an expert as I said so Idk if it's that again but like how else will I name them for the sake of the post?) in class and according to the teachers ""I do it because I don't find the lesson interesting, don't care and because I wanna be the center of attention and distract the class"". FUCK! Maybe it's my fault not explaining why they're wrong but still it's not easy to admit everything like I do here or on survivorsofabuse.

I've been FA and I'm still among the few in my group to have not kissed with tongue and I was wondering why this was happening, after all it's probs not about looks cos they're not half bad or anything I just realised why would a girl wanna be with my depressed ass? I give out negative and depressive vibes so why would a person even befriend me? Even if I'm not like that I'm a creep so...

I'm not an expert nor psychiatrist nor anything but I don't need to be any of that to know that I'm not okay psychologically.

122,"I've noticed that the more I am around people, the more unhappy I am in the long run. People in general amplify my general unhappiness. Examples: People at work. People in the general public (stores, public transit, parks, restaurants). Events. Parties. Family gatherings. Friend gatherings. Whether the crowd is big or small... the experience of being around others tends to amplify negative feelings in the long run. 

When I am around others, I behave as I always do. Very naturally. I do not feel awkward or anything like that. 

I have noticed that \*after\* I interact with people, I need to be isolated for a long period of time in order to process. It's as if my interaction left a resonating effect on me, causing me to fixate on ....just about anything from the interaction. It's almost overstimulating... as if I binged on caffeine and sugar.... and I need to be alone for a day or more just to ""*metabolize*"" the entire experience **out**. 

If I do not receive that downtime away from people, then it pumps up my general lack of enjoyment with life. I cannot focus. I cannot sleep. I become agitated.   


I have gone for very long spans of time (a week) without interacting with others and it is incredible. I feel refreshed and happy and focused. My creativity peaks. I feel so much more alive and whole.   


Anyway, I cannot determine what this condition is. It doesn't feel like the descriptions of social anxiety that I've seen. I am not afraid of being judged by others and I do not feel awkward around others. It's more like.... an exhaustion. Not physical, but I will use a physical example as an analogy: Ever have to hurry up a flight of stairs? You do it just fine, and even feel fine while you're doing it, but when you get to the top... you suddenly feel that wave of exhaustion hit you... and you have to stop a moment, process all that stimulation that went to your legs and feet, your lungs and heart, and then once everything settles and rebalances... you're good to go.

125,"I missed out on the college experience. I never got to get the party stuff out of my system and I never got to dorm. As a matter of fact, I still live at home as a college student. To be honest, I know I missed out on my best opportunity to make great friends and it only gets harder from here. Personally, I lack the patience in adult friendship building as I know it takes more effort in adulthood. To be honest, I am not going to waste my time. People frustrate me already so, trying to make friendships with adults who lets face it already have their friends and are only concentrated on work; it will drive me insane and again it would be a fucking waste of time. Adults past college don't strike me as people who desire those intimate relationships. My best opportunity has sailed and no matter what I do, I will never have a big network of friendships than most people do. The only thing that makes my life tolerable is the startup I work for. Truth is, I'm ready to spend the rest of my life alone.

Some wonder whether I should befriend the people I work with. Thing is, despite being in similar ages, my co-workers have already experienced the same things I desired. It's out of their system and from the things they told me, it looks like they've moved on. I would not get any satisfaction from them. Yes, the only people I would even consider befriending are college students who are still freshmen or sophomores. This is because their friendship groups are still forming especially that of freshman. If that makes me seem creepy, I don't care cause this has turned into more of a vent. Admittedly the only person I would date is that of age and admittedly, I just want to live that college experience through someone.

I don't know where this vent came from. It was just meant to be a question but it was time I let it out somewhere. My startup is doing well and it has given me hope. If I move to San Francisco, I would love to have a similar experience a college freshman have but I know I'm just going to be set up to be disappointed. Again, I'm mentally preparing myself for solitude. Loneliness sucks but hey, at least I'll be somewhat in peace.",22Sep2019,1

128,"I'm 18, on quite strong antidepressants and have suffered from severe social anxiety in the past. I was also diagnosed with Asperger's when I was like 6 but I'm fairly sure that was a misdiagnosis (somehow).

A couple years ago I started ice skating with a friend and we got really into it. A few months later I started working there and a few more months after that so did my friend. We both still ice skated for fun all the time, as customers, and one evening while doing so a really cute girl came up and said hi. We started talking and I asked her out, she said yes, and I spent the next few months with what I would consider to be rather crippling anxiety, as much as I hate labelling myself like that.

Her parents are pretty crazy and they didn't let us go to each others houses for these first few months so we often just met up at the ice rink for a couple hours. We rarely spoke while I was actually working as she understood it was my job and it was important to me, although when I *wasn't* working and was just there as a customer we would sometimes make out at the benches by the rink. It just felt so good to me and she was happy to just keep doing it if we thought nobody was watching... it made me less anxiety and less depressed for those few seconds/minutes. My manager then said parents had apparently complained of us, and after 8 months total of working there he said I failed my probationary period -- a slightly nicer way of saying I was fired. The reasons he gave were mostly rubbish but the making out was also a talking point. He said that he had personally witnessed me ""sucking off her face two feet away from a 4-year-old"". Neither me nor my girlfriend have any recollection of doing things while people were in sight but my memories on it are somewhat distorted now.

I absolutely hate that I did that. Everyone I've spoken to says it's not a big deal but it feels like they're just lying to me. I feel like everyone is always gossiping about it and judging me for it. It's not like me or her to be gross in public but something came over us both. This was at the start of the year and I still think about it. I feel like I need to slide it into conversations with people so I can get their opinion on it, but then I start overthinking what they said about it. I think about how my friend still works there and I don't and how stupid I am in comparison.

My manager told me he would give me a second chance working there ""when a vacancy becomes available"". A new girl was just hired this week, so I think I can throw that last ounce of self-esteem out.

Me and the girl are still happily together but... this haunts me. I don't know what to do. I feel ridiculous just typing this post but I feel like I need to for my sanity. I understand this isn't nearly as bad as some other people's situations here, but in my head this feels like such a huge deal. It's not the money, I'm able to continue making some through app development alone, but my ego is completely destroyed.

130,"Sorry about the long backstory and bad grammar.

So basically as far as I can remember I've always wanted to do things myself as I didn't know if others could do it right or they couldn't do it at all or they would just fuck it up more or whatever. This got worse a few years ago when 99% of my friends started preferring someone they met online over the people like me who they knew in real life and it eventually got so bad they would ignore me, kick me from party's, exclude,block and even talk to them on the phone with headphones in whilst I was standing next to them. I became worried it was me to the point where I sat on my bed writing a suicide note cuz I thaught I wasn't good enough for anyone as people didn't like me in other groups or around school. I decided I would try and corner a few people and ask them why they didn't like me and they all had the same response:
""Idk tbh I've never spoke to you"" and they would just carry on hating me (btw this isnt the online guys fault he just existed and didn't really understand everything going on and we actually we're good friends but that will probs come up as I type)

This went on for a few months until I confronted the main kid I suspected of talking behind my back my back (let's call him Jake incase he sees this) he told me everything he hated about me but they were just petty things like ""you aren't funny"" and ""your just irritating"" and the worse part is this kid was actually my closest friend so it stung just a bit but I did something Ive only done once and regret it. I just grabbed him lightly around the collar bone (I'm not huuge or hugely strong but I'm deffinatley stronger and more experienced in fighting (cuz i do boxing) than him) and told him if he doesn't stop I would hurt him. I also told him that I don't care if he's talking behind my back cuz I'm not that type of person but I do care if he doesn't man the fuck up about it when I ask. So the next day I'm pulled out of lesson by a teacher who I did not trust at all and told him about it cuz Jake had reported me but I gave him a very sugarcoated version of events and he saw no reason to punish me as I had never had any issues and I decided to be the bigger man and apologise to him about threatening him. We moved on but it was never the same 

Back to now and me and the online kid we met (let's call him Sammy) brings a new guy into the ""circle of friends"" and hes alright but he's bumbuddys with Sammy (I don't have s problem with him specifically but he is basically sucking Sammy off at this point) and because of him over a few months Sammy has become a real dick to me for no other reason than ""I'm English and he's Irish"" acting like I was there shooting at him back before our parents were even born. And because of his little bumbuddy he always claims its a 2-1 situation and he's always right but I still try and be nice to him as I don't wanna piss off any neutral friends with petty little arguments over this shit.

So a few months of this go by and it's really bad now. Sam and his bumbuddy insist on hosting every party which made me even more anxious about trying to be nice to them and they always try to get back at me in a petty way like ignoring messages or ""forgetting to invite me""but still I have some degree to trust Sam as we both have had some sort of relatable family issues and we were good friends before his bumbuddy came.

Anyways I start thinking between these issues that the world doesn't want me dead and I'm actually starting to trust more of my closest friends a bit more and even some teachers which may sound petty but for me it was big. 

Because of this issue though I get informed by a mutual friend that he is talking massive amounts of shit behind my back and trying to turn others against me so I decide to take a different approach and just invite him to a private party and talk with him about it calmly. I'm already annoyed and massively betrayed by him but he still Denies it and accuses me of the same bullshit as Jake did with the vague ass responses and says it's my fault which sends me spiraling again 
(I haven't told anyone about this that's why it's a throwaway) 

So Sam blocks me and still continues to talk massive shit behind my back but me and Jake are on good terms til about an hour ago when he kicked me from a party for no reason with no explanation and when I came back 2 minutes later he didn't message back so I assumed he was concentrating on his game or whatever (which is fair enough) so after 20 mins and 2 games later I decide to check back and Sam and his bumbuddys are in the party. He blocks me and it's full so I couldnt get in.

I was done with being nice to him so I started getting annoyed and getting angry but he then gets him and everyone in the party to message me saying they have reported me for everything I said and laughing and making fun at me.

This is at a pretty low point with my family as well so it didn't help. I don't wanna tell my school because I really don't trust them and if I say something to my parents they will give me the entire ""grow up take a break disconnect"" bullshit they do when I tell them about stuff like this and I really don't know who I can trust again incase something like this ever happens.

I know I'm just some fuckwit who's probably in the wrong and it's my fault or whatever but I'm generally stuck and idk what to do. I'm not even 16 so I can't see someone without my parents permission and I feel so shitty not talking to them about it but I don't wanna put pressure on them or the person reading this or anyone but me cuz it's my fault probs

Thanks for sticking with me ik it's very petty and pathetic but this is how I feel and I just want to know if theres anyone in the strange situation who can help. Thanks and sorry for pressuring you to read this or whatever but thanks",22Sep2019,1

135,"Hi, I made an account specifically to post here because I really need some help. 

The past few months were a real freak show, and I don't know what to do anymore.

Before everything I want to clarify that I'm a minor and I really can't go to my parents with this, mainly because they just don't take anything I say seriously. Which is weird, because my mom works in a fucking psychiatric hospital and sees stuff like this, and just doesn't care.

I started having issues roughly 6-7 years ago, mainly with anxiety and depression related symptoms. But the past few months it kinda escalated in feeling spiders crawling on my skin, hearing weird sounds, having some freaky visual hallucinations, blacking out, having memory gaps, disassociating all the time, not being able to concentrate, become very jumpy and paranoid, having trouble maintaining balance and even having speech problems.

Lately most of the time I don't even know if I'm alive or if I exist. I started hurting myself just because I need to feel something, something that would convince me that I exist. I'm starting to think more and more about killing myself just to make sure that I was alive all this time. 

I know that I should go see a doctor, and I tried to tell my parents that many times, but they just dismiss everything I say with the lamest excuses ever(lately, their favorite is the""vegetarian argument""), so that is out of the question. I can't go on my own, as is illegal in my country, so I have to wait until I turn 18.

I searched my symptoms (I know how dangerous self-diagnoses can be, but I had to) and what came up confused and scared me.

So now I'm here, it would really help me if people that experience the same thing as I do would give me advices. Like, what does my symptoms mean, if I have an illness or not, and how I can survive and function temporarily before I can go to a doctor(I will be able to do that after almost a year and a half, which is not a lot, but...). Please, I legitimately don't know what to do, I'm scared and confused and I just don't know how much I can keep it up anymore.",22Sep2019,3

I am ashamed of my words and actions. I feel like a monster. Nothing I can do or say will ever erase the times I was rude. I will never make it up to people, especially my mom. And the worst part is that, even realizing this, there are still many moments when I just lose it. I'm desperate. There's always such a heavy weight on my chest, from the guilt.

143," Hello, I'm sorry if you think this is TMI or too morbid but would my death upset you? am I a good person? I feel so fucking neurotic and miserable. I'm a mess rn. I'm sorry everyone, but I truly believe that it's in my interest to disable my account, for the time being, something's come up and I believe I know a break from the internet rn and from Discord. I'm very sorry and I hope you understand. I realize now that I'm not as good a person as I once believed. I'm a fucking broken and fucked up person. Emotions are fucking awful. I'm not going to bottle up my emotions, no good will come from that.I could genuinely go outside right fucking now, head down to the lake in my neighborhood with a rope and weight and fucking drown myself. I've thought of it many many times before and I've truly never felt this close to doing it. I can't think rationally right now. I want to smash my fucking computer and phone with a goddamn hammer. I'm sorry for getting you so worked up, can you forgive me? This was too deeply personal for me to do that with you, I'm sorry but this is something that I've believed in since Late 2017. They alone have made me want to seriously commit suicide twice now and I can never forgive them, for all of the pain, sadness, anxiety, and grief that they've made me feel for the past year and a half. You cannot fathom how deeply I fucking despise this person, knowing what I know about psychology, I genuinely, truly believe that they have no compassion and have many of the traits found in sociopaths and psychopaths. They use their status as a trans minority in order to get away with some truly heinous shit and it astounds me that I am the only person who feels this way towards them. They are that awful. They only suck up and complement those that could ultimately give them a better status or move them on up and it's fucking disgusting. I have zero willingness to forgive them and truly believe that they have not changed in the goddamn slightest in two years and that they don't care about me seeing as I have nothing to give, they are a lost cause, they are fundamentally a broken fucking person. I can't believe that I have seriously considered suicide knowing that people like this exist in the world. Fuck them. They're the sole reason I hated the entire trans community back then, I truly believed that the majority of them were just as narcissistic, bigoted, insincere and uncaring as she was. If that doesn't tell you how truly awful this person is, nothing else will. Does the fact that I poured my heart out to you, Cate and that you seemed to ignore my feelings like that outright prove that I was ultimately right about you? Real fucking nice of you to shit on me during such a big moment for me you fucking asshole. Does the fact I've proven how deeply regretful I am for my actions mean absolutely fucking nothing to you? Jesus Christ, I was right about how she didn't truly accept my apology. You're a real piece of shit. Go fuck yourself. I truthfully and honestly felt that I was wrong about you this whole time and it pains me to know that you're just as fucking selfish and self-centered as I believed you were when I left back in 2017. You were such a goddamn attention whore in my eyes and a fucking obnoxious egomaniac. There, that's why I fucking hated your guts. It feels great to know that my opinion was right about you, Cate. I may not hate trans anymore but I certainly still fucking despise you. I can't take back what I said and I'm sorry, but at least let me try to atone for my actions. Assuming I don't end my life soon, I truthfully and honestly believe that I could never willingly return to this place. But I truly hope that you can accept me for my flaws and who I am. I would love to continue speaking with you.Do you think that you were truly right and justified into letting the entire fucking server know about a personal problem that only affected the two of us? Fuck off. You always tried your absolute hardest to appeal to everyone and to gain favor, you're so fucking dishonest about who you truly are in my eyes. and how you portray yourself to the people of this server. You are such a fucking awful person and I hope you realize that. Please tell that that ultimately proves what I said about her not accepting my apology. I completely acted on impulse early today and said some things that I truly didn't mean towards Cate and I feel absolutely awful. She apologized, but I still feel as if she wasn't being genuine with me and that I've ruined her view of me and that I've fundamentally ruined the opportunity to have a better relationship/friendship with her in the future. I closed my DM with her because of how bad I felt. I'm sorry but you're going to have to ask her to elaborate on this.No redeeming qualities whatsoever the fact that they're only sixteen is not a goddamn excuse. I never liked this person, she was an Admin, very popular within the friend circle. It's a lot to take in, I have never liked this person and it feels amazing to finally vent and tell someone how I feel about them, Truly, I have felt this way for nearly two years now. If I was as lonely as I was back then, I would have ended my own life last night. Dead serious. I got ganged upon by the people that I trusted, I truly believed that these people in this server cared about me and it pains me to know that that wasn't the case. I left originally largely because I felt my presence made no impact and that I was ultimately expendable. Seriously considering deleting or disabling my account tbh. How could I have possibly been your most missed member, and then you could just come at my throat the second I make a single fuck-up? What the fuck is wrong with you people? Should I tell the rest of the guys about this or not? It pains me that I didn't get to know you sooner. Feel free to block me, ban me, if you truly think less of me now. I can't believe that I just burned so many bridges just now, I feel so relieved honestly. I ultimately don't need people such as that or a server such as that in my life. It was very much a heavily-LGBT centric and Leftist echo-chamber at the end of the day. I truly did love and appreciate many of them but I just can't be there right now.I was trembling and fucking bawling my eyes out last night, praying to God that I was ultimately a good person and that I was so scared to fucking kill myself. I can still feel the pull, just barely. I'm on the Left myself but many of them were extremely radical and genuine Extremist. You truly believe that I am a good person, right? I don't think I'm an extremist. I'm fucking bawling right now thank you so much I'm fucking trembling. As awful for it is for me to say, I genuinely would not feel responsible if she harmed herself or committed suicide, the fact that my words would strike such a chord with her and pierce her like that ultimately tells me that I was right about her and who she is. Fuck you, I genuinely believe the world is a worse place because of people like yourself. It pains me to know someone like you could ever possibly exist. Genuinely the single worst person I have met in my whole life. I would never stoop so low to say that they were not female and that they weren't valid. All that does is weaken my argument. It truly is no better than something like 8chan or Kiwi Farms. People such as them ultimately justify the hatred that those people have towards The Left, your views are what creates these fucking shooters and extremists you fucking Mongoloids.  I'm sure those assholes will comfort her in case she truly feels awful about all this. I'm sure they could spin this shit in a way where I'm in the wrong somehow, fucking assholes. Good god, I can't believe I liked these people as much as I did. I should probably unblock some of them in case they truly feel bad, however, I think they've all drank too much kool-aid at this point to reach out to me. Like, tell me that they aren't a goddamn psychopath or a sociopath? Psychopathy is traditionally a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The twenty traits assessed by the PCL-R score are: glib and superficial charm, grandiose (exaggeratedly high) estimation of self, need for stimulation, pathological lying, cunning and manipulativeness, lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect (superficial emotional responsiveness), callousness and lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, poor behavioral controls, sexual promiscuity, early behavior problems, lack realistic long-term goals, impulsivity, irresponsibility, failure to accept responsibility for own actions, many short-term marital relationships, juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, criminal versatility. They truly had nothing in there life, no goals, no ambitions. Just in it for clout and attention. Should I unblock some of them, in case they truly believe in me and want to make amends? Would it be worth the heartbreak ultimately? I truly believe there were good people there and I liked most of them, I honestly do. Should I tell more people there how I feel?

148,"Hi! i’m a 16 year old female, currently in high school and everything feels dull. For as long as I can remember, I’ve had amazing friend groups, and close relationships, but as of the beginning of this school year, I’ve realized i don’t really have anyone anymore. There’s been multiple situations that explain why I’ve lost all those friends, some being the fact that i stopped talking to majority of them because I always felt out of place when around them, or toxic friendships that needed to end, or even just the whole growing apart thing.. but I’ve tried to make new friends, i’m very sociable, and there are some occasions where i have brief releases from this consistently lonely feeling, but I always end up circling back to feeling like I have nobody. At school, I’m usually spending my free time walking alone aimlessly, when i used to be hanging out in a group of 5-10 people. It feels like I’ve lost everyone close to me, I feel like it’s my fault, and I’m always sad and lonely. Advice ?",22Sep2019,1
149,"Lately I’ve been feeling just weird and empty. I have absolutely zero motivation, and it’s really effecting my life because it’s incredibly difficult to do school work. I just don’t really care about anything, even stuff that I’m usually really excited for is just kinda meh. I don’t know if this is related, but I decided that it might be useful to getting to the bottom of what’s wrong with me; I have dysgraphia, but recently things have been getting much worse and I make quite embarrassing mistakes like using the wrong form of a word, forgetting a letter, not being able to spell sometimes basic things, or forgetting words, it really drives me nuts because I’m a huge stickler for grammar and has only ever effected my spelling — not stuff like word placement. Really the only thing I have a drive to do is to talk to my girlfriend. I do go out to parties and hang out with friends, so it’s not because I’m a recluse. I’m not depressed, or at least I don’t think so — if that makes sense. 


But anyways, my reason for posting this is: I just need help, if I keep on the track that I’m on, I’m going to ruin my life; because, I can’t build up the strength to do what I need to do.",22Sep2019,1
150,"So, I've only seen reddit through youtubers (rSlash) and decided to get it. Now I have come forth with my question. What is wrong with me?
It's blunt, yes, but it's been bugging me. I've had odd moments, where one second I was crying with gratitude from a simple compliment to sobbing over a small inconvenience. Around a month ago, I got 2 pet rats. Dandy, right? Well, I got excited and made a den on my floor to wait until the rats were happy enough to come out. That happened, or so I thought. One of the 2 girls managed to squeeze through the bars, and Me never handling a rat before, went to grab it. Cut to the point, I have a scar on my finger from the bite. That rat got lost in my messy room, and DIED. This led to me constantly being worried about my now 3 rats (they now have a safe cage and are chill with me) a week later, and having frequent breakdowns. I wouldn't sleep for days on end. I can know keep that off of my conscience, but I still get breakdowns. I guess you could call it a panic attack? I don't know, that's why I'm here. I have this weird thing where one day I'm super happy and starting to be proud of myself, and then suddenly the next day up to a week I feel close to suicidal, and locking myself in my room or my office. To top it all off, my mother wouldn't give 2 shits, she'd just be like ""Your a 7th grader, it's just hormones"". Do hormones make people feel like STABBING themselves?! 

Next point, I don't want to sleep anymore. Sure, I want to be online instead, but sleep just makes me feel awful. I don't know why. 

If anyone knows what's going on..... Help me, please.",22Sep2019,1

153,"I do not want to divulge into some of my past experiences that have led to the lifelong torment of anxiety I simply want to say I have it bad. It's been years..many years now were some days it is so bad I feel  a complete panic, I feel like my eyes are overwhelmed during these episodes.. I cannot think clearly, mybhands and feet sweat while my hear races. I sometimes feel dizzy and then somedays I am sorry fine. 
I find at the root that I just do not feel safe. I am scared and I feel alone. 
I feel there is no one to protect me, that if something bad happens no one will save me or be able to help me. 

I have experienced many abuses in my life and I think it is why I am left feeling so uncertain. I do not know what triggers these attacks. It used to get extra bad when I was somewhere far from home or unfamiliar and now it is basically anytime anywhere.

I try to clear my mind and clean to side track my self but then it ends up lasting hours. I went to a counselor was unhelpful.

Does anyone understand this feeling of a lack of safety? Like I just feel frightened and all alone.",22Sep2019,2
154,"I don't wanna be happy. When I have felt happiness, true, innocent happiness years ago, all I remember is confusion and panic. I did not know what to do with myself, it was too much for me since it came out of nowhere. I actually wanted to do things and though I am going to reach for my future. It lasted 3 day's. Maybe if it lasted longer I would get used to it.


All I want, is to be satisfied with life. To be able to handle good and bad it throws my away. Not getting panic attacks, being at the verge of braking down when minnor inconvenience happens, because I kept stacking my brain up with shit from morning. No stressing out about being happy, because the feeling terrefied me and made me feel too secure for my comfort. I just want to live life no matter if I have motivation or don't. 

I keep writting problems I have, and there are so many more that I could write about, there is just not enough time. I keep getting advices I won't follow. I don't have hope, I don't have will to do it. And I don't think I want help. I don't even know why I bother to post thing's, to get some amount of comfort? To know if what am feeling is real and not some romantized shit my brain made up?

155,"Just for some background, I'm 17. I was first admitted to a hospital in 2017. I've had multiple stays at different times. 2017 is when everything started being addressed so I got a couple diagnoses. First, anxiety disorder. Second, major depressive disorder. 

Now that there's background, one thing I've noticed I've been dealing with for a while is that I feel things very intensely. Sometimes even if it didn't happen to me. I'll see things, both real and fictional, and I'll feel very intense emotions (anger, sadness, etc). My dad doesn't seem to understand why I get all worked up over things I see in shows and movies, or read in books. These things just mess me up and I know it's unreasonable but it happens. I know I need to focus on reality more but it's hard. To add on to that, I mimic/mirror other people's personalities at times. I don't do it on purpose but it's really strange. I have a sense of self but not to a great degree. Good thing is that I don't mirror bad personalities but still. I did research and apparently it's connected to BPD (borderline personality disorder). During either my first or second hospitalization, I was given that diagnosis but another doctor didn't believe I fit all the criteria so we kind of brushed it under the rug. I don't know. I'll bring it up in my next therapy session but I just feel really awful at times when I notice these things",22Sep2019,1

158,"Hi there, 

25M here. 

I have social problems since first grade.

When other kids were playing soccer everyone wanted to score, I didnt want to fuck up and always passed the ball.

I remember I always did not want to be center of attention, did not want other people have bad impressions of me.

This got worse with time as you can predict.

My family has lots of mental problems, not going to write them all, because I believe now that everything is up to me.  
Recently, I decided that this will not define my future so at first I quit smoking, started reading selfhelp books, working out. Kinda feel better about myself. 

I have driving license, fear of driving is holding me back.

I had girlfriends, fear of approaching girls is keeping me single. Even when it is clear that a girl is into me and I like her also I cant do shit.

In college everyone was saying that Im smart and can achieve a lot. Fear of speaking in front of people kept me from doing anything. Now im stuck in job I hate, customer service - cant even hold an eye contact for more than 2-3 sec. 

Breaking it down, I think all my problem of starting something, approach people and anything is the fear of what other people will think and that will fail. 

This is my first time talking about it, all my life it is been like this, hope can fight this and achieve confidence.

Can you advice me what to do to improve my social life and overcome this basic fears?",22Sep2019,1
159,If it weren’t for my dog I’d be dead already. Life is not meaningful or enjoyable. I stay up late to avoid the next day and wake up late to pretend the day hasn’t started.

Friends I’ve told about my depression/ptsd are gone and I don’t blame them. I’m selfish. My family is tired of dealing with the tears and talk of suicide. I don’t blame them either.

161,"Too much to deal with from my disabled brother, unhelpful roommates, very unhelpful bitter landlord living with us, constantly diffusing situations, walking on eggshells, feel like I can't do anything at home. Constant state of quietness. 

Could tell I wasn't feeling myself, compulsively took to humming to myself tonight to try and just decompress I guess, landlord complained about that too, didn't even realize I was doing it repetitiously until I was made aware of it.

Waves of anger in my subconscious mind, crashing in my head, I don't feel okay, feeling powerless, also have some PTSD/Anxiety from severe bullying years ago. Pointless to see a therapist, I think I need to improve my situation to calm me down finding a job is impossible.

I have no outlet, I'm screaming on the inside in my cells, but I'm dead...jaded...mentally.

My life feels like a prison, I try to make it better, then people make it worse.",22Sep2019,2
162,"I've had the same best friend for about 10 years now. I love her to death. She has her share of mental health struggles (PTSD, depression, etc) and has been going to therapy and working through her issues for a few years now. I'm incredibly proud of her and how far she's come, and I do my best to support her through everything. She is distant from almost all of her family and has trouble making new friends. I also don't live near her, so all of our interaction is over the phone.

I struggle with major depressive disorder and am going through a very transitional time in life right now. I just started work full-time after 6 years of college. I'm getting married. All of my friends moved away, and I'm working on finding new people to talk to and spend time with. I've been struggling lately, which is expected in a time like this. Since I've been so busy (and she is too), we don't get to talk on the phone too often. When we do, I feel like it's an hour of listening to her talking about her problems/complaints, and then I have to go.

My friend is very regressive when it comes to romantic relationships, and I know me getting married is hard for her, even though I've been with my fiance for over 5 years. When I got engaged, she asked to be hidden from any social media posts about our engagement. I rarely talk to her about wedding planning, and when I do, I typically ask her beforehand to see if she's okay with it. I totally respect this and do my best to take her feelings into consideration, even though it's kind of a bummer that I'm not really sharing this part of my life with my best friend and don't have any other close friends to talk to about this stuff.

Last night, I mentioned a detail about the wedding to her, and she just stopped responding and completely went MIA for almost 24 hours. I texted her today about something totally unrelated, and she responded 5 hours later with ""My inner child is coming out, and she doesn't care about that.""

Honestly, I'm just feeling super invalidated in our friendship right now, while also feeling guilty for upsetting her. I did my best to respond in a loving way but a part of me is so frustrated with having to keep a part of my life from my friend and then feeling guilty that I feel this way. Am I being a dick? Am I a shitty friend for feeling this way? Like, I get it. A wedding is just a wedding- who cares if I talk to her about it. And obviously her issues are way more important.

I don't know. I guess I'm just wanting advice from people in similar situations. How do you take care of your own mental health while also trying to be super considerate of someone else's?",22Sep2019,1
163,"Rn I’m a Senior in high school. I’ve thought about this the whole time I’ve been in high school (mainly because I haven’t had anything else to do...)  I’ve been tested and diagnosed with many different mental disorders, some I’ve gotten really close to getting tested positive with. (Aspergers, ADHD, Bipolar, and many others that I haven’t a clue what they mean...) What I’ve searching for has mostly to do with the career would be best for me to pursue. I’m some what introverted, don’t have a “life”, have high anxiety and depression to the point where sometimes I can’t go to school, bad motor skills aka clumsy, don’t like to sit still for long periods of time, overthinking things that are so simple, easily distracted, etc... You get the idea right? There’s some things I’m good at like computers, figuring how things work inside and out just by fidgeting and running what I call a “simulation” of trial and error in my mind. It doesn’t always work depending on the circumstances. I could try and work with computers BUT I am terrible at typing and writing bc my muscles don’t want to do what I tell them (neurological damage when I was born). That’s also why I get behind in my work in school and have to finish them at home or in a class I have called “study skills”. I could say more but I look forward to your suggestions....thanks",22Sep2019,1

Not panicky, but a great unease.

I understand that if I improve my life situation, these bad feelings will go away, every time a new stressful situation arises the symptoms get worse, I feel like crying, but I can't, it's like my body is confused, and my muscles are tensing up to shit again.",22Sep2019,2

166,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years, but was medicated about a year and a half ago and I felt like I had been doing better. I moved in with my boyfriend of 6 years recently and have felt generally happy for the most part. Last night I got *into it* with my sister while I was at work (this meaning i sat there relatively passive while she berated me for 25+ minutes) and it set off something in my head. I had the thought of ""how many pills would it take for me to actually die"" and it scared the hell out of me. I've had what my therapist calls passive suicidal thoughts on and off since my senior year of high school, but haven't had one since I can remember and it feels like this came out of nowhere. 

I tried to talk to my boyfriend about this when I got home, but he has difficulty understanding where I am coming from on these issues sometimes, as he has never never struggled with depression in the way I have. The conversation lasted a while, and I told him about this active thought my killing myself and how much it scared me but I didn't feel like he took it seriously or maybe he couldn't comprehend the depth of what I was feeling. His response was to tell me he also had been depressed in college but described it as ""hating doing schoolwork"", etc. 

I feel like i'm dragging this out so i'll get to the point. After he fell asleep, feeling desperate I found scissors and cut my wrist repeatedly. None of the cuts are deep, my cat has given me deeper scratches. I was hoping they would be gone by the morning but they are still angry and red and can't be covered up effectively with make up. I have been hiding it from my boyfriend all day and have been a depressed slug, laying around in bed until 5pm when he forced me to get out of the house. I hate hiding something like this from him, but I don't want to worry him or have him tell my family, which would undoubtably make this much worse. I just don't really know what to do at this point, I've never felt so low and isolated as I have in these last 24 hours.",22Sep2019,3

170,So I've recently started on Lexapro for depression and anxiety. The past couple days I have noticed that it seems to be starting to help with my anxiety but it's making my depression much worse. I was having occasional suicidal thoughts before I started the medicine but ones that I felt comfortable I would never act on. Now I am having near constant suicidal thoughts and have basically asked my husband to babysit me because I am afraid of myself.
