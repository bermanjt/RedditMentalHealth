0,"bunch of teachers and some people who I spoke to in school and some friends who I see keep in to contact with (like 4). Never really someone with friends ever and have even less nowadays. 

If you list out what I have done/ see my cv you would think oh that’s pretty impressive. Uni and a masters some internships. But the reality is I barely made it through my undergrad and it probably destroyed my mental heath as I was on my own. It wasn’t for me I hated it and had no friends and friends from school were thousands of miles away on a different continent. which was not where ‘home’ really was as I went to boarding school so It was like I get to see them at Xmas or summer anyways. It was probably too far of a change/ out of my comfort zone and I basically had to struggle with it for 4 years. I finished that and was like I tried to apply for some jobs but didn’t get anywhere and applied to grad school in a field which was related and needed a masters for. And a chance to move back to a place near where I went to school. 

Fast forward to the present I handed in my dissertation a month ago and have been applying unsuccessfully for jobs in my field since last October. My parents have been forcing/ putting pressure on me to get a job especially a part time one. Yes it’s part time like barista jobs but for me that is my worst nightmare and I am stressed out as it is applying for jobs. And getting less and less clear on what I want because I am getting no where, I have had 3 job. Interviews all unsuccessful. 

So this reunion has mostly made me seem like even more of a failure because I have no job. Literally no friends or social skills. Small talk I can’t Handle, it just felt awkward and repeating I was in X for uni then was back here for a masters which I finished last month... then was sat for the meal with a teacher I like never talked to in school it got awkward fast and we are at the end of the table.... my friends on the other side have complicated issues with others there and had some awkward moments. Which resulted in leaving early. 

That school was everything to me I may have not been ‘popular’ or have many friends but I felt like I had a support system there. My parents have never really been the best at that and have made me feel like shit when I fail which is why when I do struggle I never tell them because of their reaction. There was a teacher who When in school I opened up to about like the pressure of my parents in my final two years of school. She was my teacher since I started there and  knew me and that I did struggle with the process of getting to things even though I would get there or knew it already. I saw her when visiting during my first year at uni and I burst into tears and told I was struggling with the adjusting. And when I saw her this weekend I was just brought back to that moment and was in tears again. She reminded me that I had survived and that I had gotten through those tough times. And she had been following an account which I keep for current stuff in my field which is the subject which she teaches. Although I was still kinda in tears just hearing that makes me feel less of a failure. Especially as she knows what I have been through and I guess what I have been capable of in a teacher way which my parents would never get. 

5 years and I feel like I have gotten no where, I just about made it though uni and grad school which still not 100% sure that I passed because stress levels on that dissertation were record high and late and supervisor had only seen about 10% before submission because of the previous reasons. My mental health was alright 5 years ago but now it’s really not. I feel like I have self inflicted anxiety from kinda isolating myself in first year and not really making friends either. Just had people I knew around and talked to in lectures. 

I just hate this unknown and do want a job just not a temporary retail customer direct job serving food or coffee which ‘normal’ people would find easy and ‘people without a degree’ can do. Everyday where I don’t have a job I’m filling out a job application taking way longer than one would think needs to answer a question about what I have done or write a cover letter or my parents asking if I applied to that coffee shop or a part time place the pressure and failure has just been increasing. When I wasn’t even finished with my dissertation and at all time high level of stress. My dad when we walked through the local shops area made me take a photo of every since job advert we walked past that just there was just the tipping point of the increasing pressure and sense of failure from them. They have been not in the same city for this month but yesterday my mum who is joe retired is here for 3 weeks for the sole reason of “helping” but she is 1000% worse of making me feel like a failure and repeating all my failures to me and every chance.",08Oct2019,3
1,"Apologies for bad formatting, on mobile and my brain is running wild

So I’ve been admitted into hospital for breathing issues - my o2 blood percent is low and I have to stay on oxygen. I’ve been moved up into a respiratory unit, and it’s about 1am here. I’m trying to sleep but one of the patients in serious pain and is groaning in such a way I can only describe as Satan but Dog. 

I’m struggling to cope with staying in there. I’m jumping at shadows and scared that someone is going to appear behind my curtain. I’ve escaped to a sort of rec room, which is thankfully at least quiet but I doubt I’ll be allowed to sleep in here. 

I’ve tried explaining to the staff how I feel but they don’t seem to be getting the hints that I’m really struggling mentally here, what with the physical problems impacting my mental health to begin with (the unknown is terrifying)

I don’t quite know what else to put here — I don’t even know if this will help or if anyone will see it? But I need to at least vent /somewhere/ with strangers.

Sorry if this post rambled on or got too long, uh. I don’t know how to end this. Bye?",08Oct2019,1

3,I’m not sure why I feel things so deeply. Something small that shouldn’t even matter can make me cry. I feel so emotional with everything. I’m so sensitive and I really don’t know why. My throat tightens and my eyes water. I grew up in a tough family so I shouldn’t be like this. Anyone else experience this? Or have any tips/thoughts?,08Oct2019,3
4,Basically what the title says. Therapy sessions dont seem to be going any where. my therapist gives me the lead to talk about my issues but i really dont know where to begin. she'll try to prompt me but it seems to going no where. i want these sessions to be useful to me but im having trouble opening up &amp; feeling comfortable. the sessions arent very useful so how could i get more out of the therapy sessions?,08Oct2019,3
5,"We all have life chapters, each are very unique. Some are filled with laughter, others with sorrow. Some are filled with great memories from vacations to outings, while others present struggles such as finding a job to paying the bills.To me, I've been so focused on my education and professional growth throughout my life chapters that it was brought to my attention that my support system wasn't that strong. 

It wasn't until I started having thoughts of suicide a year and a half ago that I realized I needed help so I started seeing a therapist. My therapist was the one who pointed out the lack of people I have that I could reach out to when I'm down and lack of close by friends to go out and have fun with after work or on the weekends . 

Today I wish I would have met the therapist I have now years ago to help me develop social and problem solving skills. Because I missed years of these important skills, it was not only hard for me to develop new friendships after moving to a new town 2 years ago but I also lacked having the skills necessary to succeed at interviews, working with coworkers, and having courage to speak with my boss about my performance. 

Today I've truly seen myself grow and develop social and problem solving skills. I used to take alot of things as a personal attack but with the help of my therapist, I've been able to focus on looking at the critical and not emotional piece of what is being said to me. Additionally today, I'm not as lonely after work or on the weekends, I've learned how to take feedback from my boss,and I've learned how to look at the upside or silver lining of most situations. However, today I wasn't ready to face the reality that my schedule and my therapists schedule no longer synch with one another. I'm not ready for my therapist to depart from my current life chapter. 

 My therapist in my eyes is a mentor and a role model. I admire how confident and knowledgeable my therapist is. I'm also in awe of the adventures my therapist has had as well as the great amount of friendships and support that  my therapist has. 

I'm very sad that very soon my therapist will not be a part of my current chapter or future life chapters. My therapist has been a part of my support system and in the development of my social and problem solving skills. I really hoped that my therapist and I could have worked together for a bit longer but I'm thankful for both the great and hard sessions we've had together. 

If you're a mental health professional, could you provide some guidance and knowledge around the following:
   * What is the average amount of sessions that should occur in order to end the relationship smoothly ? 
   *What should be the topics of conversation in the coming sessions ? I had so much today to talk about and I even had a list of topics I was hoping we would cover in the next two months. 
   * What can I do to self sooth? I'm so sad. The only relationships I've had where I was sad it ended and could no longer have a conversation with the person was when that person passed away. I don't want to think about my therapist as someone who passed away.",08Oct2019,1
6,"Over the past few years my parents have degraded my mental health to the point where two years ago I had hope and had a future, and bow I break down at the mention of my parents being called from school. I hear screeching and yelling and doors slamming whenever I'm alone, and I'm always paranoid about going home after school. I jump and shake in fear at any sudden sound, bracing for screaming that isn't coming. I don't want to leave. I like living. I hate the misery I've gone through and I hate the hell and torture that awaits me in the next four years. They are the issue, and they play every ""counselor"" like a damn fiddle and make it seem like I'm the bad guy. I don't know. I just want to go, leave amd be free from the nightmare I live in. complete control of a child's thoughts and feelings is never okay. I can't find the courage to stand my ground and fight back... I want to get through college at least. even if my story ends shortly after.",08Oct2019,1
7,"I feel like there's nothing i can do any more because currently i'm being fought over by both my parents, however apparent that is. I feel like no matter what i do i cannot avoid the possibility of growing up alone, fat, and poor. Friends come and go because i lack the capability of actually interesting them enough to stay. I feel as if im to stupid to do the simplest of things. As of writing this i'm about 6 incorrect words in (now fixed).
 I thought that i meet someone. She was nice, warm, generally a nice person all-round. We stopped siting with each other when i had to swap busses for the other parents home (temporally). She was younger than me, but still a grade higher, hench why i believe i retarded. My father im sure even to this day still thinks im ""special""(we were told via my grandmother). 
 Constantly i feel as if people would have a better time on this hellhole if i weren't on it. I'm constantly debating whether I should run away, or maybe just end everyone's woe's and end my life with a nice toaster bath.
 Im considered short in my grade despite being older than the majority of them. 


I've already tell myself i need to detach myself form people, work harder, think brighter, but i just can't. Its gotten to the point i almost cry every day in and out of school, and i can barely sleep through the nights... What do i do",08Oct2019,1
8,"So I’ve stayed the same weight for years now (which is a healthy weight for my height) and my BMI is 21, but for some reason I keep looking fatter and fatter. I think that it is very possible that due to my inactivity for the past year or so, I managed to lose muscle and gain fat so I ended up looking fatter and remaining the same weight. However, it seems more than that now. I am starting to look and feel obese even though my weight has stayed the exact same which is a healthy weight according to my doctor. But I’m starting not to become more sensitive to tight clothes and my limbs and everything seem to be so enlarged. I’ve been told I have body dysmorphia but why does it affect me like this if this is really dysmorphia? It seems to be actually changing my vision in a way like an enlargement hallucination.

9,my mental health is in really bad shape and i was almost hospitalized by my parents because they found out that i had been using drugs and alcohol to cope with my depression (among other things) and i didn’t see a point in life anymore. the only reason they didn’t send me is because there was an opening for an appointment with my psychiatrist but all he told me was that i have an alcohol problem and i need therapy which we already knew. we’ve already been trying to look for a therapist for me but none of them have been answering calls or arent covered by insurance. why does it have to be so damn hard to get help :( i just want to be better already,08Oct2019,2
10,"So I bet some of you have gone through this situation before when you feel sad, you stop going on social media a lot and u stop faking a smile when u greet people. I’d like to think of that as the real you, however everyone sees you as THE HAPPY ONE and when u don’t come off as that person people get confused. It’s almost as if you’re not allowed to be sad or feel pain or anger or just want to avoid people because everyone sees u as the free spirited funny and goofy individual. It sucks and I’m tired of constantly having to wear a mask that quiet frankly can’t fit my fucking face anymore. Truth is I’m not okay and I’m not happy and that’s what I’m giving u.

11,"Just a quick preface, my Mum has struggled with anxiety and depression for most of her life, my Dad has ADD, is depressed, unemployed and homeless, and my brother also struggles with depression, anxiety and ADD. Then there is me. Everyone assumes I have everything under control when in reality it is all over the place. I hate being seen as the sane one when I know that biologically I share many of these traits.

Im a psychology student and I struggle immensely with keeping up with my work load. On top of living out of home and everything that comes with being completely independent at 19, I find myself constantly exhausted and unmotivated. I can't sit down and study for more than 10 minutes without getting frustrated and giving up or losing concentration. I can't identify with any labels, I don't know if I have any underlying illnesses and I cannot bring myself to go see someone  about it. Because of this I can't justify how I feel -- ""I can't study because I'm coping with x"". I feel weak for needing an excuse, but I feel abhorrent all the time. I struggle with many things in my life (university being the biggest) and I cannot source where my pain and anguish is coming from.

I need some advice. I know I need to go see someone, and I will. I just want to hear how you get/got through university when dealing with mental health problems. How do you become more motivated? Whats the best way to tackle hard and lengthy assessments? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",08Oct2019,1
12,"This  started after a crossing gate fell on my head, i most likely had a concussion, I didn’t lose consciousness but went to the ER and they did a ct. the ct scan showed  “prominence of the sulcus spaces” in other words, brain atrophy, not relayed to the injury. Keep in mind I’m only 19.  They said it was most likely an insignificant finding but still encouraged  me to go to a neurologist in case. I’ve been a heavy marijuana user and drinker so I attributed the atrophy to this, I was convinced they’d find something wrong with my brain related to the drug use anyways. 

However I brushed it all off, brain had no bleeding which was the biggest worry at the time so I proceeded my life normally. However about a couple weeks later I had a severe personality change. I became a hypochondriac, I developed ridiculous delusions about my health. In addition I began to have certain “compulsions” , like coughing for no reason, touching/ moving my neck in certain directions, and a lot of other absurd obsessions.  I have a lot of intrusive thoughts, mostly violent, also feel a lot of derealization; like I can just do something bizarre. It’s hard to describe. 

I then scheduled an appointment with a neurologist; before I told him about any of my symptoms,  he ordered a MRI of my brain, which is a far more superior scan compared to the CT.

When I came into discuss my MRI results he told me my brain looks healthy. He did say though my frontal lobe is a little smaller than the rest of my brain but said this might be a normal finding. I also told him about my symptoms in detail, he insisted it was not Dementia but a psychiatric issue.

Anyways, to sum it up I stopped smoking weed completely about 3 months ago. My personality remains unchanged. I’ve been drinking way less than I used too as well.  I’m really wondering of what is going on, I am not myself and haven’t been for the past 10 months.",08Oct2019,1
13,"It is a very rare mental disease and I just happened to get it somehow.  I never knew that I had schizophrenia until now.  I realized I had it for years now.  Back then, I always saw myself as a baby and I hated myself (I don't completely hate myself, it was just a trait that I didn't like).  One sad thing about schizophrenia (like I said before) is that it is rare, so I don't have anyone to relate to.  Every passing day I feel like it is just getting worse and worse.  I'm afraid to even go into the shower, because I feel like, when I look out of the curtains, I'm going to see something I don't want to.  I can't even go to bed without the lights on, and checking every corner of my room.  I have conversations with myself in my head that just feel so real.  Like I'm talking to a person.  He always sort of checks up on me and judges my thoughts.  I also feel like people are just reading my mind,  I try to think of something normal (which is hard, because your brain kind of just does what it wants).  I still remember the first hallucination I had.  I saw a pure dark man just crawling across my yard and just hiding in my tree.  But the scariest one was when I just woke up, ju ped out of bed, and just for a split second I saw a demon like beast on my floor with a huge smile.  Sometimes, when I'm watching tv, or listening to the radio, they might say something, and I feel like they are just talking to me, warning me about something.

14,"I don’t even know what to say. I’ve never really talked about this before, only joined this sub like right now. But I feel like I’m at my rope’s end honestly. All my life most of what I’ve ever known is loneliness. I’ve been alone for most of my life. I was bullied relentlessly because I was “different”. Because I never fit in. I always tried but eventually I gave up. And at that point I just wanted to be left alone. I didn’t care what they he’ll they said anymore. I fought back with everything I had screaming to be left alone. 

Fast forward to today and I think I got exactly what I wanted. Now I’m all alone. I have no friends and no hope for what’s in store for me in the future. I thought since I figured out why (mis-diagnosed as ADHD in 2nd grade . Later to be Autism in 11th grade) I could make a change for the better. But I never could. And now I feel like a complete failure. I’m 19 now, jobless, dropped out of College, and don’t have friends to talk to about it. I failed at chasing the dream I so desperately worked for only to come up short. And I feel the reason is because I’m to stupid. Am I just doomed to fail a everything I do?

15,"I recently was looking through the yearbook for last year and I looked at all these people that are gone from my highschool and think to myself, ""I will most likely never see these people again, they have lives, and part of that was here at this highschool."" I also look at these people that are seniors this year and think about how I won't see them again. Weirdly it makes me sad, I was kind of bummed out whenever it (frequently btw) popped into my mind what I just said.

I feel like I'm supposed to know these people maybe, even though I won't and most people in my grade won't either. I feel like it could possibly be because im not the most popular either. I have good friends, but I'm not in with any ""popular"" kids. The best way to describe is that besides my friends no one would really invite want to talk to me if they have other options available. Even though I should be pretty contempt with the situation I'm in besides that, I think I overlook the fact that they don't have perfect lives like I just assume they do and I overthink the fact that I should be with them and be popular. That's the overthinking part and then I feel like I'm too sensitive because things like these get and stay in my head and make me kind of depressed (not like depression but just in a gloomy mood) for a while while the thought is just circling through my head, like this one above has been for a few weeks. 

I've looked into obsessive thinking and intrusive thoughts a little bit but could definitely read into them more as I barely have. I watch some videos on it and then for the next few days it seems like I'm fine and can control it but then it starts again.

If you read this far thank you so much and if you have or have had similar experiences (the one I gave was just one example specifically) please let me know how you've dealt with this. I'm also hoping hat just getting this off my chest will help a little bit, but again thanks in advance.",08Oct2019,1

I know what I want to do. I want become a counsellor, but being an undergrad Psychology student is just draining. Countless hours of nonsense and analysis ends up making me rush all my assignments which come out so shitty. I know I can do better but I struggle to apply myself and find interest in the boring trivialities of the course. I waste so much time, basically anything to avoid working on assessments and studying. I do this day in, day out and get so disappointed in myself to the point where I struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel, or even question if there is any light at all.

So I guess I'm just asking for advice, how do you get through it all? I struggle with a lot of mental health issues and I just want to know how to deal with it all and continue to do well in university. How to find inspiration.

19,"Last Tuesday (Oct 01) I had a psychological evaluation done for ADHD as my primary wanted it done. I initially did the intake appointment at the end of August. At that appointment the PsyD made a couple comments about if it was a good use of plan resources, and something along the lines of 'may find malingering'. Ever since then I have it stuck in my mind that he has already decided that I'm faking. Anyway I did the testing last Tuesday. Today they called to schedule results/recommendation session. With less than a week for turnaround time I am even more convinced that is what he is going to say he found. The appt for that isn't until October 24.

20,"When I was little I was physically abused by my dad and I've for the most part always been subservient to others. I guess this started an idea in my head that I'm always meant to be beneath everyone else. And I have to put everyone else's happiness before my own well being. 

Growing up I hardly ever asked for anything. I never asked for help or favors from friends and family. Sometimes it got to the point where my mom would yell at me when she asked if I wanted anything from the store and I said ""nothing"".

Nowadays, somehow, I have a fiancee. And I love her very much. Although her short temper triggers my ptsd, she is very supportive and encouraging. I am grateful to be with her. She has told me to speak up about things and I have.. Followed by me falling apart and crying. 

Some days a bad thought or memory invades my head then a snowball effect happens where my silent self loathing gets worse and worse until I get suicidal. My fiancee goes through the same thing so I know she'd understand, and she has helped me with it before, yet I still struggle to speak to her. It's hard to speak in general when I get this way. 

I'm calm enough to type this out. But I'll eventually feel bad about reaching out and bothering or bumming someone out. There's like a voice in my head that keeps judging every move I make and that I'm not worth the effort anyway.

We had a break period where tantrums had calmed between 5 and 6 but hadn’t totally disappeared. Her biological father is bipolar at the least. My wife and I just had our son and noticed during her pregnancy that our daughter had started to get more disconnected with empathy. As of late we have seen her become physical, when we ask her to stop she says we are making her do this. She has taken a bat to our door, she has thrown rocks at our car and at my wife while breastfeeding. She kicks the seat in the car non stop at times, refuses to do things we ask her because we are not the boss of her. She disconnects herself from doing wrong and though at the beginning she would apologize after she is no longer doing so and asking us too. We have tried to ignore her, we have tried to spank(worse idea), we have tried to talk to her and we have taken her in for mental help. They diagnosed her DMDD but she wouldn’t show her colors to them. She hides it from most unless it’s to us in public. We are at wits end, my wife never gets a break since I got to work and she’s our homemaker, and her outbursts with her when I’m working are some of the most terrible to see.

I've tried just about every medication they feel safe prescribing me over the past years, and I don't feel or see any positive results, more often than not the anxiety medication worsens my depression and then the depression medication makes me feel hollow.

I'm to a point in my life where I constantly have thoughts of self harm, though I never act on them. I've tried mental institutions, I've actually been to the local one twice, in a span of three to four years and both times I had been discharged for being deemed ""safe."" I speak with a therapist occasionally, as my financial situation makes it a bit difficult to consistently see one.

I don't feel like I want to die, but too often I feel completely and helplessly overwhelmed with the world around me, and I've sunken to a point of being a near hermit.

27,"Hi, lately I've often been feeling like I don't know anything about myself. I don't know if I'm happy or sad or lonely. I feel like I know what I want to do in life, but it's like I have no emotion and every emotion at the same time. I can't get a job because my anxiety makes interviews feel so stressful. I have no idea what's wrong except my obvious anxiety issues. I have no idea where to go or what to do. Almost any important issue I couldn't give concrete answer on how I feel about it.",08Oct2019,1
28,"I'm writing this in the midst of the biggest panic attack I've had in years, so apologies if some of it doesnt make sense...

I'm a full time (16 credit hours) student and I work a 30 hour a week job on top of that. I was on top of everything from the beginning of the semester, but last week I caught pneumonia and was confined to my bed for several days. This set me back immensely. I'm on my last year of my undergrad degree, and now, because of a documented illness, I am very far behind. I have an essay due tonight, and my professor must have given the assignment guidelines out on the days I was absent - they are nowhere to be found online, and nobody (including the professor) will message me back. Even if I got them at this point, I have 1:45 until midnight when the essay is due, and there is absolutely no way that I will be able to finish it in time. The professor has a zero-tolerance policy for late assignments, and I'm worried that even with a physician's excuse, she won't accept it.

Thats just the tip of the iceberg - I've been battling depression for years now, with no success. Lately, I feel so depressed that I constantly think about suicide, as I don't think I can take this anymore. Very few people understand what I'm going through in my personal life. I'm so anxious about my future and my career that I wake up from night terrors and can't fall back asleep. 

I just don't know where else to turn. I've been frantically trying to find an answer to my problems but I feel like nobody can help me.",08Oct2019,1

For some reason my chest would jump like you would see someone you like, but this was a combination of that and anxiety and frustration.

32,"So I've worked for the same small start up company or over 3 years since it began when it was just me, ""Jake"" the guy who started it, and two other employees. Now the company is run by both Jake and his sister ""Janet"" and the business has grown a lot. I have always had a great relationship with Jake as well as Janet; they often treat me like a third sibling and even call me family. However over the years I have struggled with them a lot due to the fact I have struggled with severe suicidal depression and anxiety for a number of years now due to concurrent traumatic losses in my life. Both are kind but Jake and Janet had very happy lives, and Jake especially just can't understand how I feel. He seems to think that if he sends me an ""inspirational"" instagram post and just ""be positive"" I won't be depressed and anxious. 

When I joined this company I was mentally considering it ""my last chance"" and if it didn't work out. Much to my surprise I really loved it, and of course, Janet and Jake. A few times over the years though, they've sat me down and told me that certain things are causing problems due to my behavior. I do have a tendency to be pushy without realizing it, either out of eagerness/excitement or I can just ""take over"" a situation and make sure it's done right. (Previously, the latter has actually been why the business flourished). In act they even sort of demoted me over a year ago and hired someone else to take over my managerial role (I was devastated) only to realize 6 months later that the dude was terrible and they apologized and essentially gave me my job back. 

Basically the manifestations of my depression and anxiety--speaking in a panicked voice, anger, overreacting, generally looking or sounding miserable, being annoyed if they ask for extra work, etc. is causing an issue and they literally called me a ""toxic"" presence. It really hurt me to hear that, and it's extra confusing too because at the same time they tell me this (and say if it weren't me I'd have been fired...) they also say that I'm awesome and the company wouldn't have flourished or even still exist without me. Now it seems like they're looking to ""reassign"" me to do other things, and almost hinting my future in the company is in jeopardy if I can't improve. But...I give them and the company all my energy. Like, all of it. All I do on the weekends is sleep, smoke pot and watch Netflix because I have no energy for anything else. Most days I don't even know how I get through work at all. But it just feels like I've been running marathons with two broken legs and they're saying that my crying and wincing in pain is upsetting everyone and making a difficult work environment. 

I'm making a conscious effort to try and be better and help myself but what if I can't? What if I lose the only thing I've been able to do successfully? What if I lose this? I don't know, I'm just really hurt and almost wish they could look past all this because they even admit I bring so much to the company. It doesn't seem fair...",08Oct2019,1

Best way to explain me is imagine a cat when it's hunched over and now imagine thats how it is all day no matter what. I've tried meditation which works for a little but then fades away really quick, exercise but that just makes tension even worse and therefore makes me more unstable, just sitting and watching the wall which works to for a little and then fades quickly, hot baths/showers which relieve tension for a little, sleep but I cant sleep that well, etc. I can't calm my mind no matter what :(",08Oct2019,1
34,"Today I read some feelings I had from 4 years ago when I wanted to die and I felt hopeless. I hated myself and picked apart every aspect of the worst part of me. I thought I'd never be happy. I didn't even know what happiness was other than some LSD induced manic episode that morphed into psychosis and suicidal thoughts that would've turned me into ocean decay if I hadn't decided to say goodbye to a family that wasn't even mine.

   Today is just like any other day, a good day. My uniform is soaking in the sink ready to be air dried so I can wear it to my job that doesn't pay much, but I get to enjoy it with people that I actually want to work with. I'm in my apartment that I share with my best friend and partner, it's a little messy right now with the life we get to share. I have friends who are better artists than me who keep me inspired and encouraged. My friends who aren't artists inspire me to be honest. I have a family that I love. My regrets have turned into lessons, humiliations have become funny stories, days when my body felt too heavy to live are now days filled with music that makes it impossible for that same body to sit still, and the resentment I once used to feed my loneliness has become learned skills I use to feed my passions. I don't know how I got to this point that feels ""normal"" and I don't know how my ""normal"" became happiness. I hope anyone who feels the way I did can have their own day like my today.

  I don't know where to share this, I don't want sympathy from friends or family for where I was, I don't want to brag about how happy I am or preach about how you have to do whateverthefuck to be where I am, I'm just recognising for the first time that the good things that I'm lucky to have are good things, and I haven't had the energy to dwell on the bad anymore. There's been a lot of introspection and stepping outside of my comfort zone leading up to this point (maintenance never ends) and I'm proud to say that it's working.

While I now keep to a smaller group of friends then before, I've started to value my friends over own wellbeing. Of course this became much more prevalent once I separated myself from the people I considered family with a decision that I will forever regret. While we are still close friends, I haven't seen them in months and it's taking its toll on me. I've started to eat less and less and sleeping is rare at this point. Even when I was with them physically I'd put their needs miles above my own often giving my own food just to see them happy. I'd sooner lose limbs than hurt them unnecessarily, which is why I'm starting to hate myself. They have started to notice that I haven't been taking care of myself and its starting to worry them. I absolutely hate the fact that they have to worry about me and I've started to hate myself for worrying them. I want to get help but I don't want to get in the way of someone who could need it more than me.

41,"Hi my name is Vendel and I am an 18 year old from Sweden so my English isn't the best, I am diagnosed with ADHD, DSPD(Delayed sleep phase disorder), Dyslexia and Depression and i take Ritalin, Sertraline and Mirtazapine to combat them. I have been aware of these for over a year now and have been getting treatment for 2 years. Recently i have started to realize that some of my behavior is unusual compared to other people and that some of my symptoms have gotten worse recently and my psychiatrist just told me 2 days ago that he thinks I am normal and that I have been misdiagnosed because of me over reacting, that's why i asking Reddit for help.

Symptoms:

\- I always feel like someone is either watching or listening to me constantly, even when i know I am alone, for this reason i tend to look behind me a lot and I never cover both ears when I use headphones. When i talk to people I always feel like they are judging me for what I am thinking about.

\- Dependency on being social. whenever I am alone it feels like torture, i always need to listen to music or watch something whenever I am alone to not have intrusive thoughts about killing myself, killing others, raping people and other horrible acts despite me never ever wanting to do any of those things and will never do.

\- I always feel like I am inferior to everyone else around me.

\- Whenever something touches my body i can feel it for a long time after, like that part of the body got disturbed by it, this makes being outside in rain and snow horrible since i hyper feel every single drop on my skin for  a few seconds before the feeling disappears.

\- Whenever i feel a something on one side of the body i have to make myself feel the same thing on the other side of my body or i cant stop concentrating on it for a few minutes and sometimes hours. a month ago i someone riding a bikes coat lightly touched my hand when they cycled passed me, i tried to replicate that feeling on the other side of my body for 3 hours going through a bunch of stuff but nothing felt the same.

\- Doing stuff that inconvenience me in the future only to make myself suffer like not brushing my teeth every day or spend money on things i don't need/want even though i want to save up for something.

\- When i think of something to say I always have to say it even if its not appropriate or if the subject had change, once i decide what to say i have to say it. Because of this i sometimes say it when I am alone after the conversation or whisper it to myself.

\- minor auditory hallucinations.

Please help me, days for me have become an endless cycle of the same day repeated over and over again and i don't feel the passage of time until i realize its been a months since an assignment deadline.

43,"So I saw my therapist recently and told her about my long-standing issues with wanting to stand out, get attention, be unique in some of the most unhealthy ways. The most horrible way was me seeking out mental illness diagnosis and crumbling if I couldn’t get it. I also told her I noticed one of those ways was drinking. I’m no Alcoholic (I’m not in denial, my mother and friend confirmed this) but I do feel like I bask in it a bit too much.... it’s weird because I’ve thought about if I’m drinking away pain and if I’m depressed but I don’t think I do it for that! I’ll drink like 2-3 times a week, very rarely right after each other. Despite my mom and friend confirming its not an addiction, they do seem a bit put off by it at times... 

I told her (my therapist) that..... well here’s two answers. The short answer: I wanna feel like an adult. Long answer: I was always the super quiet, reserved and sheltered kid who only stood out from their body weight (and not in a good way) while everyone around me from then till now was able to do rebellious things and it showed through their assertiveness, I couldn’t or didn’t desire it. I associated their assertiveness with them bullying me. Now I feel the need to constantly depart from my childhood image in new and unhealthy ways (which btw my therapist called this unhealthy, I didn’t notice) and this is one of them. It seems I associated such things with being a stronger person which I believe I wasn’t back then. And I guess to fit in. Now I’m older, (20) and drinking at my age isn’t something unique or shocking. It is under legal age but it’s still not the uniqueness I seek deep down... I spoke with her about this nearly a week ago but this one detail still strikes me randomly and makes me sad to realize... it’s just one of many ways I still try to escape my childhood..",08Oct2019,3

I’ve had anxiety for a long, long time. I know what it

 currently in CBT therapy and it helps quite a bit!

Yesterday I was doing homework and got 
overwhelmed and had this very rare anxiety symptom 
occur. This shortness of breath/pressure in my chest. 
It’s hard to explain, but it’s extremely uncomfortable 
and it feels like you can’t breathe. The only way to 
make it feel better is to take a SUPER deep breath. 
But the relief is very temporary, and the pressure 
soon comes back. I thought this was because I was 
anxiously writing this paper, but once I finished it 
lingered. All night it lingered. I thought once I finished 
all my work it would stop, but no. It’s stayed. All night I 
felt it. And now all day today, it keeps randomly 
occurring. Most of the day I’ve felt this symptom, 
mostly when writing or reading.

55,"I cut myself and didn’t socialize all winter while I was studying. I spent my summer hopping between panic attacks and major freak outs while working a really stressful job. All year I’ve been alienating and hurting others and sinking deeper into self loathing. I now have a lot of free time, and should probably start dealing with this shit before it ruins my life.

I want to call myself mentally ill because a lot of my behavior appears to be a product of mental illness, but calling myself ill just seems like a way of displacing guilt. I often feel suicidal, but I don’t know if that’s because I’m sick, or if it’s just because I feel guilty for my behavior. And then it seems impossible to tell if my shitty behavior is caused by mental illness or by ethical and personal failings.

I saw someone this winter, and they basically told me to eat, sleep, and find some friends, which felt pretty unhelpful in the moment, but maybe they were right. I don’t know if I need medical help for problems that could be limited to my environment or to personality flaws, but I don’t know where else to get help. 

I just can’t break through the ambiguity in my situation. Once I’ve convinced myself that I am somebody, and that my shit is something else, everything falls apart, and I have no idea who to blame or where to turn. 

I can’t get help because any sort of progressive action makes me feel like a fraud. If I’m not sick, and I get help, It’s like I’m taking advantage of actual sick people in order to deal with my guilt.

I’m trying to keep this as short as possible but I’ll give as much info as I feel is relevant.
My mother has been suicidal for years. She married my dad thirty years ago and moved to another state for him, gave up her career for the family when she had my brother a year later. All she had ever wanted was a happy family and she sacrificed everything. My dad and mom are the most wonderful people, hard working and doing everything for the family (kids). They would’ve deserved the happy gamily but it was doomed with my brother. He is a psychopathic manipulative asshole who twists everything any of us say, has been giving us whiplash for over fifteen years now (also sexually abused me for years when I was little but that’s not concerning my mom, she doesn’t know it bc I know she wouldn’t survive that). I have always been their lively, sweet kid always laughing and being the sunshine in their lives, their words. The more I grew up though, the more differences we had which I know is normal and shouldn’t be that big a deal but my mom is a) overly paranoid and protective (also somewhat understandable), b) loads all her worries and fears on me which is totally okay, on one hand, but by doing so my entire life, it’s affected me as well, being fearful and anxious of so many things, never wanting to make mistakes. I know she means well, she is the sweetest. But it’s so hard. I feel like I’m suffocating. So the thing is I have been pulling back, being annoyed by her always judging and disapproving (at least it feels like that, I know it comes from a good place but she has issues). 


Now last night we had another big fight and my dad told me that she’s seriously contemplating suicide bc she has lost purpose in life (her purpose being her family) and not even my dad can reach her. And that is worrying. She is in denial about her lack of mental health as well. I have tried talking to her, very cautiously and nicely bc I’ve been to therapy to, but she won’t even think about it bc she feels like she is healthy.

Whenever I go up stairs or walk to the kitchen I have to lean against the wall it feels genuinely like I have no energy and it hurts to stand it feels like a work out to just move sometimes. Suddenly started overeating yesterday and its continued into today. I’ve also become super unmotivated and very irritated which I’m sure is because of the depression..? I keep having spouts of encouragement like “oh I wanna try hard in school when I go today!” Or “I wanna be a fighter! I wanna work hard!” But for some reason I just become so unmotivated even after a couple days of trying.

69,"I wish I didn't let it get this bad. I wished I didn't think it wasn't possible for me to get worse. I had a chance to go therapy when I was 14 when a doctor told me and mom that they believed that symptoms stemmed from something psychological(aniexty) instead of psychical. 

They said they could redirect me to a psychologist better and I could get therapy. Even though I seemed to have doing better comparing my pervious history, therapy wouldn't hurt and it would keep me on the right track and I could learn skills I could take for life.(don't ask how I ended up going to the doctor even though I was doing better it was kinda stupid)  

They said that my dad insurance could cover cover it and it actually wouldn't be costly. We left and we never went back seeing that there wasn't anything physically wrong with me. Even when I said I'll like to go, they weren't really to thrilled about it.

I didn't push about it because I was in a really good spoot and at that point and the pervious years before that were good too in comparison to when i was 8-10 years old and I didn't really think I would continously go downhill over the next 6 years.

 Now that 20 and I'm in community college, I do wish I could have pushed my parents to let me go, because I know now that they would have let me go if I pushed enough cause I'm really starting to struggle now.

72,"I've always from my depression comes in waves. It never lasts more than a couple of months! And then I'm clear for a bit. For me, three things are inevitable. Death, taxes and another wave.

My most recent occurrence I'm currently floating on the surface of, just about to climb out of the water. What was different about this wave, was that I didn't see it coming and almost drowned.

I started working from home mid-march to save myself from the exorbitant cost of commuting to London (£5800 for an annual train ticket!). It started out well; I was seeing more of my wife and daughter, I was picking and choosing my hours around other things and was finding periods of the day, sat at home, incredibly productive. if I'd had a really good day or two, I'd reward myself with a morning or afternoon off. My boss didn't care what hours I did, as long as I was meeting my targets. Heaven right?

No. The isolation from the team, the lonely hours rattling around the house alone, being stuck in that small makeshift office in the spare bedroom. It was filling up quickly, and I was sinking.

On 7th August, my best friends dad died in a freak cycling accident. As families, we were very close. He wasn't just my friends dad. He was my friend. I completely shut off. Closed the world out. Stopped logging in to work, and logged out of my life.

I was eating my feelings away and put on a stone in 3 weeks. I wasn't engaging with my work. I wasn't engaging with my colleagues or boss. I was logged out, not just from work, from everything.

I kept up the pretence to my wife (who has her own battle with anxiety, depression and ADHD to deal with) and my daughter who deserves the absolute best of me, of us. O couldn't let my suffering hurt them.

My boss, who by this point had noticed my lack of productivity, called me in for a meeting do discuss my progress. Amazingly, there was no anger, there was none of the ass kicking I deserved. He asked me one question.

""Are you okay?""

Then the dam broke. I completely broke down. He was the first person who'd asked me how I was in months. He sat and listened to me as I told him how I'd been struggling. How my friends death had capsized my world. How my own Dad had told me, on my birthday, that he's got kidney failure and they're looking into a problem with his heart. I apologised for my performance and then sat silently as I fought back the tears.

He told me to come back to the office. To integrate myself back in with the team. The isolation wasn't helping, and I needed to be around people again. He said no pressure, no deadlines (yet). Get back into the swing of things and the rest will follow.

Here I am, just over 7 weeks later, on the train to work. I'm back going to the gym and swimming. I'm reading on my commute. I'm coaching an U7s football team (and we're winning). I'm logged in to life and I'm engaging with everything I was losing.

But most of all, I've not felt down or negative for a week now. I'm not clear of anything yet, I likely never will be. But I'm looking up and can see the sun.

TL;DR: Isolation due to working from home, a friends death and my father's health issues sent me into a pretty bad nose dive. My boss' kindness and understanding has helped me get back on my feet.

82,"Hi r/mentalhealth!

TL;DR: Need to find concrete ways to help my partner struggling with PTSD and self harm. 

I am in a situation where I'm romantically involved with someone who suffers from PTSD  from of being emotionally abused in previous relationships. This person is my best friend in the whole world and I love them more than anything. 

Their symptoms are among others:

\- Flashbacks from triggers, big or small, real or imaginative that are causing them to have panic attacks 

\- Commitment issues

\- Self harm as an coping mechanism

For the past 1,5 year I've gotten to know all of this over time, I've always tried my best and give 100% to show my love and support, be there for them, help them get help multiple times. She is currently seeing a licensed therapist which is showing progress, but it is slow and takes time. Last night while in a voice call, playing games together, a minor inconvenience broke her mood, as she was already struggling to keep her mood up and have a good time. We living an hour apart, I tried my whole arsenal of methods of helping her through this while being apart. It usually goes something like this: 

Trying to ""save the situation"" by doing my best to cheer her up, and when that fails, trying to get her to talk about her feelings while giving her reassurance that I love her, and it is okay that she is feeling sad and down. When that fails and she is unable to communicate what she is feeling, I rely on comforting phrases like, ""I'm here for you"" and ""It's gonna be alright"".  Phrases that are really worn out, and have no concrete action attached to them, which are having the opposite effect at this point. 

Last night something that I think is good happened though. She called me out on the last part. That those phrases I rely on when my attempts to get her to open up fails are mostly just empty words, even if I have the best of intents. She told me if I really want to help, I need to educate myself of what I actually can do to help her. That I need to take actual actions to help her if I want to do a difference. 

So I want to learn, but I'm not sure where to start. I am considering the possibility to join her in a therapy session in order to work out ways to deal with this. I have also done some basic reading on PTSD, anxiety/panic attacks, depression and self harm, but have only read things that I've learnt myself during my time dealing with this. Things like when she has a panic attack/flashback, do not touch her without permission, remind her of where she is and that she is safe, not pressuring her to talk but giving her the opportunity to. Not be judgemental and give her ultimatums over her self harm, and do your best to get her to open up.

What I am looking for now is what I can really do to act and help when shit hits the fan. She wants me to use all of my care and energy towards something concrete. I know that this probably is something for a professional to help us with, but maybe someone here have similar experiences, some good reading material/youtube videos to recommend?

In the last 5 or so years I’ve cried twice, once when my uncle took his own life, and once during my current relationship where my SO was pushing me away. I can try and push myself to cry, like watching sad movies or thinking about things that would break me but nothing ever comes out. Sleep has even eluded me lately, usually I’ll stay up till 5 am not being able to fall asleep even if I tried. Then if I even get to sleep it’s restless and filled with nightmares. I’ve attempted changing my habits and my daily routine but I haven’t seen any change. Sometimes I’ll feel as though I’m fine but quickly I’ll become down again. 

I’m not sure what I can do to help improve myself and lately I don’t even want to try. I just want to isolate myself and stop eating. I’m currently in a break with my SO and I’m the lowest I’ve been in a long time, I get this feeling that I want to break down and cry but I can’t.

90,"I recently came into conflict with a group of people i have spent a great deal of time with and who’s opinions i value above most. In my perspective it was over nothing of specific significance, just something we have and will disagree on. To narrow the issue, it was something they were upset over the thought of me doing. It was nothing life-defining, career-altering, it didn’t affect my collegiate career nor my romantic relationship, and it affected only those who asked for it to affect them. 

Regardless, the aforementioned group responded in a way that they saw as caring yet i received as regretful and despondent. It was as if this decision changed who I was as a person, when it was nothing more than a very sparse activity. It changed nothing of my personality or my morals, and yet they treated me as if i were someone completely different than the person yet experienced growing up and effectively put me on an emotional quarantine. even those whom i felt closest to begun acting as if i had done something personally offensive. It is, effectively, making me lapse into a depressive episode.

i have a lot to look forward to this week, this month, and the remainder of this year.  Even just this week: My girlfriend comes to visit today, my friends are having me over this weekend, one of my favorite shows returns this Friday, and one of the art pieces I have been pouring myself into will be coming much closer to completion. Yet regardless of all those things, i find myself slipping into an anxious depressive episode during any moment in which i find myself alone. showers are really hard to get through without breaking, sleeping has become a significant challenge, and finding solace in my trust of myself has become challenging. I will admit I am currently running on low sleep as per my work on my essays, but recently even on my best of days I can’t help but feel the constant tug of some existential distrust in my own goodness or morality. I am shackled by my guilt over something i do not regret.

I will try as I can to articulate my emotions in laymen terms without sounding like a community college psych student (i say this as if an art school film student somehow outranks this):
The physical sensation reminds me of the way i feel when i hold my breath for too long, but it is constant. My head feels lighter than usual. Emotionally, it is as if someone has hit me in the knees with a baseball bat. i find myself lacking drive. I get my school work done, but i struggle to bring myself to the gym. In the spare time that i would otherwise use to do comic work or filming, i sit or sleep, with an intermission for food and long hot showers. I am stuck listening to the Breath of the Wild soundtrack as all other music just feels unnatural to me. I can’t even watch TV, damn it. I just feel as if i have wasted my entire life up to this point because this group does not accept this one decision of mine and therefore rejects me fundamentally. they are a group i would otherwise see often and i cannot bring myself to look them in the eye or exist comfortably in a space with them. I feel as if i have gone off the deep end. I have lost my security and trust in myself. I just want my family to like me again.

And then I moved in my with nana and grandpa and I was abused over there and then cops showed up and got me out of that abusive family. And then now my nana and grandpa are being charged with sex trafficking and child melostation and probably going to prison. And now my dad might go to prison cause he let me get abused over at his wife’s house. Worried he will go to prison I know it’s not his fault he was lied to and manipulated by everyone. And now he might go to prison but if he goes to prison or jail and he might get raped and beat up and killed he knows how to break every bone in the body and every pressure point. But his back has severe back problems. He’s not very smart he was a blue baby so it’s easy for people to manipulate and lie to him the detective is going after him and I never wanted this to happen is there a chance I will become a psychopath if my dad get killed in jail or prison,08Oct2019,1
103,"Yesterday I got out the bath and cried for about 15 minutes. I was contemplating suicide again for the first time in a while. It's a combo of depression and anxiety, the meds I'm on have helped but they haven't made me bulletproof ya know? 

I usually vape some weed (dry herb, I don't fuck with those oils) And it helps *a lot* BUT I suffer from this nasty shit where the cartilage in my ribs gets inflamed, so I've had to take a break from the vape until I know for sure it's not the vape causing the inflammation. 

Anyway, yesterday was awful. I felt paralysed by the weight of all the negativity. I didn't do shit.

Today, I woke up in a reasonably indifferent mood (which is great because my first thought when I wake up is usually ""I wish I never woke up ever again"". 

I've cleaned the house from top to bottom for the first time since about March. And not just a surface clean either, I actually scrubbed the floors and everything. Then I went to the store to get groceries for the week, took my winter coat to the dry cleaners and then made myself a smoothie. 

This is the most productive I've been (outside of work) in months. 

How can I go from wanting to kill myself to this? Literally overnight. 

You never _really_ know what might change tomorrow, this is one of the reasons I've never really gone through with it, I can always look back at a day where it wasn't so bad and think ""today is a write off, let's try again tomorrow"". 

But at the same time it's driving me crazy. It's not just day to day either. I can already feel it creeping back in and I'm trying to keep it at bay. 

Idk what the point of this was. Hopefully someone else can relate. This up-and-down shit is fucking exhausting.",08Oct2019,1

105,"Don’t know if this is the right place to write this but I need some suggestions about my nephew his mom and her ex husband.

so where to begin..My nephew  (Not biological nephew) is 9 years old. 
His mother is divorced from my nephews father when he was 4-5 years old. 

His Mother then met my brother and they are now married and have another child that is 4 years old. 

My 9 year old nephew lives every other week with his father and his new wife. 

okay that is some backstory. 

Now here is the problem, lately my 9 year old nephew has started to act strange. He has A LOT of anxiety, he can suddenly start crying because of it. He keeps thinking and thinking about things that happened when he was in preschool. 
He had told his mom that ”I painted on the wall in preeschool..Are you mad at me?” 
He sometimes wakes up at night and keeps walking around and wakes up his mom to ask if she is angrt at him for something he might have said or thought or done. His brain just won’t let him stop thinking..
He has had eye blink tics sometimes aswell. 
He’s very obsessive about things and keeps saying he needs to be a ”good person”. We are all suspecting something with ocd, but don’t know yet..Has anyonenhad any similar experiences themselves or with anloved one before? 

His mom lets him go to therapy and they thinking about medication. Problem is his dad doesn’t want him to take any medication. Is all a big mess.

And I would just like to get some tips on ways that could help him while the grown ups figure their stuff out. Like I was thinking maybe buy him paint by numbers or something to keep his mind busy when it’s really bad? I just dunno, please help.",08Oct2019,1

My anxiety medication makes my anxiety now manageable. My anxiety before medication was crippling.

However, I still have self-sabotaging behaviors (like not studying for my classes, paying bills late, etc) because I can’t find the motivation to just do these simple tasks, and I also go through “spells” were I just feel so blah. It feels like my personality has been sucked out of me and left me as a shell of a person.

108,"I am a 22 year old male.

I care too much whether people like me or not. I crave approval and acceptance from people. Like if a person looks at me and doesn't smile I assume it is a look of disapproval and that person is thinking negatively of me. I also get discouraged when I am with someone, and another person gives the person I am with all of their attention. It makes me jealous that they are acknowledging the person I am with and not me.

I am a people pleaser, and I wish I wasn't. I am trying to get to a point where I don't care if people like me or not and to stop seeking approval/acknowledgement from people.

I believe my people pleasing attitude dates back to when I was 13 and in 8th grade, I had a teacher that wasn't very fond of me. He would give all of his students attention and acknowledgement except for me. Prior to that year, I was always a teacher's pet and their favorite student. Teachers would always give special acknowledgement to me. This was really the first time that a teacher didn't think I was one of the best.

I always wanted his approval/acknowledgement and I never got it. I would get really jealous that all the other students were getting attention from him, and I wasn't getting that same attention. All I wanted was his approval.

From that point I started seeking approval from EVERYONE: To strangers, cashiers, store employees, waiters/waitresses, etc. I just remember my people-pleasing attitude starting around that point. I didn't really have this problem prior to 8th grade. I believe if it wasn't for my teacher not acknowledging me, I wouldn't have this problem today.

Now I am trying to get over it, but it's difficult. How can I stop seeking approval from people?",08Oct2019,1

110,"Hey all, I'm not mentally ill but am still struggling with my mental health. Lately I've been so stressed and I hate my job so much it destroys me. I've lost all but one of my friends and I feel quite lonely all the time. All of this weight on my mental health has really turned me into a shut in. It makes me feel better to be alone and I dont have to think about the outside world. I get in these moods where all I want is to run away. I often fantasize about living in a cabin far far away from humanity. Where I can just survive and not deal with the average stresses of a working class citizen. It just seems so peaceful to live like that. The only thing I can think of that's probably somewhat healthy for me is I've recently taken up guitar. I'm no good but practicing puts me in the therapeutic/meditative state that just completely rids my mind of any worries. The thing is I cant play guitar all day, I only have an hour a day at most because I have to do things like take my girlfriend to her apprenticeship at the tattoo shop or get caught up doing stuff like that or yanno work. Other than that I really feel like I just suffer sometimes and let it drag on because idk what else to do. I let it happen and I just do what I do, stay in my room. Its come to the point where I really WANT to get out of the house, but even if my friend tries getting me out it feels like sudden death. I love the comfort of my home but I'm afraid it's getting unhealthy. I've completely distanced myself from social media (besides reddit) because it's just so full of disgust. I hate the people on their, I hate their meaningless opinions, and I hate hearing about what abominal thing trumps done now. I feel like I just hate the world and want to be left alone.

114,"In February of this year I had a bad reaction to marijuana (possibly laced) and immediately ceased my use of the drug. During the following 6 weeks I had a myriad of physical and health issues: 
depression, eyes constantly watering when I wasn’t crying, bladder issues (drinking a lot of water early in the day and not peeing until hours later), cognitive issues, breathing issues, not sweating during rigorous exercise, dehydration, not able to take deep breaths even during rigorous exercise when normally I’d be breathing deeply) no pleasure during masturbation even when I orgasm. 

I stupidly returned to using marijuana 6 weeks after the initial incident and became incredibly suicidal, paranoid, anxious, and psychotic. I stopped after about 2 weeks of daily use and my health issues became even worse:
constipation, sometimes needing 10-13 hours of sleep to feel rested, brain zaps akin to those I’ve experienced after coming off of SSRIs, strange response to exercise (trouble breathing, needing 11-13 hours of sleep in subsequent days to feel rested, extreme depression and fatigue during the following days). I was briefly on an anti-psychotic but stopped because of the side effects and am now taking a mood stabilizer for depression. It helps but I'm still depressed, presumably because of all the other issues I'm having and how difficult they make my life. My blood work came back normal and the neurologist I saw said he can’t find anything wrong with me. I’m incredibly motivated to get my life on track but the issues (especially those pertaining to exercise) have made it difficult. Any recommendations on specialists I should see?

115,"How can I help my wife

Hi. So some background. I am a 22m. My wife is 23f. This is going to be a long one and I’ll have a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My wife was molested by two men from about ages 3 to 12. Her biological father was a junkie. Her parents were separated and her mother was unaware of his issues. He would use her to get free drugs/or was so high out of his mind he didn’t know. These two men would visit her at separate times while she would be in a room playing and violate her in every way. They told her if she told anyone that they would kill her dog and it would be her fault.

Her mother remarried when she was five and not to the best man in the world. He’s an alcoholic and a really angry and extremely verbally abusive man. He would tell her while drunk that while he loved her, he felt weird treating her as a daughter, hugging her, ect. Because she wasn’t his kid.

Her own biological father of course, never gave her the time of day or the love she desperately craved (and I think still does to this day.) her stepmother also attempted to kill her when she was 11 by taking her to the garage, locking her in there and (she’s only told me this story once years ago so I don’t really remember) did something to fill the garage with CO2. She was in the hospital for days because someone found her unconscious.

Now for the reason I’m here. My wife suffers from debilitating depression, anxiety, paranoia, and self worth issues. She’s attempted suicide 3 times, the most recent only a few months ago when I came home and she’s swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My wife blames herself for never speaking up. She worries that other little girls have gone through what she has because she didn’t speak up. I’m literally the only person she’s ever told. 

Of course I’ve told her how it’s not her fault and even walked her through how it’s not. Asking her if she would blame any other molestation victim which of course she answers of course not. But she still blames herself. 

I’ve asked her if she’ll please try to get help but she says she can’t talk to anyone face to face about her experiences and that she’s not worth fixing. She even told me that she doesn’t even expect our marriage to work because she thinks she will slip even further into this state of mind of all the issues she has, and she’s convinced she’ll end up making my life miserable. 

She also isn’t exactly sure how to fix herself. She says (and I’ve seen it) she literally keeps herself as busy as possible by helping animals (both our own and others) to avoid thinking about herself because it’s too painful. Obviously she’ll never heal from this trauma if she refuses to work on it. I obviously do not blame her in any way for her issues and I am respectful and do not push her in any way that makes her uncomfortable. 

My overall question is: other people who have gone through this shit and have made some sort of recovery. What were the steps you took? What advice can I bring her to help herself? I love my wife more than anything in the world and it breaks my heart watching her suffer every single day. Any advice for her or me is greatly appreciated. Thank you and God bless

TL;DR: Wife has depression anxiety paranoia and self worth issues because of being molested from 4-12 and has never had a good father figure. She refuses to get help or work on herself. What are some steps she can take to overcome this? What steps can I take to support and help her?",08Oct2019,7

118,"This is quite long I just really needed to vent and make sense of my thoughts today because my anxiety is just so high. Let me start by saying that my boyfriend is my rock, my world. We’ve known each other over 4 years and been together over 3. He is the kindest, most gentle, patient, funny, warm man I’ve ever known and he treats me like a queen. We both want to spend our lives together.

But the past couple years have been hard on me. Not because of *him* for who he is, but the circumstances. Since early 2018 we’ve been on a mission to get out of debt and have a savings just generally be financially stable. The brunt of the debt (~80%) was his from his past young and dumb mistakes, mine was just some credit card debt. So I prioritized his debts first, as they were also time sensitive. The point is, we have been sacrificing, moved in with family, downgrading everything about our lives to tackle it all. That way we could do “us” the right way when we decide to settle down. And we did it, too! Back in April we paid off his collections, his old car loans from a vehicle he hadn’t owned in years, even paid off his car. It felt amazing, and it was my turn next. 

But then two weeks (no seriously) two freaking weeks after paying off his car, it died (it was a beater anyway, but it worked). So we had to get him a new (used) one. I thought okay, so we‘ll still have 2 car payments, no biggie. 

Over the next month or so we managed to pay off one of my credit cards which felt great, but then my boyfriend vocalized how incredibly unhappy he was at his job that he’d been at over 10 years. I made sure we got him into a new one ASAP because his happiness is everything to me. And he did get a new job, closer to home, easier work, same pay. It was good. 

We paid off half of another one of my cards and had about $1000 in our savings before he realized he was miserable at this new job; the area manager was an absolute prick, he lost his passion for the industry, the hours were long and tough, etc.. I understood, still do, so I supported him quitting and finding something totally new, like a M-F office type job. 

But then one particular day he just straight up quit. No two weeks’ notice, no new job lined up. We had discussed this possibly happening the night before, so it wasn’t totally unexpected, but still nerve wracking to me as he made more money than I did, and had no new job prospects. I assured him we could squeak by for X amount of weeks until he needed to start working again. So he kept up his search for about two months, things are tight but we’re getting by, and he decides to pursue insurance sales. I supported him fully because, hell, I’m a supportive person and I knew this opportunity could open new doors and offer him so much growth and potential. He was really excited about it, about taking this risk, the idea of being able to provide so well for us and our future family, etc...So we got the money together, got him licensed, he did his training, even pooled money together for an inexpensive laptop for his job. All in all we probably invested $300 into it. It went well at first, he liked it and his colleagues and during training he made good money. But once he was on his own it proved difficult and after only about 1 1/2 months of doing it, it turned into something he realized he didn’t want. When you first go into sales, it takes a loooot of hard work, a lot of hours put in, to really get established and make good money. And he wanted to bring money in now rather than in a year, two years, three...so he quit last week. And I supported him. I was a bit jarred, but I support him.

So he started a serving job yesterday. And that’s fine. All he cares about right now is bringing money in to help me and take some pressure off. He’ll just do this while he applies places and until he gets hired for a new career, whatever it may be.

And most days, I’m okay. This is okay. We’re human and we go through changes and our career goals change.

But between the debt pay offs and jumping through these jobs trying to find something new for him, I feel so tired. And anxious. I have my own goals I’d like to pursue and he reassures me regularly that I don’t need to put my stuff on pause for him, but I kind of do. I’m the sole income right now. At a job I truly dislike but we need to get the bills paid. He knows it was stupid just up and quitting his last management/salary job before the insurance gig. But we can’t change the past you know? Just gotta keep moving forward and working hard, I tell him (and myself). 

I’m just so...exhausted. Exhausted from stress, exhausted from anxiety, exhausted from overthinking every moment of every day. 

Before stressing about getting him a new steady job, I was always stressing about money. The only reason it’s not a priority to stress over is because it’s been replaced with the anxiety and stress of him getting a stable job again that makes him happy. I want that so badly for him, and he wants that so badly. He also wants to start prioritizing my goals and my needs, but it’s just...I don’t know. There’s too much up in the air to focus on me.

I made the decision this year to go back to school and pursue dental hygiene (pays incredibly well in my state and only takes a two year program and examinations to get licensed). I’m excited at the prospect of having something to work towards, especially because all my life I’ve worked just to pay bills, it’s never been a job I enjoyed. But I keep thinking about my credit cards. I keep thinking about all I have to do before I can start in spring 2020 when I’d like to. I keep thinking about how I’ll need to go down to working part time or not at all as I dive into the program, and whether we can afford that. Cuz I think about how in order for me to pursue this, my boyfriend needs a steady job first. And I keep thinking about how I’ve always been independent, working full time, and the idea of not working full tome (also losing my benefits) and depending on someone financially scares me. Maybe it’s a pride thing, maybe it’s a risk thing. Idk. All I know is, I feel scared and anxious and stuck. If he isn’t stable with his career by then, I just can’t afford to not work and pursue school and that makes me upset. 

And I don’t resent my boyfriend. I can’t. He isn’t a bum, he’s a hard working man who worked tirelessly at a job for *years* and is just trying to figure out the next step. I choose this and have chosen this everyday, and I know if the tables were turned he’d support me the same because he’s an angel. I told him and I mean this, that mental health comes first over a paycheck and he was so miserable at his old job I don’t fault him for quitting. But I’m just...so burnt out. And I feel guilty for feeling burnt out by supporting my partner because that’s what you do in relationships. 

I just needed to vent. I know it’ll all work out, I’ve just been waiting for it to “all work out” for a while. It’s been “project boyfriend” the past two years whether regarding finances or jobs, and I feel like I’ve put things on hold to work a job I hate to keep the bills paid. And I feel snotty for saying that. I just.....ugh. I’m so tired of worrying about money and about him and his career path, while totally neglecting my own.",08Oct2019,1
119,"For many, autumn is a positive season of calm and resetting some kind of routine  at home. For others, it's a lonelier time, with the seasonal depression sets in along with the darker evenings. Either way, there's never been a better time to invest in one or two lovely indoor house plants. Here's why...

1. Plants, quite literally help you to breathe. Some even clean the air in your home, such as the Peace Lily (above) or Aloe Vera plants

2. It's often been said (in jest, although there's definitely some truth to it) that gardening is the cheapest form of therapy. There's something about caring for your plants and watching them grow (or, survive!) that really is therapeutic. 

3. Scented plants have been known to reduce anxiety and stress... try an indoor lavender plant, which will also help you to sleep well

4. It's a fact that human beings are happier in aesthetically-pleasing environments. An indoor plant will make your home look that bit homier, and one step closer to the front cover of an interior design magazine.

122,"This is a long paragraph. Specificity makes accurate answers. 

My best friend has asked me for mental help too many times, and I don’t think I can do this on my own anymore. I need help. 

My friend has a very controlling and psychologically abusive single mother. 
This results in, as he says, faking personalities to fitting in and not be alone. 

He hasn’t been diagnosed at all, but I’m assuming he has either/both depression and/or dissociative personality disorder. 

He talks to me about mental health a lot and usually I can talk to him and let him vent, but it’s getting to the point where it’s weekly, and I don’t think my advice is any good. 
My advice isn’t the stereotypical “just think happy”, I tell him that his negative thoughts are wrong and he just wants to be sad. I tell him about all the fun things we did, showing proof that we’re friends, and saying that I can help him but in the end, only he can make the final decisions to be happy or sad. 

For his depression, he keeps talking about how no one will remember him after graduation (we’re both high school seniors) and he’ll be crushed by stress and his mother. I say that I want to help him, and I do help him find things and do things he can’t do alone, and always says something along the lines of “You don’t have to, you can just ignore me and forget about me.” He still finds some enjoyment in the games we play together, but recently he’s been getting annoyed by small things in the game that he used to like, if he has any emotion at all. Just today he told me that he thinks some emotions are annoying and tries not to have them, to which I ask him “When will it stop? Will you soon have no emotions at all?”  He responded with a meme talking about liberosis, which is a desire for liberty, dramatically talking about his desire to leave his mother’s influence. During these bouts of depression I help him remember times where we had fun, the plans for more hangout sessions, and the fun things we talk about and say that we’re still friends, then he sends memes that involve calling someone (me) a liar. Recently he’s been very apathetic and irritated towards pretty much everything, being annoyed by mandatory class meetings and not caring that he’s late to school, even if he’s late because he sits in his truck in the parking lot 10 minutes before he’s late, and staying in when he’s supposed to leave (almost like he wants to be late). As mentioned before, the small things in the games we play he gets angry over and goes on long rants, before desaturating his desire to play and getting off early. In addition to his drama, when I asked him “When will your depressive increases stop?”, he says that they’ll probably stop after graduation because he’ll commit suicide due to the “stress of graduation and leaving friends behind.”

And the dissociative personality, a key symptom in DPD is depression, so there’s a plus. In the same conversation I was talking to him about what depression is, and he seemed very detached from me, and says something about his “pinkish squishy thing in a skull” and is surprised when I was referring to him during the whole conversation. He says he feels like someone else, referring to his fake personalities from his youth and wanting to fit in. I ask if I’ve never met the real him, he says he doesn’t know and feels “like a piece of shit” because he doesn’t know. He says that some days he’s a social butterfly and some days he’s the most introverted kid in the school. He does act this way, every so often I see him in episodes of laughter and joy, and sometimes I see him apathetic and irritated by the smallest things. He’s been very realistic as well, having an existential crisis about the fact that everything he’s ever experienced is caused by his brain, and while he isn’t wrong, he looked at it from a depressing standpoint and goes full nihilist. 

And all of this is worsened by his political stances—he refuses to see a psychologist because he thinks they’ll ignore patient confidentiality and tell the government, and the government will use his mental issues as leverage to do what they want. A few days ago he asked me if they refuse to fund disease cures because not curing the diseases is bringing in money. 

I don’t want it to be too long, and this is as much as I remember off the top of my head. I can get more specific in the comments below, if you ask them. 

Please, I don’t want my best friend to kill himself. Help me help him.

The past year was rough with my step mom committing suicide, being in a really hostile work environment, and dealing with a severe adhd, depression, and anxiety. 
I'm currently on anxiety meds but i have to go back to the doctor to fit in adhd and/or depression meds. I'm so exhausted and I've been sick a lot. 
I have a dr appt on Thursday so I'm hoping that will help. 
I've told my dad, my bf, and my coworkers. They care but they can't really help other than giving encouragement. That's totally fine. I need a therapist that i can afford. 
This is me yelling into the void that chemical imbalances suck!!!
Thank you for reading.",08Oct2019,4

125,"Anybody here have experience on coping with side effects/outbursts due to weaning off of lexapro? I have been on it for about 2 years now, and am experiencing harsher side effects and I want to try another route. However, it has been two days and had a full blown panic attack in the form of lashing out/being unable to calm down with SO. I have been on 10mg for the past two years. I did my research and am basically taking 5mg for a week, then 2.5mg for another week, then at least 3 days with nothing before I try a new drug. Anything is appreciated.

126,"I have no idea where to post this, this place has the most subscribers related to mental stuff so I thought I’d give this a try.

Backstory: I’m 17, was born with a deformity that left me with hearing impairment and a deformed right ear. It doesn’t bother me at all and I’m completely ok with it.

Today someone at my school who is in the same vague friendship group as me, said “your ear makes you look like a goblin”. Then he said “goblin” as we departed to go to our classes.

Now this is no new experience to me, people have done this all my life (a lot when I was younger) and it doesn’t offend me at all. 

But I don’t understand how people think stuff like this acceptable to say? Especially in a mature environment - he’s pretty academic (it’s a good school), he’s not one of those people who doesn’t give a shit about education or anything, he’s fairly ordinary. I just can’t get my head around saying something like that to someone. Luckily for him I don’t make a fuss over this kind of stuff, I’m used to it. I could never imagine picking on some deformity that someone has 0 control over. People have picked on my weight (I’m skinny) and I’m completely fine with that, I’ve been gaining more weight and started hitting the gym. But a comment like this... 

How does this even cross someone’s mind? Is it a mental condition? ADHD or something? How they were raised?

Please let me know in the comments, thanks a lot. If you know a subreddit which is more suited for this question I would love to know also. Thanks.",08Oct2019,10

How I feel right now

08/10/2019 @ 16:18

Angry no reason why

Frustration to the point of shaking my fists but I don’t know why

I can’t focus on a tasks

my mood is low, not where I feel sad more like a combination of angry and numb.

I am unable to focus on work tasks.

My job involves problem solving but I can’t focus on my workload, I cant priorities my work load I cant time manage my work load.

I think I have ADHD, but I could have something else wrong with me

I don’t feel like people can help me.

I feel ashamed talking about it to my partner of 10 years I love her, but she doesn’t understand.

She has sufferd with depression and knows what that feels like she would say I am not like her and she is right I am not like her.

My pain comes from anger frustration the inability to think correctly or focus my attention correctly.

I have been responding completely out of proportion in the last 24 hours the slightest thing sets me off into a shouty rage loud tone. No violence or horrible name calling but this is not the sort of person I am 

I need a doctor I keep wanting to see a doctor, but I can never get hold of a doctor.

The earliest appointment I can book is the 6th of November the earliest I can talk is the 14th October 

Right this second 16:24 I want to cry because now I feel emotional, but I don’t know why, I don’t know what’s causing me to be like this I feel like I am unstable.

I need help really need help I am not a danger to myself or others, but I feel like I’m trapped within my own mind.

I have felt like this on and off for 31 years of my 31-year life I can’t remember what it was like to be a baby but do you know what I mean? Does this make sense to anyone?",08Oct2019,1
128,"I can remember my constant worry as far back as middle school. I remember sitting on the school bus at 12 years old, worrying that my friends hate me, and this thought rolled over, and over, and oooverrrrr inside of my mind. That thought then turned into a cycle of thoughts about how “unpopular” I was, and how I’m “ugly”, which then turned into various negative preoccupations with every aspect of who I am. The thoughts trickled in without warning, and I (unknowingly) allowed them to swallow me whole. These intrusive obsessions lasted for months or even years, on a daily basis. Once the agonist of each obsession thought drifted further away, a new one would knock on the door &amp; I’d welcome it inside with (bruised and bloodied) open arms. 

These thoughts then progressed into newer, far more damaging territory during adulthood. I started to feel like I wasn’t really alive. I have always felt like I am living in a fog. I have always felt that a certain parts of life are missing from mine. 

I began cleaning in a hyper focus every night before bed, because I couldn’t sleep otherwise. When my boyfriend and I worked until late, we spent little to no time together in the evenings because of this. 

I have zero spontaneity. If I don’t have what I think I need in order for things to be right, I fear the worst. Say I’ve been asked to sleep over somewhere and I don’t have my toothbrush, skincare products, clothes, etc. Unless I’m hammered drunk, I will either decline or spend the night and following morning feeling angsty and disordered.

I spend my days on the internet making sure that my obsessions are true and real. For example, if I had a worry about something I would try to soothe myself by reading articles related to it.

I started ruminating excessively over my childhood. For quite some time I was fixated on whether or not I was raised properly and if that was the reason why I’m such an unhappy person. This worry appeared on a daily basis.

I have always been a night owl. I can’t fall asleep until everyone else is asleep. If my boyfriend is awake, I am awake, very few exceptions. He’s never understood my tendency to stay up late for seemingly no reason at all. Neither had I.

The preoccupation that actually nudged me into a therapy clinic is quite ironic. I had convinced myself that I had a personality disorder. I was positive that I had a personality disorder, even though I met very little criteria. I literally “met” two or three of the 8+ criteria, but just that idea sent me on the trip of a lifetime.

I had been arguing with my boyfriend frequently, (which in hindsight these arguments were caused entirely by my obsessive and compulsive thoughts about him leaving me or meeting someone better) and during that time I stumbled upon an article (a compulsion of mine is web-searching as stated above) on BPD. 

“Wow! I seem to fear breaking up with my boyfriend as I love him very much... there is one trait I have... Oh, I also feel like I’m living in a fog, and wow, yes, I as well feel down in the dumps quite often. That’s me, wow that is me, and this stigmatized new illness of mine is the cause of all of the wreckage in my life!!!!!”

These thoughts burned, and burned, and the flames grew bigger with each compulsive internet binge I indulged in in an attempt to somehow validate myself. 

I would think about having this “BPD” Every. Single. Hour. Of. Every. Single. Day.

I woke up, and my thoughts drifted immediately to whether or not this disorder would end my relationship. I picked up my phone, and I would spend the morning getting ready for work while simultaneously reading up on how crazy I was. I would check these articles at red lights. At dinner I would excuse myself to the restroom to check up on my obsession because it was so all- consuming. I would annoy the living shit out of people talking to them about all of my negative personality traits, prying and trying to perceive whether or not they agreed.

I was trapped in a constant state of anxiety and dread, so desperate to stop the madness inside of my mind. 

When I heard ‘OCD’ and began working through it, my soul woke up. It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. It felt like I was waking up from a dream. Objects and people feel *there*. I feel more like a person than I ever have in my 21 years of life.

The years and years of life that I have wasted. The thoughts, the constant detective work in my head, the doubt, the pain... a misfire someplace in my brain. A little loop of my imagination that has poisoned a large part my life. Why can’t I think something and let it roll off my back? Why can’t I control myself and what goes on inside of my own head? I found out why, and I found out what I can do to help myself. That’s a step. That’s some hope.

Please reach out for help if this sounds anything like you. There is hope for a better life and a healthier mind.",08Oct2019,17

Hey,

this  is about how bullying affected me and my mental health. Plus a piece of advice I have for anyone  currently suffering through it.

I  was bullied throughout basically most of my school career. My parent's  take on this was (in their defense, they had no idea, it was just meant  as general advice and it only hit hard due to the circumstances I was  already in) that I should basically ignore them and eventually the  bullies would grow tired of me not showing any reaction.

It  didn't stop and I started to feel embarassed, like there was something  wrong with me, since they didn't move on. My friends at that time  ignored the bullying. No one actively experiencing it ever stood up for  me and thus I never felt like confiding in a teacher, since I was afraid  that they'd side with the abusers. My friends noticed that I was  starting to withdraw from them, but instead of asking me what's wrong,  they just told me to smile more. As a result of that. I did. I laughed  when I felt like crying. I became incredibly sarcastic in order to hide  the fact that I did actually have feelings and that I cared. As a  result, I eventually started to repress my negative emotions enough that  I got numb and now...Well, I am 24 and have severe depression.

I  am currently undergoing therapy to deal with this and some (unrelated)  trauma caused by my Mum. Why I still wanted to post this here, besides  no immediate need for help on my behalf?

Because  I want you to know that it's not shameful or embarassing to speak up.  It took me way too long to realize that. Maybe some people won't  understand. Maybe they'll even put you down. It doesn't matter, move to  someone else. There will always be at least one person to listen. What  you are experiencing is not okay, neither is it your fault. Don't ignore  them. Don't endure it. Fight them. But if you can't. Don't try to take  them on yourself. Talk to the people, who love you.

People, especially kids, are sometimes cruel. Don't blame yourself if they target you. You are not damaged. You deserve love.

And  to those of you, who witness stuff like that happening. Talk to the  people. If you are afraid of confronting the bullies, talk to the victim  in private. You have no idea how powerful just having one ally can be.  Just because they don't seek you out, doesn't necessarily mean that they  are fine with it. (Unless you just do it to make yourself feel good.  People usually notice that. And it doesn't generally resonate well with  them. Chances are they'll feel even more alone.)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the double post, but I just felt like this might/could be useful to someone, who is not aware of the /r bullying subreddit since it's fairly small. Feel free to take it down, if this is not the right content for this subreddit. I just really felt like putting it out there. I just came back from therapy and have this strong urge to prevent anyone else from feeling that way and dealing with the consequences.",08Oct2019,7
130,"I'm afraid to disclose some things I did in my past to a counselor/psychologist, however I need help resolving what happened. I wasn't the victim and I feel ashamed of what I did. I understand why I did it to a degree and I've traced back to when I started exhibiting certain behavior.

I know that by law, counselors/psychologists are required to report certain violations. However I no longer live with/by the victims/perpetrators and it's been about 3 years since one incident and at least 10 since the others. 

Is it possible to create a theoretical situation with fake people and ask for the person I'm seeing yo resolve the made-up persons issue?

131,"I'm not suicidal, I'm not a threat to myself or anyone else, but I do have some major problems going on.  I have been to a psychologist before and have been in medication for depression but nothing that I have tried has worked.

Let me start out saying that I strive to please people and that I am by no means a lazy individual.  I work hard and am always looking for ways to improve mine and my wife's life together.  Some aspects of my life are fine, others are not.

I've always had trouble keeping a job for more than a few years - it's not that I get fired, I find reason to quit because I get bored or finally realize how I'm in a crappy environment or failing company and need to get out.  Right now I have been at my current job for a little under 3 years (not long, I know), but my boss's daughter has taken over and has anger issues always yelling and looming over us for her own insecurities.  I can't take being yelled at, so I blank out and find myself leaving early to avoid conflict.  We have had numerous discussions about this but nothing is ever resolved.   I wake up every day feeling sick, dreading coming to a job where I make decent money and should be thankful for but I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.  I'm bored and tired of the micromanagement - I'm tired of applying for other jobs and spending so much time for nothing though I feel as if it doesn't matter because the next job will always be like the last.  I'm breaking down mentally and physically and find myself having terrible thoughts about the people around me.  I have to support my wife and I...I WANT to support us, but every day with every temper tantrum that my ""boss"" throws I invision myself taking a long walk and not returning.

Because of all of this I am depressed, anxious, fidgety and forever angry.  I have feelings of dread even on days off.  I feel that I should not be working but if I don't work I can't pay our bills and won't be a contributing member of society which I simply can not have.

What the hell do I do?  I'm so tired of the dread and feeling sick and so over everything.  I'm slowly killing myself and see no way out.  There is. no magic answer, I realize this.  Maybe I'm not meant to be near people.  I don't know what to even ask or what else to say and for that I am sorry.  Thanks for listening to my feelings of hopelessness.",08Oct2019,3

On the other hand, I can get attached to people I don't know so well and want to talk to them all of the time. It happens randomly, I can struggle to talk to most people and then something just clicks with one person. I have no idea why or how to stop myself, and sometimes I feel like a burden to a relative stranger.

145,"Anxious feelings can creep up on you whether you like it or not. It’s about how you respond to the problem that helps you tackle it. 

Whether it be preparing for an exam, a job interview, social settings, or an existential crisis; attempting to treat anxiety and stress is vital for a healthy mind. 

Some stressors are completely healthy, like a challenge to beat, but some, like not leaving the house due to the infinite possibilities that could occur, can be extremely debilitating. 

CBD has helped many people in the United States achieve a natural, healthy way to tackle anxiety without any psychoactive components interfering with their daily routine.

What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about the future. Symptoms may include an increased heart rate, fast breathing, sweating, and fatigue.

For most people, anxiety isn’t something that debilitates their social or personal lives, but still causes some discomfort every once in a while. Daily stress can build up over time causing physical aches &amp; pains, irritability, or even sadness.

In some, Anxiety can be intense, overwhelming, and life-consuming. Everyday situations can induce panic and fear, making life feel extremely debilitating.

Common symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or severe &amp; ongoing anxiety, include emotional distress excessive anxiety &amp; worry. 

Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), a mental health condition in which social situations induce irrational anxieties, is also very common in americans. Along with severe anxiety, this condition may exhibit palpitations, fear, and depression along with the irrational thoughts and feelings about the situation. 

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an often overlooked area of anxiety. This sector experiences excessive/obsessive thoughts that lead to repetitive &amp; impulsive behaviors. This can be extremely debilitating to the average person as thoughts usually overwhelm the normal pattern of executing daily actions

Does CBD Oil help anxiety?

Yes. Cannabidiol CBD helps combat anxiety by interacting with the body’s naturally occuring Endocannabinoid System (ECS). 

The ECS helps regulate bodily systems &amp; maintain equilibrium, or homeostasis. This includes body temperature, blood pressure, sleep cycles, metabolism, mood regulation and much more. 

Cannabinoids are found in more common places than just hemp plants &amp; cannabis plants. For example, females produce cannabinoids in their breast milk that are crucial for fetal development. 

It is believed that CBD interacts with the CB1 &amp; CB2 receptors in the brain and body throughout the Central &amp; Peripheral Nervous Systems. 

In a 2011 study, researchers studied the effects of CBD on people with SAD. Participants were administered an oral dose of 400mg of CBD, or a placebo dosage. Those who received CBD experienced overall reduced anxiety levels.

Many clinical trials have been released on CBD since it’s popularity arose in the past decade.

Can I take CBD oil with antidepressants? Is CBD a safe alternative for anxiety medications?

Of course, but with everything you begin taking, it’s important to consult your health care physician before starting. 

CBD is a naturally occuring, or organic compound. It is completely safe to ingest and take part in a wellness regimen. It doesn’t interact with pharmaceuticals the same way they would with each other.

 For the most part, most people don’t experience any side effects from starting CBD while on other prescription medications. 

Although, there are CYP450 liver enzymes that get inhibited from the presence of CBD. These enzymes help break down medications, like blood thinners. This can cause some anxiety medications like Xanax or Ativan, to increase their side effects such as drowsiness or sedation.

This of course depends on the strength of medication you are on and the amount of CBD you ingest. The stronger the medication, the stronger side effects may be. So start low, &amp; go slow when it comes to starting a CBD regimen. 

Many of our people with anxiety have successfully weaned themselves off of prescription SSRI’s with the help of Hemp CBD and/or medical marijuana.

I always recommend talking to your health care provider or pharmacist before starting a new supplement.

What are the negative side effects of CBD oil?

It’s not very common to experience negative side effects from CBD oil. It is common though, to experience negative side effects from too much CBD. 

Some clients I have helped have experienced dry mouth, diarrhea, fatigue, drowsiness, and decreased appetite. Don’t worry, this is very seldom and we recommend cutting back your dosage until symptoms are relieved.

At a recent MITA Conference, it was discussed that too much CBD can actually induce anxiety in users, therefore, reversing the anti anxiety effects.

It’s important to start low &amp; go slow- find the dosage that works best for you and your body. 

You know your body best.

Has CBD helped with your anxiety?

As a teenager, anxiety induced panic attacks were a regular pattern. From over-breathing my way to being lightheaded to almost passing out, Social Anxiety &amp; Panic attacks have been a lingering battle to conquer.. 

Daily activities that I always loved, or had no logical reason to not enjoy, started creeping up on me. For example, meeting up with good friends became a chore that I struggled to accomplish and loathed to think about. 

Not because I don’t absolutely love my friends, but because I would get these irrational thoughts racing through my mind before anything ever happened. 

My heart would start to race as I arrive to hang out, and my hands would sweat like im about to get caught for something illegal. Producing speech when you’re feeling like a spotlight has been shown on you is harder than it seems. I felt so awkward, out of place, unwanted- even though I was invited and loved! This has always been a feeling that I try and handle in a healthy way by being mindful with my thoughts, practicing my breathe, practicing yoga, working out frequently, &amp; eating a clean plant-based diet.

Anxiety relief isn’t always achieved by my daily exercise routine, or morning meditation,leaving me anxious, stressed, and tired throughout the day. Even following a healthy lifestyle doesn’t always calm my nerves, and that’s where CBD comes in as my secret weapon.

When these situations arise, I rely on CBD to help tame my thoughts and worries. 

The effects I experience are calming, soothing, and relaxing. I notice that my thoughts aren’t as ‘racy’, and are easier to ‘control’, helping me focus more on schoolwork and my career. It’s difficult to explain exactly how I feel on CBD, but it’s a positive feeling, similar to the best feelings in my life-when I felt my best. 

Cannabidiol has also been a nightly ritual for chronic pain in my lower spine. This was from a previous injury as a swimmer. I dose an hour before bed, slightly higher than my daytime doses, and am able to sleep all night without tossing, turning, and moving the pillow in between my legs. 

Is CBD for treating anxiety a scam?

Hemp CBD is not a scam.

Just like any product on the market, there are high and low quality products. Sometimes the low quality products work just as well as the high end, but usually you get what you pay for. 

Cheap CBD extracted from the roots and stalks of the hemp plant is more likely a ‘scam’. Quality CBD companies, ones that extract the CBD from the flowers and leaves of the hemp plants, are providing top-shelf CBD that is more reliable, trustworthy, and more likely to work than the cheaper brands you see. 

Another reason CBD ‘doesn’t work’ for it’s users is that they aren’t taking enough CBD for their body weight, metabolism, or severity of ailments being treated. 

The most common fix I provide clients with is to add in third dose, or a second one. Most people are taking a dose once a day, or only AM &amp; PM. It’s crucial to understand that an AM/PM dose may work on one individual, but not for another.Your body may need an extra dosage.

Everybody is different. You know your body and how you feel best, so use your intuition to guide you to the best dosage regimen possible.

Another, more uncommon reason why CBD doesn’t always satisfy its users is that they are using only Isolate, or CBD with zero amount of THC. State laws vary with the legality of Full-Spectrum CBD products, but if available to you, I recommend always choosing Full-Spectrum CBD. 

What is an effective dose of CBD oil for anxiety?

An effective dosage of CBD varies from user to user. The individuals weight, metabolism, ailment severity, tolerance, and sensitivity to CBD all come into play when figuring out the right dose to take. 

To know if you’re getting an effective dose of CBD, pay attention to how you feel. Start low, and go slow when it comes to milligrams of CBD. You don’t need too much of this potent cannabinoid to feel its relief. 

The symptoms you’re treating should dissipate, or at least lessen in severity.  

Average CBD doses for anxiety based on severity:
Mild: 5mg-15mg
Moderate: 15mg-30mg
Severe: 30mg+ (avg. 30mg-60mg)

See how one dose a day affects your symptoms. Increment doses, and milligrams as needed until desired effects are achieved. Most end up needing a dose every 6-8 hours to manage chronic anxiety disorders.

Each individual may react differently to cannabinoids based on their tolerance. Medical Cannabis users tend to have a tolerance to CBD already, causing higher doses than the average consumer. 

CBD can’t stop your problems from happening, but it can help you tame the reactions you have. Conquer your internal battle with the external world, Try CBD.

152,"(I’m not a native English speaker so there might be some grammatical errors, sorry about that)

tldr: I have mental issues and have no idea of what to do

i started my first year of college one month ago. I thought everything was going to be fine but obviously it isn’t.
For a bit of context, I had numerous mental breakdowns two years ago (so in junior year of high school). I went to therapy because i felt really depressed, empty and had suicidal thoughts. I stopped going to therapy 6 months ago because i thought i was fine and didnt want to annoy more my parents with it, even if i still had a lot of issues with my low self esteem. The thing is that i have been fine during those 6 months (i would still feel a bit depressed sometimes but it wouldnt last more than 2 days).
Since i got accepted in an art school, i worked really hard during the vacation because i considered that i wasnt good enough.
It may seem weird but i feel like everything i do have to be perfect, and i feel really bad when what i do isnt good enough. 
The thing is, those last 2 weeks have been really hard for me. I feel really empty, i can’t get out of bed, food isnt appetizing, and i had 2 mental breakdowns in 2 days. 
I’m scared about asking my parents to go to therapy again because i don’t want to trouble them and i’m afraid they might refuse (my father has never been open to mental issues and stuff like that). 
The thing is, the more time goes by the worst it becomes (i feel angry at myself for not eating,
for not being good enough etc...)

I don't even see a point in taking my new meds, especially because the capsule form makes me feel sick. I guess this is more of a vent but... I have no motivation left.

155,"I've always been kinda an odd ball. Growing up in school I was much slower than my classmates in learning, I had speech issues, I would pronounce my ""L"" as ""Y""(I yove you). I would day dream in class all day and focus on some part of the room because I couldn't stand learning so I ended up being put in a special ed class where I could understand all the concepts my teacher tried to teach me. I barely passed kindergarden because doing something as simple as crafts was tough. A teacher told me to cut between the lines and instead I changed the way I held the scissors. 

I've also always been very blunt and I speak my mind I'd say something in a very ""matter of fact"" fashion. I would always get in trouble and I'd get irritated because I didn't know what I did was wrong in speaking my mind. When it came to video games I would always ocd check them to make sure they didnt have scratches otherwise I'd lose my mind at school. 

When it came to relationships I was pretty normal up until middle and high. I had a hard time with the stereotypical desires of that age range. I liked sex and what that entailed and I was not asexual at all. But I had a hard time with hook ups because I had the unshakable belief that I was being used for sex. I don't condemn people for that culture and way of life but I didnt know how to engage. I also didnt like getting in relationships for the hell of it to gain experience because I overthink; ""what if they end up falling hard for me and i dont feel the same way because its casual"" etc. I needed to be in love. It might also be rooted in a rough early childhood with bullies that made me self concious too. I did also got Type 1 Diabetes when I was 12 and it might of shook me in some ways. 

As I became an adult I had a hard time staying motivated and the only way I can explain it - is I have a bunch of energy but I hated staying in one spot and commiting to a task or working. It's like I have this weird headache and want to stay home and do nothing even though I have energy. Then I'll get weird energy spikes and I will do all those things abd get tired. I also pace alot. I like to do it and cant help it. 

Something as simple as applying to jobs is complicated. Because I'll sit and overthink everything and wonder ""What if i apply at a bunch of different jobs and they all call me back at once and I go to each interview and they all ask if i want the job after they give it and i have to lie to one of them and i dont like lying but i need to get to the other job interview blah blah blah"". Or I'll think if this job will allow me to have any down time and lose the free time i have for school? I'm not really lazy but I don't think to do something or feel like i cant sit and do it. 

When I fall in love with someone I hate it because I get obsessive and think about them all the time. I worry if they'll find someone else and i hate the difficulty of pursuing and wondering if I'll fail. I just dont know how to manage my emotions.

I'm naturally an anxious person and I overthink, I get panicky, I think the worst before the good etc. I also do get depressed. I'm not suicidal but I wonder if I have some underlying mental illness.

159,"I (F/22) think I had a nervous breakdown about three to four weeks ago. I was very stressed, I've been for a while, but it was like there was finally a moment where my body and mind just couldn't take it anymore. 

I'm am two committees, teach my own tutoring class, follow my regular courses and extra courses too. Slowly, I started to notice I was getting more and more stressed, and getting less and less done. I have a learning disability (diagnosed about years ago, ADD), and I still don't know how to deal with it. I had a bad start in september and things started snowballing, until I stopped going to school and had what I think is a nervous breakdown. 

I didn't really get out of the house for two weeks, during which I didn't understand what was wrong with me. I just kept on going, and tried to continue on with life best I could from home (work/school tasks), but I seriously couldn't muster the energy to get anything done or even entertain the thought of going out. Replying to an email takes me an hour on a good day, and so so much energy. Then I think had a second, just as explosive nervous breakdown about two weeks later (crying in hysterics, the whole nine). I've lost 5 pounds since then. 

Until a couple days ago, I couldn't even get up without feeling so exhausted that I thought my knees might buckle. I have tried to go out  once every week, either to the grocery store or for a walk, but I spend every day at my desk still - trying and failing to catch up on my studies and work and all the other things I need to get done. 

I've got an appointment set up with a physiotherapist in two days to deal with the physical stuff (muscles tense like bricks, constant neck and back pain, probably stress induced) and I got a meeting with the school psychologist in two weeks. In two weeks, I have my exams too, and though I'm really trying I just can't seem to focus on my schoolwork  or be productive like I want to be. But the world keeps on turning, and I don't want to fail my classes. At the same time, I don't know if I'm taking my meltdowns as seriously as I should. 

For the first time in my life, I've been really open with my family about this. I still live at home, so they have to witness this stuff and deal with me now that I'm having it rough - I couldn't really keep this one quiet, it was ugly. I feel like I'm putting a lot on them. I usually keep my issues to myself and they've never seen me like this/have no experience dealing with these kinds of issues, so they're kind of overwhelmed/worried. We tend to communicate poorly too. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

I think I had a nervous breakdowns 4 weeks ago. Another one 2 weeks ago. School deadlines are approaching, I'm not doing so well when it comes to studying - I very much so want to do well on my exams. My questions are: 

\- What have you personally done after a nervous breakdown? What helped, what didn't? 

\- Stop studying and rest or power through? If I want to study, how should I go about it? Should I go back to school?

\- What helps in the short term, to cope until you get professional help? 

Thank you so much in advance. I'm at a loss, so personal experiences related to getting better and coping are appreciated.",08Oct2019,1

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone.

176,"I hate to write this as I feel stupid moaning about the way I look because I know most people (women in particular) aren’t happy with their looks. But I don’t know if it’s normal to feel this strongly. 
There are days where I don’t want to leave the house because I feel I look disgusting. In public I feel like people are looking at me thinking I’m ugly or whatever, or looking at a pimple, or any of my flaws. This leads to anxiety in public especially when I’m on my own - I walk too quickly in a rush to get home, bite my fingers, I just generally panic. 
When people compliment me I feel that they are lying, saying it to make me feel good or because they feel they have to. I genuinely don’t understand why they compliment me because there is nothing to compliment.
I’ve lost about 2 stone since last year and I still feel the same way about my body. I still obsess over calories and when I over eat I feel like shit. There’s not one part of my body I like. 
But my face is the worst. I hate my skin as i always have at least a couple of pimples. I hate my features, my face in general. I look at other girls with fillers or whatever and it makes me feel more upset because I can’t afford them. If I could I might be more attractive. I can never leave the house without makeup, I avoid mirrors in public...
The ONE thing I like is my hair, I try to focus on this but it’s hard to big yourself up about one thing when there’s a million things you hate.
I will have days where I just cry about it and feel so depressed. 
I don’t know if I should see a dr? But then I think what a stupid thing to spend NHS time on. Or I think that the dr won’t take me seriously.

185,"In my US State where I live, judges tend to favor the mother. 

My wife and I split up 7 years ago, when my daughter was barely 3 years old.  My daughter is now 11.  Her mother moved about 2 hours away. 

Until this passed August, I would see my daughter 3 - 6 times a week depending on school events.  Now, thanks to a new custody agreement, I only see her 4 times a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a major US city and driving 2 hours away to the country, during rush, for school events isn't feasible.  I've tried several times.  It's a stressful disaster unless I take the day off of work and leave at noon for a 3pm sporting or student gov't event. 

Her mother interrupts our phone calls, I talk to her every day and we text everyday too. 

We will be talking about school or her infant half sister (5 months old) with my new wife, then my ex will interrupt and tell me I'm upsetting my daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't bring up the baby any more and our phone calls consist of things we've eaten, a school event which I won't be able to attend, and any books/tv shows she's into. 

When I talk to her, I feel the same as when I talked to my terminally ill father (he had liver cancer - he lived in pain for 3 years and then died of a heart attack during chemo).  I can't explain it, I feel like I'm talking to a ghost or the shell of someone I used to know. 

This is mentally poisoning me.  It's stressing me out and I have a stressful job as well - finance officer. 

&amp;#x200B;

The stress is depressing my wife, taking joy out of anything I enjoy, I keep zoning out, I can't sleep, I'm stress eating suddenly, and I kinda wish I would just die.  (I'm not suicidal, but I'd be thankful if a piano or anvil fell on me )

196,"I am 23M and dated a 22F for 3ish years on/off through college. She was my best friend and we were inseperable in college but had MANY ups and downs. The relationship was not healthy. As I graduated and moved to the west coast, things got hard. We weren’t ever “together” but always considered that to be the case. 

She visited me 3 times after I graduated. They were all great. Almost a year ago we made a decision that it would be best to move on given the distance and our careers at the moment. Since then, I had another short term GF which temporarily masked my pain from losing my long-term GF. once that fling ended, I’ve been stuck in an ever lasting black hole of thinking I should’ve done something different to make it work. 

She has had a BF since things and it KILLS me to think that she doesn’t even think about me or care for me anymore. I constantly stalk her social media even though she’s blocked (I unblock her) but can’t even see anything. I’d love to hear people’s thoughts.",08Oct2019,1

Then after that its pretty much floods of tears until i cant cry anymore or until i stop breathing inbetween my sobs, if i cry enough i will start to hear voices in my head giving me a warning sign that my demon (Roxy) will handle all the punishments for me to take and if i dont listen to her commands or the voices telling me to Cut myself or to take an overdose then this is when we will get into a long depth conversation about what i dont want her to do to me and me telling her that if she was to ever take over my body and use it as her own which she has done many times in the past that i would walk out the house late at night in a trance wondering off and going missing somewhere.

On the 6th of October at 10:30pm my Entire body was numb to the point where i couldnt move and my arms were like jelly, a few moments later i got up out of my chair walked to the kitchen draw then grabbed a knife and i could see where i was walking but could not control my body, as i picked up the carving knife (Roxy) held it against my throat and i felt like i was going to die at this point.

Eventually she dropped the knife from my throat and i felt a HUGE pressure lift off from my own body it was a really weird experience i cant really describe how awful it is for a demon to take over you're human body and use it as their own.

199,"Background story: When I was 17 we moved into a home with a gas stove. It was great, things cooked so much better! My parents would work Monday thru Friday and sometimes Saturday at 5/6 am. One of those early Saturdays (I was 18/19?) I awoke at 8am very dizzy, and lightheaded. My room was in the basement, so I got up and about passed out. I opened my bedroom door and the house smelled of gas. I stammered up the stairs and opened the back door. Went to the stove, and saw that one of the knobs had been turned just enough that it was releasing gas. I turned it off, opened every door and window, and went and sat outside with a glass of water.  I called my parents to let them know, they claim that neither of them were even in the kitchen that morning, but none of my sibling lived at home at that time. I don’t believe them, I am pretty sure they were trying to kill me. Like no joke. That’s another story for another day.

Well I moved out shortly after that and never lived in a home with a gas stove again until now (24). This stove is even older than the one at my parents, original to this house which was built in ‘73. I’ve been here a week, and have only used the oven once and the stove top twice now. And every time I start it up, my anxiety gets so bad. I think also that it’s a pretty beat up stove, doesn’t help. But it gives me flashbacks. I’m currently fighting off a panic attack. I am renting and my roommate has been here a couple years now. And she clearly hasn’t had any issues with it actually malfunctioning or leaking. But even after I turn it off I feel like I can smell it for hours. I don’t want to ask my landlord to replace it just yet, cause we’re waiting on him to get our front door replaced. (We have to kick and booty bump and everything to get it open) and be probably doesn’t realize how bad the stove is, because he hasn’t lived here in years. And lives out of state, so he apparently only comes here about once a year. 

I think I’m just gonna get myself a toaster oven and electric hot plate or something for now. Cause this is just so ridiculous. I also run the overhead fan/vent to make sure that if there is a gas leak it goes into there and outside. I would open windows while cooking, but they’re crank windows, and I keep crossing paths with my roommate, so I haven’t even had time to ask her.",08Oct2019,2
200,"I've recently started seeing a therapist (4th time in my life, i am 29f). So far this therapist has helped me think a lot about my life, as it is now and how I got to this point.

201,"Hi.
I don't really know where else to ask this. Sweden doesn't have a lot of psychologists and the ones that I tried to contact have just told me to look elsewhere. Sweden has a lot of issues with healthcare, and my sister has met more psychologists than she can count (most of them quit after 2 or 3 sessions). 

I hope I can find some answers here. Please, hear me out. 

So, we've been together for almost 4 years now. We've lived together for 2 years. In mid 2017 - when we moved in together - he had to break off all contact with his parents. He has since tried to stay in contact with his younger brother, but he was somehow manipulated by his mother into trying to trick him into meeting his parents. After years of mental abuse, he decided to give up trying to contacy anyone in his family and has blocked everyone. If anyone wants to know more about this, please just ask. As long as it's relevant. Some things regarding the abuse that I believe ought to be mentioned. 

His parents put him last, out of three children. They used his savings to buy him a car for his birthday, then refused to give him ownership of it when he moved out. His Christmas presents mainly consisted of things they got for free when buying another person's present. Things that his siblings simply got, he had to pay for with his own money. 

His parents thing he's stupid. Everytime I helped him put together a message he wanted to send to them (as he was trying to get them to leave him alone) they answered with ""I bet $$$ that you didn't write that yourself 😘😉"". He wasn't allowed to learn new things because ""it wouldn't go good anyway"". 


Here are the things that concern me:

His lack of common Sense
His clumsiness
His lack of charisma
His inability to communicate

I will expand on these points. 

Common sense

He is the type of person that you need to remind to look at both sides of the road before passing. If I send him down to the store to get tacos, he'll come back with a salad. No meat, no tortilla, nothing. 
He forgets deadlines, things he's said and promised, dates (like my birthday), things his parents have said. He forgets everything! I sometimes feel as though I am talking to a wall. He gets on the wrong side of the road to take a bus. It's a weird type of memory thing, perhaps I should say he has absolutely no common sense? 


Clumsiness

I don't think I need to elaborate on this. He drops things. A lot. 
He will knock over things constantly, trip, drop valuable  things. 

Lack of charisma/ Inability to communicate

I am afraid to let him talk to older people because he is so terrible at expressing himself. He throws inappropriate words around and can't tone down his language. It's hard to explain but he talks to my stuck up grandma as though she's a child. Maybe that makes more sense? It's not that he doesn't have respect for people, he just doesn't understand that one must change their language when speaking with people ""with authority"". 



I know that listing all of these things make him (or me) sound like a terrible person, but trust me, he is kind and only means well. He's a very misunderstood individual, and while I understand what he tries to convey in his actions, I also understand that it must be a handicap when he tries to live life on his own. 

I thought maybe I ought to bring up some ""good"" traits of his. 

His ability to save money 
His ability to remember strange and mundane things 
His forgiveness
Inability to get angry

Money

If we weren't together, He'd buy nothing but crackers and save until he could move to Japan.  He has separate savings accounts and always has money put aside. 

Memory 

He forgets important things, but remembers strange facts. He's like the back of a Snapple cap, he'll say ""did you know?"" In the strangest of situations and just bring up a fact I have no use for. 

Forgiveness 

He forgives everyone - no matter how mean they were to him. He always sees the best in people, even his parents. No one is mean and he wants to believe that the only one who is wrong is himself. 

Anger

In my 4 year with him, he has never gotten angry. Never screamed, never shown any sort of negative emotion apart from crying. He has cried a lot because of his parents, but feels no hate towards them. Nothing. Never yells, never goes to bed angry. Always forgives. Always. 
Don't get me wrong, we have arguments and discuss things, we just don't get into fights and stuff unless it's one-sided (I, at least, can get angry). He avoids conflict as best as he can. 

Maybe it's a result of the abuse. I don't know. I just feel like 2 years of constant support should have made a difference. I can safely say that he's the same as he was when I met him. Some people have asked me if he has autism, but I don't think that's it. Doesn't really fit the picture.

202,"I am a 20 yo male who is struggling emotionally and socially. I want to go back to dating and hooking up and having a sex life but whenever the opportunity comes up I avoid it like the plague.

I’m terrified of rejection. Plus I don’t want to deal with the copious amounts of drama that can come from either friends or lovers like those that I’ve experienced in the past.

I get angry over scenarios that are made up inside my head and that will put me off for the entirety of the day. I want to make more connections but I find escape from pushing people away.

IMO they were shitty and toxic people and I had no reason to continue entertaining them so I left, but in return they were extremely angry that I left.

205,"Yesterday, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/derkm9/i_cant_mentally_handle_school_right_now/) asking for what options I have for finishing my last semester when recovering from sexual assault. A few hours ago, I went to my school’s disabilities office in hopes of finding a way to be accommodated. That didn’t happen.

There was a new guy I’ve never seen before, and when I tried to explain what was going on (I am dealing with a physical injury and struggling with my mental health), he kept interrupting me, first to introduce himself to my mother, then again to move some books. He kept demanding details, saying he won’t help me if he doesn’t know exactly what happened. This alone was making me anxious and upset, but then he says he can’t help me anyway since he’ll have to look through my file and the office will be closing soon.

I told him to just forget it, knowing I wasn’t going to get anywhere with this guy, and went into the end of the hall to try to figure out what to do and who to talk to next. He comes out a moment later, saying that he didn’t enjoy being cursed at (I had sad to my mother “just fucking tell him” because skirting around the incident wasn’t helping and I couldn’t say it myself) and he wouldn’t want to help anyone who acted like that. I told him to please just go away, I don’t want his help, I’ll speak with someone else. He goes back into the office.

He comes back out, now saying that if I wait two hours, he’ll help me than. But the office was closing in a half hour at that point. I again asked him to please just leave. He does. He comes back out again, towering over me as I’m sitting in a chair in the hall trying to calm down. He says he’ll find someone else to help me. I ask him to please just drop it; I’ll ask, myself. My mother has been reiterating everything I’ve been saying but at this point she loses it and tells him that she works with disabled children and is appalled at his behavior. I guess that bruised his ego because then he starts mocking her, even going as far as saying of course she does, looking at me as he said it. I again ask him to please just drop it and leave. Instead, he goes into another office.

At this point, I’m having a panic attack, just thinking that here’s another asshole that can’t take no for an answer. Just another guy doing whatever he wants no matter how many times I ask him to stop. I’m crying and I can’t breathe. He comes back out, stands over me once again and says he called security and I have to leave.

My mother somehow gets me out of the chair and into the hallway where I vomit into my sweater sleeve. I can’t breathe, I can’t see, and she’s dragging me down the steps and back to my car. I have her drive back home because I physically can’t.

Now I really *really* don’t know what to do. I desperately wanted to get through my last semester but I don’t even want to go back on campus at this point. Everything feels like it’s falling apart and I can’t even get something to hold on to.",08Oct2019,10
206,"My mum was a strict christian. (She passed away a year ago)

When I was younger we got such bad beatings she would be gritting her teeth while hitting us. When we was in pain we was 'lying' (we wasn't, she just said we was)
When something happened she called us liars too. 
She used to give us silent treatment for days when she wasn't happy with us (baring in mind this was between the ages of 5-14)

I remember one time she got mint mouth spray and told us all that if we were naughty she would spray it in our mouths and it would burn our mouths out. 

Her technique of parenting wasn't the best.. 

The youngest sibling (there was three of us and we were adopted by her, she's technically our aunty but I class her as my mum as she raised us from when I was 2/3 and the youngest was a baby when she got us).. so yeah, the youngest got special treatment. She was paid to go on holidays and the best clothes, her own bedroom, after school clubs etc while we had to have second hand clothes, never went on holiday, wasn't allowed to go to after school clubs as she would only pay for one etc etc. 

So, basically after all the shit, one time it was my birthday , I was 14. 

My two other siblings had their birthday the month before and she generously gave them £50. 
It came to my birthday a month later, she gave me £10 and said ""your sisters don't want to get you anything but here's £5"" -actual quote. 

I snapped. I took all the cushions off the couch and threw them on the floor so she couldn't sit down and told her I'd pick them up if she paid me. (She was pretty overweight and couldn't reach the cushions.) 
She said no so I walked out and never came back. I moved into a friend's house and stayed there till I was 16 and then got my own flat. 

We did reconsolidate in the recent years but I'm 28 now and it happened when I was 14 so it took a good 14 years to get there. 


I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. (Schizo typal)

I'm pretty sure this is what caused it but I also feel guilty talking about this as she's passed away.

208,"We started dating while I was living in a group home, I knew him already and when I got to visit home on the weekend one time he asked me on a date. It progressed from there. Due to anxiety and my insucurities I tend to be overly clingy in real life and over text messages. When I say over text messages I mean I will text him 30 times in a row asking the same question because I feel like he is constantly mad at me or ignoring m. I think I feel that way due to neglection as a child or because I sometimes compare myself to his ex girlfriend. Anyway my over texting has gotten out of hand recently and I am embaressed about it. On sunday him and my step mom sat down with me and spoke to me about it. I often feel attacked when im being confronted so while they were talking to me I refused to make eye contact with either of them and and i pretended to text people on my phone to seem like I was not bothered. It seemed very rude of me and now I feel bad. After they confronted me I went to my room for a bit and kinda hid. When I came out of my room he was walking up the stairs trying to find me and he asked me what was wrong. I kinda blew it off and said nothing. I felt like I was going to cry because I was so fucking embaressed. So finally we are downstairs and i sit on the couch and he keeps asking what is wrong so I told him that I get frustrated when I see he is active online and does not answer me and just stuff like that. After I tell him that he tells me he has to go. So I kiss him goodbye and things seemed okay when he left. He texted me goodnight that night and things seemed normal. So then yesterday (monday) I only texted him 10 times which is a lot less then normal and he answered once. I was anxious and thinking maybe he was mad at me but I knew he had work later in the day so he was just busy. But then last night he didnt text goodnight and he always does, so thats when I got a bad feeling. Today I am not positive but if I remeber correctly he told me was his day off. So I only texted him 5 times so far today and I got no response. At one point I was like ""he probaly got called into work"" and then my mind set went to ""Why should I even try"" to ""he is gonna break up with me"". I apologized for being dissmissive while they were talking to me and I have been trying not to spam him and it is very very hard because my anxiety is just telling me to text him. I love this guy a lot and I cant cope right now with the idea of losing him because just 2 days ago we were fine. I dont want my actions to ruin this. I have not felt this way about someone before and that could be another reason I am so clingy. But I dont want to lose him, i really dont.",08Oct2019,1
